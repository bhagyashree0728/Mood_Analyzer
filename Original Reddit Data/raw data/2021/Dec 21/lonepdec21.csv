2,Cats_have_teats,1640953307,1,"When do you feel most lonely? New Year's Eve alone or alone on a normal weekday work night?

I'm pretty sure everyone would say NYE, or another festival like Christmas. 

The difference is that being alone on a weekday night feels normal whereas being alone on NYE feels abnormal. Your entire inner emotion and perspective has shifted based on an external issue. When lots of people are feeling more lonely anyway even when around people. 

You're also choosing to be alone and that is not a bad thing. Anyone could go out and sit in a pub/bar make random awkward conversation. Join millions of clubs. You choose not to do it because often your own company is better. Is that actually a bad thing? Lots of important people preferred their own company.

The quicker and faster you shift towards this mindset the more you will feel fulfilled. The added bonus is it can make you more attractive to others but that is not the aim or necessary.",lonely,The key to overcoming loneliness,2021-12-31 23:21:47

4,SnooDogs5502,1640952312,1,"This past Christmas I spent it with family. Everyone decided not to buy big gifts but instead buy small presents. Everyone bought each other small, meaningful gifts. I got clothes….clothes that I didn’t even like. And the thing is I’m a very fun and extroverted person to be around, everyone wants me for holidays and parties because i bring life wherever i go. But suddenly I’ve started to notice that I’m an outsider everywhere i go. They want me there because of my ability to blend in, but im not really needed there. When i hang out with friends i notice how everyone in my friend group is like really close with someone, same thing goes for family stuff and even at work. Someone always connects with somebody and they share this really nice bond where they don’t feel alone when the other person is there. I don’t have that in my group of friends, family or work. Today is NYE and i just want to spend it at home watching netflix in hopes of someone actually texting/calling me to spend the night with me and accompany me in my sadness which i know won’t happen (past experience).

6,qwop7676,1640951100,1,"Month ago made plans to go on a bar crawl with a group of friends and their friends for New Years. The two that planned it backed out and didn’t even tell me, only found out because the two closest friends told me so we started talking about doing something New Years and it was obvious On Tuesday that one of them (they are a couple), the one who is my best friend for 10 odd years, is the one who didn’t want to do anything with me and it was just his girlfriends idea to do something as the 3 of us. 

What sucks is I can’t even message her anymore because he was getting jealous and I’m sure I did something to irk her but she wouldn’t tell me when we talked about it. So not only was I down a friend this year, she seemed to be the only one that actually cared even after our silence, and we can’t say anything to each other because of my best friend, her boyfriend in anything other than vocally. She seemed to be the only appreciative one of my gift to the two of them for Christmas as well. I bought gifts unconditionally and she said she would look around where they’re staying for a gift. (They went to the city a few days prior, and originally I was gonna go there New Year’s Eve and then back to his after the fireworks) again, this was unconditional, I did it because I wanted to and didn’t ask for anything nor expect anything back, I appreciate and am grateful for her thought and saying that alone. Her laugh and smile when she said thank you as she read out our old messenger nicknames on the card was enough for me to understand she appreciated it. 

 In front of our other friends after she said that, my best friend just had to say he wasn’t “gonna get me fucking anything “ he’s an ego chaser, but fucking hell did that hit hard. I wasn’t asking for anything, and yet he still had to phrase it like that instead of not say anything at all. Also I’m autistic, so I may be reading him completely wrong, but after 10 years I’m quite sure of how I read him... having to break communication with the only one I could really talk about anything was already a lonely feeling, but this just confirmed that I’m in a hole and don’t know how to get out.",lonely,Realization I am truly alone,2021-12-31 22:45:00

So I’m doing it, posting about being alone on New Year’s Eve… sorry guys 

I was lucky that a friend invited me to hang out with her friends tonight, and I said I honestly didn’t know I could make it because.. Social anxiety

But anyways she just cancelled because they are celebrating at one of her friends place instead, so now I know that there isn’t the option anymore

I have an apartment in a campus-like place, so I know some people will be throwing parties and invite anyone who wants to join but again, social anxiety

So I’m just gonna sit on my own while entering  the new year. I really want to try and make this okay in my head, like it’s not the most important and I can just chill at home… but I can feel the anxiety creeping up and it’s only 8am here, and because of the (constant) fireworks I won’t even be able to sleep to escape for a few hours

I don’t want to be negative and I feel like loneliness is the only thing I can talk about with the basically 2 friends I have (one is my ex-boyfriend and the other lives 4.000 km away)

34,SalaryBitter9813,1640933476,1,"I am 23 years old and I have never been in a relationship or been intimate with a woman. All in all, I've lived a pretty good life. I was always proficient at school, getting into a top 10 university and now med school, and have always had a stable life with friends and family who care about me. I have always kept myself pretty fit either through swimming or weightlifting and apart from a bad period during quarantine I have always taken care of myself mentally and physically.

Even so, I have never been touched. Never been in a relationship. Never had sex. I've wanted nothing more in life than to experience these things. I've tortured myself my whole life with the question, ""why am I not good enough for these things?"" ""What am I doing wrong?"" ""Why is my life so awful when I have tried so hard to be a good person and do the right things?""

I blamed everything I could, from being the nerdy kid who tried too hard at school, to drugs, to not being muscular or attractive or confident enough. And I tried everything to fix every single one of these issues. I lied about my grades and dumbed down the way I talked so people wouldn't view me as a nerdy kid, but reputations stick with you like glue and you can't lie about your intelligence when you go to a top 10 university and your fraternity has access to your perfect GPA. And it's not like women liked me more when I acted dumb anyway. I quit drugs and alcohol, but that only made me feel worse, and alienated me from social events, just like I was in high school. I did steroids to make myself buffer, but that, of course, was a last resort, and I didn't expect women to find that magically attractive to begin with, but I felt I was out of options.

In trying to solve these issues, and after a failed suicide attempt, I began to realize that the real glaring issue was none of these things, but was me. I have come to understand that I am not a person who is easy to love, in fact, it may be so difficult to love me that it may not even be possible for a woman at all.

I haven't enjoyed my life since I was a little kid. I used to love school and learning, but now hate it and view as it as a chore. Ever since I was little it was beaten into me that being nerdy was bad, and the stereotype that nerdy guys can't get dates only reinforced my hatred for this identity. I have tried developing other parts of my identity to not appear as such a nerd, but the fact of the matter is that I hate my intelligence. I also hate how competitive I am, and that I continuously need to keep trying to impress people to get into college, med school, and residency just to do what I want to do in life.

There is just so little I enjoy about life anymore. I enjoyed my dog, and I watched her die from cancer, taking her final breaths right in my arms not being able to do anything. I enjoyed school, but was conditioned by everyone around me to hate myself for being a nerd. I enjoyed videogames, but they're now just an escape from the real world. Drugs like weed and alcohol are just the same. I only ever listen to music at the gym anymore, and I only go to the gym because I feel like I have to.

I don't think I am unworthy or undeserving of being loved. I don't think I'm a monster anymore. In fact, I don't think anyone is undeserving of love, no matter how horrible or lost they may be in life. But I do think some people in life are more difficult to love than others, and I think I am one of those people.

I have spent my entire life trying to be someone a woman could love, and it got me nowhere. It wasn't until recently I gave up on this idea entirely, and for one of the few times in my life, things became less difficult. Getting up in the morning was easier, not getting mad or irritated at little things was easier, exercising and eating healthier was easier, and being kinder to strangers was easier.

While I'm not religious, I firmly believe in a higher power, and that higher power has given me signs my whole life that I am simply someone who is incredibly difficult for a woman to love. And I'm ok with that now. The change I needed to make wasn't trying to make myself a person who is lovable, but to accept the fact that love is something I am simply not meant for in life. And that's ok. I'm in med school, I have the opportunity to use my life to save others, that's pretty cool at the end of the day, and certainly a much better use of my existence than being 6 feet underground. I'm not happy, and I still say I don't enjoy life that much, but things are easier and bearable, and maybe that's all they need to be for me to find peace.

Sorry for all the text, I mostly did this for myself. I hope someone out there can understand how I feel and why I'm making this choice.",lonely,"I have given up on finding love, having sex, and being happy, and I don't feel depressed anymore. (23M)",2021-12-31 17:51:16

Everyone is out there celebrating things. It's NYE! We ""should"" have an AMAZING night full of fireworks, laughter, and unforgettable memories because anything short of that makes you a loser right? 

I ""should"" force myself to go into town and make something happen tonight. Put on a happy facade. Strike up conversations with strangers. Perhaps meet the love of my life. 

But I don't want to.

There's so many things that I ""should"" do right now to escape from this loneliness.

Tbh,Idk why I feel Half if the way I do,my entire life I’ve been pretty introverted and never had an issue, there have been year gaps where I just chilled without being around others for the majority of my time,right when I got around 16 ish and could drive alone my only real form of therapy would be driving and camping in the mountains. Now it’s all just changed,all the freinds I had made all have or at least had some form of romantical connection,I used to just tell myself I didn’t want that but now Ive kind of realized that I really do and just don’t know how to talk to girls (lol). But it’s like the more i think about it the less of a possibility it becomes.I started getting into a lot of drugs (yes you name it from meth to acid binges,I’m not really proud of it) with a small group of freinds and now going sober is just a pain.its been a month but every second i just feel internal screaming and anger at myself for not being truly loved. Idk I guess it just got to me that two of them started going to aa meetings without me that hurt me,even though it probably shouldn’t. Self harm isn’t a good thing either but it sure seemed to keep my mind of other people caring,trying to get over that now too. I feel like the issue as far as people finding me attractive is just that I don’t really talk to anyone but at the same time I don’t know how,I mustered the courage to go talk to a doctor about all of this and of course I conveyed it so badly that he thought re prescribing my adderall would be the solution to all of this,it was not. Now the only thing I can do to keep me from going off the edge is playing my guitar,really the only thing that grounds me to reality itself. I tried to keep this not so graphic so it wouldn’t disturb anyone,I just wanted to know if anyone could have any suggestions for me ,thanks for even taking time to read it",lonely,Am I weird?,2021-12-31 16:42:54

I'm sure some of you think that's not true, and yeah I do have people around me, but I don't think anyone of them could understand me. I've been weeks away from marrying a good woman. But we had a falling out shortly before because I thought it was right to side with my family in a dispute. After that I was scared to love anyone again. Once I could and I started dating, I got to know another amazing woman, or so I thought.. and that devastated my self-apprication, my confidence, and my heart.. I was always kinda cold hearted, but this pushed me to a new level. I think of others as objects, almost like people are tools but that wouldn't be right. Because I can use tools to make life or work more efficient, whereas I let people use me as if I'm the tool, maybe I am. But I'm digressing. Anyways, with this outlook and knowing it's messed up to others, I don't actually see why this outlook is bad.  Because I can observe others and their actions from a logical and unbiased perspective. I view almost everyone else around me as more pathetic than I am, just for the fact that they truly feel, sympathize and hurt others to make themselves feel better. Where as it should be to make yourself suffer to move forward. And if you say suffering is wrong, I don't think so. Even now I'm typing this because maybe two people will actually read it and it's gonna hurt Everytime I remember writing this. My hope that I'm ever gonna be something has nearly faded all together. I know I won't ever amount to anything, I'm never gonna find ""the one"", and I can't actually do anything to help those around me. This is kinda sounding like a suicide letter, but it's not. Because with my outlook, killing myself will end my suffering, end my progression. And what is that progression, it's my ever forward marching life of nothing. This is kind of a last ditch ever to find anyone who will lift up my head and just say I'm not alone. Because even with my family and friends ive tried expressing all this. But it's my fault for not seeing the brighter side, or I'm not happy with what I got, and my favorite is guilting me into hating myself even more because I Shouldn't feel this way with them in my life...""I have your back"" bullshit is what all that is. They don't even know me anymore. They knew the old me who tried talking to them, not the one who cried in the shower to cover up the sounds, the one that drove into the mountains to end it all but realized that suffering is probably what I deserve for my outlook.

57,Fun-Kaleidoscope-731,1640924703,1,"I’ll probably end up deleting this when I wake up. I kinda just want to vent about something that’s been in my mind for a decent bit of time 

I really want to fucking kill myself. And despite how much I want to and how often I think about ending it all, for whatever god forsaken reason I have this stupid idea that *”If I just stick with it for **~a little bit longer~** I’ll be able to improve myself, or at least find some form of satisfaction and everything will be A-Ok”.* Except the problem, as it so would be, is that everytime I do TRY to improve myself it either: A - Blows up in my face, B - I end up quitting, or C - A &amp; B + a general “Fuck You” from the universe. Literally anything that I’ve attempted has either left me in the exact same shitty position that I was in before with additional self awareness on how pathetic &amp; worthless I am, or somehow manage to dig my grave even deeper than I thought was possible. I’m genuinely just tired of the cycle honestly. It’s the same thing
Every. 
     Single. 
          Goddamn. 
                Time.
Every single time I decide, “Hey, ya know what we should do today? Let’s try to be a better version of ourselves :)” I know EXACTLY where it’s going to fucking end, but I can’t get this worthless, annoying, faint twinkle of hope out of the slurry that I call my brain. And thusly, like the dumbass I am, I continue and push forward towards my inevitable failure and then get sad and disappointed at myself for falling short of my expectations, even though it was obvious before hand and in retrospect that I was going to fail. Why? Because it’s me we’re talking about :) 

Welp, I could probably continue on but that would either lead to A - repeating what I’ve already said, B - continuing to deprecate myself, or C - oversharing (and none of us want that). So, uh, tbh idk why you decided to read this clusterfuck of a vent all the way to the bottom. Kinda weird imo ngl. But guess what, you get to listen to me vent a bit more because I just thought about more crap to talk about, isn’t that just wonderful? :))))))
So anyways: Honestly, it’s kinda just annoying to be tempted with hope constantly like this. Despite how much I talk about how little that chance of me actually achieving self improvement is, In those moments spurts of motivation I wholeheartedly believe that I could actually do it. and so it just becomes me running on a treadmill trying to catch a piece of food or something (idk leave me alone I can’t think rn). No matter how long or fast I run, I can never reach what’s hanging right in front of my face. At the end I always end in the exact same location I started in, but now I’m tired and angy (I misspelled angry on purpose, how devious &gt;:} ). I’m angry at the fact that I didn’t get what I was chasing so hard after. I’m angry at the fact that I got back on the treadmill and started running despite how many times I already failed in the exact same way. I’m angry at the fact that I know I will continue to get back on the treadmill until I inevitably slip, fall, and the treadmill tears the flesh off my face and I bleed out, finally putting an end to me running in my hamster wheel (or whatever tf you call those things)

I'm not looking for anything sexual because I personally don't believe in premarital sex and I don't mind if we're too far apart for IRL interaction, I'd just like to play games with someone and talk about each other's interests.

As pessimistic and depressing as this sounds it was a realization I had not too long ago that has ironically benefited my life immensely. 

I was at my lowest and feeling very suicidal. I’m 21(m) with no friends, no job, no car, no love life, and no money. I had a mental break where I laid in my bed and cried for what felt like 4 days straight, but I can’t be sure because my perception of time was skewed. It felt like I had depersonalized and was truly in mental anguish that is hard to explain but I’m sure a few of you know what I mean.

My whole life all I wanted were people to care about that cared about me as well. It was like I was waiting for others to come into my life and make it better. Years and years of waiting. No one came.

It was like I was pushed to the edge of suicide but rather than ending my life I realized that I don’t need to rely on others for my happiness. I had finally realized that as long as I work on myself and try to improve and be better than I was yesterday, then that would be enough. I’m the master of my own destiny, I control my own happiness, and I won’t give into despair and let my ego kill me.

I was back in middle school and moved into a new neighborhood. This girl next door (tall, black hair, and a tattoo oddly enough) randomly struck up a conversation with me and we became friends.

I think the dream was a form of wish fulfillment. I saw what i desperately wanted when i was young and alone.

Then not to mention when I do let people in ... they are normally an undercover narcissist. So ... here lately I'm just like ""hell yea, riding the lonely train! Choo choo"".

The last person I let it was just waiting (I feel) for a reason to get outta the friendship. To catch you up to speed, we hadn't talked for a few weeks. I reached out to her and was all happy and cheerful ""hi! Blah blah blah holidays blah blah blah I miss you blah blah blah I hope you are doing okay and hit me up when you are free"". Mind you, she hadn't reached out on her end either ... also I believe friendship is rooted in the ability to go awhile without talking and pick up right where you left off. Well she flipped complete crap, got all stabby stabby with her words. Saying some real below the belt type crap. Idk it is a lot to go over, and it sucks cause I thought I had a legit friend.

I do have a history rich with trauma/abuse and severe anxiety/depression. Everything is complicated surrounding this whole situation so I’m going to try and be as brief as possible.

Ok so me (23F) and my “person” (24m) met a little over 2 years ago. We ourselves have a very complicated history with each other and have complicated pasts. We have been through so much together with each other and have helped each other with everything. There is no one on this planet i have ever loved or trusted more in every way. We’ve always had things we’ve overcome in our friendship and have always come out stronger, we both have genuinely admitted that we made each other better and stronger. I wish I could go into more detail but i would be here forever. In short, he’s been struggling lately and i can see it. I usually am always staying with him but based on tension and verbal cues i knew he needed to be alone so i came home. We were part of each others daily routine for months on end and were stronger than ever despite usual bickering. I came home after a fight he had with his family and just other reasons for him needing to be alone. Even though i have terrible separation anxiety and he’s been different lately so i had stuff i wanted to talk about, I went with no objection knowing he needed it. Now I’ve barely talked to him other than formalities since i left and he seems like he’s pissed at me even if he is the one texting or calling me. I wish i just knew what i did or whats wrong so i could at least apologize. Its not like I’ve been blowing his phone up, I’ve let him contact me. How is it we are so close and i feel out of place texting him? Again we have a very unique and close relationship. He would have me stay at his house if he went and did anything and text me first.

Everything went well when suddenly at the end of the trip, he said he doesn't like to travel with me anymore, because he's more adventurous, when I would just lay at the beach or at the hotel with cocktails for a week. And because of limited amount of vacation days, he just wants to travel with a group of more adventurous friends and ofc his girlfriend. I just don't understand. We went together on vacation for years to the beach and he never complained. I was there when no one was there for him and then it was all alright. But now he met a few other friends and has a girlfriend and I'm suddenly not that important anymore, while he is the most important person in my life. Maybe I'm just overreacting, but I really do have flashbacks and dreams about our last trip and I just can't believe this was our last one.

Seeing this just pushes me farther down the hole I’ve dug for myself emotionally. And yes I am very happy for them, but at the same time I can’t even bear to be around when they are talking about their relationship because it makes me feel more worthless.

143,Doomsdaydz,1640890531,1,"It doesn't feel like I've got any friends. I had a girlfriend but that relation ended about a month ago. After moving in together in a new city, away from where I've spent most of my life. A little over two years spent with her and looking back, I mainly stayed with her because she was a safe connection to the world.   


I have friends but none of them write to me. Then again, I dont write to them either.   
I used to have a group of friends but people started to move away, get married, have kids. They are all a lot older than me (I'm 30 and they're about 5-10 years older). I didn't do enough to foster the relationship and as people started to move away, I just lost contact.   
Now I'm in a new city, doing my Ms.C. and so far the only friends I've made are in my muay thai gym. The problem is that when we leave the gym, I dont really speak with them. They've all got their own lives and I dont know what to do in order to make a connection, I not sure if they even want to and I dont feel secure in my ability to gauge it.  
I feel disconnected from the world and I dont really know how to make any meaningful connections. 

I have no NYE plans, even though I asked my friends in my home town if they had room for me but people aren't home or they've got other plans.   
I'm good with women and have been using Tinder to hook up regularly with different women but I dont feel any connection. They're just validation and something to do.   
I miss having friends and having fun. I have nobody to talk to about being sad or lonely or frustrated. It's been like this for ages and I dont feel comfortable talking to the people I know because I dont know if they want to listen.   
I dont want to involve the women I date in my issues. I just wish I had a friend to text and say ""hey, I'm having a shit day, wanna do something?"" - But I dont and I don't know if I ever will.   


I feel like a failure and I feel unhelpable. With COVID lockdowns shutting down the night life, I dont know what to do.   
People dont expect this of me. I used to work as a bartender, I currently work in healthcare and I'm used to talking to people and making them feel at ease. I can usually get anybody to open up about their lives. I just dont feel any connection to them.  
I feel alone surrounded by people and most days I just think about not being here any more. It just seems easier to not be here, atleast there is some certainty in that. 

I have a hard time finding joy in anything. I used to game alot but started prioritizing Uni over that but after the break-up, I had a hard time focusing on studying at home but I couldn't find any pleasure in gaming anymore. Nothing really makes me happy anymore.  
Muay thai is a great passion of mine but ever since moving up the fight team, I just feel useless and talentless. I get my ass kicked in sparring because I'm the newbie and most of them have a lot of fights under their belt.   
It's so demotivational not being able to do anything and I just lose confidence in my ability.   
I already hate myself plenty but atleast I had some confidence in muay thai but that's fading quickly.  


Exams are next month and I'm just apathetic. I normally have extreme anxiety about exams but I'm just so empty inside that I can't even feel that. Some days I'm not even sure I exist to anybody and that's probably the most lonely feeling there is.

It's hard to make friends, it's hard to find a relationship, climbing the social ladder is hard (especially since it seems more pointless when you're like this)... But as much as I could come up with various self-criticisms or hypothetical handicaps in those areas... I honestly sometimes feel like I'm just solitary by nature. Socialising doesn't look appealing. It's almost like if you think of any of the hobbies that most people aren't into, you could flip that into viewing socialising and connecting with others as like this hobby that over 90% of the world is into that you just don't really enjoy.

Essentially, it's like I feel the natural human desires for connection and companionship, but also feel a huge ambivalence towards them also. Friends can be shitty, partners can betray, the social ladder is empty despite the technical material benefits. I can see how it would be better to be more normative and have less of an ambivalence towards these, the most natural of human instinctive desires, but I can't change how wary I am of them and I have many doubts about how 'leaving my comfort zone' is as clever as the self-help culture tries to tell me it is.

So, im currently 19M and have never had a friend nor irl or internet. Ofc i have people In my friends list and have tried to vent with them, but those individuals have just been there not responding or doing anything rly. Only recently i started removing them from those lists and thought that i should try to find people who i could actually consider friends, and who could for example play videogames with me or just talk to me in general.


Only last month i started being active again on reddit and discord etc trying to find people my type, and i surprisingly found a few promising guys. I started chatting with couple of them, and the start looked fine. Only after couple weeks i didnt have any of those guys anymore on my friends list and here's why.


Guy #1
This guy was funny and he had the promising kind of personality. Only after couple days this guy wanted me to buy him all kinds of things on various differend games because ""he didnt want to do that"". So basically he tried to get advantage of my friendly nature. Ended up blocking &amp; reporting the guy... Wasn't fun...


Guy #2
This dude was continually asking me questions &amp; forcing me to answer... If i did not, he automatically assumed my opinion witch really weird... Was feeling very uncomfortable afterwards... Ended up blocking him as well...


Guy #3 
Since the first words we had voice chatting, this guy could not stand my english, and he quote ""didn't understand me"" and bullied me about that. Blocked after 15min convo. Yeah, english is not my native language, but i still understand most of the words and can communicate flawless, just with an bit of an accent.


Guy #4
This gentlemen ghosted me after we said hi to each other. I asked how he was doing... 1,5 months later still no answer :D



Guy #5
This guy was young and silly all the time. I like to be humorous, but when a guy dont understand what i mean / said, it eats the expectations. 



Those are just an handful of gategories of people that i met november alone. There have been many more crazy type of people this month.


So, the question still remains unanswered. How could i find good friends, that i could seriously consider as one.

183,throwaway36019,1640870409,1,"How do I not feel guilty for learning multiple languages?


I speak multiple languages- Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French and a smattering of Greek and Russian

Currently, I’m trying to improve my French level, while trying to maintain my Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. I love reading a lot, especially literature written in the original language, so I read books in all 3 languages everyday (at times 2). I’m also currently learning Greek from scratch, and I wish to learn (or go back to learn) others in the future like Russian, German and Turkish, if I’m not dead yet. 

Now I wonder- how is this fun? It feels like a f****** chore. I feel pressured to read in every language everyday just because I speak it, and because I want to maintain my damn level(s)- my maintenance languages range from high B2 to high C1/low C2. 

Sometimes I regret having the interest (regret having my brain wired this way, rather) in learning so many languages, and instead just learning one. Because I’m unable to fully enjoy the cultures. 

Take for example- if I had just stuck with Spanish, I could read a Spanish book in the morning, relax with some youtube videos  in Spanish and some Spanish-language music and watch a Spanish show or read more in Spanish in the afternoon- no sweat, I’m high C1/low C2 in Spanish, and I would actually enjoy it.

Instead , I have to split my time in between each language, like someone jumping from one store to another shopping frantically. I currently have ample time for each, but I feel guilty at the same time- I have high expectations for myself, and I will not stop until I reach them- it’s my nature (I grew up this way too, it’s the only lifestyle I know of-) - I’m very self-driven. Maybe I’m immature , I don’t know. I’m younger than 22 years old, older than 17.

I also feel pressured to learn every single translation in every single language- for example , I would feel very upset if I didn’t know what the translation for juggling was in Portuguese, but I knew what it was in Spanish, Italian and French. 

Any tips?",lonely,How do I not feel guilty for learning multiple languages?,2021-12-31 00:20:09

188,tthrow5awayyy545,1640867533,1,"Hi fellow lonely people. If this isn't the loneliest goddamn year for like... everyone. Excuse the mindless, nonsensical venting. Needed an outlet for thoughts that have me struggling to sleep tonight.

 I'm broke, living with my parents in a town that I've never been able to leave and that is full of bad memories. My parents are older and I have a shitty immune system so I'm too nervous to get a job as things currently are. Can't really go out much, for the sake of being safe. Can't drive. I've cut out all my old childhood friends because they're bigots and have also deeply hurt me in the past. There's a couple stragglers I still talk to occasionally, but I think it's probably best if they're out of my life asap. They're not becoming better people. 

I'm extremely queer (not alligned with my assigned gender and I'm bisexual) but closeted and have had 0 chances to really...do anything with that identity. I also have a bit of a broken (by a societal standard) brain. I talk weird, thoughts struggle to get out. Possibly some sort of undiagnosed disorder (old therapist suspected ADHD, SO thinks so too, who knows.) Point being, life is an uncomfortable minefield to navigate because of who I was born as. Throw in the depression, anxiety, a sleep disorder, and I got a nice pot of ""get fucked"" stew going. 

I'm taking a year off of college due to the absolute mess that is the world right now. I never really got to have a normal college experience because of Covid, didn't make any friends, mostly just felt isolated. 

I have a longterm partner who is my best friend and whom I love very much, but they're going through extremely stressful times and have had an unbelievably hard life; most struggles I've had pale in comparison. Due to that, trauma, and depression they are detached and have extreme trust issues. I feel much of their love, but a lot of it gets caught between those walls and doesn't really find it's way to me. They struggle to trust me, often unbelieving of my stated feelings.  They resent my life and therefore me talking about it with them lately because of how hard their own is. There's a present coldness when I talk about my life, so I sorta prefer not to. Many of our hangouts lately end in an emotional breakdown, which I comfort them through. The last of which–after a minor argument over the phone–they told me I should ""just find someone normal."" That hurt. They're normal to me, the only person who makes any sort of sense and one I've been able to express much of true essential myself to in ways I was never able to. But at the same time, they can hardly maintain trust in me because of trauma, and that makes it hard to feel seen or loved. I also can't deny the ways they've hurt me. I don't think it's exactly appropriate or possible to bring this up to them considering how many urgent stressors they have in their life, or at least I don't know how to.  I haven't known for a long time. 
They're suffering terribly right now, and don't really have as much energy to give towards the relationship as I do right now which I completely understand. I'm just trying to support, help and love them towards a better period in their life, and maybe then they can more easily reciprocate love. I'm hesitant to say, but I'm beginning to feel lonely beside them.  Dating someone with severe trauma, mental illness, and a mental disorder is so hard. 

Regardless, they're just one person and at the end of the day I need friends. They're the only person I have to regularly talk to who isn't family, and pretty much vice versa for them which isn't fair or healthy to either of us. 

I have a ton of hobbies and projects that have been keeping me happy and busy. Way too many, maybe. But hobbies are hard when you don't got someone to share em with, or someone who will listen to you talk about them. My family ""listens"", and my SO too, but there's little engagement, little remembering what I talked about, or questions or dialogue about it. I say things, they're said, and that's that.

My family flip-flops between kind and completely cold. And even when they're kind, my words sorta just pass through their ears. I want the energy I put out into the world to bounce back. I want people to be patient with me like I am with them. There's a part of me doubting how true this all is, skeptical of how valid my feelings are. But I don't know.

I'm feeling like a ghost. Bound to one place, caught in a transitionary liminal state without ever making the transition, lonely and unseen. I need to be with people, in person. The screens are killing me. Being inside is killing me. 

I'm lonely all the time but don't have any privacy or independence. I'm scared of losing my partner to suicide or losing our relationship because of her trauma and lack of trust in me. Scared of losing my family to suicide too, or of our relationship being even further strained and broken because of their unprocessed mental illnesses/disorders.  I lost all my friends because they grew up into bad people. Every relationship I've ever had is more distant than it's ever been. I can't even build new ones because of Covid.

I just feel bummed. I've never had a relationship and refuse to try or seek a hook up to gain a moment of worth. I don't have any friends and I just have been at a point in my life for maybe 4 or 5 years or so where I have absolutely nobody. My life is all  just work, gym, sleep, repeat. 😞

I see people in the street in town if I go for a walk. I see them happy together and I just think. I wish that was me. I wish I got to understand what it's like to be appreciated whether it's a friend or a partner. 

I know people. Might say focus on yourself. And the gym is making me do that. But we can't all pretend, or at least alot of us pretend we wish we had someone. I feel almost at a point of regret that I haven't had friends in my late teens and now mid twenties. And I'm someone who never regrets anything and things are done for a reason always. So to say that is kinda big for me. 

I just wish I had a friend or 2. A partner. And that's me happy. I don't need flashy goods or a luxurious lifestyle. I've got a roof for now at least, food, water, a bed.

We push away the ppl who actually like us and instead we try and catfish our way to the ones who don’t. Love is hard. Especially when you’re pushed away bc of your race, sexuality, your height, your weight, etc. I wish ppl can be loved for their soul and their vibes, no matter how they look, but unfortunately they don’t.

217,joebidensghost,1640851645,1,"I made a long post back when I was a freshman in highschool. It is pretty cringy to read now, but it echoes things that I still feel to this day. After so much happened. I met so many people, was in a long relationship, spent a bunch of time with friends. Now I am graduated and soon going to get a job. All my hobbies and interests have changed. Now I actually enjoy going outside, and can't stand sitting at home. My world view has changed drastically, especially my own philosophy. But I am still alone, and I feel it everyday. 

It is draining me. 

I am back listening to the same set of songs I was listening to back throughout 2018, except now instead of just the feeling of unending loneliness, it is paired with the agony of losing someone beloved that I just couldn't be happy with, and watching them moving on to someone else as I feel my heart is finally ready to be back with them. I can't lie to myself anymore, like I have been for the last year since I broke up with her. I want her back even after everything she did that hurt me but now it is too late. 

As much as I want to forget, and as much as I can rile myself up by thinking about how great the next relationship will be, I just can't for some reason. You know, the whole ""if you were so happy with someone that treated you so badly imagine how happy you will be with someone who treats you good"" shtick. I don't think its wrong but... I can't find a single fucking person that actually wants to spend time with me. Literally just a single person. Someone that messages me often asking to hang out. Just one person. Even a guy, just to be friends. 

No one wants to though. I ask so many people to hang out, my treat even. I always get told they are busy or they just bail at the last moment. Even after they tell me they really want to hang out. The one time in the last year I spent time with a girl, we had a great time, and she told me she wanted to hang out again. I tried a few times, and everytime she bailed or blew me off. I can't take it anymore. 

I am hoping that when I get a job I can make friends with my coworkers and maybe meet people that way but... After everything its hard to stay positive about it. Or hopeful. If I wasn't such a pussy I would have just done something already, but I hate pain. I don't want to die with regrets. I just want to be happy and not have to work for it. I shouldn't have to force myself to appreciate things. 

Just in the last year I have begun exercising more, losing weight slowly, found something I actually have somewhat of a passion for, exercised much better hygiene daily and go out as frequently as possible to socialize. Yet I feel no different. I feel like I am missing someone. I wish I could be alone. I am truly and honestly happy with myself and where my life is going, but I can't shake the loneliness. I just want someone I can share it with again, that actually cares about me and fulfills me. Too tall an order I suppose. I doubt anyone will read this. I am just another lonely young man in a twisted depressive state, just like everyone else. I need someone who cares, please, god help me. Give me that atleast. Let me be happy.

I'll end this like I did all those years ago:

218,Standard_Session4214,1640851221,1,"I've pretty much been lonely my entire life. Never had a partner due to lack of confidence. Pretty much everyone I know has someone. I used to feel jealousy towards them, now I just feel sadness. Every time I see a couple I get this feeling like missing a vital part of the human experience. Not a fear of missing out but rather a feeling like I'm not whole. I want to know what it feels like to have someone who genuinely loves you for who you are. Someone who I can be my genuine self around. It just pains me that I'm too much of a coward to speak to people I'm interested in. Everything I have a crush on someone, there's this voice in my head that tells me ""there isn't a chance in the world that they would even begin to like you"". I always end up believing him.

220,justdonexx,1640849516,1,"I think i’m obsessed with love. Either that or I have some sort of serious attachment issue. 

I keep finding myself, over and over again, in situations where i’m in love with someone and they just aren’t reciprocating even though they’ve claimed to love me too, and then my whole life is on pause and I can’t focus on anything like work, self-care, responsibilities, etc because all I can think about is HIM. And why he isn’t showing me the love and attention I thought he would. And why it’s always ME who cares the most in every relationship, who loves the hardest. 

My boss, an older man, always tells me how it’s much easier for men to move on and not get hung up on any one woman. Like as soon as another pretty, interesting woman comes along, he’s already forgotten about you. Obviously he can’t speak for the entire male race but fuck. Every guy i’ve been with has moved on with the quickness, it’s almost traumatizing lol

It hurts so bad when you’re not getting what you were expecting to get from someone you thought loved you. It’s excruciating, actually. I can feel my heart tearing, breaking, sinking. All of it. It’s a physical pain. I haven’t eaten in days. I haven’t been able to get any work assignments done. My apartment is disgusting and I can’t wash a single dish. All I do is alternate between laying around on my couch and my bed, crying moping around and feeling sorry for myself. 

Like, how can he go days without texting/calling me? How can he be so busy that at night before he falls asleep, he can’t send me a quick “goodnight babe, i’m thinking of you” ? How can he not miss me when he said he loved me? Why do they always do this to me? Why am I always the one putting in the most effort, doing the most? Why am I always the one hurting because I end up catching more feelings? 

But most importantly, how do I stop making other people the center of my universe? How do I stop seeking validation/happiness from the external? How do I put an end to my constant struggle of allowing my entire self worth to be reliant on other human beings? How do I boss up and be a bad bitch and prioritize myself when my entire 27 years on this planet have been spent self-doubting and feeling unworthy unless i’m wanted and sought after? 

Currently 11pm and thinking of just crying myself to sleep. Again. Phone’s dry, I need to stop waiting for something that isn’t coming. It really fucking hurts. I can’t even listen to music. All i’ve been able to do is sit in silence. I used to be able to at least keep myself distracted with funny tiktoks. I can’t even go on tiktok now, everything triggers me and oh god forbid I see a pretty girl. Immediate suicidal ideation lmao.

233,NJDevilsDude,1640845609,1,"I have finally taken the time to vent in written form. This may be long and discombobulated but I sincerely thank you for reading.

Exactly this time last year I was so relieved to be going into the new year. I had a handful of new years resolutions that I was looking forward to working towards but more importantly I thought 2021 couldn't be worse than 2020. I was fucking wrong and should have never looked forward to this year.

The first few months of this year were routine, I even went on a nice trip in the first quarter of the year. Overall the first half of the year was fine with a few brief good moments. Outside of my trip (thank god I had this at least) I was simply just in the motion of things, which is fine. That is until July when I was told that I was going to be trained in specific responsibilities at work, but not to worry because I ""was only being trained to back up those teams for when they need backup!"" Next thing I know, my sole responsibilities are those of a position I never would have taken. But fine, I'm a team player, if they really need the help I will buckle down for a bit and fill the role. After 2 months, I should be up for a new position and meet the performance requirements but they decide to block all internal mobility for at least 1 month! I am now livid. I am unhappy. My performance drops. I resent coming into work. I started applying for new jobs and made this clear to my manager.

September hits and not much changes, I am still very unhappy at work. Then all of the sudden I get a call from my parents that my grandmother (Fathers side) has passed. absolutely sucks but this one was somewhat expected. What wasn't expected was my grandfather (Mothers side passing away 2 days later. Now this was incredibly unexpected and 2 days apart amplified the damage done. The worst part about it was that my grandmothers funeral was held first and unfortunately took place on what would have been my grandfathers birthday. Very long week of traveling for both arrangements and very emotionally and mentally tiring. 

Thankfully I received 10 days of Bereavement time total (5 days each as horrible as that is to say) I resume working in late September but now not only do I hate what I am doing but I am basically numb from what happened in my personal life as well. Rough next month.

At this point the only thing keeping me going was the holidays, knowing that I will be surrounded by loving family who are going through the same situation as me. I come from a big family where we make a point to be together for all the holidays we can (Covid has thrown a wrench in this for the past 2 years unfortunately). Then towards the end of October, my grandmother (Mothers side) passed away. This was the biggest blow of all. Not only because she was the third grandparent to go in less than 2 moths but she was the most influential. My other grandparents were beyond special and important in many ways but they didn't make the impact that my grandmother (Mothers side) did.

Naturally, Thanksgiving and Christmas were a shell of themselves. This is especially painful because Christmas has been my favorite time of the year for as long as I can remember. Really unfotuante but I thought I could just power through the last few days of the year and just start fresh in 2022. 

Nope, driving home at night on 12/28, a deer jumps in-front of my car on the highway and its likely totaled. Now I am trying to deal with the auto body shop and insurance company to close out the year. 

I want to be hopeful for 2022 but all I can think about is how hopeful I felt for this year and it turned to a total shitshow. 

I need a win.

TL;DR: 3 grandparents passed away over the span of 2 months (Not Covid related), I was forced into a position at work that has made me resent coming into work and I have never felt more lonely in my life.",lonely,The end of 2021 cannot come soon enough. I am drowning.,2021-12-30 17:26:49

This feeling became very strong and occurred more often after quarantine started. I would feel invisible and like a fake person when I would spend a whole day teaching on my computer to my kids then hours waiting for my roommate to get home only for her to need alone time or time to work on her second job as a writer. So days could go by where no one really made eye contact with me and said “hi *name* how are you? What’s happening in the brain of yours?” 

It can be really isolating to realize that when people had to pick who was in their lifeboat of people (the people they would bubble with - the people they would go to the effort of hanging out with because they need your company in their lives) there were very few people in my life that I put in mine and people that put me in theirs. I realized that I don’t have many peers in my life, let alone people who are close enough to me that I need them around… I’m hopeful for the future and all the potential friends and relationships I may have.

Though I won’t lie this job is awful in terms of pay, benefits, and the owner. But I’ve managed to stick through it on the count of enjoying just hanging out, it feels like I’m being paid to just have fun when its not stressful. 
 
It is all good and dandy, but my favorite coworker is leaving he’s graduating in a month and will start looking for a job soon. Usually it would be whatever move on with life and such, but he’s like the friend I’ve always wanted we have great talks, share A LOT of interest, think alike, and have the same sense of humor. I’m proud he’s moving on in life, but I’m sad by the fact I’ll probably never see him again, and I’m not overreacting he’s mentioned moving far away. He also has no time to spare considering he has a family to take care of, so I can’t expect him to just randomly want to catch up when he has so many obligations already.

I try not getting attached to coworkers since they are just that, coworkers, but I can’t help but feel sad its like watching someone disappear from your life and you can’t stop it.

255,TwinsDevil,1640838719,1,"I sit here in thought and tears about where time has gone and I think about all the people and opportunities I’ve turned away from my life and I know It’s not worth dwelling but if I had the option for an opportunity to arise tomorrow to give my life some meaning and sense of belonging I would still turn it away. Why you might ask? I legitimately feel like I’m too messed up to be around others besides my family I live with and it’s a rough reality I choose to live with. Im sure many have felt isolated since the pandemic has started but my isolation from life began long before that. I’ve felt alone in this world ever since I entered this world and technically I’m a twin so I wasn’t totally alone but I’ve always felt like a loner wandering this life and I definitely have lived and accepted the reality that it’ll be that way until the day I depart. Part of what makes me human in my opinion at least is the fact I feel this great sadness and pain and I’m filled with such emotion that it’s the lonely solitary path I’ve chosen to live my life. I cant tell if I want it to be this way or not honestly but I definitely feel like at 22 years old it’s over and that misery and loneliness  will follow me wherever I go. I love my family a lot I know I can show love but I feel like I’m letting them down everyday and they see me wither away in front of their own eyes. I don’t choose to get back up and fight, fight like my life depends on it because it honestly does at this point. I used to at least physically take care of myself even if I was mentally unstable and allowing my thoughts and mind to deteriorate. Now I don’t even do that and my body is falling apart. I sleep most my days away and sometimes I can’t tell if it’s depression or just that I’m so physically exhausted as well or both. I’ve been hospitalized 16 different times. Have survived multiple suicide attempts the most recent one being the most severe and sometimes looking back Im astonished at the amount of times I’ve cheated death and it might just be chance but it’s the choice I have to make to truly believe there’s time for me to still do something while I’m here. I choose to live this reclusive life because i don’t want anyone else to suffer with the sadness and loneliness I experience on a second to second basis. I don’t want them to endure the pain i feel and so I choose to stay isolated it’s much easier this way for them but for me I’m falling apart. I’m watching my own demise right before me and I just can’t take much more. I wouldn’t even say I’m suicidal anymore ive tried that and I’m still here and that didn’t even work. Itll end one day but I am legitimately tortured by my continuing existence and I don’t want to be. I want to be at peace I do but I want to be here I know I do. Even in my own pain and sorrow I cherish that I still feel something emotionally that I’m me and im a unique person just like anyone else and that there’s still a chance for me to start brainstorming goals and ways to improve my condition and to grow stronger to be able to manage my day to day life so I don’t have to be lonely anymore hopefully and I can start going out of my comfort zone and allow people into my life even my own family Especially them. I jump around a lot I mean I have various diagnosis so a lot of my thoughts are just racing and scrambling in my mind and its so hard for me to handle and manage it. It’s exhausting to live a day in my mind. i play this battle with my mind and my own thoughts everyday that I havent even really thought about my goals and aspirations things I want to achieve in my life. I don’t think much of myself but honestly I’ve recently come to the realization that I want to gain self esteem and confidence to attempt to put back together my life. Just I never take action and I’m in constant battle with myself on what to do whether I go on or give up. I don’t usually air my thoughts and express or talk about them but I just needed to see this posted somewhere and maybe I can get feedback on what I can do going forward. hi everyone this is me and I’m going to take the first step to getting proactive in my life. I hope all of you find what you’re looking for and that feeling to not feel so alone in this life.",lonely,"Appreciate Time, we all still have it.",2021-12-30 15:31:59

260,Kitchen-Afternoon589,1640837098,1,"I watched a couple of videos on the non-clinical causes of depression and an important one was being part of a group (or groups) for different reasons. They gave sense to whatever you did, they’d help each other out, sharing is caring, feeling listened to is reassuring and they could give you more perspective about your own life. 

Although I agree with said reasons, I’ve always found it hard to be part of any group. And please, don’t judge me, I’m not trying to be pretentious. I don’t have much in common with them, they usually want to gossip, get drinks, have superficial conversations… most of the things that I liked, I couldn’t share with anyone: reading, painting, writing, the topics of conversation I was interested in, the kind of music that I liked. I didn’t have profound relationships neither in college, nor when I was part of a sports team, because I really didn’t have much in common with anyone. And it didn’t get any better once I graduated, four years ago. Even less having to work from home since almost 2 years. 

I don’t know if you’re depressed, I had been, and though I’ve felt way better for some months, some days it hits me all of a sudden. Today was one of those days and I realized a good part of it is feeling isolated. And figuring out the reasons for that. I guess reaching out here is one of said attempts on trying to not be as isolated.

Any suggestions on what to do, given the present circumstances? Thanks!",lonely,Isolation equals depression. But I don’t know how to get along.,2021-12-30 15:04:58
261,highestRUSSIAN,1640836182,1,"\[M23\] I'm so fucking tired of life.  I have shitty roommates who make an effort to tout that they are together.  Well, the girl at least.  She knew I liked her, and we kissed twice.  Her and her ""boyfriend"" were not together at those times, or so she claims.  In fact, he wasn't even home.  But now she backtracks and said that we never kissed, even after telling other people that we did.  This couple quoted that I am jealous of what they have. 

 You know what?  

I am.  

This girl was an exact carbon copy of me.  She and I constantly laughed.  We always had a good time.  We constantly looked at each other in the eyes and talked about our true, unfiltered feelings.  She said she was literally falling in love with me.  So, I made her choose between me or him, and of course she chooses him.  

To add another nail into my coffin, my middle school bully who put me into a suicidal depression at age twelve now has a real estate company.  He also has a beautiful girlfriend and makes six figures.  I reached out to him, just to confront him for what he did to me ten years ago, for two years.  

""I'm sorry you feel that way.""

It's not my fault I hate you.  It's your fault.  Fuck you Abraham.  I'll happily name drop.  Not the last name though.

I have also been touch-starved for years.  I haven't had true physical contact with a girl in over three years, besides family.  I'm supposedly thin at 200 pounds, and I lost weight just so I could find somebody, but it's been so damn hard.  Dating apps, bars, and going out with my supposed friends have not worked.  People don't approach me.  Everybody has their own friend groups or other people that they are seeing.  I never really had one friend group.  I never really have had a friend.  Yes, there are others who have been alone for much longer, and my heart aches for them.

Personally.  I'm just done trying.  I can't be the bubbly me anymore.  I can't be me.  Hearing them laugh and talk in the living room while I sit in my bedroom and type this while crying is absolutely gutwrenching.

I have gotten to the point where I ache for intimacy, I ache to have that deep connection with someone. It hurts me and has manifested itself on a physical level, I am severely depressed and I am plagued by ringing in the ears whenever I feel this way, coupled with tension headaches and the overwhelming urge to end it all. 

I know deep down what I want. I want to share my life with someone. Im not interested in hook up culture. I am not interested in just sex. 

I crave something more. 

I wanna connect bond and grow with someone. 

That whole “work on urself” pep talk is the most disgusting wank piece of advice. 

Being in a relationship and going forward is what I want to work on. I always work on myself and I am always striving. Im tired of it. Im done with just thinking about me me me. I want to think about a shared goal, finding meaning and purpose with someone special. 

Man, im a 21 year old bloke and I will admit it. I want to have a family. I want to marry someone. For the longest time, I have battled with this, because all I want in this world deep down is to have a family. I want to be a husband, I want to be a dad. 

Im not saying I want this now, but I want to set myself up for it. THATS what I wanna work on. 

But its honestly so hard. Everyday just gets worse and worse, my chances growing slimmer. I get more symptoms of depression, I feel more alone and undesired. 

I wish the girls I talk to would notice me in a sexual sense but they never do. Regardless of how much I train, work out,  work on myself or my career. 

I daydream about being someone else, living a totally different life. Its the only way I can keep going.

294,plurallmaquiavel,1640825644,1,"Hey guys, it's my first post here. 
Last week, my best friend (that I treated like family) decided to cut ties with me (we are both 18 year olds who entered college this year). This made me realize how lonely I am. Here's the thing: I am not lonely physically. I have parents, a boyfriend and some friends. 
The true problem is that I never felt as alone as I am feeling for the past days: I don't have a true bond with my parents (my mom has a mental illness and my dad has been through a lot of medical problems since my early adolescence), and I feel like my ""friends"" are not truly people I can rely on. Because of my problems with my parents, my best friend was my true family. When I needed someone to vent, or to announce that I was dating, she was my first (and only) option.
Since she left, I began to notice how lackluster my other social relationships really are: most of my ""friends"" create plans without me (they did a trip together this week), don't really open up (I don't even know their parents names) and are just more like acquaintances. But I always treated them like family, giving them support if they needed anything, a support that I did not receive.
I noticed this thanks to my boyfriend: he is a really social person with some great friends (he hangs out 4 times a week with friends, each time with a different friend group) and a really good social circle, apart from his really incredible family.

I am kinda tired of not feeling like a priority, like family, to anyone. I understand that my boyfriend and my other friends have family and closer people than me, but it sucks so much to feel like I do not have anyone to be a family with. I spent Christmas alone in my room because the people I wanted to spend it with had other family and friends as a priority. People always said that Christmas enhances our loneliness, but I never felt something like this before, and it truly hurts.

-mom and dad conceive me accidentally and then have me since abortion wasn't really an option back in the 80's in the country i'm from

-dad is a real scumbag who keeps trying all these get rich quick schemes. hated having jobs

-he gets into trouble with the law and goes to jail

-gets out on parole. breaks parole and sells the house we've been living in, leaving my mother and i homeless when i was 4

-gets fake passport and flees the country since he was wanted, basically abandoning us

-mom gets boyfriends every other month, while i'm home alone waiting for her to make me dinner late at night

-i start working afternoons at the age of 7 selling metal scraps and cardboard just to earn an honest buck and i start learning how to cook for myself while mom keeps working menial jobs here and there

-too awkward and socially shut in to make any friends. was too busy with school and work anyway

-mom sees i can handle myself so she neglects me even more. doesn't even care what time i get home at night even though i'm still like 9 or 10

-eventually she gets married to a dude i can't stand when i'm 12 and they both leave to work in another country, leaving me alone... again.

-the only saving grace for me was that the house was my aunt's, who lives in a different country, so at least rent wasn't an issue... but utilities and food were. i had no other relatives. all my grandparents were dead

-kept working odd jobs here and there just enough to keep me afloat. mom sent me no money whatsoever the entire time i lived on my own because she figured i made enough working on my own and she ""had her own utilities to pay""

-made very little money. had asshole bosses who sometimes refused to pay, because what was a skinny 13 year old gonna do about it?

-was very skinny and some days i had to decide whether i wanted to eat a little but consecutive days, or a little more, but skipping a day. i've had on average one meal every other day for about 7 years. was constantly hungry. many days it got so bad i passed out from stomach pain, or i would just sleep as much as i could so i would distract myself from feeling hungry

-did this until i was around 20. no friends whatsoever up until that age

-met some people over the internet, which was fairly new at the time, before facebook and all that. yahoo messenger was brand new

-kept in touch for a couple of years. then one of them invited me to a different country to work on the other side of the world, since my country doesn't really have much work (post communism). decided there was no reason for me to stay there

-after getting there it turns out 6 weeks later the friend who invited me to her country got a job offer in canada that she couldn't turn down, which i understood given the salary she was offered. i couldn't go because i had no visa

-now i was back to square one, homeless, on the other side of the planet, no friends or family, no money, didn't know the language or the place. she allowed me to stay in the apartment she was renting for one month which is what she could afford to pay for me and then just left. i quickly had to try to look for both a job and a place to stay and also learn the local language.

333,SilverQuantum,1640806954,1,"hello everyone, i've been struggling with depression my entire life, and with good reason, but i did manage to eventually handle it well enough that it doesn't actively affect me or my social life anymore, and i figured if someone like me can do, anyone can. figured i would feel better to share hoping it would inspire others to believe that no matter how bad you've got it, it can always get better. i'm going to use the 4chan format since it's what i'm more familiar with. so here's the story of a dude who has literally been alone since almost birth (raised by wolves... lol jk)

-mom and dad conceive me accidentally and then have me since abortion wasn't really an option back in the 80's in the country i'm from

-dad is a real scumbag who keeps trying all these get rich quick schemes. hated having jobs

-he gets into trouble with the law and goes to jail

-gets out on parole. breaks parole and sells the house we've been living in, leaving my mother and i homeless when i was 4

-gets fake passport and flees the country since he was wanted, basically abandoning us

-mom gets boyfriends every other month, while i'm home alone waiting for her to make me dinner late at night

-i start working afternoons at the age of 7 selling metal scraps and cardboard just to earn an honest buck and i start learning how to cook for myself while mom keeps working menial jobs here and there

-too awkward and socially shut in to make any friends. was too busy with school and work anyway

-mom sees i can handle myself so she neglects me even more. doesn't even care what time i get home at night even though i'm still like 9 or 10

-eventually she gets married to a dude i can't stand when i'm 12 and they both leave to work in another country, leaving me alone... again.

-the only saving grace for me was that the house was my aunt's, who lives in a different country, so at least rent wasn't an issue... but utilities and food were. i had no other relatives. all my grandparents were dead

-kept working odd jobs here and there just enough to keep me afloat. mom sent me no money whatsoever the entire time i lived on my own because she figured i made enough working on my own and she ""had her own utilities to pay""

-made very little money. had asshole bosses who sometimes refused to pay, because what was a skinny 13 year old gonna do about it?

-was very skinny and some days i had to decide whether i wanted to eat a little but consecutive days, or a little more, but skipping a day. i've had on average one meal every other day for about 7 years. was constantly hungry. many days it got so bad i passed out from stomach pain, or i would just sleep as much as i could so i would distract myself from feeling hungry

-did this until i was around 20. no friends whatsoever up until that age

-met some people over the internet, which was fairly new at the time, before facebook and all that. yahoo messenger was brand new

-kept in touch for a couple of years. then one of them invited me to a different country to work on the other side of the world, since my country doesn't really have much work (post communism). decided there was no reason for me to stay there

-after getting there it turns out 6 weeks later the friend who invited me to her country got a job offer in canada that she couldn't turn down, which i understood given the salary she was offered. i couldn't go because i had no visa

-now i was back to square one, homeless, on the other side of the planet, no friends or family, no money, didn't know the language or the place. she allowed me to stay in the apartment she was renting for one month which is what she could afford to pay for me and then just left. i quickly had to try to look for both a job and a place to stay and also learn the local language.

-couldn't find a place to stay but i did find a job as an english teacher. lucky for me background checks aren't really a thing here, not because of any criminal past, but because i had no formal education to teach, and i just had to make up some lies in a CV i hastily put together just so they would give me a chance, since i didn't have any money for a plane ticket to go back home, and even if i did i would still need to find a new job.

340,daydreamingoften,1640803609,1,"I have a friend which is pretty, she's been in many relationships and is one of those girls which can get any guy she likes. 
After her being in many failed relationships I managed to find a guy which is quite attractive and seemed like a decent person for her... Now I regret it so much, so so much. 

Her and her current boyfriend is the dream couple, the ones that you see in the most romantic movies, he's extremely in love with her they're obsessed with each other in a healthy way. They post each other every single day and do everything with each other it kinda feels like he's replacing me a little bit. 

I'm jealous because I've never been in a relationship and no boy ever takes me seriously and I've been rejected so many times no matter how hard I try to be nice. It makes me feel like absolute shit and I feel so ugly, I feel unloved. A lot of guys I've liked has stopped liking me because they want to test their luck with her. 

She has cheated on every boy that she's been with apart from one and now she's got the dream guy? It doesn't make sense to me at all, I would never cheat EVER or do anything horrible. 

She's always with him everyday and he always takes her home and they're always with each other every single day and it's gotten to the point where she doesn't really talk to me as much as she used to, she asks me to hang with her or come over to her house but it's almost compulsory that her boyfriend is there 😐
I've spoken to her about it and she understands but she just says that she's in her honeymoon phase. 
At times she finds him annoying then comes running to me and I brush her off because wtf. 

It just annoys me when they do their PDA right in front of me, it feels like she's taking the piss when she knows that me and boys don't work together. It really just doesn't make sense asking me to hang then doing the shit that I don't like right in front of me. She's apologized but her boyfriend just doesn't want to chill on the PDA, he's such a nice guy and I can talk to him but ugh it's frustrating. 

I was happy for her at first before she started acting up, the only reason why I helped her get a boyfriend is because I felt like I had to. She's one of those girls which can't function without one.. She will happily sleep around because it makes her feel better about herself as she lives for male validation and I was so scared for her because it's guys she didnt know. 

She's my really close friend, best friend even and of course I don't want to lose her. I don't have many friends at all and I would feel so horrible if we stopped being friends. She doesn't have many friends either a part from me and my other friend so if We stopped being friends then I doubt that she would care since all her attention is on her boyfriend anyway so that would make me feel even more annoyed. We live right next to each other too so it would be awkward seeing each other especially when she's with her bf. 

Sorry for the rant I see people ranting too so it just felt right 😅 is my jealousy valid or am I being a bad friend or am I overreacting or is she the one which is being the problem?",lonely,I'm super jealous of my friend..,2021-12-30 05:46:49

My ex girlfriend broke up with me 2 years ago. The breakup was kinda initiated by me but I was too weak to end things, so she broke up. The reason for the break up was that I was too insecure with the relationship (my family would not approve the releationship and I felt mentally pressured).

We both met at highschool at 17 years old, she was my first girlfriend and I was her first boyfriend. It was the first time I fell in love. 

Now 2 years later, I‘m not sure if I miss her or the feeling I had with her. She was my best friend and my girlfriend, so I never had someone to talk to since we broke up.

I feel empty inside and emotionally cold. I don‘t know how to meet someone new, I have no social interactions with girls AT ALL. I also never had social interactions before my relationship. She was the first girl I was attracted to, so I tried and „got“ her. I don‘t know if I will find someone as complete as her in terms of my „dream girl“. 

Since the breakup, we chatted like for birthdays (only some texts, not much) and I think she has moved on. I also don‘t feel the connection between us anymore since she writes pretty disinterested/cold, atleast that‘s how I receive it. 

I also feel like I have too much love in me that I can‘t give anyone so it fucks me up. And there is no love anyone is giving me (except my family but I think I‘m unable to „accept“ this kind of love).

Every time I try to find an online friend in literally any other way, nobody cares about me enough to really try to befriend me, even if I try to talk frequently, but then I worry about coming off as clingy because I'm always like that...Maybe the problem is that I'm starting to have a distorted perception of people around me. Idk I always just feel like everyone around me by default doesn't like me and no one should care about me, and having barely talked to anyone besides immediate family for the past 4 months has pushed me further in this mental state where making friends is practically impossible, or at least feels impossible...Idk I just needed to vent more ig",lonely,The only way I can get attention from people online is through something sexual,2021-12-30 00:47:52

I’m in a group of three… we’re “best friends” but I’m constantly left out. I think one reason is because I’m not as pretty or as stylish as them. I barely see them now since we are adults now and not at high school anymore. but when we do meet I’m never in pictures they post on social media or I’m cropped out. The only time I’m mentioned in their stories is when I’ve sent them gifts and they thank me… We all live apart, in different cities of the same country. However, when we’re in the same city they never reach out to me or reply when I send messages about being in the same place. I live in our hometown so they both come to my city often to see their parents and family…. I understand that when they come here they’re busy catching up with family. But when they’re both here they meet up with each other or other friends (who I also know) and drink and party…. I’m never invited nor am i included in any plans. Then when they leave to go back to where they live they will send me messages saying “I miss you so much” or “I’m so sorry we couldn’t see each other, I was with family the whole time, we have to catch up soon” … when I clearly saw on their Insta stories that they had a lot of time to see other friends who they claim to hate and have no interest in. These holidays we were supposed to meet up since we were all in the same city again. But of course theyre out of touch. It makes me so sad. This year both of them also forgot my birthday… but I’ve sent them both presents and messages when it’s been their birthdays. I’ve never missed one birthday of theirs but this year they forgot mine. It’s embarrassing. They know the month of my birthday so why would it be hard to send a belated message ???? I cried at the end of the month knowing they truly forgot. I know that as we get older these small things don’t matter but as I reflect on the year I’ve had I realise how shitty I've been feeling and the disappointment I constantly feel when I expect them to talk to me, reach out to me, check up on me … it never comes. Don’t get me wrong I really do understand that life happens and you can't always be there for others when you have a life of your own and your own struggles. But how can you be ""best friends"" with two people but only care for one? Its like they only include me in things when it suits them, when no one else is available. I feel like im third wheeling. I feel like im having a big fat cry over nothing. im sorry im going on and on and rambling not making sense. I don't know anymore, I want to drop them and leave them as I step into the new year but they have been such great friends in the past and I know deep down none of what they are doing is intentional.maybe I should just distance myself from them. they're supposed to be my best friends but they are barely even friends at this point. I don't want to bring it up to them either I am just so lonely... when I needed them and reached out earlier in the year they ignored me. It really hurts because I check up on them regularly and I try my best to be there for them, I put in so much effort but I am barely even acknowledged. I love them too much to put them in a position where they feel guilty about any of these feelings im going through, I guess I wish they just knew.

Who gonna cheer you on? why you gonna go to the gym again? You already went there and still feel sad, why bother?""

It wasn’t ever *weird*, just made our experiences too different. I wished them all well but I wanted to make some irl friends, or at least online friends that were more my peers. Neither of these have occurred. So now I am far more alone than ever without any people to speak to as a friend.

IRL I’ve not changed in the slightest as a person and certainly am no closer to making friends, while my efforts are online just fizzled out. My original group emerged organically because we all played the same niche game, and trying to form a new one was difficult because I was in essence *forcing* it. Going off with the explicit goal of making an online friend is a pretty easy way to make sure you fail, at least it has been for me.

So as the title indicates, I’m 26 and the feeling never goes away. Holidays feel worse every year. Seems that as the years go by the pain goes up a few scales. I’ve made friends along my journey, but none that i could ever reach out to and vent of how much in pain my soul is in right now. 

It’s insane how someone can feel abandoned, so incapable of being loved. Growing up i always thought no one can go feeling this way their whole life but here i am feeling like that and worse. 

I’ve been considered a very approachable dude, ive always believed in compassion and peace. I believe in giving everyone a second chance because thats what life is about sometimes. I’ve made many temporary friends because of it. After some time i just start to think what is it about me that no one ever sticks around. It’s heartbreaking how people can hype you up and tell you that they found a friend in life and disappear the next. 

The same goes romantically, I’ve been on a couple of dates, only had one real relationship in my teens but even then that didn’t last to long. Never kissed a girl much less fucked someone. It gets to your head sometimes, if couldn’t be loved in my 20’s this is the end of the road for me. How can someone be passed on my so many people. 

I’ve evaluated everything, specially now that i have covid. I’m forced to quarantine with my thoughts and you start putting the numbers together and you realize that no matter how much i attempt to improve the results don’t change. I felt lonely my whole life, I’ve felt like i was peoples 6th option when no one is available. I feel used by most of the women i know, they keep me in their back pocket when no one gives them attention but no one is there for me. 

I’m utterly broken, my heart is aching at the thought that I can’t end this pain. This is a constant torture that i have to endure. My parents keep asking why i still haven’t brought a significant other around, they don’t understand that the world would rather be alone that to be burdened with my presence. 

I understand that this might come across as dramatic, maybe this is the only way that i know how to describe it. I’ve begged any higher beings that i would gratefully trade mine for someone who still wants to be here. It’s a constant pain that will never go away. Ive learned to be comfortable with my own company, but there is only so much solidarity one person can take. 

All I’ve ever asked of life was to be loved by someone else, i wanted to feel wanted like i mattered to someone else. Ive realized thats its more reasonable to ask to be a billionaire than to be loved by someone else. 

I don’t expect anyone to have made it this far reading my over the top-cry for help post but if you stuck around thank you, I sincerely wish your life finds completion and fulfillment with love. I hope that you are loved the way you are deserved to be loved. Maybe the next life will be when i get to feel what I’ve been yearning.

Why seek therapy for your problems when you are only going to get blamed for how things are going anyway.

Why post about it on Facebook? No one on there is really your friend. Block and delete fakers and be done with it. They decided their relationship with you wasn't going to be much of anything. They decided that...not you.

It hurt because we have been friends since grade school and we considered each other family. So the backstory is his current gf and I had a casual relationship in hs before he even knew her. I ended it and they have been off and on dating for about a year or so. My issue with her is she has cheated on him at least three times and has told people she doesn't love him but I feel like he is completely blind to that. I've told her I don't like her for this reason specifically and I feel like she told him this just to drive a stake between me and him. I tend to get angry a lot but this time I wasn't angry I was just hurt. It hurt that he would think I would do that to him and that he had the audacity to believe it whole heartedly. I knew something like this would happen eventually because our friendship has been on a decline since they got back together. He has only called me to help him work on his car or help him fix something in his house never to just hang out like we used too. I just feel like today I lost a brother over something so dumb.

407,Graveyard31,1640763745,1,"I () will be turning 19 this week. everyone who knows me knows that I hate celebrating birthdays and doing all the crap people do on their birthdays.i like to stay in and just avoid people .i come from a very dysfunctional family and I was basically a mistake and my parents keep reminding me of that time to time.and that figures why i am not big on celebrating birthdays and shit .
 I have been suffering from depression since I was 12 and no body knows this and I can't tell my parents about it coz they don't believe in doctors let alone therapy.i still think that they have a little idea about it but they cat like they don't.my mother has created this crazy picture perfect image of my family in front of her friends and my extended family that we're very loving and happy family.but that is just on the outside.a big part of my depression is caused by my parents . they've humiliated me countless times and still do ,i feel worthless all the fucking time and the amount of time they slutshame me is honestly crazy .until a few years I used to fight with them telling them that I am not okay with the way you treat me and shit and now I just don't have the energy in me to even talk to them .
It was Christmas a few days ago and we celebrated it with my parents friends and their kids..there were a lot of people.i was hanging out with their kids and the grownups were hanging out together.and honestly it was a great day. Fast forward to yesterday one of the kids texts me saying that my mother somehow had this crazy impulse idea to host a impromptu dinner on the occasion of my birthday and I feel like she has this need to portray our family in the most pleasant way in front of others.my dad is barely home and my mother hardly ever talks to me aside from humiliating me and insulting me .all of this made me so furious and I just wanted to ask her that why is she so adamant about ruining everything for me.she wasn't home so i had time to cool off and I thought about things I'd say to her  and i came up with very logical explanations and points .when she got home I confronted her about this and she flipped over and started yelling at me.she told me""you're lucky that I'm hosting this coz you're such a lonely bird that no-one will ever talk to youa nd want to be with you.be grateful that some of our friends are nice enough to spend time on your birthday with your nd that I should stop acting like a bitch.""after hearing this I started crying and told her that I feel really sorry for her that I am your daughter and that i have lost all the respect for you and that i hate her.she added that ""....can't wait till you move out ""...I went to my room then.

414,Aquesteen,1640760679,1,"I felt lonely multiple times before this, and most of the time i see it in an optimistic way to get rid of the huge weight in my chest with excuses like ""They're probably busy..."", ""I'm probably living a different life they are..."" And ""I probably did something wrong..."". 

However, this month was probably the hardest hit that i got from my loneliness. 

My only friend in university is pushing me away and getting together with her other friend group. She didn't say anything bad, but she dismissed me many times and didn't invite me to join her for lunch or dinner. One time i chose to maybe leave her alone and not annoy her for a couple of days, and probably expecting her to approach me first instead, but what i met was the usual dismissive annoyed replies that certainly turned me off. 

The quote ""People come and go."" Or ""There will be people who come and get out of your life."" Reminded me about how normal this will be. However, It doesn't make me feel better. 

For my family however, my parents have this difficulty to let me go to join in my cousin's entourage to have outings, or sleepovers since i was a kid. Because of that, it has been difficult for me to get along with my cousins well. 

And today, I am staying at my aunt's house with some of my cousins and i can feel the dismissive vibe coming from them as well. If im speaking, they're not listening, if Im asking, they're not answering, but if there's work to do, Im the one they'll find and ask. They'll talk about things I don't know of and outed me of their conversation. They'll do things that have plans for and didn't include me in it, and basically make me feel like the outsider. 

It is suffocating me and making me get away from them and basically exit their lives myself. 

Some people will probably say ""but it was you who walked away. They didn't mention anything of you getting away from them. You took the first step."" After listening to my rant. Don't have to tell me twice, I told myself that as well. 

But is it just me seeing something wrong? Or am I the wrong one? Is me trying to save my head from thinking delusional thoughts by getting away was really a wrong step? 

This is just a rant for me to get this out. Or I might  just be breaking down crying in the middle of a conversation with them tonight.",lonely,Am I destined to be alone?,2021-12-29 17:51:19

425,laxmi_chitfund,1640756937,1,"We met at engineering college and instantly fell on love, it was a smooth transition from friends to best friends to partners, 

probably the most beautiful relationship I ever experienced and ever will, 

we were best friends, lovers, soulmates she was everything I could ask for in a girl and I tried to be everything that she ever wanted.

 We never realized when we fell in love 

I come from a small town/ rural kind of place from a conservative family. 

I wasn't really good at studies and she'd help me, even after clg I didn't get placed in any company,
 I was jobless for 2 years, she was still by my side, supporting me and doing everything from her end possible. 

I got a job and moved to her city to live along with my brother and he broke the news to my parents,
 they were shocked to hear, they were completely against it, 

my mother threw all sorts of tantrums also a suicide threat and what not, my family of 10 everyone was against it, called her what not, slut shamed her, said girls from good families don't hang out with guys before marriage and what not. 


She was very enthusiastic about entrepreneurship and startups and applied for MBAs in India as well as abroad and she got selected for a very good b school abroad. 

That's when I made the decision,I am not going to hold her back anymore, I'd never be able to crack that exam while I don't want to hold her back and settle with my regressive family here, 

I know for a fact that they won't let her work or even clothes of her choice, she would just end up being a glorified maid. 

I broke the news to her a couple of days before she left, we fought for 6 hours and then cried all night,she was holding herself because of me, 

I genuinely wanted her to grow and be happy in life. 

She was quite upset and angry with me,also blocked me for a few months. 

We do talk sometimes but not daily, life seems incomplete without her, 
feels like a part of me left meI try to make new friends and hang out outside,
 I just fear being alone, I constantly surround myself with people, a lot of people , I can't face myself, I can't live with my  thoughts alone, 

Mornings are okay, I've got work to do but at night it gets lonely, I miss her a lot. 

She was kind of sheltered and all her friends we're mostly my guy friends, so it would have been awkward for her to be friends with them . 

Moving to US was tough for her, doing everything by own self, making new friends, starting from scratch, she would breakdown at times. 

Did I fight for her enough? Did I let her go easily ? The fact that she was there by my side through thick and thin and when my turn came I wasn't by her side,life wasn't fair to her. 

Tomorrow would be our 9th anniversary, I would somehow save up from my pocket money and take her to a decent place in college, now when I have all the money in the world I don't have her by my side. 

I am  feeling very lonely today, I don't want to disturb her she has exams,

I dont want anything more in life than to experience my life with someone else that I love and cherish. Dates after dates, nothing. I am so frustrated. I dont know what im doing wrong. I have dating apps, granted they probably make me feel worse but literally i have nothing else so it makes me feel that the only girls out there are on bumble/tinder/hinge. I go out. I have friends. I just want to give up. I miss cuddling. I miss looking into someone eyes and falling for them. I miss telling someone stories of my day whether big or small. I miss telling someone about our future together. Its not fair. Im picky but I have been hit on by some pretty cute women but at the same time some pretty cute women have called me unattractive and such. So, I dont know where I stand. I dont want to sound like im bragging about that. Its not fun, its fucking awful. You have to take chances because youre at that line of attractiveness where its a grey area?? Is that the right word?? Having those constant thoughts thinking of wondering whether to approach or not because ""she's probably too cute for me"" or ""oh, I feel like I am in her league""... does that make sense?? Its stressful. I dont feel like im making sense. At the end of the day though, my thought process is ""oh, shes probably not interested in me...so I wont make a move."" Is the constant thought that goes through my mind when I find a potential partner. But people tell me to do that??? To have this mentality of not caring and acting like youre not interested. 

Ive been wanting to push everyone away. I WANT to feel like im worthless so I can get closer to the edge of running away and never coming back. I am so tired of being so tired.

There are positive comments, but I focus on the negatives. I WANT to feel shitty, I want to have more reasons to kill myself. 

Fuck everyone that tells me that you need to work on yourself. I will fucking scream. I have been ""working on myself"". I go to the gym, im graduating FINALLY in May, i take good care of myself with hygiene, etc etc. Thats a cop out. The friends that tell me that have GFs, they dont get the struggle.

Finding yourself is an ever going process that doesnt end. Im trying, im trying to keep this smile on my face but behind that smile is nothing but misery and agony.

444,NOMER_OFC,1640749141,1,"I've been feeling an incredible hole in my soul for about a year.
There was this girl, I'll call Lilly, I met over a year ago, and I really really liked her. We started out by texting, you see we were involved in the same program which consisted of two groups, and I lead one group while she lead the other. We would help eachother setup meets, and one time something just clicked so out of nowhere we just started talking, but I didn't think anything of it. Honestly, I wasn't planning on taking it any further. We would set up a group meet with the program a week later, as would continue every month for about half a year. So the first time we actually met was the first program meetup.

The first time I saw Lilly, I swear to God I never felt like that with any other woman I've met. I had zero hesitation in my attraction, it was strange because I've met highly attractive women before, but something just sparked for me. I thought it was just a little thing and I would forget about it within a couple hours, but next thing you know, we have an attendance check and lord behold it's the my fellow program leader. In the program we did some exercises and we would make a speech about some random self-help topic. Mine was financial management, Lilly had Physical Training, overall it was fine, I'm quite confident in myself so I have no problem with public speaking, but I could tell she was a little shy with it which I thought was kind of cute. Again, I didn't think much of it, to me it just meant I'd have a better time running my half of the program. Boy was I wrong.
After the meet ended, everybody headed out and I headed to my car, just before I drove off I kind of said ""oh fuck"". I'm not gonna lie, I know I'm a hopeless romantic so I had to be careful not to make anything of the feelings I felt. I got back home, and she texted me saying how good my speech was, I repayed with my own compliment and somehow we ended up talking about each other till like midnight. Now I'm thinking, okay maybe we'll just be good friends 🥲. 

You have to understand, I'm really secure with myself and keen on not being desperate. The only time I had a moment of desperation was when a 16 yr-old girl I previously had interest in as a middle-schooler, asked my(at the time)15 yr-old self to be her boyfriend after about a year of being really good friends. I ended up breaking her heart after being bored of the relationship. I've known of all the crushes that were had on myself as a highschooler, mostly because it was confirmed after the fact, but during I never had a thought about it, I just thought they were super chill. I'm a confident dumbass is really what I'm trying to say. ALSO, given my career goals and purpose which I wish to fulfill, I don't generally have time for a relationship either.

LILLY didn't just break through that wall, she phazed through it. We texted paragraphs to each other EVERY SINGLE DAY and we agreed to our first personal hangout I think the Saturday either right after or the week after the first program meetup. It was a cute little bike ride around the park that was only meant to last an hour or two. Nah. We went from 3pm to 8pm, walking all the way around an 11 mile round park atleast 3 times. Sitting on the lakeside and looking at the sunset, talking and laughing, you know just normal friend stuff that a guy and a gal on their very first hangout after basically talking about anything and everything for a week straight. Just regular platonic things. I didn't understand what I was going on, I was just so nervous about what I was feeling, I couldn't tell if anything was real. We ended it via hug, and went our separate ways. Texted abit once we got back, I wanted to make sure she got home safely and she did, hooyah good day, I was living on cloud9. 

We kept talking, everything was fine. Then, I got sent a bad path and my insecurities were taken advantage of in order to fuel their ego. I started distancing myself from Lilly, I barely talked and started to dig myself in a hole. We met a second time, a dumbass month later, right before I really kinda fucked it up. I knew this one hill that had to be the tallest point in my area, and after a relatively normal time we went up there and watched the sunrise. I could feel that something weird was in the air, so I just ended up asking her if she'd want to start dating instead of doing this friendship gig. I told her I felt like I liked her and that I don't know what else to do about that tension than just be honest. She was chill about it, and said she was so busy with everything that she didn't have the time for a relationship. I was fine with that, like I said, I'm a secure guy, but I'm also a confident dumbass. After that, the amount we talked started to grow less and less, and it wasn't until this that I realized how fucking into her I was. It was crazy.

Tell you what though, definitely helped my music career haha, anyways. 

There were a couple times where we talked and I kind of felt like there was stuff there, but the problem was it was all Lilly making the interaction. She was the one who had to contact me, while I just tried avoiding her (to stop feeling the way I felt, as ""obviously it was never gonna work because she rejected you"") and dug my hole deeper and deeper. Goddamn, did I really fuck up. Every time we metup for the program I did my absolute best to avoid interaction with her at all, and I'm so ashamed of it. I even saw her a couple months back and I couldn't muster the courage to say Hi, I just kept walking with my stupid grin, not giving her even a glimpse of recognition, because I'm afraid of looking in the mirror.

I personally hold the belief of ""no regrets"", but I'll tell you what. That's my regret right there, fucking up that potential. I don't know what to do anymore, I have my career, friends, family, but I don't have her. I've tried replacing her with exercise, drugs, and other women, but Lilly just doesn't go away. It doesn't help that I'm a creative mind, so it dramatizes it all. I had a moment in my life where I wasn't thinking about her every single day atleast once, and what happens? Out of nowhere one of my buddies starts talking about her and how she was doing in her career, apparently so well that everybody had to talk about it. I've started to feel like I just have to accept it, and if there's any chance of me paying it back, it's a big price. Maybe there will be another who can replace her, but I genuinely don't know. Who else would warrant a whole ass reddit post just so I can get my mind at ease without feeling embarrassed? All this really did is reignite my feelings, fuck me haha 😅

TL:DR - Pay attention to your gut, don't listen to your insecurities, false idols, negative thoughts. Do what you think is right, otherwise you might fuckup. Trying to avoid it makes it an even bigger fuckup. For the indefinite period, no matter how many friends and family I have around me, without her, I am hopelessly alone.",lonely,Please Read This.

452,Impooor,1640746277,1,"I think I get why various priesthoods and religious sects value celibacy... Sex is a drug. Love is a drug. Society is sick with dopamine addicts and they want to pressure everyone they can into an undertow of normalized abusive behaviors.

So many people complain about being alone and virginal, this is peer pressure. So many people complain about dry spells in love and relationships, these are withdrawal symptoms. We've witnessed the effects both grandiose and minute, the fall of Troy, the divorce of parents, the heartache of rejection or love lost... Are these truly the norm if they feel so wrong?

I posit that the human is not the social creature it believes it is. I think this idea is a careful manipulation of breeding and propoganda stirred by cleverer and more dependent addicts. Pushers, if you will, and their kingpins.

I think dependence on anything is a weakness, as is fear. I think if you can let go of these things, stop stressing about them, stop desiring them, the picture starts to become clearer, and you gain autonomy and awareness in a dimension outside society's clever boxes within boxes.

This is what it means to come close to god, to achieve Brahma, and endless joy. You have to be without. You have to lose need, and lose desire. This is the only way anyone can find their true self. Anyone is capable, and yet so few achieve it because temptation is so pervasive.

I have my parents to worry about because I know that as soon as we interact my mom is going to push my buttons and force me into a disstresfful state and my dad won't give a shit about whatever i'm doing if he has a task he'll just start barking orders at me like a godamn drill sergeant that you can only say yes to.

Ugh as if that wasn't enough I have to worry about finding a reason to live cause frankly I got none I don't have a job, I Don't have friends, Every Girl that I talk to just ghosts me for no reason or based on prejudices they've accumulated from past relationships and on top of all that I need to deal with a huge amount of haters that are just trying to kill me with negativity i'm not even joking they're trying to hurt me but because it's not physical no one bats an eye.

All my friends are gone I don't even want to talk about it it's just so lonely and every relationships i've had so far were complete disasters and those that were good just ended in me being ghosted.

I can't be the real me because no one cares about me.

I care too much and I love too much and that's the greatest turn off ever apparently because out of the 100s of people i've talked to only a few appreciated that I gave such importance and treated them fairly, Religious people are also after me for the obvious reasons that they're after everyone that doesn't bend to they're rules and lastly even the supernatural forces of nature are hellbent on killing me because WHY NOT!!

Every single thing so far been pushing me to suicide and at this point they really are succeeding because between my Depression PTSD Anxiety Bipolar Dissociative I don't know who the fuck between them will kill me first I struggle more and more to come back from a depressive disorder and it's not fun I have lost most if not all my appetite so far and I'm Still being pushed even further down the rabbit hole and It showing no signs to stop.

It doesn't matter what I do. Who I am. Who I act like. What I act like.

Things just keep turning out the same way no matter what I don't even know the fuck I am at this point I look in the mirror and I feel more like I'm looking at someone i'm familiar with rather than my own self I have trouble recolleting what my hobbies and interest are because I genuinely go so much with the flow that it carried me away now I'm just stuck in that river drifting away and i'm not sure I want to stop and save myself anymore.

I was dreaming that someone is going to come for me and save me from all this distress and torment.

I was hoping that someone would show up to save my day and heal me put me back on my foot and make me walk

EVERYONE WAS LIKE RELATIONSHIP ABOUT HEALING YOU OR SAVING YOU BLA BAL REEALTIONSHIPS IS  BORING SHIT AND JUST FUCKING!!!.

We have both openly talked about a relationship and stuff, saying that we both like each other and would want to actually date each other but nothing actually happened, she is currently in a long distance relationship with someone who hasn’t been the best and she has openly said that she is loosing feelings for the person and is close to breaking up with him

It was going great and all, we have been having a great time, we have been for a while and after all this time I’ve put in so much effort in trying to be the best that I can be, bending over backwards for her thinking that she would leave the person that has been an ass to her on many occasions after she said she would leave him

And today I got the, “your like a brother to me” and the room went silent 

Later on today she said that she hopes to still be friends but I don’t know how I would be able to do that because we would hang out at hers and cuddle and stuff, share food and do things that you wouldn’t see in just a regular friendship but you would with people who are in a relationship 

I left hers today and I got around the corner out of sight of her house and broke down

And that really badly affects my relationships with others because I end up not putting in effort because I think they don’t care about me.

And my question is right about this...

Like. I know there are people who have it worse than me, and every time I have a day where I feel like absolute waste or that I really can't take it and I read about a much harder story I'm like... ""Why do I whine so much if there are people who live impossible situations?"" And feel at fault. Now I don't know if it is right to feel at fault to... ""Feel like waste regarding my situation"" even if there are worse ones... obviously not that knowing there are people who have it worse than me"" is an excuse to be like ""I'm being in the worst situation but some have it worse"". Because that would be hypocrite in my opinion (I'm sorry if I'm expressing myself badly, kinda stressed and burnt out lately)

Also I could sport again with my team at the local sport club again. I hang out with people and played games with them offline and online.

There are many ways you could interpret that but I've taken it to mean that looking exclusively to other people for comfort and validation is a good way to get burned. Time after time, I have looked in someone's eyes and seen a home where I'd be safe and protected, and time and time again I've been lost and depressed because they leave me. There's something to be said for self reliance. For learning to be at peace with yourself. For allowing your own heart to be your place of comfort instead of someone else's. Because when you look into someone's eyes and see home, that home disappears when they look away from you for the last time, leaving you lost and shattered, unsure of where to go or what to do with yourself. And when this happens over and over, the loneliness becomes unbearable.

510,Suspicious_Beyond_18,1640722060,1,"I have always had this bad habit of comparing myself to other people on social media. It always feels like a never ending competition when I’m engaged online. I am not the best looking in fact I’m biracial and not the good looking kind. The kind where you wonder if God intended to punish someone from birth. I have always had conflicting and shifting self image. I have struggled with things from childhood abuse to mental health issues. There are days I will love myself and be proud of the hardships I’ve overcome and endured and then others where I hate the way I look and disregard any achievement I have made in life. This especially happens when comparing myself to others online. I’ve had terrible relationships to okay relationships. The most recent one is a divorce from my ex whom I was very attached to. He treated me quite poorly and I didn’t set boundaries until recently which had led to divorce. I find myself comparing myself to his ex and his friends and their girlfriends etcetera. I don’t know why I spend so much time comparing myself to validate self worth. I definitely don’t compare in looks by any means. I’m quite ugly and I accept it some days and other days refuse to accept it. I’ve had surgery done to my face. I’m looking into other cosmetic procedures however they are quite expensive. I lost a lot of weight from stress and poor genetics. I had enough and decided to remove myself from social media. Has anyone ever done this before? How do you cope with being completely offline, I find it difficult as I have this belief that a lot of my inspiration, news, and supposed feeling of connectivity comes from social media. Although I’m pretty convinced now my presence online has a very opposite effect. I don’t feel well informed about the world around me, but sure, I feel more informed. I don’t feel inspired seeing gorgeous women, I feel discouraged. When I see what people I know are up to it’s nice to be updated I suppose, but why do I care? I question my self worth quite a bit. I don’t think I’m particularly unique. I’m maybe a little above average when it comes to intelligence. I have very often been among the top few students in my classes (and this is also despite the issues I had going on in my home life as kid.).Kudos to me. Based on somewhat credible iq tests I have an iq ranging from 118-140. That only means so much since an iq test is based only on how fast your brain recognizes a pattern. I wouldn’t say I’m that knowledgeable at least for my age. Mature maybe or so I’ve been told. I’m 20 yrs old F. My memory is quite limited due to my drug and alcohol abuse in high school. I haven’t been on medications recently for mental health reasons but probably should be on something. Recently I have found myself reading into psychology and found that a lot of my mental health symptoms correlate to someone who has borderline personality disorder. My recent ex (the one I divorced) was so out of my league in looks and intelligence and skills you name it but also has many traits and behaviors of someone that is narcissistic. It has damaged my self image and worth quite a bit. I’m embarrassed I let someone treat me so poorly and it makes me question whether or not I’m mentally handicapped. Very humiliating. I’m sorry for the rant (and that’s not even the half of it…) I doubt anyone will actually read this anyways. I guess I deleted social media and my next step I don’t know what it will be. Self improvement somehow I guess until I am worthy of making an online presence again. I need some serious make over… no I don’t want to look like a walking bag of plastic though.

Likelyhood is that most of the people here suffering from loneliness do not make themselves seen. Not because they are unlikable, unlovable losers, but because people do not know that we exist. 

I reckon that most of us stay indoors at every opportunity, barely see the sun, barely touch the grass and no one actually knows that we exist in the first place.

My trouble is knowing where the fuck to find friends. College was personally good for me, im sure some work spaces are also a good way to find friends, but what else can we do? Clubs? Meetups?

Haven't had a girlfriend in  let's say  ... 3 years now? Last meaningless hookup was on Valentine's  day lol. She blocked me right after too. Was kind of embarrassing

I  have to vent, I really don't know where people are meeting eachother  anymore because where I reside (Philadelphia) there's basically like no  MeetUp groups, tinder and dating apps ARe flat out HORRIBLE here (people  treat themselves basic things such as replying like a business), and  meeting people in public just by approaching them seems so looked down  upon nowadays. I don't want to be called a creep by trying to talk to  someone... Happened before lol

I  don't know. I'm just really fed up with the current dynamic of how  everything is set-up nowadays. Anyone else feel this way? All my friends  have moved on, they all are married or have jobs now. I barely keep in  contact with them anymore.

If this  was how hard finding a relationship or even just people in real life to  be friends with was gonna be, I would've just never tried in the first  place lol

I grew up in an Indian  joint family of 11 people who would fight every day, attention and love from my father was almost equal to nothing,he never expressed love, 
 
Dark skinned, slightly chubby and had a big nose, ugly according to beauty standards. 

Was body shamed right left and centre ever since I remember, at 3,at 4 during my teenage. . 

They said no one will marry me! Oh who will marry you? You need to earn heavy bucks to compensate for your looks, 

My cousin brothers said they picked me up from the garbage man. 

My brother would always tell me I have nothing to offer, no height, big nose, fat ugly bitch. 

I never confessed my love to a guy because I always thought I am too ugly for anyone.

My first crush ended up liking my best friend and dating her, I always felt he choose her because she is fair skinned. 

I in turn went into my shell turned into an introvert, would stare at the ceilings for hours, would be sacred to talk to people especially boys. 

I would always feel if I talk to people they would body shame me, in order to protect myself I went into my shell and became a lone wolf.

I'm turning 32 and I'm at the stage where I feel like I'm totally alone. 
I earn a decent wage (way above the country average, finance industry), friends think I'm funny in my own way, have not really a problem socializing (my alcohol tolerance really helps), regularly read and exercise, I'm pretty smart (not to be an arrogant dick, but general consensus from people around me), had many artistic talents though I don't pursue anymore.

These are the good, but the bad:

I could be very stubborn sometimes, never had a relationship, feel myself unattractive, have quite a few secrets about my family that i want to keep from people, doesn't really wanna go outside home, have no interests in general things (delicious foods, media, social trends, outfits etc.), don't really feel easy when there are too many people (still able to socialize well, but drains alot of energy. Introversion i guess?)

Now, jerking off became a routine for an empty pleasure, can't really read texts (books) with interests, personal side project that I've been passionate about for a couple of years reached almost to a halt, started tasting liquor (not really drinking but one or two shots of spirits a week) as a hobby for new interest but it worsens lonliness. No more new hobbies would interest me anymore for now. Most of all, I think this is the worst, but I'm tired of being the one to reach out. I tried to make meaningful relationships personally, but right after i stop reaching out I always become alone again. From my point of view, communications are two-way channel and it bothers so much, the fact that I always have to be the one to initiate. I know people have their own lives and things to deal with, but being checked up on by no one besides my mom is fucking terrible. It is not just recent circumstances, but has been for my whole life. 

I'm almost at the stage where I want to give up (not really suicidal, in an active way till my parents are still there, but it would be great if it ends while I'm asleep.)

Can anyone give me an advice on how to deal with this feeling? I've been hoping and trying that the situation would improve if i put more effort into it, but it hasn't been the case.

A pattern in my life is that I give my friends my time, emotional support, and even money and when I am in need they're no where to be found. I have been friends with a girl for about 2 years. We began drifting earlier this year because of life and she made a huge point to reach out to me and she happened to be going through alot and needed support. I didn't even have to think about it and I was happy to support her and I told her about some things I was struggling with too which is really hard for me to do. A few months ago she started barely talking to me when we used to talk everyday. After a few weeks I just said hey we don't talk much anymore is everything okay? She responds to tell me my issues bring her down even though I never even cried in front of her or mentioned my own issues more than a handful times. I rely on myself first and then my husband for my emotional support and the most  I'd do with her is vent. Despite this, even if she didn't want to talk about negative things if she was mature and just said that I would have totally just respected that and talked about other things but she admitted to essentially ghosting me. She would call me crying and panicking and I'd help and now that she's moved past the rough patch in her life it seems ive outlived my usefulness. She said she still wanted to be friends but distant and essentially slowly fizzle out the friendship. I told her I don't need her friendship, I don't need to feel like a burden when I happily have been there for her and this has happened to me too many times in the past and I'm just weary now. This has happened to some other people I know and they tell me theres alot of reasons as to why it happens and alot of it is that people are selfish.

To me, I will accept anyone as a friend as long as you're not inappropriate, or racist, or mean or discriminate against others. Its okay to be sad, depressed, angry, happy, all those emotions I'd personally want because I'm friends with a human, and humans have multiple emotions.

547,thecherryflower,1640704921,1,"How do you stop feeling inadequate in social situations where everyone else is ""farther along""/""more successful"" than you?

I am trying so hard to redefine success - which at the core I truly believe is fulfillment/satisfaction/contentment/happiness/inner peace.

But it's hard when you come from a culture (I was born and raised in the United States but my family is of Asian descent) that highly praises and emphasizes honor, awards/accolades, academic success, big-named schools, prestige, power, popularity/fame, riches, status, meeting the stereotypical life milestones by a specific age, etc. I'm trying to break away from this mindset. I am very close with my family, but, I hate that we are part of a community that really is deeply enmeshed in this ideal if you know what I mean. Social events with other Asian folks (people my parents know and their kids who are in their late 20s/30s). I'm in my late 20s (for context), single, unemployed, and living with my parents. Graduated medical school in 2019 but have had to study for licensing exams in order to get a job in my field. These exams have given me a very difficult time. I've never been a good studier/test taker. Always been a mediocre student. I graduated at the bottom 10% of my class. I couldn't get involved in extracurriculars because I failed exams and was very overwhelmed with my rigorous program. Even repeated a year and graduated later than my friends (who are all working). Barely passed my first board and am studying to re-take another exam that I need for medical residency. It's been a difficult journey. This certainly is not how I envisioned my life post graduation. It's taking me so long to get my life together. I feel bad because my parents have supported me (financially and emotionally) throughout my entire journey and it's taking me so long to get my life together. I have heard them a couple times comparing me to other girls my age: ""Look! so and so is your age and almost done with medical residency and she's ready to start her fellowship. She's pregnant with her second child."" or, ""When are you going to hurry up? So and so already has interviews for residency programs.""

I want to be a child psychiatrist more than anything though. I'm just frustrated it's taking longer than I hoped. And besides being a practicing doctor, there is SO MUCH else I want to do in life (publish a book, get into flower design, start a podcast, candle-making, travel, etc.)

But I feel self-conscious and even inadequate about my station in life sometimes. While I do appreciate the time and freedom I have (because of the lack of responsibilities), at social gatherings, people ALWAYS ask what I'm up to. I feel inadequate compared to the other girls my age who are established doctors in training/lawyers/aspiring business magnates/politicians/diplomats/etc. who have gone to or are working for prestigious institutions/programs. Some even married and also with kids. While I have none of that at the moment. A few of the girls are honestly really mean to. They pry and ask about what I'm doing, when I'm applying to residency, what I've been doing since graduation, etc. and they lord it over me what they have - being far along in their medical training, being married, etc. In my interactions, I try not to let my upset feelings show on my face. I try and demonstrate grace congratulating them on their achievements, asking them what they like about work/their spouse/kids, etc. But I still feel bothered on the inside. I want to get to a point where I don't feel provoked by other people no matter what they do/say. I genuinely want to wish them well in their lives (even if they are jerks). Getting to that point is hard because sometimes I feel that it's not fair what they have (or that because they are shitty people that they have success in life). Really trying to get out of this frame of thinking because I'm not seeing the full picture. I know they're just projecting what they want me and other people to see. But I know genuinely wishing them well and being happy to see that they got what they wanted hits folks like this on another level. How do I stop feeling bothered?

I am very attached to my parents. This time I've had with them since I moved back home after finishing school has been precious. The other night I thought to myself: ""When am I ever going to have this amount of dedicated time with them ever again? I don't know if I ever will...life moves so fast...""

The only thing that's been helping me has been church and Bible time. I have started going recently and I feel...great every single time I go. I am reminded of the brevity of our lives. Whether a human being lives until 100 or 80 years...that is still short in light of eternity. And while I am aware of this sobering reality (and time with God has changed my perspective on what's truly important). This thought always crosses my mind when I hear news of a rich and famous person dying. They've accumulated everything and couldn't take anything with them.

It's just hard remembering this in the moment when I'm at these social functions. People are mean. They attach their worth to what you have/haven't accomplished. They attach your worth to your career/other external measures of success. I have started to realize that it's an individual's heart and character that carries them far, isn't it? It's really sad how the world doesn't see it that way.

I know we're in the middle of a pandemic (and the States has no intention of going under lockdown). I'm just afraid of going to social events. They make me anxious. I don't want to make an appearance because of where I am in life. I know it sounds terrible.

dear redditor (or redditer? idk),

so i (20F) have been on reddit a lot recently and i feel like shit because of it. i mean, no shade to you, live your life the way you want, i guess, but i just never thought i’d find myself here.

basically, my thing is everybody always leaves me. i never thought i could develop a fear of abandonment at like 12/13, but i found myself overanalyzing over every little tonal shift and trying my best to emulate behavioral patterns for years now. clearly, i’m here, so it hasn’t rlly been helping fight that fear.

now, i’m sure there are plenty of reasons why everyone leaves, but i just wish i knew what made them leave specifically. i have no idea what i did seriously wrong to drive them away, and that FUCKING TERRIFIES me. 

because of this fear, i’ve developed an unhealthy habit of cutting off people before they can do it to me (hey ppl who i ghosted, srry it’s not u, i’m just too scared to let anyone close to me again xoxo). i don’t know how to let my guard down when, every time i do, i get hurt or extremely disappointed. i want to form meaningful connections, but every time i do, all i can think about is how they’ll end. i’m so tired of this.

anyways, i’m not sure why i’m putting this out here, but maybe someone will be able to find peace knowing they aren’t the only one feeling this way. i could go darker, but i’d rather not have my first entry be full emo tumblr goth

this may be my fault do to me being older than  my lil sis's but i cant relate to them anymore cause im into more mature stuff

w**arning: very long post so get comfy!**

 My phone is like my gateway to everything. I talk to my IRL friends on it, I use it to write a diary,  I use it for my entertainment, it records my health, I use it to laugh, to cry, I use it to listen to music, it's the first thing I see when i wake up in the morning, it's the last thing I see when I go to sleep, I play games that I like all by myself, I use it for online school, I use it to access the world wide web. I can write my true feelings and express myself however I want whenever I want on my phone and it will not judge me. I use it for health advice without asking my parent. I also use it for homework help so it replaces my parents. *in a way my phone kinda replaced my parents and friends in a way. My phone is a ultimate representation of me.*

I have two friends and a friend group, let's call them Friend 1 and Friend 2 and Friend Group of friend 1's friends. 

Friend 1 is my best friend since sixth grade. I'm a high school senior. I wont tell her everything cause you can't always trust your best friend because what happens if your friend leaves you one day or is dishonest to you. She doesn't watch/like anime so basically I don't have a complete  relationship with her. I can only relate to her when it comes to school topics and that's it. I only see this friend in person once or twice a year due to us going to different high schools. I put on this fake personality that I like the stuff she likes but it’s not genuine.  

Friend 2 is my other friend shes not a close to me as friend 1 but I still enjoy her. I can be more genuine around her than friend 1 shes more of a tomboy like me a bit. The last time I've seen her in person was March of last year. I speak to her on snapchat and that's it. It's just school conversations, not much anime, only some vampire anime. Some memes and some crap. 

As an introvert, the Friend group doesn't really work for me. I prefer being with one  one person rather than being left out in a group. I fake my personality all the way through, it doesn't feel genuine, it doesn't feel true. I fake laugh at their jokes. They’re unfunny to me. I don’t completely trust them. I was at friend 1's birthday party and it was boring, bland, and lame. Im sorry but thats how i truly feel the food was the best part but the entertainment was boring. She brought all her friends from her highschool and i couldnt really fit in cause the majority of the time they discussed topics concerning their highschool which i cant relate to cause i dont go to their highschool. Friend 2's birthday party was way better cause we did stuff that i liked! We watched silent voice anime movie, we went to the arcade and won prizes, i had an awesome unforgettable time! It was the best party i went to out of my education!

&amp;#x200B;

 i have younger sisters , ,

hi at like 4am in the morn'in where i live.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*My front interets:\*\***

I like English class its my favorite course

I love photography

I love sailor moon due to the nostalgia, soundtrack and 90s aesthetic

I like art class

Japan is my favorite country

**\*\*My true interests/entertainments that genuine that i love that i cant tell my parents or sisters. These are interets i keep a secret:\*\***

My favorite anime is Kill La Kill

Right now i have chemistry class and graphcis design. I dont like the courses but i gotta do what i gotta do. 

My other favorite animes are prison school, Golden Boy and any Ecchi anime. The ecchi genre in anime is anime that is quite risuqe and sexual in nature. Such as panty shots, perverted jokes, peeping on girls, boobs etc. 

I like movies with a lot of violence  and swearing Such as Kill Bill, Kill Bill 2, Battle Royale, Logan, Deadpool, Deadpool 2, Wonder Woman, Black Panther, Xmen First class, Aquaman, Xmen days of future past, Xmen 1, x2, the wolverine, shazam and poltergeist, Joker 2019, Pulp Ficiton, Invisible Man, The thing 1986, both terminator movies any many more movies.

I dont read books anymore of physical copy anymore. I lost the attention span like completley. In eighth grade I would read books such as Peregrines home for percuilar children. 

I dont read manga which are Japanese comic books cause currently i dont have the time. Like the physcial copy. I only read hentai manga when im horny before bed. 

I dont watch tv anymore cable neither netflix or any streaming service on tv. I have two tvs in my house kitchen and living room. My mom always guards the remote and has it with her cause in my hosue we only have one remote for those two areas. The best tv shows on cable come on past midnight like adult swim cause the daytime shows are boring. I would watch Kenny vs Spenny but thats past 3am on Rogers.  My mom takes the tv remote before bed and therefore its out of the question. I cant watch my favorite shows anymore cause all the adult shows come on past like midnight and it ruins my sleeping schedule and its inconveeint. So as a result. Tv is no longer an entertainment for me. I have zero inetrets in tv now. I dont even remeber the last time i watched tv in the ktichen

I have my phone and laptop access 24/7 depends on me. 

I dont play video games like I used to play when i was younger super mario galaxy for example back in like middle school days. Those days are over. I dont have time for vidya games anymore. Im more conerned in my homework. I dont have the adrenaline anymore.  

The only video game i like to watch people playing but i dont play myself is Yandere Simulator. I like Yandere Simulatior because it had a huge influence over my interets in anime. I like the concept and its exrtemley bloody and violent and anime. I know the games not gonna be finished due to the poor development but im glad it had a huge infleuence in my childhood  I’m. 

The music i listen to is various. I like ballads from anime, 90s and 80s ballads power, 80s sad songs, i like city Japanesepop, I dont listen to kpop only if its like 80s synthesizer power ballads. Like super sad. I like theme songs from movies and tv shows. An exmaple is the sailor moon soundtrack.  I like whitney houstons music from the 80s those sad pwoer ballads like dint we almost have it all and all at once. I like instrumentals as well.

Sports: In middle school i used to play the clairinet and do cross country. I gave up the clairnet for the love for art in high school. I used to do cross country and track and field back in middle school. Those days are over now for obvious reasons im in online school and those inetrets are done. I gave it up for other interetss and courses. 

So what is my entertainment. All i do is go on reddit andother sites laugh at LOLCOWS such as Lovely Peaches, Yanderedev, etc. They're my entertainment cause of their imbecicilic actions. I laugh at basement dwellers and how much of a falirue they are.  I watch true crime videos on youtube in the background while im doing my homework and thats it.

I dont have games on my phone and i dont use tiktok. My phone is the iphone 6s. The battery sucks ass from a straw and it dies very quickly. So i cant download those apps due tot he afct they use tons and tons of battery life. So i lost inetrets in phone games and tiktok. I also hate tiktok its the emobdiement of a 5 year old. Its loud, obnoxious and wants your attention. People say amongus, sus, and sussy baka and its annoying. 

I dont watch anime anymore currently. My love of anime and wtahcing it is currently on hold until late June next year the end of senior year. I dont watch movies anymore as its currently on hold until next year when im done senior year. So those interets are on hold. Also i ran out of movie ideas and the glory days of violent movies and anime are over. The list of movies i wrote in this post were movies i watched last year for obvious reasons. 

I dont play with toys anymore the alst time i played with a toy was like when i was 12/13.

I dont cook and im not allowed to cook. I dont do laundry. I clean my bathroom and my room and thats it. My parents wont allow me to cook when i want to. I remembr i used to make my own lunch in 9thgrade and 10th grade  but im now allowed to now. Im not allowed to vaccum my own room. A parent does it for me caue every year the vaccum breaks. 

I do my homework all by myself. My younger sisters cant help me. My parents dont remeber and cant help me. So who can help me only myself. My teachers cant help me. So im left to my phone for help and my own devices. 

Allergies: im allergic to eggs, peanuts, and nuts. That means on brithdays i get left out and events. Cause cake has eggs in it. These biches know. They know what im allergic to. My little sisters ate the cake thats eggfree that one of my parents brought home instead of the cake that was intended for them.

 When my mom saw me watching on 90 day fiance on tv last year two girs kissing my mom said for me to not watch it and said it was shameful what they were doing. Also my mom and sisters were watching black swan 2010 that psychological thriller and changed the scene when it was getting sexy with two lesbian girls. Also in like may of this year during the whole Billie Eillish queerbaiting situation i told me mom in the car while with my three younger sisters and my  sister asked my mom what queer means. And in a low whisper in an angry pissed off voice my mom told me to shut up. She lied and said it was nothign and that she didnt know. Your 50 you know what queer means. Didnt the bible say its a sin to lie. Then why ate you lying to them. 

This is the result of a shelterted household. I cant share my thoughts or ideas with anyone. They tell me to shut up or be quiet and to shut my mouth. They also take my phone or devices from me. I find it kinda sad cause im supposed to go to these people about my sexuality and to share my interets and i cant. All these thoughts are repressed and hidden. They're presented as shameful and soemthing i should keep to myself. It is starting to feel like sort of a government in my house. I have no one to talk to. I eat my dinner at different times. I never sit and eat dinner with my family. I never watch movies with my family. I never watch tv. I dont play vidya games. I dont go to them for homework help.  Am all alone more than ever. I dont really see my real friends. All my friends are all one their own too on their path. Some are going to workplace, college or university. Some are online or in class. My friends moved schools. Its quite sad this year in senior year. It really establishes that its alla bout you. Senior eyar is the worst year. 

I dont fight with my sisters at all. I fight with my parents more over stupid shit. Parents took my phone away for 5 months last year April-end of August. This utterly destroyed me and ill never forgive my parents for this and all the damagE it had done to me. THIS DONE THE MOST MENTAL DAMAGE TO ME THAN ANYTHING AND ILL NEVER FORGIVE THESE BASTARDS.  As a result of this five month hiatus I COULDNT talk to me friends, i didnt have any access to social media, i had access to nothing. My friends kept texting and calling me how am doing and for school shit. I dont have a lot of memories of last year. Ever since then it melted me down into a self centerted bitch. They violated my phone. In terms of violation they made me unlock the phone and they oevrthrown it. They went through my everyhting on my phone. They started using my phone for 5 months.  This angers me beyond anything. As a result, i started  acting very aggresive towards my parents as a way of revenge and grieving. swearing at my parents calling them the R word, the C word, the F word. I called my mom a piece of shit to her face and the c word and got punished. As a result of this intense anger i got cup glasses and started throwing it to the ground. This is my way of grieveing for the 5 months i lost. My mom interrupted me during a google meet where i was doing a presentation for art class and the microphone was on and she screamed that i was rude and my teacher heard. My house is unsuitable for online school as well and i hate my bedroom. 

My parents hate being called the C word but mom tells my dad that she likes getting her pussy fucked. She does this dirty talk with my dad in like a moaning voice about her pussy. My sisters dont notice this but i do the whole hypocrisy and how dirty my parents are and how they hide it. My dad grabs my moms ass sometimes. in the kitchen and i was there, its suggestive. Suggestive talk. My mom grabs his ass back. I hear them making love at 3am the bed shaking and the moaning cause my rooms next door.I found a vibrator and condoms and thongs and shit. My dad gropes my mom from the back grabbing boobs and her crotch area. My sisters dont know this but i do. My mom changes the channel and hides adult content from my younger sisters. She portrays it as something shameful, that its soemthing to look away from to cover your eyes from to not look at the tv the adult content. Even to me. Ive seen worse and heard of worse people whove done worse. I watch porn. Thats it. 

On my  17th birthday i couldnt do what i wanted to do. I wanted to watch deadpool but i couldnt with my family. I couldnt watch Kill bill or Battle Royale. We watched the disney movies Raya dragon movie and this was my brithday i was supposed ot pick the movie i didnt watch it with them. To me anime or movies without seuxal content or sweraring or violence is nothing to me. I dont watch a lot of movies with my parents cause all the movies i watch are for babies and little kids. Its too safe. Its not risuqe its not sexual, its not violent enough. I like taboo movies with violence like Pulp Fiction. Attack on titan isnt enough and is boring. My hero academia is boring to me and the fanbase is the worst on the internet. I only like sexual anime not anime with actual sex which is called Ecchi. Playful sexy content in anime like Prison school and Golden BOy is funny to me.

My younger sisters think that the concept of sex or anything violent taboo is like im not allowed to talk to them about it. All they talk about is Roblox, titkok kid shit, Flamingo youtube channel for roblox PG13 content no swearing. 

My  sister is too sensitive to like sexual/adult content. She's so afraid of it like its a horror movie and thinks that kissing is weird. She's sensitive to violence. Im the opposite all the sexual and violent shit i watch is what i love.

&amp;#x200B;

 i share a room with  sister and i dont speak a word to her

I despise sharing a room with her. She opens the window in the morning and it's freezing. She plays classical music on repetition on the same radio station because the same station that plays repeats the same classical music. The classical music is too loud. I'm in online school and I can't talk to my teacher with background music and there's nowhere else comfortable to go. 

   I can't go downstairs cause the television is on and my parents disrupt me during class. This makes my room unsuitable as a study room because there's now the music factor; I can't study with music because my attention shifts from coursework to following the music's tune. I can no longer do my homework there and can't concentrate.

My room is so cluttered now it's an unsuitable cluttered environment. I have to go to bed and be on the same schedule in sync with my lil sis and im a 12th grade student. I'm different and have more coursework and more concerns and responsibilities. I'm older now and I want more space and it's just so unfair that I can't even be my true self in my bedroom. I also have rotations such as when she needs the room to do a presentation I have to leave the room. 

My parents dont give a shi either.

Currently a high school senior can't wait to start uni. That way I can have my own space full of freedom. I do online school so it sucks that I can't study with the music on.

Even in university dorms you can get a small room all to yourself but it costs more money than sharing a room with someone else. I may never have somewhere comfortable to cry or be my true self. I feel trapped, i feel so built up with emotions and just sad.  By the time I'll get my own room it will be like when I start working after I get an education and that's like years from now and it's honestly sad. 

In summary, it's similar to jail. Same schedule everyday. I lost control of my room. Its so annoying and the fact that ive been stuck in this state. 

The most annoying thing she does is spray perfume in the room and it just makes it unbreathable. It's so horrible and it's been like this since September 2020 and I feel so trapped like a bird in a cage. My accommodations are not to my liking currently. If I cause any problems with my sis i'll get my phone confiscated. 

I don't have enough money to move out and I don't have a job. I'll be stuck in this state until September 2022 when I move out to university and that's a long time from now I'll have to be stuck with this annoying child. I feel like I'm dancing to someone else's tune when I want to dance to my own tune. I feel one day I'm gonna crack and I'm just suppressing this anger and feeling boxed up.

589,Kryslais,1640682866,1,"I used to have real friends back in elementary and middle school but now I'm a senior and really have no one. Not even my parents can be considered friends because for my whole life they've always went out to gamble or shop, or go to relatives houses and won't come home for hours or even entire days. My entire time in high school I've been seen as this funny, dumb, and nice guy, but really it's all just an act. When I come home I have no one to talk to and have nothing to look forward to, I do enjoy lifting but even tho I've gotten results that I've wanted I've got no one to talk to about it. When I did have real friends I would always go to sleep overs, and always had someone to text. As my friends and I got older I drifted apart from them, they all started to get into weed and drinking. I would get invited to their houses to smoke  and drink and I would always say no, they all think I say no because I'm a good kid who doesn't want to get in trouble. In actuality I've grown up with aunts and uncles and cousins who would drink and smoke as kids and seeing what their lives look like now, it scares me because in reality their lives suck and aren't looking like they'll get better any time soon. I've tried talking to my ""friends"" on snap or insta but in the end I'm always the one who hits them up first and they never text me first or even reply sometimes. Even on my bday which was last week my parents said ""happy birthday we'll be back in a couple hours"" and didn't come back till 2AM. not one text from someone saying ""happy birthday"". When I'm at school I have a ""friend group"" that I hang out with but they won't even think about me once school is over. Here's a good one, my junior year one of my friend girls asked if I would go to prom with her (she is part of my friend group and we've been ""friends"" since 4th grade atleast that's what she thinks) so I obviously I said yes and when I picked her up and took her to prom she immediately went straight to her girl friends and didn't talk to me once the whole time, I tried talking to some of my friends but just found myself alone with nothing to do. I decided to just leave and I went to the gym and worked out. I planned that if she were to text or call me asking where I'm at to take her home I would say I'm in the bathroom and I would drop everything and go straight to pick her up and take her home. But nope not a single notification and her gram looked like she didn't even notice I was gone. The next week at school when I talked to her she didn't even seem like she knew I left she just thanked me for taking her. So most of my time I just go to school talk, go home, lift for about 1-2 hours, come home and have the whole house myself with nothing to do so just mainly play some madden or apex but after a while it jus gets boring and I jus lay on my bed and listen to music. I do try to talk to people but it ends up leading no where, I'm not trying to a find a girlfriend bc I kno that I need real friends to talk to and hang with before I strive for something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, they invited me to this GTA RP server and this is where the problem started. I developed feelings for this girl in the server. She would always talk to me, she made me feel special because even if she is one of our ""mafia bosses"" she doesn't talk to them. She would always reach out to me and ask me to hang out. We drove to mountains, took pictures together, etc (All this only in GTA btw). The problem is, I'm soft as fuck, and I develop feelings too easily. I can't have her because she has a girlfriend, she's older than me (I'm 17 and she's 20+), and I don't even know her IRL.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, it's super corny and reading it back is just super cringey. But I can't help it, not having anyone to love and also the lingering pain I had from my ex just makes me this soft and desperate. So what I've just decided is that I'll quit this RP thing. I already insinuated this to her last night and she said ""I just left you for a second and now you want to leave me?"" In a half joking half serious way (it's more understandable in our language lol). Little bit of context, she said that because she took a break from RP for 2 days.

&amp;#x200B;

After I quit, I'll just go back being alone again. I'd rather be by myself rather than feel this again. I hate memories more than anything. I can't really open up to family for personal reasons and also not to my friends because they're not really the type of friends you can open up to.

 like, I'm  and I've been depressed since I was born ((god bless genetics/ j )) 

when covid started I really isolated myself from the world, and the first time I went out of my home was like 3 months ago. I procced to try to make friends but I really don't know how to interact with people, some of my close friends really don't mind it at least. But today this dude that I met 3 months ago was at my close friend's party. 

 A drunk friend of mine said joking that I was curious about his life, I responded joking as well, saying that I've never saw him out of party. 

 He misinterpreted the joke, thinking I was offending him or smthing like that. He sighed deeply, looked into my eyes and procced to say around a bunch of people that I barely knew. 

 ""Outside of this circle you have no friends. Everybody thinks you are strange. No one likes you ""

  everybody looked unconfortable. The party was over. I wish I could be stronger, but I was holding lots of things and started crying my heart out, my friend took care of me, but people soon started go away. This was 7 hours ago. I'm still crying.

601,Revolver-Knight,1640676313,1,"So I went to the movies with a girl that works in the same store as me.

I do like her I think she’s very pretty Ian’s we get along well the drive there and back was probably one of the more thought provoking conversations we had that wasn’t about what time you at work and how was your day. 

but I’m divided on how far I want to take this.

On one hand I feel like I’m over my ex I’ve broken my chains and I’m ready to get back out.

On the other hand I don’t know how I feel about dating someone I work with.

Like we don’t work directly together but she works in the front at customer service and I work as a closer and fruit cutter.

We see eachother every day but that either on a lunch break or when I leave for the day and grab a sodie and a lotto ticket.


Honestly like it was a spur of the moment.

I messaged her last night and was like hope your shift went well what are you up too.

She told me what she was up to and asked me.

I told her I was ordering my ticket for the Matrix.

Then I got a lil courageous and was like you wanna go.

She said sure.


For how different this is for me is I normally go by myself 90% of the time.

The other 10 percent of the time I go with my friend Matt.

But Matt is a Full time College student and a bit of perfectionist so when he’s in school it’s rare we go together. It doesn’t really bother me I know how hard he works and how much pressure the poor guy puts on himself. I saw it in highschool.  Lol it’s kinda funny how we became friends. Me and him became friend cause our marine science class was full of the popular crowd and they weren’t like mean but like we couldn’t relate to them like at all.

Meanwhile me and him really found the class fascinating and had similar hobbies and we’re considered the smart dorks in the class.

But legit I really felt bad for him when his finals were finished I don’t know what he got on them but I took him out with a few of his friend to see No way home to get him to calm down.

How I knew he was feeling a bit better was I asked him if I needed to watch Far From Home and he texted back and called me a “fucking goofy” 


Any way I have this like annoying issue where I want to do something fun at home but don’t end up doing it.
Like I want to watch a movie  or play a game tonight but instead I’ve stared at the ceiling listening to a song on repeat or like endlessly scrolling the Reddit or Twitter. Or I just decide fuck it let’s go to bed early to then get up earlier then I do said fun thing only to wake up around like 10-12

603,aszil,1640676054,1,"TW: Suicidal ideation/attempt, SA

I went through a nasty divorce, lost my mom to a long battle of encephalitis, and disowned my dad all within the same 3 months a few years ago. My brother and aunt are the only people I consider family, but my aunt never reaches out to me and since my mom got sick, my relationship with my brother has been rocky. Last year I had to end two long standing friendships. I am left with one friend who honestly isn’t a great friend to me, and my cat. 

The holiday seasons are extremely hard for me, as I’m sure for many others. I am in therapy but my T has taken three weeks off for the holidays. I work during every holiday this year but it doesn’t help fill the void. It only intensifies the longing I have for someone to just care about me. I hate that I pity myself for it, but it’s a harsh reality. 

I went back to my abusive ex 3 times this year in a pitiful attempt to feel less lonely. I lied to my T about it each time because I felt ashamed. He SA’d me twice when we dated, not too long after my mom passed away. He was/is extremely manipulative, verbally abusive, and disgusting. I’ve been on and off dating apps for the last year and a half, but they always just want sex. Always. Even when they say they don’t, they lie and try to touch me at the end of the date. Every time. And every time I reject them, they ghost me. 

I don’t feel like I have a hard time making friends. I’ve befriended a few of my coworkers, but they also don’t check up with me, ever, even when I check on them often. Most of the time I get invited to go out somewhere, it seems to be because their other friends said they couldn’t hang, so I was their last option. 

Last night I contemplated s**cide again. I attempted a few years ago, not long before my mom passed away and I was still married. I reluctantly told my brother about it a couple of months later and he said he wouldn’t feel sorry for me, or miss me, if I was successful - because it’s a cheap way to go.  I always told myself he said that as a tactic to make me feel stupid for it (something he feels the need to do often), but I don’t fully believe it. 

The world, reality, all just feels different than it did when my mom was alive and well. It feels like when she died, all the love in the world died with her. I am longing and searching to find a partner who will love me as unconditionally as she did, but I have a harsh belief that this void could never be filled. 

I just want someone to ask me if I’m okay. Someone who actually cares about me and my well-being, safety, and sensitive heart.",lonely,The loneliness grows stronger every year,2021-12-28 18:20:54

But nowadays, every time I would like to fit myself in a certain conversation, or something I would like to ask to, they ignore me. Like I wasn't there or anything. It's makes me completely anxious to the point that I start to ask myself if there is something wrong with me? Maybe I'm not interesting or I'm boring? 

Surely if someone in the chat says ""i'm sad""

a lot of people be like: **""oh that's sad, dm me if you want! ""**, or **""i will help you!""**

But if I'm the one doing it, they'll just continue their conversation, or someone will reply, ""**drama isn't allowed here TALK THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE**""

The thing I thought would make me happy is also the one that made me lonely.

Let the bubbling black consume me, because, honestly, I’m done now. I’m done wondering if I’m good enough and being lied to that I am. I’m done being pursued doggedly and feverishly by one gender, while being ignored almost entirely by the one I’m attracted to. I’m done being told to work on myself. Hot take: everyone is always working on themselves all the time. That’s all life is, a series of days where you work on yourself. Lonely people are not lonely because they aren’t working on themselves. They’re lonely because they have no one to acknowledge and validate  the work they’re already doing/have done. And this makes it even harder to continue that work into the future because…well…what’s the point? So telling a lonely person to work on themselves is a bit like advising a  starving person to drink plenty of water. I mean, I guess it’s not the worst advice, but it’s kind of missing the point. The person is still missing something essential that they need. In the case of a starving person, food. In the case of a lonely person, companionship. I continue to work on myself every day, and every day it gets a little bit harder to keep going. I think I’ve reached my limit. I can’t accept this pain anymore. I reject it, as I have been rejected.

ive tried talking to them about it, and they seem like they understand, but then nothing changes. i cant get an esa because i would only want a dog and they wont let me get one, its non-negotiable. i dont feel comfortable touching them because theyre usually cuddling their partners and it feels like intruding and they never initiate touch with me. i also am a constant 5th wheel because of it.

it take about 5 seconds within meeting for them to whip out their phones, which is fine if they were showing me something i CARED about, but nope just updating instagram. one time my friend had me take pictures of her when we met at a restaurant, and it turned into a whole photo shoot. i told her what she got was fine, but no picture was good enough for her and we spent a good 10-15 minutes on this. THEN when we go to sit down and as i try to make conversation with her, she whips out her phone to post the pictures and spends another 20 minutes picking out which pictures she wanted to post, and what caption she should write. i love and care for her as a person, but i really didn’t care about these pictures and for some reason she thought i did and had me select which ones to post (yet again, she kept obsessing over it because she was convinced they weren’t good enough). clearly OUR needs don’t align at all, and it’s insufferable. and again this is just one person in my life, this is not a “my generation is brain dead cuz phone BAD 😭😭😭”. 

but at this point i feel like i’m going crazy, this is not what i want out of life. i know what i want and i know which direction i’m headed and i can’t seem to get away from this stupid social media pithole. i want friends who mutually don’t give a shit about it and will do things that actually interest me together. try out new places, play video games literally fucking ANYTHING OTHER THAN STARING AT PEOPLE IM ALREADY FORCED TO SEE 7 HOURS 5X A WEEK ON INSTAGRAM i’m so tired of this. always hear “make friends with those who are similar to you” yeah no shit but where the fuck are those people?? it’s damn impossible out here, i have to hangout with these assholes who act cordial to each other’s faces and hype up their instagram posts only to talk shit about them behind their backs. rather sit around this than be alone. but at this point i think i’d rather be alone. but i want people, but to do that i feel like i need social media.

634,thecherryflower,1640663674,1,"I'm a girl (28F) who indulges in a lot of romantic fantasies (I'm chronically single - which I'm trying to put a positive spin on and embrace it instead of dreading it).

Men never choose me. The guys I've liked have all been so cruel and bullied me. It's affected my self-esteem. I resent it when other women complain about their relationships because someone still wanted to be with them regardless of how long they were together and how things ended. Most women don't know the pain of never being wanted, of longing and absence. I've always been overlooked. Men have never looked at me. It was always hard seeing my friends getting attention from guys (even though they constantly assure me that male validation/attention does not add value to your life. It is not important). But again, it's easy for them (and most women) to say that because they, at one point or another, have had people notice them. They've been ""picked"".

Rejection comes in all forms, but, I'm talking about as something as personal as a romantic rejection. Everyone says not to take things personally but its still very painful.

How do I process and deal with it in a healthy way?

I've been dealing with feelings of hurt, disappointment, and even anger. Is this normal?

Earlier this year (I'm 28F and have never been in a relationship) I was introduced to a guy (31M for a courtship with the end goal as marriage, we met through family friends. His mom has always really liked me for her son) and we hit it off when we met. Although I will say that my dad was not happy about it. My dad felt something was not right. He didn't like the guy when my family met him. (he thinks the family is more cheap instead of extremely frugal). We both ended up hitting it off when we met. So this guy wanted my number (it was the first time this happened). He initiated the texts (and I was in awe this was happening because no guy ever had wanted to get to know me before). Things were fine but then he started telling me things like he's robotic and has absolutely no friends (he's in his early 30s) - but only close to his parents and cousin (who is like his older sister). He began grilling me right away about how many kids I wanted, what my ideal family situation looked like, and he wanted to identify areas of conflict in a relationship. I went along with it because I didn't know any better. He asked me if I wanted nannies for children and if the kids should have medications/psychiatrists.

He's very spiritual (prays a lot) and volunteers at animal shelters and horse farms. He enjoyed outdoor activities like hiking and biking (esp. mountain biking) and going to remote locations in other parts of the world to hike there and meet the local population (and I thought this was cool and something I would have loved to have done with him) - but he also kept going on about barebones vacations (which I've never done) and kept emphasizing bargain hunting (he told me I could buy a table for $1000 instead of $20,000 - but I never named any prices - I just told him how lovely it would be to spend some money on decorative items for our home. I've always envisioned a beautiful house once I'm married. There's nothing wrong with wanting nice things, right? I even told him what if wanted to buy a lovely dress (I would need a nice wardrobe for work anyway) to get dolled up for myself and for him too (I think there's nothing wrong with wanting to look nice for your spouse also). But when I said that, he said he has experience with people who do things for appearances sake and he wholeheartedly disagrees with this way of life.

I mentioned that going out to eat once a week (and treating myself off and on with a nice gift, etc.) is something I've always done. That just because I grew up comfortable does not mean that I'm an impulsive buyer/spender. I lived on my own for a few years (while in medical school) and know how to mind and budget money. That family instilled a great respect for money in me. Treating myself is something that I am used to and that I have a right to do. But he said that if he is contributing to the children's college fund while I'm going out to restaurants once a week, there is an imbalance. This was bizarre because I don't think going out for a nice meal once a week would affect the hypothetical children's college fund? He framed it as if it were an ""either-or"" situation. But I pointed out that it doesn't have to be. Why not do both? I did mentioned that going out and treating yourself is healthy. It's something else we could do to spend time together and connect along with hiking/biking/anything else he wanted to do. I did also mentioned that I go out with my parents often and am pampered by them - I didn't mean ""pampered"" in a waiting on me hand and foot kind of way, but spending quality with him, saying and doing thoughtful/loving things. Things were fine up until then and he said he would get back to me (we were texting back and forth everyday) but then I didn't hear from him for 4-5 days which made me upset. When he came back, he reiterated all the points in the previous paragraph and said he was concerned about my expectations of being pampered by a future partner. (I had even made my wants smaller and suggested going out twice a month if that would work. He wasn't receptive to that.)

So when I replied, I reiterated all my points adding to the fact that this money thing seemed like something was unwilling to compromise on, like it was a non-negotiable. I asked him to help me understand him and to give me the same grace, that could find an option that worked for us both. I told him that I really liked him and how willing/open I was to make this work (I really was trying).

He did mentioned that while he was growing up, his family was hand to mouth and he never wanted to be hungry for money ever again. But he ended up doing well for himself. He makes 200K+ per year and owns 3 homes (he works at the intersection of IT/finances). I didn't understand why me wanting to spend my money was a big deal - I even suggested a ""mine, yours, and ours"" financial arrangement. It's perfectly normal to want to treat yourself or go for a hard-earned vacation, etc. right? I mentioned that he appeared to have an unhealthy relationship with money, which I found unsettling. I also pointed out that he didn't tell me what happened in his last relationship (ended over a year ago and lasted 2 years). He briefly glossed over it and didn't tell me what happened. So I said we could always talk about it later if/when he felt comfortable talking about it. I even gave him a way out and asked if getting to know each other was what he really wanted?

He replied immediately and said he believed my concerns should not be minimized and promised no more excuses and said it was clear that I deserved attention, respect, and respect with the level of communication. He said he felt very lucky to have met me. That I'm genuine and amazing. Possess strength of character, integrity to stand up for my beliefs, and the ability to be myself (which is what he was looking for in a partner). He said that he did not wish to cloud my unsettled feelings with sweet nothings. He said he really does enjoy talking with me and hoped I felt the same about him.

I told him I did. That I did feel the same way. And I really meant every word. So I just reiterated my previous points about the concerns I had (about his views about money and the previous relationship) and said I was eager to keep getting to know him. I also asked him what made him want to pursue marriage/a relationship at this point in time. I asked him to be upfront/honest with me about everything (as I have been with him) rather than me thinking he's hiding something. I said I really wanted to keep getting to know him.

I didn't hear from him again for 3 days.

Then when he came back, he ended it with me and I was left feeling devastated. Like something was dangled and then taken away from me. I was so fond of him. Very fond of him. There was so much more I wanted to know about him and now I will never get the chance to. I found out later (a few months later) that his mom was basically shopping him around and looking for other prospects for him which made me upset and feel bad. My parents keep telling me I didn't miss out on much and I shouldn't need trouble convincing myself. It sucks though. I knew we were basically incompatible (with our lifestyles), but, I wasn't asking for much at all. I wanted to demonstrate to him that I absolutely could be a loving, respectful, communicative, and gracefully-allowing partner. It really hurt. Around the time when he broke it off with me, his dad was diagnosed with cancer. (He was taking good care of his dad those few months he had left). Then his dad passed away 3 months ago. I felt sad to hear that.

A couple weeks ago, my parents went over to his house to pay their respects (his mom, older brother, and older brother's fiancee were there also). He and his older brother do not get along at all. My parents noticed that. His older brother owns a home in another city and goes out to eat at nice places and travels a lot.

So apparently (the guy I was talking to) he saw my parents and didn't even want to talk to them. He ended up leaving the house. I felt so bad when I heard that. When my mom came home she said, ""Yeah...he cut you off cold turkey. I don't think he was as nice as he presented himself to be.""

Still, I felt bad when I heard that.

But she told me to work as hard as I can on my exams, get residency, live my amazing life and shine bright. He didn't deserve me, she says.

Now there's obviously nothing wrong with living in a small house. My mom said their home was like a relic - it's 50 years old. And his dad who passed away, he was the manager of the IRS (so he was doing well for himself financially). I think unfortunately, it was more selfish penny-pinching/being cheap that he subjected his family to instead of not actually having the means. His mom worked (and still does) also.

Despite the obvious discrepancies, I feel sad. I really wanted to see him again.

It didn't last long but I was hoping that I'd continue to learn about him and get to know him. There was so much more I wanted to know. I was left feeling very sad and confused. But now I have to keep focusing on my own life (and right now, that's passing my board exams so I can get into a medical residency program) - a little bit of background, I graduated medical school (in 2019 - and I struggled so much. I failed many exams and even had to repeat a year in school. I'm studying to retake one of my board licensing exams I need for a medical residency. My goal is to be a child psychiatrist. That's my biggest dream. I also have many other dreams as well! To publish a book, start a podcast, paint/sculpture, calligraphy, learn languages, flower-pressing, flower design (making flower garlands/crowns/wreaths/bouquets), cooking/baking, candle-making, etc.

I've been working on myself: Truly prioritizing self-love (which I want to carry into the new year). I lost over 30 lbs this year (working on being the healthiest version of me), and really honing in on my spirituality. I've been going to Church a lot more and spending time in the Bible. It has helped A LOT. God is healing the parts of me that need to be healed. But there are days when I will get tear-eyed and struggle emotionally.

I feel so sad because it really seemed like after this rough patch that things would progress between us. He didn't even give me the chance to show him who I could be. I wanted to truly know him and spend time with him. It bothers me so much. I always wonder what could have been. There are days when feelings of anger and sadness just rise up. I stay in prayer a lot and I try to use these feelings as motivation to improve my own life but there are days when I struggle.

Marriage is a vocation I absolutely hope to be called to one day. It's a desire of my heart. To help with my sadness and grief, I indulge a lot in romantic fantasies - I've been reading this fanfiction about Hades and Persephone. I identify a lot with the main character in the story (she's studying to be a doctor, loves flowers, very attached to her mother, had a sheltered upbringing, etc.) Sometimes...I imagine there's a handsome king of the underworld who is admiring me from afar (he first saw me at a spring festival) and wants to make me the queen of his ""kingdom"" so to speak. He'd be handsome, strong, steadfast, generous, etc. I'd fill his heart with life, love, and light. He'd show me all the magical lands and creatures of his realm. He'd encourage me to want to wear beautiful gowns/fine clothes, decorate our home however I'd like, and spend time in our gardens so that I may make as many flower crowns, garlands, and beautiful bouquets to my heart's content!

642,jessjessrevolution,1640662619,1,"No reason to sugar coat it, I'm close to my breaking point.  I'm a 27M and at this time I am struggling immensely with loneliness to the point where I am throwing everything away.  I wont lie i've been desperate for a relationship for a long time, but now its gotten to the point where that desperation is getting the best of me and I know it shows.  I've truly feel as though I have no way out of this situation.  This is not even a throw away account, I just don't care anymore.

Where I was:

I work hard to be the best version of myself.  I constantly put myself in uncomfortable situations to help me grow as a person.  I have a great career that I do really well at.  I take care of my physical health and keep an active lifestyle.  I've find awesome hobbies and creative outlets that I am super passionate about and dump a lot of time into.

Where I am now:

I'm drinking almost everyday, started taking substances, given up on maintaining my physical health, have nearly jeopardized my career and have lost some of the few friendships I did have.

I find more and more that my mind is operating with this perspective of not caring if I lose everything.  Almost as if I am blaming my pursuit for what I have accomplished in life for ultimately putting me in this situation in the first place.  I've done nearly everything that has been suggesting on this sub.  I've gone to meetups, joined groups, joined classes like improv, gone to social events, joined group sports, and even have gone out alone and tried talking to random strangers on multiple occasions.  All that and I'm still in the same place I've always been, alone.  I know where I fall short, but I also know I can't be perfect and always try to put my best foot forward when given the chance.  There just haven't been a whole lot of chances.  I guess theres many conclusions I could draw from that, most of which are negative.

It's also worth mentioning that I do struggle with mental health and have been diagnosed with a few disorders ever since I was a kid.  I go to therapy on a weekly basis and have seen several therapist this year alone.  I am also back on meds.  Just wanted to mention that I am getting help, but then again I have been for over half my life and i'm still here in the same place.

643,lonelyinlove121,1640662584,1,"In my early 20s I was a very lonely young man and had no friends. I hit my lowest point when I was 22. I had just started my first job out of college and I was walking home from work one afternoon. I remember vividly, the sunset which cast the street in a golden hue. Very suddenly, I was hit with a deep, soul-aching sense of loneliness. I felt isolated and alone, as though I was on the verge of tears that wouldn't come.

This sudden and unexpectedly intense feeling lasted for quite a while until a couple years had passed. I was 24 when, one day, I met a young lady (F 18) who I'll call Sophie. We were introduced by a mutual acquaintance as she wanted some technical assistance. As I was assisting her, we struck up a conversation and decided to keep in touch.

Over the following months, we occasionally chatted about topics which became increasingly personal: family, religion, relationships, and so on. She was an inquisitive individual, who was trying to make sense of adulthood and being a bit older, I did my best to give her advice.

Over the next couple of years, we would hang out once every few months. Around this time, I made a couple other friends closer to my age. Unintentionally, I found myself spending less time with Sophie and more time with them. We still kept in contact, though infrequently, until I managed to balance my relationship with Sophie and my other friends. They weren't interested in hanging out with her because of her age, so I spent time with her separately.

As time progressed, Sophie and I became close friends. We supported each other through challenging situations:  breakups, ill health, family issues... We've had arguments, apologised and made amends, and challenged each other to become better. It has been a wonderful 8 years of friendship. Now I'm 32 and about to embark on the next step of my career, and she's 26 and recently accepted an opportunity to move abroad and work.

I'm incredibly happy for her as I know this will lead to her personal growth and a wealth of opportunities to further her career. I'll miss her terribly. Her companionship liberated me from my loneliness, and her support helped me through some very difficult times in my adult life. In turn, I was glad that I could be there to reciprocate everything that she has done for me. 

Perhaps something this wonderful was never meant to last. A very small, yet selfish, part of me wishes that she would stay. But I know that in order for her to grow and progress to the next stage of her journey, she must leave and embark on the self-discovery and development that comes with living in another country. 

It's possible that this process could change her profoundly and, in a way, that scares me. The possibility that if we encounter each other in the future, we would be so different from who we once were that we might find it difficult to reconnect. 

On an intellectual level, I know that fearing the inevitable is foolish. I'm no stranger to losing friends through geographical separation, but it doesn't get easier. If I've learned a lesson, it's to cherish the moments spent with the ones we care about. Take nothing for granted.",lonely,Dealing with the loneliness of losing a friend,2021-12-28 14:36:24

648,zotter23,1640659788,1,"Mid 20's guy, virgin with depression. Don't know what to do anymore.

I don't know where to start. Ever since the 10th grade, I've been sad most of the time. I am someone with friends, but is not so close to my family. So, I guess the fact that I've never had a relationship hurts really bad since I could use that support. Now, i'm in medical school in a suburb, thousands of miles away from home. I spend most of my time studying, but still use dating apps and party on occasion.

Ironically, I am confident in things such as my looks. I'm social, and you'd never guess I had these problems. But, I am only physically attracted to individuals who are pretty good looking (i'm bisexual, which I've come to terms with at this point. Only out to close friends back home). Sexually, I am more attracted to men, emotionally to woman (this alone causes me problems). However, a lot of gay men I come across on the apps aren't my type. I'm more into masculine guys, something I cannot control. There is nothing wrong with other types of guys, just not my type.

Even when I find someone I'm attracted to, I end up not being able to pull it off and it hurts. Worst part is, someone I’ve liked since high school (a girl), who is also a good childhood friend of mine, lives back home, and has started hanging out with my friends. She's interested in some of them, and flirts with them. It makes me sick to my stomach. When I lived at home for a year, I at one point got her to like me (I would find this out later). Long story short, I blew it. I cannot stop thinking about it. She doesn't know I'm a virgin (I lie to her), but I'm scared it'll come up when she's with my friends. This gives me so much anxiety. And theres nothing I can do, i'm so far away. I feel like I have nothing to live for. I just go with the motions, with nothing really driving me. All I have is medicine, my friends, and my physical health. I have very little affection in my life, and honestly, I crave it. I have read about this thing called ""skin hunger"", and I check off all the symptoms. My heart is just so empty, I have nothing to ground me and little support. Friends are great, but really its not enough. I need more from my life.

I see people living normal, young adult lives. Going on dates, hang out with other couples, go on vacations together, etc. Or just have a quiet date night. I want all that so badly, it hurts my studying significantly. I'm afraid I'll never have a happy ending, and ill be that 40 year old guy living alone, bothering my friends to hang out when they're with their families. Worth noting I am in therapy and take antidepressants. I am so incredibly sad all the time, I just want it to stop. Some would say I'm picky, which may be true, but I honestly would date a lot of the girls many of my friends end up with. So it looks like I'm not that picky I guess.

659,Comprehensive-Fig985,1640658146,1,"I met my girlfriend in March 2021. The first 5 months were great. Full of dates, cuddles, eye gazing and enjoying the little things like book collecting, buying each other new shoes to see who can run faster, and road tripping to restaurants that turned out to be closed. I've enjoyed every moment with her ever since I met her. 
But seemingly overnight, the intimacy disappeared from her. She gets awkward and shys away when I try making love. Most conversations end with her saying the equivalent of ""damn that's crazy"". And she doesn't open my messages half the time till 5+ hours later.
A very drastic change in pace.
I talked to her about it. She claims she still loves me, that I haven't done anything wrong, she's just getting burnt out and wants to slow it down.
I think she's sugar coating it. I don't think she's attracted to me anymore like I am to her. I want to be with someone who wants to be with me equally. But I love her so much, she's done so much for my mental and emotional health I don't want to give up on her yet. But if I do MORE and go above and beyond to earn the attraction back, I feel like I'm just running face first into an inevitable break up because that goes directly against what she wants. I don't want to be alone. Am I stupid for staying with someone that doesn't want me because it beats being alone?

I enjoy doing the things I want when I want, and not having to worry about sculpting my day around someone else’s needs. I’m an anxious person and highly sensitive, so as I’m working full time in the week my weekend hours free are incredibly precious to me and are the only time I feel I can recharge.

However the awkward juxtapose of that is sometimes I really crave friendship and social interaction that just doesn’t seem possible these days. I left school young and went to work straight away in an environment just filled with middle aged people. My friends from school stayed on and did college, and so made lots of lasting friendships with people their own age. So I’m kind of left with ‘friends’ that I wouldn’t feel comfortable confiding in, people I feel like I’m bothering if I message or ask to meet up. Everything just feels so awkward and like a facade. I can’t remember the last time I had an irl friendship that just felt natural and laid back. Probably when I was a kid!

And then there’s the other part of it where a really uncomfortable dating experience this year has left me feeling like maybe I won’t even ever find my person. Like I said, I like my time and space but when my ex used to want to meet up - I never ever wanted to see him. I now realise it’s because I never actually liked him and just agreed to dating because he showed me a fleck of interest… which was wrong, and I shouldn’t have done that to myself or him. At the start I thought my feelings would change, and I would like it but I never did. So it has got me worrying that maybe I won’t ever find a person who I wouldn’t think twice about dropping everything for. Someone who makes me feel so in love I could forget about my precious few hours gaming. I want that life that every one else just seems to take for granted. I’m tired of being questioned why I don’t have a partner and why I’m not out with friends.

A friend and I started a self-experiment 2 months ago: 7 days in paradise.(7Dip). This is how it goes:

The participants think about how a week would look like in which they do all the things they have always wanted to do/that make them happy. So they try to live in paradise for 7 days straight without worrying.
After the 7 days, participants should be able to better reflect on their own lives up to that point and decide what they need to do to always stay in paradise.

1)What is 7 Days in Paradise
7DiP is a self-experiment designed to help you find happiness.
The participants think about how a week would look like in which they do all the things they have always wanted to do/that make them happy. So they try to live in paradise for 7 days without worrying.
After the 7 days, participants should be able to better reflect on their own lives up to that point and decide what they need to do to always stay in paradise.

There are 4 rules for 7DiP. These are to prevent falling back into old patterns.
Do not compete with others
Suppress the desire to be loved
Suppress the desire to be accepted
Do not think about the future

I'd say it helped me a lot , because I have finally found my passion in cooking again. Many others in my circle of friends have also tried it and given positive feedback.
That's why I created a discord server to have a community for people who also want to try it out!

I’ve failed, and continuously fail to make meaningful and strong bonds and relationships with people. For example, I had a pretty nice “squad” with three other friends - so it stung a little when I saw another guy hanging out with them in my stead, and none of them ever gave me an invite. I’m usually the interchangeable/extra/replaceable person in a group.

Sure, i can’t match people’s energy at outings - I keep to myself and enjoy others’ presence - so maybe that makes me seem antisocial? But I’ve always reached out to people I’d like to call friends to check up on them. It stings when they don’t respond or reciprocate my efforts at friendship.

For the record, I’m not out here saying “the world sucks” and all that. I’m just venting. I recognise that I’m probably uninteresting, pessimistic and/or low-energy. Still stings that if I were gone tomorrow, people outside family wouldn’t really miss me.",lonely,Dumb venting,2021-12-28 06:56:02

731,tootyfruitpootyboot,1640625052,1,"Some background info: I *might* have BPD. Starting therapy as soon as possible, but it's been mentioned to me in the past from a therapist when I was 18 years old (I'm 39F). I'm hoping someone here might be able to help; I posted this over on a BPD subreddit but no one has replied &amp; it's going on 16 hours now, so here goes nothing.

I met someone on a dating app for ppl on the spectrum just over 2 weeks ago. We hit it off immediately, confirmed we wanted to meet asap (they live out of state, less than 6 hours away), and confirmed we care about each other a lot &amp; only want to see each other.

Then on Christmas Eve, after sending me a quick text saying they were caught up at work with no idea when they would get off work &amp; would text me later that evening, they, well.. Stopped talking to me completely. I sent about 2 messages wishing him a Merry Christmas Eve later that night, and a Merry Christmas message the next day. Just cute &amp; sweet messages, short, saying I hoped that he was having a great day &amp; to enjoy the holiday, and that I missed him &amp; hoped to talk to him soon, whenever he was free from work &amp; holiday obligations, if any.

I checked their Reddit account around 5 pm today (they told me their username when we first started chatting, but I don't follow them) &amp; they were actively commenting on 2 separate gaming subreddits right after they would prob be done with work.

They mentioned before they usually don't like talking to anyone, but that I was different, and that they were shocked as a result. They also mentioned they get overwhelmed this time of year, especially bc their work (tech support) gets extremely busy.

I also went back onto the dating app (first time ever using one) &amp; it showed they were listed as single &amp; still looking for a relationship. I'm not sure if they just never went back there &amp; changed their status, etc, but I'm concerned no less.

I panicked (as ppl with BPD, etc often do in these situations) &amp; messaged him asking about it, if we were OK, if it was a mistake, if he still cared, if I did something wrong, etc. I sent about 6 50 sec voice messages also (you can only send 50-60 secs on text vm's), hoping to better communicate/reach him (I communicate best verbally). No yelling, swearing, etc. Nothing even really accusatory, but obv worried &amp; sad/upset. Calm voice, etc.

One time a week prior he shutdown when I got upset over him not being really communicative &amp; perceived him as being insensitive, when I mentioned I was feeling very overwhelmed &amp; depressed about moving soon, feeling lonely, just venting a bit really. He wouldn't respond/talk to me for about 2 days when that happened. I apologized, asked if he could forgive me, and he said yes, and that he had planned on talking to me the next a.m. probably (his words). He said normally he completely goes cold, shuts down, and basically never talks to them again.

I'm very recently (self-diagnosed) autistic; He was officially diagnosed by a doctor at age 10.

I'm too afraid to post this over on one of the dating subreddits, so for now, what do you think I should do? Should I give up &amp; accept that he's never going to talk to me again? Any others here that are either on the spectrum &amp; potentially also have BPD, or dating/married to someone who is (past or present) who can offer any insight or advice? Does this potentially sound like stonewalling/love-bombing/future-faking, even? For reference, he told me he never sees himself ever wanting anyone else, that I'm the most beautiful woman in his eyes, that he never wants to lose me, etc.

I'm.. Heartbroken. I've been crying, restless, unable to function, eat properly.. And I feel like it's my fault. But.. is it? I just don't know anymore. I just want him back. I just want this hurt to end.

I start a job or something, pretend for a while, move away and delete all social media and everything to start over again. Done that cycle over and over again. Not exactly happy with it, but it really is the least shitty option for me personally. I guess being around people generally just makes me feel more alone than when I’m actually by myself. 

I did know one person once though, that didn’t make me feel like that. A girl I used to work with, we became friends pretty quickly and I guess we just had good chemistry or something. But I guess because my brain doesn’t know how to handle that, doesn’t have experience with genuine kindness, it went ahead and mistook it for love. But I knew the love was one sided so I never said anything. Then the love got ugly, turned to obsession. I tried to push her away because being around her was bad for me, but she didn’t really let me. Could’ve tried harder I guess, but part of me didn’t want to lose her either, even though I knew it would’ve been better for us both.

Long story short, I had a suicide attempt, a severe bout of self-harming and she kept supporting me through it for some reason.

It was pathetic and it absolutely made things weird between us. She said we could still be friends, but I could tell it would never be the same as it was. 

Went through the whole push and pull thing of blocking her number and then unblocking it, wanting her gone, to wanting things to go back to how they were before. And it really didn’t help that she’d text me out of the blue once a month on average, making me think she still wanted some form of communication with me. Even left her on read for a full month only to have her come back with “good talk” after all that time. But the conversations also weren’t like they were before, used to text for hours and now I couldn’t get more than 5 replies before she was gone for another month. I was so confused about what she wanted, why she’d text first only to seem uninterested in actually talking. I know I should’ve ended it, walked away, but I guess I still didn’t know what I really needed. 

Anyway, fast forward to now and it’s been seven months since she texted. Our last conversation, she texted me first and then left me on read not long after. Then nothing. Guess I also had the discipline to not engage her again. I still wasn’t sure if she was done with me yet though, I figured the real test would be to see if she sends me a merry Christmas text. She’s done it every year since we met, so I figured if she didn’t do it this year, then I’d know. And low and behold, Christmas came and went and no text. Part of me felt relieved but part of me is absolutely fucked. Just gutted. 

And as if it was a fucking sign, the second of the two goldfish she bought me died last night. First one died last month, but it was clearly sick for about a week beforehand. This one seemed fine, right up until Christmas Day, I shit you not. And the next day, it just died. Not only that, but it actually swam up into the little plastic flowers that were in there, sort of cone shaped ones, so they were like little cups and it  sat itself inside the flower and a few hours later it was cupped in there on its side, not breathing. All I could think about was that scene from Half-Blood Prince where Slughorn talks about his goldfish disappearing the day Lily Potter died. 

I normally don’t buy into shit like this, and I do mostly think it was still just a coincidence, but man, something about the poetic imagery of that fishes death, dying in the flower like it did, at the exact time I realised my friendship was finally dead too. It’s just fucking rocked me. I thought I’d be mostly relieved when she stopped taking to me, but it hurt so much more than I thought it would. I guess she’s still the only person I’ve ever been able to connect with, so even though I know it’s better this way, it’s still depressing to think I don’t have anyone else in my life at all. But fuck it, I’ll get over it, guess I just needed to vent because of how weird of a coincidence the fish thing was.",lonely,"My fish died today, and I don’t normally buy into this shit, but it felt eerily symbolic",2021-12-28 01:57:37

760,MrAizawaHead,1640604527,1,"Everyday I wake up seems to just get more difficult to deal with, I don’t know why I’m saying this hear, but it’s probably because I know deep down I need help that either my friends don’t want to care about, or take too long to act up it. I am currently attending university and I’ve met a great group of friends, but in person in particular caught my eye, let’s call her Jenny (not real name), she always wanted to spend time with me and we always message each other everyday, even about little things, we are pretty close and to top that, if she has any food she always offers me first, I always really liked Jenny, and I have a crush on her, although I doubt she likes me back in that way. 

The hardest part to deal with is that she’s gotten more distant lately due to personal reasons I’m unaware about, so one of the only people who bring a little joy in my life is moving away, this is most likely temporary, but talking to her is the highlight of my day, and now it’s became less frequent. 

The problem is is that I usually talk to Jenny when I have mental health issues, which is quite often, and she takes a long time to respond to messages, so it doesn’t really help that much anymore, I don’t like being by myself but Jenny makes me feel happy for once, it’s like if you take a child’s favourite toy away from them, they’re going to be upset.

The worst thing though is that I vent this emotion through the use of poetry, and these poems get very dark, and there are quite a few to say the least, I’ll not post them here because I doubt anyone wants to read them, and they’re pretty long, this post has already taken up too much of your time already, although I doubt it’ll be read.

I just don’t want to be alone anymore, I need my friends but I feel like they don’t need me, I’m the one who checks if everyone is okay, but only a few people care how I feel, and one of those is Jenny, it feels selfish to say, but I wish people checked up on me more often, because for the most part, no one ever does.",lonely,Crushing Loneliness,2021-12-27 22:28:47

I grew up with many older brothers who always said I can't date at such a young age and should wait until my late twenties/thirties. They have guns and and be very protective. I never tried forming relationships with guys because I knew it would not lead to anything just because of that. All of my brothers have been in multiple relationships and have their significant others sleep over but my parents and other brothers are very controlling of who I meet and scare off anyone that I want to be remotely friends withand bring over.

This has made me never form relationship skills and I don't even know how to communicate with the opposite sex- almost like a disability. I am sick of being controlled. I am lonely most of the time because my brothers are not even nice to me. This has caused me to develop anger issues and I look at girls my age with their boyfriends that hug and do things with them,,, meanwhile I have not had a hug in probably 4 years. I feel sad because I am going to college soon and most of my friends talk about their boyfriends and I can't even relate to them. I just don't know what to do. I am proud of how good of a student I am- I get a 4.0 and have several jobs, but feel like that area of my life is lacking and feel empty in the evenings and night when my mind has nothing to think about.  yes I have wanted to kill myself before and had depressive episodes.

782,StardustTendency,1640591103,1,"Was lonely throughout all of HS, fearing parents and judgement. Watched the first girl I truly liked get taken by one of my new friends at the time, forcing me to treat it as my guarded secret for years. Watched them make out next to my locker powerless to say or do anything, afraid of losing my friends. Neat.

In covid online college, met a girl in an extracurricular project, began a months long romantic buildup, real techno flirting. She listened to my venting, I asked about her life, I felt like she cared, we admitted we liked each other, met up in person with everyone, hugged all evening, I was in heaven thinking I finally got what I wanted, and that I could love and cherish her. Cute.

Days later, summer rolls around, she drops me over text. Turns out I was basically given false hope for weeks as she figured out her feelings at my expense. She then proceeded to have a fun filled ""hot girl summer"" and now has a committed boyfriend while totally forgetting my existence. I feel abandoned and betrayed, yet ""officially"" kept the peace and pretended to be ok for my own sake, and it still really hurts at times. Cool.

Now here I am, shackled by covid measures, filled with bitterness knowing my chance at a cute mutual first love with a girl I actually like is basically shot thanks to my age. Even if I find a girl that cares about me, I know it's probably just a matter of time till I get burned. Add that to the curse of likely being the inexperienced one in the relationship and knowing she's done all this and more before. And the curse of wanting something real deep down. Awesome. 

My only solace is work, where I feel valued and wanted (damn it man). There's a cute girl who gives me signs working in a position across from me. If she wasn't a fellow employee, I'd ask her out. But my hands are tied by the payroll, as I'm pretty sure it flies right in the face of code of conduct. Splendid.

Lastly, some people keep telling me to try Tinder. I have several issues with this. a) Commodification b) Its well known algorithmic strategy to make me pay for good matches c) I'm confident, but not enough to believe I'll do well there. No final decision yet on the matter.

I guess I just wanted to vent that to people who understand the mind-rending loneliness, and not my coupled up friends who mean well but won't ever get it (and I hope they never have to get it)",lonely,My depressing historical vent,2021-12-27 18:45:03

I'm Transgender(mtf), and pansexual. So rejection is constant.

Seemingly destined to be unattractive(badly overweight, freaky tall, and built like a linebacker.) 

I'm poor, my family never had much, and I Couldn't and still can't afford to go to college so I got a crap job.

Interests range from niche to wildly esoteric

Untrusting and anxious when engaging with new people due to a life time of traumatic experiences in my youth.

Live with parents out of necessity

Negative world view due to past experiences, and Defensive due to bullying. So I come off as ill tempered and abrasive. Even though I try not to be.

The few Friends I have seem to tolerate me out of kindness, instead of enjoying my presence.

Why does it always feel like when things are going great with someone one week, the next week they seem cold towards me. This happens everytime I talk to someone new and in a blink of an eye they seem distant and I’m left here wondering what I’ve done. I obviously won’t ask if anything is because I don’t want to come off as clingy and I have to play it cool like it doesn’t bother me when  in reality it does (in the past I’ve asked and they’ve taken offence to it and told me to chill) My mind starts to wonder, “is there someone else?” “Am I annoying?” “Is it something I said?” “Did they not like my picture?”. And it’s always me that has to initiate the conversation or else it won’t happen. Maybe I’m reading too much into but it happens all.the.damn.time and I’m so sick of it.

What’s wrong with me?

Update: so I bit the bullet to initiate the conversation today.

Sure, the world makes it seem like socializing is a necessity, and yes, we are innately social creatures; which makes this time of year, where everywhere you look are plastered congregations of smiling faces and “holiday cheer”, particularly difficult. But the truth is, all you need is yourself and a greater purpose. Personally, I haven’t had any type of relationship with another human (except my mom and coworkers) for almost 6 years, and at first I felt forlorn and spent my time ruminating on better days and what-if’s. What helped me tremendously was meeting and rescuing my cat, Mika, in 2016, who would’ve died in a dumpster, sick and hungry had I not found her. Nurturing her, with the knowledge that she relied on me for everything, helped give me a reason to want to live and further *help myself* so I could better *help her.* In the midst of that self-realization, I also discovered a fervent love for working in the field of physical therapy for the same principle, helping others while fulfilling a greater purpose. Correspondingly, the past few years I’ve discovered true peace in being alone and find myself caring less, and less, and less what the status quo behooves and I just do what makes me happy. I go to the gym, take myself out to eat, walk around my neighborhood while feeding the kitties and puppers, read in the park, listen to music/nap while on a work break or just chill at home— me, myself, and I. Don’t get me wrong, I *do* hope to one day find a friend who sees me for me (maybe even a gf *gasp*), but I’m not forcing the issue, and certainly am not allowing outside opinions/expectations to dictate my emotional state. Being alone is difficult, but it makes you strong. It forces you to look inwards and ask the big questions, and if you’re able to answer them, you’ll gain new life. 

I challenge everyone here: Before succumbing to the woes of loneliness, first get to know yourself. You’re with you every moment of your life. Who are you? Why are you here? Do you love yourself and what you stand for? What impact do you have the ability to make? The implications of your answers will shape your mind for the rest of your days.  For me it was my cat, and learning that I can actually stand people if I’m helping them convalesce. What is it for you? 

If you’ve read this far, know that you are loved. **I** love you because I was you. You are never alone because you walk with yourself; and if that’s not enough some days, you got all of us here on this sub.

896,Slouma-Gamer,1640536965,1,"There was me , a year and a half ago , a young talented boy that made it to university through hard work and through so many hardships and struggles from family issues to social ones , until i fell in love with a girl that studies with me , to be honest at first i didnt even like the idea of falling for someone , it all began because my parents got divorced so you could say i had a trauma of any relationship , but this girl was different , all i could see is just my life there , my hope and all i believed for . I started contacting her and talking with her at first and things went smoothly but little did i know what i was signing up for ... Anyway after a few consecutive dates i asked her out and it was hard for me to do so , coming from someone who was lonely and socially shy all his life , but she finally accepted even though at first she didn't because her ex dumped her ... And if only i didn't get so clingy to her and emotionally attached things would turn out to be quite different but whatever . Anyway , we studied together , ate together , and things escalated so quickly to the point of me wanting to marry her , i did my utmost best to make her and keep her happy and i did , and even like any relationships we had some few ups and downs but that didnt stop us from loving each other . And to those reading this so far : bear in mimd i was so traumatized from my past experiences that i feared she might leave me and she promised me she would not , and i trusted her , i believed her to my heart and just kept on going with her .
Around 7 months in , i met her family members and they got to know me and i gave my word for them that i will always protect her , and things went so perfect for the both of us until she started getting depressed : her two precious family members died and she felt too heart broken , that didnt stop me from supporting her through these hard times , i even worked twice as hard as before in both college and outside to maintain the balance ...
summer came in , and since i wanted our families to go out and have fun and forget all the hard times we went through we decided to go in a summer vacation . Me and her booked everything out , and our families took care of the rest and the day came in and we went ahead and had our most memories in the beach and somewhere new .
At the end of this vacation i got hit with covid 19 , so we decided to go back home early than expected , man i wished things would have never happened , for me to be so emotionally invested and attached to her made everything afterward so hard to keep even living . So long story short , we went home and i kept myself isolated so that i can get back on my feet and see her again , but she kept me company through all that time and i was so thankful for that ... 
And now comes the most awaited part : one day , in morning , i still remember it to this day , she called me out of nowhere saying we should break up .. I was like what hold on you gotta be kidding me ? why and why would you want that ? she said at that time it was because she wanted to focus on her career amd studies and her sick mother , and i told her i'm with you , and she declined and insisted on breaking up ... I was left demolished , as what i have been constructing so far collapsed entirely , tears wouldn't stop dropping no matter what i did , i couldnt sleep , she doesnt wanna pick up the phone anymore , she blocked me from all social medias , i was left with nothing ... And i remembered that on august , we will have a course in robotics ( because of her family members dying on her she dropped out the semester and failed the year , and i thought of her so i said to her at that time we can apply and at least have something out of this shitty year ) , i was left with that hope until that day came in , and man oh man the cold stare of her eyes , she didnt even say anything to me , she just ignored my entire existance , and that made me collapse , i left the course the first hour , i cried in the stare , why would someone i loved so hard do me dirty like this ? why would she betray me ? why didnt she stick to her oaths and promises even though we made it clear the first day that we arent playing around and that the whole thing is serious .... I contacted my father that day and i said to go speak with her , that was my last resort . After he did and convince her out , she came to me - and at that time i was with her aunt talking about our relationships and her aunt loved me , she knew i was a good person and that this drama would settle down but that didnt seem to be the case - and we talked alone while my father and her aunt and mother went to the car , she said to me things arent working out for her and that our goals are separated , and that she wished me the best and thats all , i begged and begged her to stay , i was literally drowning in tears in the street while she didnt even care and just sticked with her decision that to end things up .... 
To this day , i'm in severe depression and didnt continue my studies as i quitted university , everything doesnt seem to entertain me no matter what i have or do , and even with the professional help such as psy doctor helping me out with the medecines and stuff i still cant forget her , people tell me to move on and focus on myself only but easier said than done , easier said for anyone who didnt have any problem and certainly things he had traumas about ... And to see her through my friends accounts - sharing the stuff related to her club she was in - doing absolutely fine and scoring the top 3 best student ... I was like why did this happen to me and why do i deserve such hell ... The kind hearted ones can't live in this world , no one can , and to think i found my soul mate .. How foolish i was , and despite all that , i sent my friend over to speak with her about me and why she did that to me and the truth came in like this : "" tbh i didnt like the guy at all at first , but since he was so clingy and pushy i thought maybe things will work out for us , but now i don't think so so i cut him off , and also i do have a boyfriend right now and we are doing pretty good ""
Yes as you heard , that last line hunts me even to this day , the wholesome and the kind hearted me no longer exist anymore , and god knows if i'll be able to move on or get up from this disaster ...

Thank you for all of you who have read my story so far , feel free to say whatever you want too , i'm so lonely after all ^^""",lonely,my whole story life,2021-12-27 03:42:45
897,Whyquestionwow44,1640536964,1,"Well all my life I've only been able to connect to people online since I have severe social anxiety it's easier for me.But everyone I've gotten to know always leaves me in the end and I'm so fucking tired of it all I want is someone to stay. I keep having bad thoughts about all of this like dark thoughts and anxiety thoughts like I don't matter and such.

I have a secondary reddit account just for a subreddit for finding gaming friends and I have spent months of trying to find someone.I have talked to 100s of people but no one wants to stick around untill I found this one guy.

The most recent person is someone who I actually feel in love with cuz we are very similar even our names it was like I found a better version of myself.Well we where dating for about a month all was going good. But on the last day of school before the Christmas break and which is also when I graduated early from school. So at that point I had 3 things I've always wanted in life I had a job I was done with school and I had a boyfriend I was very happy. Well i got online and he just broke up with me and wanted to just be friends and I freaked out I pushed him away and blocked him but the next day I texted him and unblocked said sorry I freaked out and I know what I did was horrible but he had just been ghosting me since and I think I have no chance to ever talk to him again and it's killing me. It's another person who left me but this time it's my fault and I just love him so much.

So now I am really struggling being alone. I don't usually wake up in the middle of the night but recently I tend to wake up 3-5 times at night while I was dreaming about the mistakes I made. All I can think about is suicide at this point. On Christmas I made a plan to stay home and hurt myself but my mom started crying and such since she knew I wasn't doing good and didn't want to spend Christmas without me so she stayed and it stopped that. But I just feel so lost and out of it all the time now I hate myself and what I've done to have all these people but him especially leave me. I just wanted some to help make me happy and someone to talk to but it's gone now and I don't know how to just keep going.",lonely,I don't know how to go on anymore,2021-12-27 03:42:44

902,Actual-Chicken3624,1640534770,1,"So here's my intro

23 years old, very few friends, permanently rejected, still a virgin, lonely as fuck. I never knew why that was since people always kept telling nice things about me. Ever since i turned 18 i kept trying my best to change it but it always failed. With every year things just got worse and worse. The few people i turned to for help gaslit and abused me and a lot of rejections were pretty cruel.

When i was 22 however i actually had a chance with one girl.  But i blew it. We still technically stayed friends but it honestly wasn't that great of a friendship. We had some decent conversations but it was always me putting in the effort and we never really saw eachother in real life. Everytime we agreed to meet up she made some lame ass excuse last minute why she ""can't"" that i fully believed. I wasn't exactly the best either since i was in the middle of my year long bitter asshole phase often ranting about hating this and that. And i just kept sinking lowet and lower. Eventually after a year of our friendship i crossed the line and she called me out on being a bitter loser and cut me out. This made realise that the years have turned me into the stereotypical asshole neckbeard and that it must be the reason why everything goes so wrong in my life. So i devoted the entire next year on self improvement.

I hired a trainer and managed to lose weight and get some rather decent looks. I worked on my character , people started saying i'm a much better person now. I managed to get myself a decent job. Learned some hobbies other than video games. Somewhat worked on my mental health. Got more confident and stable.  Managed to finally make some friends who were telling me how cool i am. Patched things up with my crush who also said i'm a much better person now. I didm't expect anything to happen between us but i did expect us to finally hang out and be good friends.

So i felt like things finally fall into place and i wanted to celebrate. My birthday was coming and i invited all my friends to my favourite bar (the place where i managed to have a somewhat decent social life though nothing spectacular) including my crush and everyone agreed. I got happy since it was the final proof that everything is going to be fine now. But it didn't

First i lost my job after a month. I tried my best but i just wasn't good at it. Then people kept bailing out on my birthday with some cheap last minute excuses. Most of them didn't evem bother to tell me. I had to ask them why didn't they show up. Out of the 20 people i invited i was left with 4. Those so called friends didn't even send me wishes or contact me ever since. My crush didn't show up either but she sent me some personal wishes and invited me for a coffee instead. So i was still happy. But then she ""rescheduled"" it without ever mentioning to when and ignored the subject ever since. Generally, despite her praising the new me and acting like she appreciates me it was still me who put in all the effort and we still never saw eachother face to face. When it comes to dating nothing really changed. In real life i kept getting ignored and my new looks still weren't enough for tinder. All that ended up with me rotting inside my house for the last few months like i always did. At least i still kept deluding myself that my crush will eventually find the time for me. That we are great friends but she's just busy. That is until a few days ago where i lost my pateince and called her out on everything. And she pretty much confirmed she just didn't give a shit about me. It was never about my character or me being a bitter loser. I was just a fifth wheel to her that she just sort of tolerated.She didn't even care when i ended our friendship. Now they again issued a lockdown in my college again. And the bar closed down for good. So i can't even try to socialise. My confidence spiraled down fast. I stopped putting in effort into workout so lately i put on a lot of weight because honestly i don't care anymore. Despite all the effort nothing changed. Things are arguably worse than before. I spent christmas alone. I'll spend new years eve alone. And i just don't know what do do with myself anymore.

I've had several friend groups in my life but they never lasted long. I moved 3 times in high school and had good friend groups in each of them as long as I was there. After I moved to college, I was in different groups over the 4 years, changing every year. Once I got a girlfriend in my final year, I lost all my friendships. I've changed jobs thrice since then over a period of 3 years and didn't really contact people after I left. I'm going to leave my girlfriend soon as well.

I don't make the effort to be in touch with any of them. I've had several people try to contact me but I ignored them altogether. Mostly because I know the wrong that they have done to me and me to them and I feel exhausted trying to continue to any dying relationship.

Let me tell you, ""No."" Because when they think of someone, they'll think of their family, their loved ones, and their best friends.

Just go ask them, ""On a scale of one to ten, how much/many times would I appear on your flashback of life?"" I'll tell you, little, to none.

Just take me as an example, I play VRChat, and everytime I say hi to my friends, they just keep talking to their friends. When I said to them, ""Hey, (name), I feel left out... You made me feel left out…"" They'll say, ""I talked to you, I was trying to let you join our conversations."" Hey, you know what, you didn't. You might thought you did, but you didn't, bitch.

Just can’t seem to maintain friendships or relationships at all. Only saying that in case it’s somehow relevant to what’s going on with me here.

Anyway, been talking to a girl recently who I met online and was planning on meeting up with for some casual sex. The conversation has been getting pretty hot and heavy over the past couple days and today I was losing focus on things so I had to go masturbate. Anyway, after that was done I just felt fucking empty. I kinda get this feeling when I masturbate alone, but I get it way worse when there’s a partner in the equation. 

But yeah, just felt this empty, sinking feeling and I re-read the messages I sent beforehand (we were talking back and forth while I was masturbating, so it was right in front of me when I was done) and I just felt this weird sick feeling of regret I guess you’d call it. I didn’t even say anything super cringey or out of the ordinary, in fact I think it was pretty normal talk for that situation but I just found myself wishing I’d never said it. I had the overwhelming urge to completely ghost the woman who I was talking with but I pulled myself together enough to tell her the whole thing had made me really tired all of a sudden, thanked her and said goodnight. 

Still really want to ghost her completely, the urge is almost overwhelming. I just want to delete the memories of it from my mind and knowing I can’t do that makes me so overwhelmingly suicidal it’s hard to put into words. I just feel really fucked. Like I said, this happens to me every time I have a sexual encounter with a partner but this one is probably the worst time. 

Even though this feeling feels a lot like shame or embarrassment or something, at least in part , I can’t stress enough that I don’t feel like I said anything embarrassing.

928,teenytinyhooman,1640521438,1,"I recently moved to a new country to start university. Super excited, really worked my ass off to get into this university as it's T10/Russell Group, and I finally thought I'd be surrounded by people who were like me. I wouldn't say I'm an introvert, only that if I feel like I'm being excluded or convince myself I don't fit the vibe of a group of people, I generally remain silent/interact very little. When I moved and started uni, I thought since everyone here must have similar interests, I'd find a close group of friends/my own social group. But my first term ended and I still feel horribly lonely. While my academics have gone excellently - really, couldn't have gone any better, my social life hasn't really been what I hoped it would be.  I put a lot of effort into making friends - being open, approachable, and interacting with everyone for the first few weeks - but the thing is, I feel like I'm just a friend of convenience, as in, if I were to disappear or not be a part of the group, it wouldn't really make a difference in their lives. They all have their own social groups, and sometimes I feel like I'm included out of pity, or because I just tag along with them and they *have* to include me in the activities they do because I'm just *there*. I properly thought about this today and had a breakdown, because all my life all I've ever yearned for was social acceptance and friendship. All my past friendships have been pretty exploitative which I never realised while I was in those relationships -- I would be the one they turn to for homework or exam help, or turn me into the butt of all jokes while passively making it known I wasn't really *there, with them, a part of them*, and while I did enjoy these friendships, I never found close emotional or intellectual connections with these people. What I'm trying to say, is that I haven't found someone, anyone, who values/ed me as highly as I value/ed them, like a *ride-or-die* type of person, one could say. To me, they'd have been my world, but I wasn't even close to being theirs. I've constantly been isolated/not really included in groups. Sometimes I think it's maybe because I just have very niche interests and high-functioning anxiety, so people usually either get bored of me or overwhelmed with me. But recently I've been wondering if it's really just me, as a whole -- not conventionally pretty, not really fluent in pop culture/trends, not really a party-person, not really possessing the qualities of a cool, get-z kid. 

I'm just disappointed that I haven't been able to cultivate meaningful relationships in university, even though everyone here pretty much has the same interests, ideas, and goals. I thought being in an intellectually stimulating environment and surrounded by diverse people would give me a sense of belonging. Maybe I was even hoping for us all to have been misfits in high school who've somehow made it in life and can now reap the rewards of their hard work and grow together. But I haven't found that to be the case. And I don't know if it's *me*, or that some people have a fundamental quality about them that makes them predisposed to being outcasted and ignored in social settings, and I'm one of those people.

So yes, this is my barely coherent semi-rant about why I think I'm an outcast/how I feel about it. Wonder if anyone else feels the same way, or has any suggestions for how to get through university without an active social circle?

Sometimes I feel like my friends aren’t as committed to me as I am to them. I constantly check on how they are doing; it seems that I’m usually the one initiating plans, stuff like that. I of course absolutely adore them, it truly is a unique group in my opinion and I wouldn’t give it up for the world. But sometimes those thoughts linger in the back of my head and I wonder if maybe some of those things may change. For now though I don’t see the need to bring it up.

And of course, I have never been in a relationship, so holidays are always interesting. At 23 I’m still fairly young; my friend group is settling into the post academia stage of their lives, however they have been also getting into more serious relationships. I of course fully support them, but of course can’t tell but feel a bit left out as they spend time with their partners. I can’t help but feel curious about what it would be like for me. But like I said, I’m still young, and so I still have hope, however little that maybe. I’ve been trying my best to become more fit (I was always wildly underweight, and for the first time I am now have a normal BMI), my career is doing well and I make more than enough money to build a foundation for myself and enjoy my youth (nightlife I suppose), and I’ve picked up a few hobbies and other interests to take up my time off work.

I want nothing more than someone to care about and for them to genuinely care about me. I [24M] am physically unattractive and have never had any intimate relationship with a girl. The one time I got close to a girl I found extremely attractive I was basically her servant and would tend to her every needs, drive her around and spend money on her in hopes that she would like me and it was never reciprocated. She would give me lip service that I meant a lot to her etc but her actions would show that she didn’t care about me at all. The most I ever got with her is holding her hand and a kiss on her hand. That girl eventually threw me away when she didn’t need me anymore. I genuinely cared about her a lot. I know she has no obligation to reciprocate that, this isn’t about her, it’s just about how desperate I am to be valued. I realize the relationship was toxic and one sided but I just feel worthless without her. I really cared about her very deeply. I don’t know how to fix myself, I feel broken beyond repair. All I want is affection and there’s no way for me to get that being the person I am.

951,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1640504675,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has leaft little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 3rd! ( Just one left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends! 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. I'm currently working on 4 papers for finals week. It would be great to find some good company.

967,octopusluv67,1640499457,1,"I haven't celebrated Christmas since I was a teen but this year hits particularly hard. I never had family growing up so Christmas was just my parents and I but as a grew to be a teenager, I started hating Christmas because of the issues my parents would bring up, lots of fighting, shaming, yelling, nothing was ever good enough etc etc.

This year, 2021, I accomplished a lot in my personal life. I make good money, this is not to brag but more of a money doesn't make you happy sentiment. Although it's a hell of a lot easier to live (not ignoring that), money doesn't replace people or buy you relationships. I moved across the country, cut off ties with parents, broke it off with an abusive ex, haven't had friends in years and am sitting in my living room crying infront of my Charlie Brown esc tree. I've been renting out a large home, which I will probably downsize. Never thought a family sized home would fill the ""void"", I knew it would make holidays worse but I chose to ignore my inner-knowing. It gets lonely sometimes and I'm a hermit but this year it's particularly hard. 

I have no one in my life. I never got a call or a text or even had anyone this year to give a present to. Life is really lonely knowing, you don't even have acquaintances. I know it's mainly due to me being a hermit and a very private person. It's hard to put yourself out there when you legitimately have no means of networking through anyone you know. I could show up to a public event where you mingle but I've never been comfortable around strangers or having to go up to anyone or anyone coming up to me. I personally find it really difficult to connect to people on a superficial level, espcially small talk. I'm better at having deep, thought provoking conversations. I think that's where I can't hit the mark when I meet new people which eventually lead me to this point. I think I make people feel uncomfortable with my quietness, from the handful of situations I was put in by my ex (extremely long timeline of events I'm not getting into). I used to be such an exuberant, bright and lively child,  I wish I could get that part of me back. I think of the time I was talking and showing videos of myself to my ex, he asked me ""where did she go? What happened to her?"" really hit me more than I'd like to admit. I think about it a lot. 

Anyways. I've always been a loner and I feel like my life is just destined that way which I'm okay with as I'm not a people person. Sometimes I would like to celebrate my milestones with someone or even preferably, me celebrating someone else's. I cry all day every Christmas and my Birthday. I'm generally depressed and when I did have people in my life, I shut everyone out just for the day and am always fine the day after. The emotional toll seems to be worse every year. I do think I should just get out of the house to not think of the holiday but it's a nightmare to see people with family, friends, their partners, seasonal music blaring; I don't think I could bare it. It's embarrassing enough I cry alone all day rather than crying in public because I'm so desiring the family experience. I hope I get it one day.

I'm finally getting somewhere financially and now suddenly people are giving me attention where they never gave me the time of day before. It's frustrating. I hated humanity as a teen until I went on Reddit over 10 years ago and everyone told me that I was the problem, and I believed it! I tried to be positive for a decade, believe I was wrong and try to be strong and believe everyone is good, and I just have to follow different kinds of advice and change myself. But this reaction I'm getting just flies in the face of all the online advice I was given. These people don't care about me, they care about what I can do for them. They want to use me. It didn't matter how good I was to them when I had nothing. 

Luckily right before I gained success, I actually met four real, good people outside my family. But that's not a good track record considering I've met hundreds of people in my lifetime.

So with this revelation, I have this to say: based on my life alone, you're statistically only likely to meet less than 1% of all people you meet, who will ever actually value you as a person. Therefore, the best, most efficient policy is to just try to talk to everyone you meet and see, until you find someone who will actually value you back. Don't waste time on flakes and don't bother with people who don't want to reply back to you. Just move on and try someone else, and use every experience to learn to be a better communicator.

I've spent nearly my entire life alone. I've spent so much time learning to be who I am rather than hide the fact that I'm a human with emotions. But for the love of all things holy, why is it no one chooses me. I'm a good man. I've more than earned the right to be happy. Where is my happy ending? I've only ever gone on dates with two people, and only one of them ever became my girlfriend. My standards aren't insanely high, the only thing I want is be loved and feel safe. Why is it that something that is so mundane and basic so hard for me. I don't have any disabilities. I earn a decent enough living. I'm smart. I'm adventurous. Hell, I'm 6'5. Why have I spent every Christmas hurting and hoping for what feels like a miracle... To have someone next year. This time of year is about togetherness and I always feel so stranded and alone. Never once having someone to take home for the holidays. Never once having a new years kiss, and never once have I received a stupid Valentine's day card. I don't even remember the last time a female has hugged me. I just want someone to choose me, to value me. It just all feels like the cruelest of tricks.

Been fighting bipolar depression for 11 years now. All that lead me to satanism so I joined the Satanic Temple back in October. I needed something to keep myself grounded. It's silly but I'm also a Starwars fan, movies, mainly action, some sci-fi, &amp; mostly comedy was the few ways I could reach my agnostic father. So Starwars was really nostalgic to me. I would modify and recite the Sith creed to myself to keep from sliding into mania. Had epiphany had my old job one day. What's closest thing in real life to a Sith without being an edgelord? By whatever means I started thinking of Satanism. On a restroom break I looked up the 7 tenets and realized this shit is something I wish existed in church! Compassion towards all, no judgement towards your own body, use logic and scientific reasoning. Blind faith wasn't necessary. My dad always told me to find peace of mind and I have in this new religion but I still have his absence and bipolar depression that fuel each other now. I was feeling alone for a long time and now I've caught covid from my brother and am now recovering from it in quarantine. Got the booster but being sequestered by myself for a week+ now has me feeling numb. I wish I had more friends. The ones I got are from my old job and all they seem to want to talk about is the old job. Sick of one sided friendships. Wish I could talk to family they just want me to comeback to god and I'm completely with any abrahamic religion. I'm agnostic in the sense that I believe in some way the universe could have a creator it always made it sense that the universe would have some sort of authorship to it cuz why else would it need humans to try to observe and understand it or anything else that could be intelligent or more intelligent than us but outside of that my atheism leads me to believe that the abrahamic idea of God is pure bullshit I can no longer pray to a warmongering racist piece of shit like Yahweh and I don't even want to call my grandmother to try to argue that point home cuz that's the only thing that brings her comfort is that I might once again come back to God and she can't live and let live.

i dont know

even though school’s in still, i just feel like my ability to talk to people and make new friends has been hindered. i went through this self absorbed phase in may or june of this year where i was really suicidal, and didnt want to talk to anyone and that partially fucked up my relationships with people.

the other thing is quarantine. i only kept one friend throughout quarantine, and even then, we’re growing apart now, because we quite literally have nothing in common and i’m introverted and never think of starting conversations with people. 

quarantine severly fucked up my ability to talk to people. there was even a point where i would refuse to voice chat on our minecraft server because i was scared, insecure, had nothing to say and i didn’t want to be annoying or a bore. but i think that’s only added to people growing apart from me.

the only consistent friend i have now is because he talks to me.

i feel like the only reason my classmates continued to tolerate me was because i kind of had nice hair?

i don’t know. i don’t know if they really actually do like me and i just continue to drive them away because i’m antisocial or if everyone is just putting up with my autistic tendencies. maybe they feel pity for me.

AND THE FUCKING CHERRY ON TOP

i got a horrible haircut. in a week break will be over no one will want to talk to me and the friend i’m reuniting with in art class and who i kind of have a crush on probably won’t even want to talk to me anymore. or at least not think i’m cute which i can live with but :(

barely have said a word to any school people except “merry christmas” because i’m uninteresting, boring, hard to put up with when i easily get overstimulated, probably annoying when i phsyically stim in class.

to summarize,

i’m a borderline sped kid who drives away his friends by being boring, who has no interests because i bully myself out of having them, and i’m super unhappy with the way i look 💪",lonely,quarantine made me fuck myself over!!,2021-12-26 13:07:47

I wanted to say this to somebody and talk to it with my friends but I don't seem to have the urge or the power to do it.

So instead while I feel lonely and maybe rejected I decided to write my mind out here to some random dudes I don't even know. I'll appreciate it if you read through this.

I often feel lonely at nights. The time before I go to sleep.  The moment when it's dark everywhere and my mind is empty. I feel the feel of loneliness comes when my brain isn't engaged with the daily activities of life. Closing my eyes and thinking about what has happened. I'm a student in highschool, not the most liked amongst my peers. I don't blame them for this, I do things which will repel me from myself if I was someone else. I'm in a somewhat friend group of four people, I'm not sure if I am very liked in there. I'm not best friends with the biggest friend group in the class either, I've done shit there, too. I'm not liked in my class, so going to school is somewhat gray activity to me. Maybe the one of the few things that cheers me up there is that I have a girl in my class I got sympathies for, but I don't really know if the things are going well. I have friends in a different school, but we don't see each other much. I think they like me, but we haven't talked too much to be close enough to just text and hang out. I don't have anybody to listen to me and be able to help me with any of my problems. I just feel lonely because I have no one close and it's on everyday basis. Even if I don't have much friends, I still manage to do things I like, but I feel like I'm in an infinite cycle of repeating gray days. I need people with which to party and I can't manage to find some. I want people who will want me.

I don't know what went wrong, I don't know what happened,

Somehow, its difficult to write the closing words of our journey- 'the end'.

I thought what we had was special, it was you and I against the world,

Made jokes, laughed till it hurt, we were supposed to grow together grey and old.

But somehow you told me, something in you snapped, you did not feel the same,

I am sorry, I don't know what I did wrong but it seems I did extinguish our flame.

You said you would try, while moving out of our house back to your parents,

I felt stranded, abandoned, I missed those warning signs that were apparent.

Sold everything that we had so that I could move close to you,

You met me thrice? the time we had, were a distant memory that you blamed I blew.

You said you would try, when I was pleading on my knees, begging to give me closure,

And then you told me you are speaking to other guys and I might not be the one for sure.

And now you embarked on a journey with someone else as if nothing has changed,

Here I am aching and losing my mind all alone, estranged.

One thing I know for sure is what I don't have for you is hate anger or respect,

But how can I deny that 5 years of our lives did not have an everlasting effect.

Oh, how I wish you could have just communicated what you felt for years, for oh so long,

A step too late, a disillusioned fate with someone else will be the last tune of our song.

I wish you the very best of luck with your new life, but I know you will regret,

Leaving someone loved behind, without a care in the world but I will forget.

For who I loved with all my heart is who you were and what we could be,

How could you be so blind, in spite of everything we did, you chose someone else over me.

49M is muh dad

50F is muh mom

when 49M gets angry he gets physcially harmful to me.

On December 22, It was the morning, i was listening to kpop and finally decided to eat some breakfast. 49M was downstairs home from work on a break shift. I wanted an organic chemistry tutor and told 49M. He said that he didnt have could not afford it and that having tutors is some 5 second thing. I wanted professional help for work i was having trouble with. 49M does not know/remember how to do 12th grade organic chemistry and they were useless. I started getting angry how he wasn't taking it seriously and made it into some brush off situation/joking situation. He told me to clean my room when i had more important things to do and how he said how my sister is sick of seeing my like clothes and drawrers out and i said that i dont love my sisters. I said hurtful things about my sisters which i regret later and i hate myself for it and 50F was shocked. To me, my sisters throughout the pandemic were annyoing and disruptive throughout my classes, i discusssed in my previuous post about my living conditons with my  sister, i discussed how my younger sisters are pratcially useless to me cause they're younger. How is a sixth grader supposed to help a high school senior with their grown up problems 12th grade chemistry? Saddness? getting into a univeristy?Graduation requirements? As a result i barely talk to them/interact with them. They're not guidance counsellors is what im saying and i cant get them into my business cause there's absoutely nothing that they can do. They're not adult figures they cant help guide me. They dont understand a teenagers life. All they do is play roblox and do tiktok all day and i dont have time for that anymore. My in real life high school friends are nonexistent now the alst time i saw them was march of last year and i wont see them again until june of next year for graduation events such as prom, ceremony etc.

49M started getting angry and he wanted my phone. I needed my phone for schoolwork to elaborate i use my phone to take photos of my schoolwork, to ask my friends for help through text cause some of my friends have the same chemistry teacher, to search up the answers on my phone, teacher recordings, all my passwords, photomath etc. MY PHONE WAS IT ALL. They dont understand. **ITS CALLED ONLINE SCHOOL. YOU NEED A LAPTOP AND A DEVICE WITH A CAMERA like a phone TO PARTICIPATE/BE SUCCESFUL/to operate.**

as a result of this i refused to give 49M my phone and i hid it somewhere. He took away my laptop which has all my schoolwork on it until i give me back my phone. Essentially my phone and laptop are my lifeline to like people and to my teachers etc cause im like stuck at home. . He started to like grab my wrists and started hitting me, started tossing me around, started hitting my face repeadetley asking me for my cell phone and like i still refused. and he just stopped and later while i was like sleeping with my phone he took it back and he said that i would never get it back.

49M is the type of person to turn off wifi while the kids are in online class to help them focus. Its ironic.

Also another thing too university applications are due **January 13** and i just lost more time due to my actions of misbehaving poorly and then receiving punishment. My poor actions of saying mean things about my younger siblings resulted and fueled this fire more than anything this was just the beginning. **I fueled this fire im attempting to show where i went wrong.**

December 23 2021 the worst day of the month happened. I got a horrbile beating from 49M and its my fault. But the beating was hurtful but not as bad as having my nose bled or being ch0ked/str@gnled like hands around the neck. I still have sores over my body though and it hurts as ever!

So what happened was i was so irrational that day still angry from the previous day of getting beat and missing out on time to do schoolwork, uni applications etc, due to *my* behaviour. All i wanted was a chemistry tutor cause i was struggling and i got angry when i couldnt have one. I was really upset cause this is my future now, this is my like im purusing the faculty of science, im a high school senior. Next year is university! I want to major in psychology but the requriement is grade 12 chemistry on eof the requirements. I just wanted assitance to understand the material, like i have limited resoucres for help due to remote learning. I cant ask my parents for help. They dont know. The teacher sucks and is unclear. I can go on an on an on about this teacher. My best friend failed chemistry with the same teacher and sturggled and im stuck in her position now as well. It costs money to get professional help, and its unfair. Im frustrated. In grade 9 i almost failed science. In grade 10 i did average due to online school. In grade 11 i did average due to online school. I want a higher grade and i want to egt into a good university. Thats why i was so angry. My whole post secondary education is on the line. I am in tears of my struggling and mental health how the material is difficult to undertsand and i dont have any resources for anyone to help me. Being a senior sucks because everything matters now. Its all about you know its your year, your actions, your future. 49M took it as a joke when i asked for help saying that i could just redo the course, eh just brushed it off etc, not fully understanding my situation and its just made me angry. I acknowledge that its all about me this year but i want some guidance and support. I took the initative to ask for help and i didnt recieve the assistance i wanted.

To help myself, I watch youtube tutorials, i seek help off of reddit chemistry i make an attempt to feed myself. I help myself to understand the mater.

After i said mean things about my sisters. 50F said that im not allowed to talk to my younger sisters and not to interact with them. My  sister is afraid of me cause of my shouting and me getting angry at 49M. So im locked away from her. Im locked away from  cause she doesnt like me and im not close to her. Im locked away from  cause she shares the same room with me and creates a hellhole of an environment. So i have no one in person to talk to.

So when he told me to clean my room to like get ready for Christmas i just cracked and i started cussing and swearing at 49M. So history repeats itself again, i broke a glass like a irratonal piece of crap and started screaming because of my frustrations with everything. I acted like a fool and insulted my sisters again.

So my punishment was i was repeatedley hit in the face, punched in the face by 49M, I was repeadetley hit in the ear punched in my left ear. **I was punched and hit with force in my ear/ side of my head so hard that i could hear a ringing noise in my ear and my left ear could hear nothing** **but like muted sound for a while** but its back to normal now. I was spanked wildley, he pulled down my pants and started really open handed spanked my bare ass, it wasnt even directly my ass it was more of my thigh side which hurts a lot right now. This was like hit 20-30 times. My arms were twisted and bent and hit in uncomfortable positions. Right now im in pain and the muscle hurts. My thumb is sore and hurts to move cause i was hurt there too as i tried to block all the hits. I got a scratch from the glass on the floor. He started hitting and punching my back, like my shoulder blades hurt a lot right now. He hit my face a lot started slapping it and punching my face and it was sore. It wasnt swolled it was sore. My neck is swore. I was beat like some street punk

My body was numb, sore, and in muscle pain that day. I felt horrible I felt scared, i felt like nothing that day. I cried all day and cried all night. No one to comfort but myself. I camped in my bedroom for a while i sneaked food upstairs so i wouldnt cross paths with 49M. He really like pushed the love outta me like i felt really hurt. It hurts to wear headphones on my head over my ears now cause my ear where that applied pressure was from all the hitting and punching the side of my head resulted it in it being sensitive.

Today is Christmas. **Since i dont have my cell phone as my punishment i cannot wish any of my friends a merry christmas/happy holidays/happy new year. I cant facetime any of my friends or talk to my family at all from long distance. I cant text my friends are call them. I cant take any Christmas photos of me or my sisters or my family in my house. I dont have any Christmas memories of 2021 all because of me. It hurts even more now is that next year i will prolly not be with them for christmas so christmas 2021 is my last christmas and i have no memories. No memories of Christmas morning, no memories of opening gifts. And it will scar me in the future cause ill be looking back at this. My last christmas 2021 is not a recorded one. Photos or it didnt happen. 49M also threatened me that if i ever do anything bad like destory another glass he will get a hammer and smash my phone into pieces.**

My life right now feels like solitary confinement to me the way i see it ever since april of last year. Locked away from human contact not allowed to talk to anyone in real life or online. Being governed by parents like jail operators. And my bad behviour which fueled the fire. I cant get help for chemistry still to this day im left to my own devices. My parents always tell me to shut up, to keep it to myself, to be quiet. And it hurts. It hurts cause it damagers me internally. I miss my friends the last time i saw them in person was march of last year and it hurts.I dont remeber the last time i was genuinely happy. I feel like the black sheep of my family as a result. I cant even trust them fully anymore.

My current goal right now is to get into university and im left to my devcies and my choices. and graduate high school which i cant wait for it to happen.

well i got my laptop back thats how im saying this now but not my cell phone.

8 more months left of my sentence. Cant wait for late August of next year when ill move out to uni and be on my own in a better respectable environment where i can study psychology in peace. I dont have a job cause im focusing on getting into a uni right now, i have some money around 30-50 bucks so im trapped here for a while. When ill have freedom as an adult and i can now make my own decisions. It will be hard but, ill be more happy. Afterall, with great power comes great responsibility.

I have one thing to acknowledge to the reader before them viewing, I have 3 younger sisters ,  and  and my mom. They never get treated this way and the main antagonist of my tale 49M states that he would never hurt my mom. In other words, he would never hurt my mom but roughhouses and brutally beats me like a playground bully and im the main target. Im the only one that gets treated with phsyical punishments and having my device taken away from me for months.

Im also wondering if its my fault. Am i the asshole? To be fair i will share both sides of the story.

I currently have poor mental health. Im on the edge of insanity. Thanks a lot parents.

welcome to the life of a female high school senior.

To refer to my parents I feel uncomfortable referring to them as normal parents titles so ill call female parental figure 50F and male parental figure 49M.

For the past months and months since April of last year i've spiraled down into insanity and ill never forgive my parents for them doing a variety of things to me which i will elaborate later on in this post. **Ill never forgive you for all the mental damage you've done to me.**

When the whole big incident last year started in late March, it was fun at first, I had my cell phone. I had contact with my friends, i was off school for two weeks until a few days after my birthday something bad happended. This bad event would have a months long impact on me.

Last year I got my phone taken away from me for **5 MONTHS**. due to unclogging the toilet and it flooding the whole bathroom and leaking the ceiling and staying up late. April-late August. I missed out the summer of 2020 and end of grade 10. They didn’t let me talk to my friends especially during the whole big incident last year. I had to use a scanner to hand in my work. They violated my phone and forced me to unlock my phone. They started using it and my phone changed. They went through all my photos and messages. This damaged me mentally. I was all alone completely they didn’t let me talk to my friends and they violated my personal space on my phone or anyone. This is the worst thing they done to me. Cause now, none of my friends through like Snapchat have time to talk this year. We’re seniors now everyone is on their own path now. No one has time to talk. It just ain’t the same. I lost those connections. It’s just the same shit everyday.

49M also hurt me. During that summer there was a time where i once called him an imbecile (i dont remember why), and he attacked me. He punched and hit my face and my nose started bleeding from both nostrils. My face was swollen, my lips were swollen, my eyes were swollen. My body was sore and I felt horrible and was crying badly.

Another time during summer( i dont remember what i did), I got the belt whipped on me like over 50 times.

Another time in like spring of last year i called my mom the c word. She got my backpack and dumped it in the basment like the emptied out all the contents and scatterted it in that dusty digusting dust infested basement. Filled with centipedes, spiders and bugs. It was a hoarding ground and i had to play find my school items down there.

Imagine 5 months. 5 months of not being able to talk to any of your friends or family from long distance being locked away in your room. I missed out the end of the grade 10 school year and the wshole summer vacation. I suffered mentally. I had no one to talk to and relate to. I had a grandma who lives long distance for example and i couldnt talk to her at all cause u need whatsapp which is only available on mobile phones. I had the computer to do my schoolwork only.

i couldnt talk to my friends cause u need celluar to send text messages and phone calls and all my contacts were on my phone. As a result i was isolated.

When i got my phone back in late August last year i cried. I cried because i got messages from my friends from months ago asking if i was okay, where was i, how was i.

I uninentially ghosted my friends for 5 months. My parents had authority over me. They did everything to prevent me from talking to my friends as a punishment and it harmed me mentally. I truly miss my friends. I couldnt talk to them at all.

It felt like maximum security jail

Once i got **ch0ked/str@gngled me** by 49M this was this year. I called him the c word. I called him the c word cause when i was during google meets he disrupted me and forced me to come out of the bathroom cause i needed a quieter place to talk to my class thats why i was in there in the first place and there was nowhere else to go cause my room is unsuitable as i share it with my  sister and she plays the radio so damn loud.

I despise sharing a room with her. She opens the window in the morning and it's freezing. She plays classical music on repetition on the same radio station because the same station that plays repeats the same classical music. The classical music is too loud. I'm in online school and I can't talk to my teacher with background music and there's nowhere else comfortable to go.

I can't go downstairs cause the television is on and my parents disrupt me during class. This makes my room unsuitable as a study room because there's now the music factor; I can't study with music because my attention shifts from coursework to following the music's tune. I can no longer do my homework there and can't concentrate.

My room is so cluttered now it's an unsuitable cluttered environment. I have to go to bed and be on the same schedule in sync with my lil sis and im a 12th grade student. I'm different and have more coursework and more concerns and responsibilities. I'm older now and I want more space and it's just so unfair that I can't even be my true self in my bedroom. I also have rotations such as when she needs the room to do a presentation I have to leave the room.

My parents dont give a shi either cause theres nothing much to do.

The most annoying thing she does is spray perfume in the room and it just makes it unbreathable. It's so horrible and it's been like this since September 2020 and I feel so trapped like a bird in a cage. My accommodations are not to my liking currently. If I cause any problems with my sis i'll get my phone confiscated.

So back to the 49M tale, so after i explaiend whats wrong with my shared room and why i was even in the bathroom in the first place. 49M confiscated my phone from me even though i need it for schoolwork, i called him the c word. Than he held me by the neck under his legs and started using both 49M hands and started pressing on my neck and it was hard to breathe. 50F watched in horror and told 49M to stop. As a result after that i was so angry i broke glass plate and a cup and he got the end of the broom and pushed the kitchen mixer and it fell on my foot cause i was standing next to it. I started crying and i later got the laptop back and my phone was still confiscated even though i needed it for school. For my phone i was on supervision using it and i got it taken away each day for 5 days before bed.

even though i was in class, i was about to do my presentation participating marks for visual arts class and he shut my laptop down and i missed my participation marks and the rest of my art class.

50F is also disruptive to my art classes as well i was presenting and my mom overspoke me while i was talking to my teacher and screamed that i was rude and as a result im angry at her.

My sisters never get treated this way. They never get ch0ked or str@gnled, they never get physical punishments they never get their devices taken away for long periods of time.

i cuss at my parents and i call them swear words when they disrupt my classes are do things to me or my stuff that i dont like. They dont. Its my fault. But do i deserve to be str@gnled and my nose bleeding for calling my parents swear words? I understand that i should not be doing that but do i really deserve this kind of punishment.

theres more a part 2 which will be in a seperate post which ill link later cause a huge incident happened and asa result i am suffering even more",lonely,I will never forgive my parents of all the actions they done to me since last April. This includes isolating me from my friends for months by confiscating my devices for long periods of time and physically punishing me repeatedly to the point my body is sore and one time where my nose bled.,2021-12-26 10:05:39

He’s very outgoing, he has plenty of friends, a very healthy family, whereas I don’t have any close friend no more, just a few acquaintances, my family is toxic, so I try to avoid them as much as I can.

Basically my boyfriend is my entire social life. When we are together, it’s perfect. I feel completely fulfilled, I don’t need anyone else. But I have to share him all of the time, and I hate that. I want him all to myself, but I know it’s unhealthy. And when he’s with other people is distant. No text, no calls. I’m just pacing around, frustrated, looking at my phone in despair in the hopes of getting some text or call from him. He’s very bad at texting, so I can spend an entire day with no sign of life.

It's just really weird, I've never gone a year without celebrating Christmas. I feel really bitter. I worked for the first half of the day and I wish I was there longer to be honest.

It sucks not waking up to a big breakfast, opening presents, seeing peoples' reactions to presents I got for them. I never thought I would feel so sad not seeing a Christmas tree.

I always thought that if it was up to me, I wouldn't celebrate at all (I'm nonreligious anyway.)  But I think now that I'm a little bit older (not much) and have had this experience, I would just celebrate in my own way.

Not this year though.

I'm an international student in Spain, and I've been struggling with a chronic health condition for the last six or so years. It causes a bunch of complications but most importantly, it causes fatigue and pain. These last couple of weeks have been especially worse and I feel like absolute shit. I feel guiltier because I'm someone who likes to do many many different things for short time periods to feel productive but recently I've had no motivation to do so.

And I've been craving a bit of affection lately. I've not had many friends in my life and the first ones I made I had to leave, because my health acted up again. Now I'm in a new place, with a bit of a language barrier and it's hard to make friends. These last few nights, while I'm in pain, I sometimes wish I could have a hug. The first time I was hugged in my life was last year by one of those amazing friends of mine, and I may be a bit addicted. Every night I'm in pain and I feel so isolated. It's really annoying even if I do say so myself. 

Unfortunately I had to leave them and I've never been hugged since.

She's still living with him and having Christmas with him while I'm here aline as I've always been for the past 29 years.

But what I do have is a Boyfriend and a Daughter. 

He hasn't acknowledged me in weeks. He does this every few months. Just ignores me, unless I interact with him, which just ends in him insulting me. I put so much effort into being seen by him, when he just hates me.   
I offered many times to talk. Today I had to corner him because I can not live like this. I had to ask all the questions, because he never initiates any kind of communication. 

He never loved me. He hates that I got pregnant. Because he isn't from my country, he thinks I ruined his life and future. Fair enough. But he wants to leave and take my Daughter with him. 

I can not lose her. But worst thing is that he doesn't even like her that much. He sleeps till 11 am and lets me do all the work. I put her to bed every night, she sleeps in my bed. I care for her while he sleeps in, feed her, give her baths. While he is just in a bad mood, sometimes even throws stuff. But as he says, I drive him to do this. 

I don't want my daughter to grow up like this. Because I did. I remember the anxiety every day around lunchtime, hoping that my father decides to eat upstairs. And removing my door handle at night so I can sleep in peace. 

He can just take her and leave to the US or Saudi-Arabia and I might not be able to get my Baby back. He doesn't even have money, he doesn't care they could be homeless. 

If I deport him, he is gonna ruin my life in other ways. I would never be able to live in peace again.

I can't win. 

And it hurts that a person I love so much is doing this to me. We were so in love the first years. He was so nice. Until he started to blame everything on me. 

Why didn't he show his face in the beginning of the relationship. I would have left. Now I might lose my daughter. 

There is no one I can talk to, I mean as friends. So I need to shout this into the void, because even if I would raise my voice and scream this at my Boyfriends face, he wouldn't listen. I am invisible to him. Insignificant.

I will fight for my daughter. And so will he. But he has a rich dad and family in the Us that could help him.

1092,lanator,1640460122,1,"I moved abroad 3 years ago and got into a relationship shortly after.
I don't really have family and what I had left after a messy divorce was so abusive I parted ways with the remainder 4 years ago. Basically just my dad. The ""healthy"" part was not my biological parent and so when they divorced my dad, I never heard from my ""family"" of 16 years again. Cousins, grand parents, aunts. No words, gifts from my grandparents got cut of, no contact, I was just cut off in the divorce.

I felt crushed to be cut out of what I had known as family since I was 5 years old and I moved abroad to get away after a few years and recover. 
My boyfriend and I broke up this year (I spent Christmas with his family the past two years) and the friend who I was going to spend the day with had to cancel on the day.
I just stayed home and was productive, but honestly being 28 years old and sitting in a tiny studio flat with no gifts is crushing my spirits today.

I have friends, but I am often the friend in need because I don't have family to support me and just can't throw more friendships out of balance. I have often pushed friends away if I am sad and it can become off-putting that I'm so needy, so I'm always ""the teacher"".

I feel like I'm not important to anyone, but my friends are so important to me. I'm not really part of anyone's tribe anymore and it's crushing. Everyone is unavailable, spending time with family and I'm waiting around for people to be available again so I don't push more friends away.
I'm just so crushed that this is what my life has turned into.

I just feel so alone and unlovable.

Just treat it as a fairly ordinary day, do you ordinary things that make you happy, and don't think about what you don't have and you won't get upset because you're thinking about what you don't have.

It's that simple. That's my tip for what it's worth. 

A happy Christmas to everyone.

First of all i wish to all of you a Merry Christmas and i hope you have a wonderful day

Hello everyone, this is my first post on reddit, I'm just feeling hopeless, tired and a bit suicidal. (So here's a random post that hopefully makes sense and it's not just random nonsense)

///

 I decided to write a post here because writing how I feel in my diary doesn't make me feel better anymore  and i have no one to talk to about this.

I currently feel like jumping off a building and ending my stupid life, does anyone else feel like this?
Unfortunately (Or probably Luckily) for me there aren't any buildings that are high enough to just jump and die.

I can feel the loneliness in the air, it's like a fog that doesn't allow me to see anything, it's like an endless night or a rainy day but i don't have an umbrella and i'm soaking wet. 

This feels just horrible, it's killing my heart and my soul, it makes feel just like in the place of my heart there's an empty void and i also feel like puking.

This loneliness doesn't allow me to get out of bed and do something or to go outside, it's just a matter of time before i go crazy that's for sure.

But i'm sure that it's my own fault that i feel so lonely",lonely,I'm just so tired of living (TW:suicide talk / venting),2021-12-26 04:08:22

The past two years have been so tremendously challenging, but the holidays only amplify that loneliness when you can’t even surround yourself with the loved ones that you so dearly miss. For some, today might not feel all that merry, because it feels like everything but. Maybe you’ve lost a loved one, or you feel like you’ve lost yourself. Maybe you don’t even have the family that you once did, either because you feel like you’ve been abandoned, that you’re not good enough, or that you’re not lovable enough. That you’re so broken, you don’t feel like anything could ever fix you. 

Please know that you do deserve to be loved. You are worth it. You deserve to be here. You are enough. You are not broken. 

You deserve to live. 

I work as a 911 dispatcher, and over the years, I have heard so many cries for help from people who just want someone to listen. For someone to actually hear what they’re saying because they feel like no one else will. Some of the voices I’ve heard are so desperate for someone, anyone to care, because no one in their life has shown that they do. Some people are lonely, and just want someone to talk to. I’m grateful that my job allows me to ease some of the burden that a person might be feeling, that I can take some of the weight off of their shoulders. I’m grateful that I can listen to them, that I can tell them that someone does care about them, and I can help them get the resources that they need. 

But there have also been times when that persons burden was just too much, that nothing I could have done would have ever had been enough to convince them that they were worth it. That they felt the weight of their struggle was just too heavy, and that the world would just be better off without them. I couldn’t save them, because they didn’t feel like they deserved to be saved. 

But every single one of them did deserve to be saved. They all deserved to live. 

If you’re struggling and you just need someone to talk to, I am here to listen to you, to hear you. If you’re feeling lonely and just need a friend, I’ll be the best damn friend I possibly can be for you. If you need help, I will do my best to get you to someone that can help you if I’m not able to be the help that you need. But please don’t feel like you need to struggle on your own. I know the weight of the world can get to be so heavy, that it feels like nothing could ever be enough to lift any of it off of your tired shoulders. But please know that there is help for you. If you’re not sure how to find it, I’ll be there with you every step of the way until we do. I promise not to judge you, and if you just need someone to talk at, I will gladly just listen without telling you how to fix a problem that you’re not asking me to fix. 

You are worth it. You are a good person who deserves to be here. You deserve to feel happy.  

You deserve to live. 


[One More Light -Linkin Park](https://youtu.be/Tm8LGxTLtQk) 

Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
We're quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do
The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there
If they say

 I am completely alone in the world. And it turns out I am completely, 100 percent stuck, in my situation.

 Too long to post all but in general. I have a baby girl, live with my boyfriend in his family's house. Most of MY family is either dead, has threatened to kill me, or doesn't gaf about me. 

The lowest rent you can find here is 900 for a shit appartment, and that's if you beat out the dozens of others applying. My FICO score is 600, I have a ft min wage job where I rely on BF for rides to work because I have no car, so that's not happening. Have 0 friends. Forced to be with him if I don't want to be homeless and away from my daughter who's the only reason im still alive. 

He's thrown food at me, yells at me every single day. Leaves me with the baby every time he's mad for hours and hours without texting back. And today he ruined our daughters first Christmas. Started arguing with me first thing in the morning. Says hes done with me. Which I honestly don't care about, other than the fear that hits me when I realize that means I'll have to move out and probably leave my daughter behind because, where will I take her? 

Guys I just want my own place with my daughter. Like so so fucking bad. I want to be away from him. From his family who sticks up for him no matter what. I just want to not have these special first time moments constantly ruined because of him. Im going crazy because I have no way out. I fucking hate my life. So fucking bad. It shouldn't be this hard to get my own little place. 1 bed 1 bath would be more than enough. But instead im forced to stay in the upstairs attic crying wishing my daughter could've just enjoyed her first Christmas with me.",lonely,"First Christmas with my daughter crying, begging for anyone to listen.",2021-12-26 03:21:47

1128,NimblyBimblyMeyow,1640449205,1,"I’m not really sure why I even started to type this out. Maybe it’s my own way of coping because I’m fortunate that my job allows me to help people by talking them through their crisis. Maybe it’s what I wish someone would tell me… I don’t really know.

The past two years have been so tremendously challenging, but the holidays only amplify that loneliness when you can’t even surround yourself with the loved ones that you so dearly miss. For some, today might not feel all that merry, because it feels like everything but. Maybe you’ve lost a loved one, or you feel like you’ve lost yourself. Maybe you don’t even have the family that you once did, either because you feel like you’ve been abandoned, that you’re not good enough, or that you’re not lovable enough. That you’re so broken, you don’t feel like anything could ever fix you. 

Please know that you do deserve to be loved. You are worth it. You deserve to be here. You are enough. You are not broken. 

You deserve to live. 

I work as a 911 dispatcher, and over the years, I have heard so many cries for help from people who just want someone to listen. For someone to actually hear what they’re saying because they feel like no one else will. Some of the voices I’ve heard are so desperate for someone, anyone to care, because no one in their life has shown that they do. Some people are lonely, and just want someone to talk to. I’m grateful that my job allows me to ease some of the burden that a person might be feeling, that I can take some of the weight off of their shoulders. I’m grateful that I can listen to them, that I can tell them that someone does care about them, and I can help them get the resources that they need. 

But there have also been times when that persons burden was just too much, that nothing I could have done would have ever had been enough to convince them that they were worth it. That they felt the weight of their struggle was just too heavy, and that the world would just be better off without them. I couldn’t save them, because they didn’t feel like they deserved to be saved. 

But every single one of them did deserve to be saved. They all deserved to live. 

If you’re struggling and you just need someone to talk to, I am here to listen to you, to hear you. If you’re feeling lonely and just need a friend, I’ll be the best damn friend I possibly can be for you. If you need help, I will do my best to get you to someone that can help you if I’m not able to be the help that you need. But please don’t feel like you need to struggle on your own. I know the weight of the world can get to be so heavy, that it feels like nothing could ever be enough to lift any of it off of your tired shoulders. But please know that there is help for you. If you’re not sure how to find it, I’ll be there with you every step of the way until we do. I promise not to judge you, and if you just need someone to talk at, I will gladly just listen without telling you how to fix a problem that you’re not asking me to fix. 

You are worth it. You are a good person who deserves to be here. You deserve to feel happy.  

You deserve to live.

It really hit me, made me feel even more lonely, dead inside.

But today was different. The first time in gosh, maybe years and years I feel on top of the world and for something so simple.

Just had the best time, walking in town and by houses. Talking, enjoying our company and loving the pure emptyness in the streets and roads. It was on a whim and not something we planned, as we don't celebrate Xmas and usually just stay in doing our normal day.

I just wanted to share that. And inside my heart, feels, rejuvenated, beats of happiness and joy. Even if it's gone by tonight which I can guarantee it will. Just makes me wonder if I do have a chance in life to be happy. Around the right person.. 

I've only. Got my mum. No other family and no friends. I dread to think when I don't have her anymore, what I'll do If I haven't found someone.

But for today and right now at least. That walk just restarted my heart and put a massive smile on my face.

I've been thinking about how I'm turning 30 next October. I've now spent more than half of my life now dealing with an anxious personality disorder and the depression that comes with it. I honestly don't remember very much of my youth. My brain is so clouded by my loneliness that it's become all I know. And I've become comfortable in this loneliness, despite his painful it is. Despite my extreme anxiety and shyness I've managed to overcome it a handful of times, asked about half a dozen girls out in my life. All in high school and college. Of course they all said no, and I don't blame them, I probably would have said no to me too. But I just want a chance. And now, almost seven years now since I graduated from college, I haven't even caught feelings since I was last told no. I don't even remember what it's like to have a crush on someone. What I do know is that I have so much love to give. The thing about love though, is if you have nobody to share it with it becomes extraordinarily heavy. This weight is making me act in ways that concern me. I just gave a person who I don't really know, who doesn't know me at all, someone who I'll never meet a $100 gift for Christmas. This was, more than anything, me desperately trying to shift some of the overwhelming weight of love off my shoulders onto them. But stepping back and looking at it, I've accomplished nothing in the form of relief from doing that. And I'm now out $100 so there's that too. Now all I want is a drink. Is 5 AM too early for that or just late enough that it's still OK? Man I really miss drugs. I would love to roll right now, even if there's nobody to share that experience with. I'm tired of feeling hopeful that Death is coming for me next. I just want to love being alive. I think the key to that is not being lonely. And that's what keeps me going I guess.

1183,y_mxplusb,1640426068,1,"TL;DR: Lonely because online friend cooler than all other friends put together, but they are far away.

&amp;#x200B;

This entire post is basically a rant to try to organize my thoughts.

It is Christmas morning, but I am not feeling too jolly about anything right now :’( 

I think I need to back up a few steps to explain my low mood. I am a college kid and have always thought of myself as a pretty unique kind of guy in one way or another. When I was in my mid to late teens, I found out I was a bit sharper than my peers academically and really went to town with it. I became very arrogant but still had plenty of friends and kind people all around me. 

My impression of most people was that they thought too little about things that “actually mattered” and were less smart than me. I didn’t express those sentiments much, and I would conveniently forget them when I was hanging out with my pals doing dumb teenage things. I don’t wanna overplay how much it actually affected my thinking though. I was generally just a friendly, nerdy guy back then. The arrogance was more of a background thing.

When I started going to college, I realized how much of an ass I was and worked very hard to not think worse of people for not sharing the same interests as me or caring less about random academic topics that I happened to be learning about at that particular moment. 

I feel like I was very successful at this. I made friends with plenty of different people and particularly enjoyed talking to people about their random passions that didn’t at all align with what I liked such as film or candy making or ham radio. I have always been the type of guy that loves meeting new people and is friendly with everyone, but I feel like I really mastered that now. From the trolley drivers on my commute to peers in my university to the professors I visit during office hours; I felt like I was really making a community of friends around me here in college.

Well, during COVID, I got to experience none of this. I was sad and lonely from isolation, so I made friends online. One particular online friend I made during this time showed me just how sandy the foundation to this entire mindset of mine was and washed it all away.

Biblical allusions aside (it is Christmas after all), this friend I made is incredible. I don’t even know how they are real. I found someone that actually seems to think like me. I have never found that with anyone. This wasn’t an r/iamverysmart kind of thing this time though. I have met countless people that I much, much smarter than me in university, and none of them have a similar outlook on life to me (at least compared to this friend).

Well, that sounds wonderful, doesn’t it? Surrounded by countless, kind people PLUS an online best friend to talk to about everything, right? If only the math were that simple. Our entire friendship is basically a social addiction for me. I am full of frustration because the only way we can communicate is through text and extremely infrequent calls. I don’t feel any lasting satisfaction from our friendship like I do with the most basic of real life connections, but I enjoy talking to this person way too much to dare to stop.

The other consequence of this is now that I met them, talking to new people seems like such a drag because they aren’t like my online friend and therefore not like me. This pessimism is a very depressing regression to my arrogant high school days and probably even worse than that at this point. 

A few weeks ago, I was very misanthropic for a while when I realized just how much of an effect it was having on my social life. I hardly spoke to anyone outside of class, and I was annoyed/bored with any friendly people trying to enter my life. It was pretty terrible, I tried really hard to overcome that and be more optimistic. Fortunately, I no longer openly hate people and at least appear to try to let others in and be social, but now I am just really lonely inside. I don’t actually care nearly as much about making random friends like I used to be. I feel so unfulfilled and sad. I know I am young and will meet countless awesome people, but right now, I feel like I had a tiny taste of genuine friendship from someone that actually kind of understands me, and I can’t have any more. 

I don’t really know what I am meant to do with all of this emotion. Right now, I guess my goal is to find a friend similar to this person to actually talk to someone like me in real life. 

When it comes to my online friend, I have zero clue what to do. I think this person is incredible, and I have tried to make it clear how unique of a friend they are to me, but I don’t know if I want them to know the full extent of their effect on me. I am afraid because I am committed to the friendship way too much, and they most likely aren’t feeling that way too. Even if they are, it does nothing because of the distance between us.

I know that a great deal of this likely involves me having this inflated image of this person, but I have been trying to end that potential false idol with no success. This person consistently says just the right things to remind me that out of my many, many friends and acquaintances I have been met, none are this cool. 

I think the worse part of this loneliness is that it is all in my head. I am very blessed with a loving family this Christmas. I already have so many friends in real life that love me very much. I am in the middle of a city filled with college kids, and I am good at making new friends, but I just can’t be bothered to because a single friend of mine just happens to be more like me than the average person. The bar has been set too high, and I don’t know how to bring it back down.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Lonely because online friend cooler than all other friends put together, but they are far away.

The gifts we exchanged, I felt like my partner didn’t really think much of anything I presented.

Now he is asleep next to me with his headphones in, and he can’t hear me cry over stupid shit that’s definitely just me being too sensitive. I’m really craving serious discussion, serious connection, and serious receiving of things that matter to me on a mentally intimate level. It’s almost like the longer you’re in a relationship, and the more comfortable you get, the harder it becomes to talk together without playing around, using pet names, and refraining from putting in jokeless emotional effort. Our relationship formed over many (even if short) “3am thoughts/conversations,” and I feel like as life progresses, we are losing that between us. 
I should be grateful that someone loves me enough to call me by affectionate terms, but I am just really needing to be called by my real name, and taken seriously for…I don’t want to say “deep,” because that’s overplayed, but…substantial communication.

I haven't been in a date or seen my friends in almost 2 years.

It's been cathartic in a lot of ways. I've met some cool people who allowed me to blow off some steam. Usually people start off kind and empathetic. But inevitably, after a while (or sometimes relatively quickly), it delves into a bootstrapping speech. Sometimes subtly and sometimes very overtly you are told to ""stop your bitching"" and make the best of what you've got.

People who claim to understand depression, who claim to themselves have PTSD, should understand how detrimental this advice can be. But ultimately they feel like they're not getting paid enough to listen to you for long, as they are concerned with being the main character of their own movie.

I find the effect compounded by the fact that I'm a man and people are viscerally repulsed by a man who says too much. They may say they're there to help, they may even try to help, but they cannot help but recoil at a man complaining. Man up is too deeply engrained into our evolution.

That's the back story that leads to the creation of this post lol.

I'm M20 (INFP and an empath if that means something to you) and I'm weird possibly because of my hobbies. I have hobbies like programming, reading a lot, writing and I love solving logical things like solving programming questions for fun, puzzles, and riddles, etc. I cannot play games just to tell you, how does everyone even play games? It's so tough to win and me being competitive only makes it worse but that's a personal problem also I don't have that high spec laptop like most of you out there so just forgive me for that.

I wonder what it’s like to have a person you love to be by you every night, and to know their heart is bound to your own.

I wonder what it’s like to feel the smile of another pierce through the icy cold sting of solitude.

I wonder what it’s like to no longer fear the shadows of the dark, as the soul of your loved one shines brighter than any demon.

I wonder what it’s like to awake with gifts and praise from those not bound by blood, but by choice.

I wonder what it’s like to no longer fantasize about having children and supporting each other until we’re separated by the grave.

All these questions lie within, causing restless nights again and again.

I wonder if the time will come when these events could become reality.

1224,1999Championhoodie,1640411814,1,"I’m almost 23 and I’m scared that I’ll never get rid of my depression. Since middle school, I’ve been fighting to be positive about myself and life but I never seem to maintain this attitude. In the back of mind I’m always thinking things like “I wish I was never born, to live is to continue suffering, I’m just a piece of shit, I have no value”. 

Every so often I try to find something to keep me grounded and happy to distact myself but for some reason I’ll find a way to tell myself “yeah, but it means nothing, you’re still a fuckin’ loser”. I try to get active and work out but then after my addrenaline rush I’ll think “what’s the point, you might get a little stronger but even then nobody will like you.”

I feel like a lotta of this negativity comes from my feelings of rejection. I don’t feel like im part of anything, I have no friends, and I spend most of my time alone.

I’ve tried to socialize but I feel so out of place, like a fuckin’ weirdo. I feel like im not interesting and always look desperate for interaction. I feel like people can see right through me and tell that something is off. 

I tried to be different in high school and tried to be different in college and I’m still alone. I try to tell myself “well fuck it who cares, I think I’m an okay person so whatever” but I know thats what a loser says and hate myself even more.

“If you have value then why are you alone?”

“People like you don’t deserve a spot in society”

“There’s nothing special about you”

“You’re just a waste of a fuckin’ life”

“If you were really a person of value you wouldn’t even have these thoughts”

“You will never be happy”

I don’t know how much longer I can take it. I’m not normal. I was brought into this world as a defective human.

I spent my day cleaning to have a guest over. I have new furniture since last time they’ve been over and was excited for someone to finally see my decor. 

After I cleaned, I wrapped presents for people. I spent so long on the ground, my back started hurting. (Idk if I know how to decorate on a table lol)

Anyway, I have a significant other (SO) you who refuses to go to my family’s get together (whole other thing that already made me feel lonely) but digress (just adds to my feeling) - today we were going to do little things after my SO got off work. We were going to drop off and see his brother briefly. He’s unvaccinated and we are precautious so we had planned to just drop it off to his apartment and chat outside. I finish all the wrapping, my SO makes this special dinner they ate as kids to surprise him, I get dressed and text him we are going to leave and he texts back he got the day off so he went 2 hours away to a city and we should reschedule. 

I felt bummed for me and bummed for my SO. But I rally the troops - my SO has a good friend we also made plans for slightly later - we were going to see his brother then go to two stores then get his friend, have dinner, give him our gifts and go see Christmas lights. This is the guest that hasn’t seen the decor. Well, we go to the stores, take our time, his friend text the dinner he was making isn’t done yet and won’t be for awhile. I thought he was having dinner with us, poor communication, whatever, we eat and then run an errand out by the friends home. As the time approaches he said he’d be done, we text and say is he almost ready we are nearby. He said the food still isn’t done - he hasn’t even eaten yet. It’s getting late. My SO wakes up super early so he’s getting tired. We are about 2 hours past our original agreed upon time. We have nothing else to do and we aren’t going to drive home 20 minutes, wait around, and go pick up the friend later (friend doesn’t drive). Friend suggests we do stuff another day, maybe tomorrow.

Im going to see my mom tomorrow, so I don’t want to do stuff another day. I wanted some of our plans to work out today. 

On top of that, the only other Christmas thing my SO got to do with his family, was also cancelled because his nephew was sick. But then he wasn’t sick enough to go out to a restaurant? I’m not even sure I believe it.

I feel like no one wants to spend time with me, or my SO, besides my mom and sister. I have no real friends. No one who doesn’t flake. I just feel so bummed out. I want to be wanted. I want this feeling in my chest to go away. It feels like a tightness and heartache. I don’t want to be on the verge of tears on Christmas Eve. 

So I’m gonna give myself a little shake. I know I’m not alone in this feeling tonight, so hug to everyone else out there. Im there in spirit with you. May you feel some peace and love. I wanted today to be about friends and family, but it can just be about kindred spirits and the winter season instead and I guess that will be ok.

Hugs to any who want one.",lonely,Disappointed,2021-12-25 16:08:04

Yet tonight has been the first Christmas Eve without them and now as the clock hits midnight it is rolling around to the first Christmas without them. I just miss them so much.

Struggle to connect to anyone. Only ever had one person I’d consider a friend and I don’t even talk to her anymore cause apparently my brain mistakes human decency and the smallest display of respect for romance and also skips straight past a crush, straight past love and all the way to venomous obsession. Has a way of ruining a friendship, I guess. Also has a way of ruining a persons desire to ever make another friend again. 

But apparently no one told my fucking brain any of that, cause it still craves that’s connection, that’s intimacy that it knows it can’t have. That most of my brain doesn’t even fucking *want*. Doesn’t matter how many times I have to endure being stuck in conversations with “friends” while I’m dissociating cause of how disconnected I feel from them, or how many times I’ve been dumb enough to get stuck at a party or a bar with a group of people who’s faces I can’t even recall when they’re sitting across from me just because I feel like I need to *force* myself to try having friends I clearly can’t have. 

Anyway, guess cause I’m still biologically a 22 year old male, I still have a sex drive and also because I begrudgingly have to accept I’m also human, I guess I still need intimacy. And since I have exactly zero friends or people in my life period, I resorted to Tinder. Started talking to a girl, eventually started to actually feel somewhat comfortable with her, I guess. I’ve got C-PTSD, and I dunno, she started to pull my into feeling some remnant of “safe” in our conversations. Started to consider it might actually lead to us meeting at some point so I forced myself to talk to her about the self-harm scars all over my body since I thought better she hear it before we meet. 

Anyway, thanks to the title, you probably already know how this goes so I’ll spare the fucking details. I got fucking catfished. Not a fucking shred of that person was real. Don’t know why the fuck I didn’t see it coming. Figures the one fucking time in years I let my guard down, I get immediately fucking punished for it. Guess that’s what I fucking get for not fucking learning ever. This whole species is fucked. 

To add salt in the wounds, that old friend of mine, one I was obsessed with, apparently finally decided this was the first Christmas since we met that she isn’t going to send me a text. It’s for the best, know I’ve gotta move on from her, I do know that. But I guess given everything it just feels like a final gut punch after barely surviving a cage fight with a fucking silverback gorilla hopped up on amphetamines. Just drives home I guess that I miss how things used to be with her, before I poisoned it with the black fucking tar that runs through my veins and corrupts everything fucking touch. 

Anyway, maybe this time I’ll learn my fucking lesson. Maybe I should carve it into my fucking skin to remind me. At this point all I wanna do is somehow save enough money to move as far as fucking possible away from people, say fuck you to the whole world and spend my days drinking myself into and early fucking grave.",lonely,"Finally made an effort to meet people again, got fucking catfished.",2021-12-25 15:38:57

When I find myself with nothing to do I wish I had friends but I don't know what I would even do with them. I will go to my sister's place some weekends and its fine find it incredibly boring because all they do there is eat and watch netflix. My coworkers are nice people but all they talk about is series, movies and what new stuff they bought or are planning to buy from amazon.

I'm not a sporty person nor do I care about new age stuff, and I find people who obssess with money and ways to earn it boring. I'm unable to relate to the average person my age, and I'm past the point where this would make me feel special.

I simply don't have any hobbies that are conductive to socializing, all I do is read, listen to podcasts, music and audiobooks, work, tinker with my laptop, talke walks and daydream, mostly daydream. I'm getting into cryptos, and I want to get into painting, but it will be another lonely activity because people here don't care about such things.

In a sentence my life is basically reduced to nothing but somehow I don't percieve it to be boring or empty. Its meaningless and aimless, and not very exciting, but its just fine to me, its quiet, sometimes its a litttle too quiet, like now.

I was a NEET for 4 years, I would not leave my room and play videogames all day. Those were bad times and I didn't know better but I had a small group of people I talked to on discord who were also NEETs and ""losers"" like me. I still miss many things about that time but I cant go back, they were assholes.

I'm told I should go to college even though I already have the job that I wanted and they are apparently fine with me not having finished college. I don't want to earn more, I have no needs.

Its all so diffuse. Nothing ever stays the same for long and we are suppossed to believe this is a good thing. Communities died before I could ever know what it was to belong to one. The things that we have now (fandoms, subcultures, and other so called ""online"" communities) are nothing like the real thing. It's basically like comparing real tacos to Taco Bell.

As I look on my snapchat feeds I see my former friends or ones who I'm not super in contact with anymore out having fun with their families, friends, companion

While im at home in my bed just wanting to fall asleep because of loneliness and depression.

im a 25 year old man. im in college. i don't have friends anymore. it's like suddenly a few years ago everyone started falling off... eventually they were all gone

then covid happened which was the final nail in the coffin... BAM nobody to talk to, to socialize with, to even vent to...

just became a habit of online classes, work (which i may add no coworkers my own age/not a public job), and sleeping... this became my dull life, and eventually became everydays schedule..

Tried all suggestions. dating apps.... don't work at all for me.... tried finding hobbies/groups (meet up or Facebook) nothing... At ALL... tried going out to public events like bars, concerts, fucking even tried approaching peopke

It's like NOBODY wants to fucking socialize anymore and im sick of it. It's aggravating. I thought by now I'd have a wife or girlfriend or AT LEAST START Dating... But no I'm just a lonely ass person with nobody and nothing.

Fuck",lonely,so uh... How the FUCK are you supposed to meet people in your mid 20's???,2021-12-25 13:09:27

1295,fancygoldengirl,1640394728,1,"I apologize if this body of text is confusing but I am highly emotional right now ;

I am a recovering alcoholic/drug addict, and except for a couple of slip ups with alcohol I've been clean for 6 years. I have been in love with someone for 10 years and I kept it bottled up inside because I have an extreme fear of rejection and abandonment and a tendency to self sabatoge. 

We lived together briefly when I was trying to get clean, but I convinced myself that he just wanted me around for sex (we fucked like bunnies because I literally could have lived and died with him wrapped around me and I could not get enough) and the pain of all of those feelings made me burn everything we had to the ground and salt the earth. I did things that still make me cry when I think about it and I don't think I will ever forgive myself for it. 

I tried hopelessly to get over him. Literally everything, healthy or unhealthy. I ended up accepting that I fucked it up too badly and to move on with my life. I ended up meeting someone who made me feel safe and secure and although I wasn't in love with him, I still cared about him and decided to have a family with him. He ended up abusing me during my pregnancies and after a loss in his family and the first lockdown the abuse escalated so I left with my 2 children. To complicate things more, he is an involved father and I refuse to alienate our children from their dad so I'm forced to stay here where he lives because we had bought a house here together.  Despite all this stress trying to coparent with someone who hates my fucking guts for leaving them- I've been doing all right.

So after much soul searching I  finally decided to message my love with a much deserved apology earlier this week. I needed him to know that I was deeply sorry for all I had done and how I was grateful for him trying to help me out. To my absolute shock he actually messaged me back, and started flirting with me after some small talk. I tried to resist it but he is my absolute kryptonite. I would swim across the ocean for just one kiss from him . I ended up finally telling him how I felt about him which was extremely difficult because I have a hard time being vulnerable. He ended up telling me that he loved me too. Felt like a knife in the gut. Told me he still loved me. We started talking about how we would meet up and make love again. I couldn't sleep all night, my emotions were all over the place. So I texted him in the morning telling him how anxious I felt about this and he just messaged me back that he thought it was a bad idea. 

I unfortunately agree. it probably is the worst idea. But I am completely heartbroken and I feel sick to my stomach. My daughters are at their dads for the holidays so I've been alone for the last 24 hours. My first urge was to go to the liquor store across the street and get wasted. 

Instead I put on some music that is akin to my emotions and I let myself feel it all. The embarrassment, anger, sadness, the disappointment and the relief. I wondered if he was just saying he felt something for me just so I would flirt with him but came to the conclusion that either way it doesn't matter. I cuddled with my cats. I cleaned my aquarium. I made myself a meal that was nutrious so my blood sugar wouldn't make my mood worse. I made a list of what housework needs tending to this weekend and I booked my g test for my driver's license on the day I was going to drive to go see him. I spent a bit of time looking in the mirror and studying my face- seeing that my eyes still have light in them and my skin isn't sallow like it was years ago. I wrote this out to clear my head before I go finish the finale of Dopesick. The liquor stores are long closed. I beat this and I'm going to make it through the holidays sober.",lonely,The deep sadness at the loss of love has triggered a desire to relapse but I am getting through it in a healthy way and I have no one to tell it to so I am sharing it here.,2021-12-25 12:12:08

But since Covid I see the bad in everyone. I have my close circle who I trust and know I can rely on but everyone else just gives me bad vibes, whether that be because of the way they act towards me or their attitude in general. 

I don’t know if everyone else has changed or if I’ve become an introvert. Either way I’m sad, I want to make new friends but how do I do that when I get let down by people time and time again. It makes me lonely and I just feel like people don’t like me no matter how nice I am or how much effort I make, It isn’t reciprocated.

1333,miamiheat0599,1640386542,1,"Hi friends. I hope you’re having happy holidays and a Merry Christmas. I know other people are dealing with worse things in their lives. I know I have a good life. I’ve just been down for a long time, and yesterday I messed up really badly at work. I started this new job like 2 months ago, so I’m still the “new guy.” And yesterday, I messed up. Like I messed up bad. And to make it worse, I messed up on something that I promised earlier in the week that I would not mess up on. Without giving too much away, I work for a media company, and the thing I messed up on is not just noticeable in-house, but it’s obviously noticeably to a large number of people who consume the content that I was working on. I feel so terrible. I tried to just work around it last night, but this morning I woke up to people angrily tweeting about it. The cat’s out of the bag, it’s on social media now. I sent a lengthy apology text to each of the 2 dudes who I’ve been working with about 20 minutes ago, but neither one of them has responded. I feel like such a complete dumbass. I failed miserably, and my words came back to haunt me for it too. I don’t know what else to say. I feel absolutely awful. I’m dreading going back in on Monday, and I can’t think about anything else right now. I wish I could fast forward to Monday and just get past apologizing for it again. And I can’t even be mad at anyone but myself. I’m just sitting alone in bed and can’t think about anything else. I ruined my own Christmas, and it seems I pissed off a ton of people in the process. I’m so embarrassed about it, but at the same time it feels like I have nobody to talk to. Why won’t they just respond to my apology texts?? … Sorry for venting. Hope you all have a Merry Christmas.

I don't know why she texted me first and then showed no interest in talking to me. And I don't know why I was stupid enough to think that I would have someone to talk to.

I honestly feel so tired, it's hard to do my job like that, it's hard to get up from bed. I have absolutely no strength to change anything, I can't talk to people about my feelings.

It's about someone very special to me, a person everytime i feeling scared or bad i always thinking about him and calling his name, i always imagining him here with me. He's like a safe place to me, a happiest place to me, he make me feel okay. He's the reason why i still looking for tomorrow, the reason i didn't lose hope yet, a reason for me to stay. He is my source of motivation, he keep me ""sane"". In my head i always thinking of him as my ""big bro"" (he's 6y older than me) but he can also be a good friend, a teacher and also a best partner to me. He's very special to me. He is everything i want in this world..

But there's a problem, He didn't know me.
He don't even know im exist. I want him to know me but i don't know how to reach him. Im too scared to send a message to him or even leave a comment on his social media, all i can do is ""like"" his post. I wish he could acknowledge me, acknowledge my existence but at the same time i also worried, ""He's not gonna like this, He will judge me, He's not gonna accept me"" for so many reason. There's so many ""wrong"" about me..

I really wish i could talk to him personally, I really want to talk to him. This is so wrong to say this but i need him. I want to be close with him, i want him to be here, i want him to know what i feel. There's a paper i slip on my comic book. On that paper i draw a star symbol with his name written on it. Everytime i feel scared and anxious i wrote a message on that paper. ""Can you hear me?"", ""I need you"" and then i blow the paper like i blow a candles and hope the wind or universe will send my message to him somehow, someway..

I'm so crazy and desperate but i need him. There's so many things I need to fix about me. It's make me feels overwhelming, I need a little help from him. I just need him to be ""here"" for me, that's will be much much bigger help for me, make my life much lighter. The only help i looking for and probably work for me is him. He is my only hope. He is the only thing i need. I like him, i really like him and I want to be with him. I really.. really wish universe make this happen. I make a vow for this..

I've been such a mess for weeks due to stress (not related to the holidays) and my mind has been all over the place. It's not the first time I spend Christmas alone, so I thought I wouldn't mind too much. I don't really care about this time of the year either, I don't hate it though.

I'm not in very good terms with my family now. We have a complicated relationship because of something that happened around 3-4 years ago, and being with them makes me really uncomfortable, makes me feel trapped, I have to pretend I don't hear, see, or notice certain things, I have to bite my tongue constantly, I don't have my own room at their house anymore, etc, just a bunch of if things that make me feel like I don't belong anyway (also one of the reasons why I moved to a different city), so this week I decided that to keep my sanity I preferred to spend the holidays alone, since I have work to do anyway.

I didn't mind it. After years of trying to ""fix"" whatever had happened in my family I decided to do what's best for me. They called me and asked if I was going home for Christmas and I said I didn't really feel like it. They tried to convince me, saying my sibling was also there, but I said I didn't want to. Part of me felt bad, but this is what's best for my mind.

However, I found myself crying very hard this morning, woke up very anxious, feeling like I had been abandoned, even though being alone was my decision. Friends aren't replying to messages (which I understand) [and I can't spend time with them bc of covid and also because they went home for the holidays, while I stayed], my boyfriend isn't replying to messages either which I also understand [we can't spend it together for the same reasons, we don't live in the same city and covid just complicates things], but it's starting to make me feel like I'm bothering people (I know it's not their fault and it's just my brain messing with me, but still). Why tf am I feeling like this, when I chose it, and when I know spending time with family would have been worse?

I've been trying to keep myself busy, I go to work and when I get home I have some other work to do, I overthink A LOT and I don't really know how to stop it, the only way I know to deal with the overthinking is working and/or doing a few things at the same time, like working on my computer and listening to a podcast or youtube video, or doing chores while i have a livestream and music in the background, etc, I even sleep with something playing in the background.

But today that's not working. I left for work and I kept thinking about how lonely I feel. I got home completely exhausted, started working on my computer and couldn't help checking my phone every ten minutes, wondering if people had replied to my messages or were actively ignoring me. I've been working for around 12 hours now, and mentally I feel so exhausted and I really want to scream and cry, but I don't even have the energy. I think I'm spiraling again.

Seeing so many families around during this time isn't helping either, it just reminds me that mine is broken and it will never be like it was.


TLDR: I decided to spend the holidays alone because of problems with my family. Friends and bf aren't replying to messages or calls (though I understand). I ended up feeling lonely and abandoned even though it was my decision, thinking it was the best decision to keep my sanity, but I'm starting to spiral. Keeping myself busy/Distracting myself isn't working.


Does anyone have any advice for dealing with overthinking and feeling abandoned, especially during the holidays? Or if you feel a similar way and just want to vent, that's alright too. Either way, thank you for reading.",lonely,Dealing with feeling lonely for Christmas,2021-12-25 05:53:15

I don’t have too many female friends, my one friend is moving away and my other friend had a baby and is he ty pre occupied and we don’t talk as much. My last boyfriend wasn’t affecitonate, not supportive, got annoyed if I gave any physical affection- it sucked. But it’s been so long that I’ve been in a relationship AND so long since I’ve been in a relationship where I can just cuddle with someone and feel safe and special. I like myself and I think Cool, personally, but I lose self esteeem when it comes to dating. Yeah I’m cool and get along with guys well but guys don’t care about that when they can date a girl who’s traditionally hotter than me. I just find that most guys don’t actually care about a girls interests and if they have stuff in common. And even if a girl is super cool he’ll go for the Instagram girl. I’m more of an “alt” girl and I’m also biracial so I have a hard time meeting someone that understands my/has similar interests. And when I do meet someone with similar interests, I’m just constantly worried they arent going to want me and just want a cooler, ahem, white alt girl instead of me. I liked this one guy for a bit, I put myself out there and tried to make conversations, jokes etc….but he liked for my friend (who is much hotter and cooler and badass than me) and now they are dating. It made me feel like absolute garbage and just ugly and not worthy. So embarrassed I even put in that much effort to talk to him . I’m not a super sexual person im so nervous of casually dating bc I don’t want to be expected to have sex or if im not super good in bed if I get dumped or cheated on. I’ve never had good sex in my entire life so I feel like I have to fake or something if I have sex with a new person bc it usually just hurts and it’s going to take so long to meet someone who makes me comfortable. It’s just so scary. Not to mention everyone on dating apps sucks, i absolutely hate having the same covos over and over and they never lead to anything. I really don’t like meeting people online (so yeah don’t try to private message me please). The worst is I love going to shows, playing shows etc and that’s like the same scene where I meet new people and friends. But with the pandemic it’s literally impossible to do any of that stuff and meet people. Canada is the worst and constantly shutting everything down.

1396,jorgyporjy,1640365634,1,"One-sided anything, really. 

Friendships have got to be the worst. I am not your therapist, I am not your life coach, I am not even your fuckin parent— yet they don’t see that. 

I’m a human. I’m a person with emotions. I fight everyday to make it through— like everyone else. 9 times out of 10 I’m dealing with a lot more than them, and they never even bother to ask how I am. Hearing “how are you?” is worth more to me than money, gifts, travel, etc. Most likely, they can’t help me, but it’s the fact that they might care. That matters.

I’ve dealt with friendships like these my whole life. It’s left me with the belief that most people are weak and don’t want to be better. That most people are functional infants. They aren’t narcissists, but they hate themselves and think about how shitty they are all the time, they only ever think of themselves— thinking about the other person proves impossible for them. 

I’ve had to cull some friendships again and I’m sick of it. I go into every relationship with the mindset of “How can I help them? What can I do for them? Is there something I can do to make their life better?” What I end up with, are people who want my attention, money, time and effort. They never give even a 10th of it back. 

It is not normal to walk away from these relationships knowing their entire life story, allergies, medical history (yes, really), dreams, hopes and plans, but they know nothing about me but my first name. It’s not normal. It’s fuckin’ tired.

No one knows what my hobbies are, what I like, favorite things/animals/etc. these are people who I can list at least 10 things they like (yes even my doctors and people I’m not very close with) I pay attention to them and what they tell me. I care…I never like people being left out so I try to include them and learn what I can so they don’t feel lonely…but I’m only met with “oh I didn’t know you liked that?!” After saying I liked it almost five times in the last ten minutes of conversation but they can remember what everyone else likes.

I feel so alone right now.

What's worse is that the people who pointed this out to me this morning were being patronising about it. Tell me I'm 'special', that I'm Rain Man. I'm far from being super intelligent.

1425,_Sphynxx_,1640350851,1,"So, like many people who are part of this subreddit, I'm not the best person someone would meet when it comes to human interaction, friendships, et cetera. Christmas is now closer than ever, soon the New Year will knock at our doors, and I took some time to think about how I dealt with such things throughout 2021, which I'd like to share with whoever reads this.

I'm still a teenager, so, you know, this should probably have been the best moment of my whole life to get friends, date someone; to live, in short. Ever since I was 14, however, my ''social life'' has been all about meeting new people and seeing how they just disappear right before my eyes - people change and people go, just as modern life says so. Eventually, I got used to being the ''second option'' for everyone around me, the friend someone would look for when there wasn't anyone else to go after, the one who would be left behind in the end, and I gladly played this role for a good few years, since it was the best thing I had.

What I'm trying to say is: somehow, I'm ''biologically unable'' to build lasting relationships of any kind. I hate talking about myself, but during these years I have at least been trying to be friendly, supportive, the person someone could count on... Such things were fruitless, after all. In this year, I was finally able to face the fact that, no matter how much I try, nothing will change, and no matter how much I try to be ''the best version of myself'' each year - learning from my mistakes, for instance -, I will never be enough for anything.

The highlight of 2021, for me, was the fact that I had a chance to reedify a connection with a pretty important person from my past, the ''fuse'' needed for all the effort I mentioned in the previous paragraph - that is, the person who made me want to actually change something. I got out of my shell many times because of this ''friend'', and I got happier than ever while doing so, but in the end, just like everyone else, this person is slowly going away as a new year comes, and it's not even her fault; it's mine because I'm just not someone people would like to be around, even if I tried to change that for countless years.

After being ''numb'' for something like seven weeks since I got in touch with that friend again, I'm facing reality one more time. Once January 1st, 2022 comes, I'II send an e-mail to that person expressing how grateful I am for knowing her, specifically, how grateful I am for how she made me forget how alone I'II be soon enough...

... I don't think she will care enough to read this now since most of my last messages have been ignored, but if this friend comes to feel down someday, even if we aren't in touch anymore, may those thoughts of mine will help her to get through it somehow... I hope so.

I don't what's the point of this post, maybe I just wanted to share what I've been feeling about this with people who may feel the same, maybe I just wanted to look for a solution I couldn't find yet... Anyway, I wish you all a Happy Christmas beforehand and finish this by saying that I hope things get better for all of you next year.

Peace.

I know as a guy I'm just gonna sound like a people pleaser. If you wanna think that be my guest.

It just pisses me off, we all have feelings, girls or guys. It doesn't matter who you are, you all have emotions whether you like it or not. All you guys are doing by being weird, is actually ruining it not only for yourself, but for every guy who's just trying to be a decent human being and find a friend. I have found it incredibly hard to find a friend and am still searching. Guys seem to get bored easily if you're a fellow guy, and understandably girls are hesitant to talk to guys (in general I know not everyone is like this) 

All I ask is if you're one of those, take a look at yourself.. A real look and think about your actions. They are tormenting people, you're ruining their emotions by being weird and sexual all the time.

Let me reach you to master your mind and be in control instead of your mind and it’s feelings control you.

Whenever you feel the sensation of being alone, remember it’s your mind playing games and trying to control you. When you feel lonely, time for you to meditate on that and tell your mind to obey you. 

Follow these steps:

1. Mediate daily, hourly if need be for up to 60 minutes. Make sure to listen to your surroundings and not pay attention to thoughts.

2. Step outside in the sun, do some activity, exercise and expose your skin to the sun. For advanced levels, sun bathe but place your hand palms facing the sun it’s an Ancient Egyptian technique passed down in my family. 

3. Be present in everything you do, if you feel stress, push through it don’t escape. If you feel worried push through it. Go where you hate going and face the fears. You’ll become a brick and all powerful.

My mom has been struggling with her mental health and addiction to pills all my life. Honestly this is the key problem to most of my childhood trauma. I’ve gotta so good a repressing bad memories that I can’t even recall parts of my childhood. I never realized how poor and damaged was until I came to college. 

I worked my ass off in highschool just to get to college but was too depressed to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I did really bad in school and almost lost my financial aid. My grades have never dropped below a 3.0 in high school. I feel like a failure. I’ve been doing better just not great. I got a 2.5 this semester.

1494,Gamer555Lu,1640321375,1,"It's kinda late over here and I'm locked in the bathroom, as I normally am around this hour.

I dont really know if there's a proper way to structure what I want to say but I guess I'll start by expressing how I feel. Over the past year, I've made a sizable friend group that I talk to everyday. In the beginning, I felt close to these people, I had recently dropped a friend that was dear to my heart cause they were actively trying to make me feel inferior as ""to level the field"" and I sort of just became attached to the nights we'd spend talking about random shit. Of course, as time progressed, they kept their lives going, and with this came romantic ventures or whatever the fuck you wanna call them. Essentially, all of my friends except a couple would get coupled up with someone, in or around the group. I'm not the greatest guy romantically, and my track record this year has been awful (long story short, my depression and self-hatred issues interfered with a relationship I was building and any other girl I liked or was interested in did not share the same sentiment.) but I cannot explain how lonely it feels to see people around you all happy and fulfilled with their partner when I want that same feeling so bad. I find myself feeling hurt after dumb comments from my friends even though I know they don't mean to hurt me, and I'm overwhelmed easily by this. Getting out of bed is hard cause my days don't seem exciting, and the things I enjoy (making music, videogames, friends) don't bring the same joy they used to. I barely talk to friends by starting conversations, cause I don't know how to anymore, and I don't wanna feel like a nuisance, especially when almost all of them don't share the same feelings, whether that be cuz of their mental or situations. Shows and movies can momentarily feel alright to enjoy, but at the end of the day I find myself in the same mental hole of just losing time. Even when I go out, I space out and begin spiraling down until I feel numb. And, as dark as it is, I have thought so many times to just start a drug addiction to feel some emotional high or just ending this shit cuz then I won't feel like a corpse of what I used to be. 

If anyone has any advice on how to start getting out there, mental health advice for people with similar issues or just a quote that lets you get out of bed easier, don't be afraid to send them to me or dropping below.",lonely,"I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't want to exist, amongst people who are thriving.",2021-12-24 15:49:35

i just miss feeling alive.

i miss human connection. i miss contact. i miss laughing. i miss being myself. i miss going out with friends.

i don't have anybody anymore. i have my sister, who i have to live with now as i was kicked out of my previous living situation, and i have one very close friend who i'm probably in love with, though he's told me he has no romantic feelings for me. (i'll call him L.) that's about it.

my sister's family is very private, and run on a tight schedule; they don't want people they don't know coming to the house, even to pick me up or drop me off, even L was a stretch and there was a lot of questioning before he was allowed to drop me off here after work. but it's their house, not mine, so i respect this.

i just feel so stuck. physically and mentally. i'm not sure what to do with myself other than: eat, exercise, work. i wish i had friends to go out with. close friends. i'm bad at making them though, and L is far too busy to see me that often, and he's also going to ireland next college semester. he won't be back until june. not even sure if my living situation will remain the same until then.

i just feel so awful. i want to be held. i want to have sex with someone that i trust; just for the intimacy, more than anything else. 

lately all i've been wanting to do is go over to L's, lay with him, watch stupid shit, talk, maybe play around on my switch, maybe fuck. more than anything I think I just miss cuddling, especially naked. the other day we hugged, and we were both wearing pretty heavy jackets due to the weather, but i had my face pressed against his neck and it just felt like so much. i didn't want to let go because of it.

1499,geekyguy4,1640319558,1,"I had a thought while reading this sub.

I thought this place was meant to help us connect and make each other feel loved, so we can all start feeling a little better about ourselves because of that love we receive and also give. (And maybe every once in a blue moon we make friends)

But all too often it feels like people come here to vent about their problem which are pretty similar in nature given the subreddit.. and they either expect encouragement, advice or empathy but that is often unclear or maybe they don't even know.

And often when people give advice or encouragement to me (or I'm reading it on another post), it doesn't resonate with me. While I really appreciate them taking their time and effort to help but most of the time I already know what I should be doing which in general is to leave my comfort zone by meeting new people irl or start working out or to love myself more, but reading some random strangers advice rarely has an impact on me even when I 100% agree with it.

So that's why I think if we make each other feel less alone and more loved, it will help (at least it would me) to have a bit more self worth, motivation and mental energy to start and keep doing what we need to do to improve.

I would go about doing this by:

Trying to understand not just what the poster wants to tell but also what they want to hear

I try to have a conversation not just give advice because weirdly enough I rarely have any convo with anyone on here which doesn't help because I feel lonely even around other lonely people. And when someone says feel free to dm them what am I suppose to talk about? I always like when a convo organically forms thats why I try to comment now in a way that could start a convo.

Also joke about stuff. I don't see that very often here but I think humor could really help in these situations to relate to each other and build a connection.

I'm very much ignorant to the people that are here for encouragement but please tell me I'm not alone with that not helping.

I'm sorry if this is not very coherent but Its very late and I don't think rewording it for longer would yield any benefits.

I cannot think of a legitimate reason to try when failure is all I get. I've been cheated on, led on, gaslit, lied to and nobody takes me seriously.

It doesn't matter how much I cry for help and comfort, nobody thinks I'm serious about my issues or they just think it's a small issue I'll overcome. It's not. Loneliness is ruining my life and it's eating away at me every day. 

I have to stop myself from seething with rage when I see couples. I have to pretend to be happy for people when they enter a relationship despite feeling nothing but contempt. I can't think of a reason to trust a woman after all the bullishit I've experienced. I try to be a good person despite all this. However:

At least if I become a horrible person I'll have some kind of attention. I'm one negative experience away from giving everything up and just being a shitty human being.

I want to have a Christmas with my whole family including my cousins, aunt, uncle and have fun. I have been waiting for Christmas because this is the only time that is for sure we're complete, all 5 of us. I just wanted to play games, eat, take pictures, sing and just have fun. I never had Christmas without them as far as I remember. I wanted to give them the thing I was supposed to give them but I guess I just wasted money on it. I just hope that everything is ok next year. All year I prayed that they stop fighting about small things. This Christmas it's just probably me, my mom and my brother. I wish Older Cousin 1 was here to talk to. I have so much going on in my mind but has nobody to tell that understands it. I hope that I can fix this Christmas.  I had so much hope that Boy Cousin would stay for Christmas but I just got my hopes up. I hate getting my hopes up because I start to hate people and think so much that my brain can't keep up and then I burst into tears. This is the Christmas that I wouldn't forget because I know it's supposed to be a happy day, the birth of Jesus but the only thing I wanted was to have my best cousins. Christmas is the only day I probably forget about everything I worry about and I forget any bad thoughts in my mind. I know this Christmas everybody in my family is showing smiles but inside they're probably crying but some are actually happy. I want to look into everyone's thoughts and find their thoughts about me because they might not even like me or I'm just you know they love me because I'm just their family. I always wanted to have happy thoughts on Christmas because It's supposed to be a happy day but now everyone is going without thinking about me. My feelings as I should be also considered. I always wanted to tell each one of them how much I want them to be close. I want to show them that  they meant something for me. I’ll explain how much I hate them this holiday season.

Christmas sucks if you are alone and I'm talking truly alone. For context, my GF broke off with me on Halloween but I am off better for sure, my family isn't as much a family but  a work group of people held together by unfortunate circumstances and the mindset to make the “last years” of my grandparents enjoyable. I spend 3 days crammed together with my parents and my grandparents, as I said because “it might be their last one with us” and I can understand that to some extent, 3 days because its my granddads birthday on the 26th.  

I have 2 real friends and a couple of lets call them acquaintances that care more what I can do for them than be there for me or care how I’m doin. The Girl i was seeing and got along great with decided to start a hot / cold game on me which I resent and don’t deal with, I'm too old for such bullshit. No matter how many people are around me I feel alone and out of place. At no place is this more true than my family since it's basically nothing but a big sharad since I don't want to be here, my parents are just still together because of the money and my grandparents don't do anything but complain about everything. Yay Christmas spirit. 

To add to that I battle chronic pain, which then caused severe depression as well for nearly 2 years now and I just can't anymore. I do nothing but act around people, crack jokes and go to bed silently crying wishing everything would end. 

I doubt the right women beside me would change much about this but still it’s loney, more so even than during summer even though I can't really say why I feel that way.

I really get it that loneliness can make people feel terrible and sometimes drive into the state of depression.

But why don't you try to show some compassion to yourself? Hopes of being with somebody won't make you feel better. And even if you'd find a person to be with, there's a chance the relationship wouldn't work for out for you well. And even if it would work well for you, you'd still be too dependent on the person you are attached to. Being overly-dependent on something comes with a risk of getting hurt.

That probably sounds negative, but it's also the real world we're living in. My suggestion would be to stop relying on someone else to fix your loneliness.

So now you're lonely and I'm some random stranger on reddit who's telling you to remain like that. Well no, I wish you well and wish that you start showing compassion to yourself. You are a worthy person, you are amazing the way you are and you should feel happy with yourself. But you don't need me or anyone else to tell you this. You have to try to feel like you are loved and that love has to come from inside of you.

1586,VeryMentallyStable,1640276221,1,"Can feel my skin tightening up as I type this out. Can’t remember the last time someone even touched me at all. I don’t have anyone in my life at all, no friends, no family, definitely no girlfriend. Guess I’ve never been the type for any of that. Been unemployed for the past couple months so I don’t even have co-workers or acquaintances. Thing is, I prefer it like this. The touch starvation is awful, but the bullshit that comes with having people in your life is much worse. 

I just wish my fucking brain would get the memo, I don’t like people. Me and people don’t mix. So it’s infuriating to me that my body gets this hunger, this intense need to feel someone’s skin on mine. Feels like being born allergic to water or something. 

Part of me wants sex, bigger part of me knows better. I’m actually terrified of sex at this point. Can’t connect with people and I guess I need to feel that with someone before hand, because I’ve never been able to orgasm during sex in my entire life. Basically given up by now. Only so many times I can have that conversation with someone. Guess as a guy, you’re expected to orgasm every single time, so when you don’t it’s impossible to explain it without your partner feeling like they’ve done something wrong or they’re not good enough. Plus I just feel broken. So I dread the thought of sex ever coming up somehow.

But I think the thing I crave more than anything is to just hold someone. Keep picturing having someone next to me in bed at night. Feeling her warmth. Feeling her soft skin against mine. The scent of her hair. The way her smaller body slots together perfectly with my own taller frame as we spoon. Hearing her soft breaths cut through the deafening silence that’s always here. The feeling of knowing someone actually *wants* to be in my arms. Even hug a fucking pillow while I sleep cause it’s something. 

But I can’t have any of that. I’ve only ever met one person I’d even considered doing any of that with and she didn’t feel the same. And besides, in hindsight what I felt for her wasn’t love, it was something much uglier; obsession. I tend to poison any semblance of beauty when it enters my life. Think it’s just tar that runs through my veins. Not to mention she proved to be just as disappointing as everyone else in the end. So I can’t form connections and the thought of doing any of this with someone I feel nothing for is enough to make me want to kill myself. 

Therapy, medication, none of it seems to be able to help me form those connections so I guess these are just needs I’ll never be able to satisfy. Can’t even go get a fucking massage cause I don’t like the thought of strangers touching me while I can’t see them and also I’m almost entirely covered in deep self-harm scars I never want anyone to see. I know they don’t judge or at least would never mention it or whatever, but I know that just feeling eyes on those scars would tense me up so much that any benefit of going in the first place would be null and void. Guess I’ll just have to live with this hunger forever.",lonely,"I’ve never felt more touch starved, and yet I can’t think of anything worse than being touched",2021-12-24 03:17:01
1587,LingLingSpirit,1640275927,1,"*Discription before poem:*

So basically it's poem, but doesn't rhyme in English, so sorry.

""
There are two sides of me,
one is going through segment one,
second is going through segment two
Regardless of which is harder to go through,
of which is longer to go through,
of which is more moral to go through,
I will choose one,
and I won't like it.

I'm not talking to you nor world,
I'm talking to the worst monster alive,
and that's myself.
But why should I apologize for being a monster?
Has anyone ever apologized for turning me into one?
We are not monsters
but at some point in life the pain was too much,
and I finally broke.

One segment leads to loneliness,
where I accomplish my bucket list,
and hopes that the one who is being loved is happy.
Second segment leads to selfishness,
where I am with the one who is being loved,
but that one who is being loved is with monster.
I won't let that one to be with monster!

Both segments leads to pain,
which I keep all inside,
because I would rather the pain destroy me,
than anyone else.
Don't worry,
it's going to be fine.
Because once you die,
It won't hurt anymore.

*Description after poem:*

So I have two reasons why I am posting this - 

1. I like to create, so whatever it is (literature, art, etc), I want to share it. 

2. I feel lonely. 
Obviously. 

And because of that, I don't want this poem to be only in my notes, but to show it to internet. Regardless of views, I just want to have it somewhere were it can be seen by others, not only in my notes. So basically, this is just my online diary. 



Also as the context of the poem's pasting... The theme is, I feel lonely, even though I have family and friends.
But I still free as in the box - noone really knows my feelings. And because I have this one crush (for about 8 years, so it's not just *something* ), I feel lonelier. All I want (what is the second segment), is to see my crush be happy (with or without me), do all of my stuff in my bucket list and than die in peace. What makes me the lonely feeling is that I never asked for having crush on someone, because even now I don't want to be with that person in relationship, but only see that person happy. 
And while I have friends and family, but I can't show and share those accomplishments with someone I romantically love, what is the point than? 
*What's the point when you win a contest, when you can't share the progress with anyone? Even if you win, the good feeling will soon fall, and lonely feeling will rise* - for a reason. 

Ergo, I do those accomplishments, and die in peace. But while I still breathe, I hate that feeling of loneliness. 

Maybe, I want your help to not feel so lonely.",lonely,Loneliness (My poem),2021-12-24 03:12:07
1588,ChewDipp,1640275201,1,"Everyday I can feel myself grow more and more bitter with my loneliness. This last week I went to see my friends who I haven't visited in a while and the entire time I was angry. I got to their place, intending on spending a fun time catching up and celebrating a birthday and the whole trip, from the moment got to town till the second I got back to my place, I spent angry and trying to hide it.

First it was seeing everyone from my hometown and high school dating someone. Not anyone in particular, just it seemed like everyone I saw had someone, and knowing their past just made me so much more angry. The worst part of that was seeing a friend and having to watch how uncaring they were towards partner. 

Then there was going to my friends house that I'm visiting and thinking it would be any different. Nope. There he and his wife are, but on top of that he has two kids so he is the furthest thing from lonely, and complains about his lack of free time, which basically feels like he's rubbing it in.

Finally was probably when I went to our other friends house and he is almost right in the same spot. He's  married, he just had a kid, and he is five days younger than me. The worst part of this is that originally they didn't want kids, so I thought maybe I'd have friends to keep me company, but one accidentally pregnancy later and now they're a family, and I feel bad because I'm not happy like I know I should be.

Either way, everyday I feel myself grow more bitter, and right now I think the best thing I can do is to stay away from my friends. Visiting them was supposed to be a vacation, but all I feels is anger. They both have something I've wanted for as long as I can remember, and one of them didn't even want it.

I spent 4 months at my university in a single dorm, doing 35 hours+ at my 3 part time jobs per week while being on top of my school work barely interacting with anybody that wasn’t a coworker. I went days without speaking to anybody, no meaningful conversations and I hated it. 

I told my friends and my gf back home that I was alone and tired and sad and I wanted to go back home and hang out with them. I’ve been home for almost two weeks now and not one of them wants to hang out. I’ve literally been crying over how alone I feel. I just go to work, come home and play video games alone in my room while crying. 

I learned a few days ago my friends went to see the new spider man movie without me :( I fucking love spider man. Nobody even told me they were going, nobody even asked, they all knew I would be home :( 

Every time I ask my gf to hang out she’s always busy and says tomorrow instead but when tomorrow comes she’s hanging out with her friends or cousins. 

I feel so fucking disposable, how come all these people that I would bend over backwards and help and the drop of a dime, all they would have to do is say the word, why do they not care about me?

Some days ago he told me that he'd like to send me a Christmas card. That took me by surprise because we are not friends; we just talk business. But he asked for my mailing address, and I gave him.

It turns out I gave him my sister’s address because it’s been a while since the mail stopped sending stuff to my house. But as he has my actual address (because I sent him invoices in the past with my real address), he surely noticed I gave a mailing address that is different from my actual address.

Well, I don’t see any problem with that, but I took a closer look at my sister’s address, and I noticed her address is really complicated to understand, so anyone who wants to send something to her address needs to be as specific as possible. It turns out my client lives in another country, so I’m almost sure he will have trouble sending the card. I gave him the address in the most detailed way possible, but I still think he will have trouble with that.

After I gave him the address, he didn’t say a word, and it’s been 15 days since I don’t hear back from him, so I assume he gave up sending the Christmas card.

TBH, I’d rather he gives up sending the Christmas card because I don’t care about Christmas and even less about Christmas cards. But it turns out that every end of the year, I like to send messages to those I value , and I certainly like him a lot and want to send a message. Then I was thinking about sending him a new year’s email around December 27th or 28th.

But I imagine that if he sent the Christmas card, he’ll ask if it arrived, and I’ll have to say no, which might upset him.

Some days ago he told me that he'd like to send me a Christmas card. That took me by surprise because we are not friends; we just talk business. But he asked for my mailing address, and I gave him.

It turns out I gave him my sister’s address because it’s been a while since the mail stopped sending stuff to my house. But as he has my actual address (because I sent him invoices in the past with my real address), he surely noticed I gave a mailing address that is different from my actual address.

Well, I don’t see any problem with that, but I took a closer look at my sister’s address, and I noticed her address is really complicated to understand, so anyone who wants to send something to her address needs to be as specific as possible. It turns out my client lives in another country, so I’m almost sure he will have trouble sending the card. I gave him the address in the most detailed way possible, but I still think he will have trouble with that.

After I gave him the address, he didn’t say a word, and it’s been 15 days since I don’t hear back from him, so I assume he gave up sending the Christmas card.

TBH, I’d rather he gives up sending the Christmas card because I don’t care about Christmas and even less about Christmas cards. But it turns out that every end of the year, I like to send messages to those I value , and I certainly like him a lot and want to send a message. Then I was thinking about sending him a new year’s email around December 27th or 28th.

But I imagine that if he sent the Christmas card, he’ll ask if it arrived, and I’ll have to say no, which might upset him. Like, I’m not close to him, but I think he has some extra consideration for me because it really takes a lot of effort to send things to another country, so I don’t want to make things awkward between us, but I also don’t know what to do in this situation. Please help me; this is stressing me out.",lonely,"My client wants to send me a Christmas card, and that us giving me anxiety",2021-12-24 01:30:51

I always knew my period affected me way more than normal, way more than other people, but I've always been dismissed by doctors time after time. For 16 years. Today, I'm 29 and I got an official diagnosis for PMDD. I self diagnosed myself about a year or maybe more ago, and today I got a legal diagnosis made by my ginecologist. Its an important event, because its a starting point for having legal backup for what happens to me, so people believe me, and that's so sad that it actually is like that, but I have it today.

If I hadn't diagnosed myself first I still would be without an official diagnosis, that's also so outrageous. But it's how life works.

1607,VeryMentallyStable,1640263544,1,"I don’t get how anyone else does it. How can anyone be content to be here? How do people not just hit a certain age where they just kinda realise this is all there is and that it’s fucking boring? You just do the same shit basically every day, just fill in time each day over and over again until one day, if you’re lucky, you die of old age. There’s no substance to any of it. None of it matters. Nothing feels worth doing to me. 

I’ve tried to find some kind of enjoyment or just something in anything, I really have. It’s not like I *want* to feel like everything anyone does on this planet is worthless. But I guess I can’t force myself to care and I really just can’t see the point of any of it. There’s people who find meaning in their work, but I don’t have any career goals, there’s no job I’m ever going to care about more than just to pay my rent. Which that alone feels like enough reason to off myself, because you spend a majority of your time on the planet at work and so if you know you’re not the type of person who’s ever going to care about it, that means most of your time here might as well not happen.

I’ve tried finding hobbies I enjoy, but I just can’t. It’s like something is missing in me. Best I can hope for is that I can get a day or two of distraction before I realise how bored I am again and put down the hobby because I don’t see the point anymore. Tried getting outside, travelling, but it’s pointless too. Everywhere just feels the same to me. Basically just me being suicidally depressed but with a different background. 

Tried finding a point in people, but fuck are we just a disappointing species. I can’t connect with anyone. Most people are just fucking worthless. Only ever met one person who I even remotely *wanted* to hang out with and she turned out to be just as shitty as the rest of them, just took her sweet fucking time to show it. Even worse because apparently part of my brain didn’t get the memo and so I still have this inbuilt need for connection or even just for sex, but I literally can’t fulfil either of them. Feels like being born allergic to water or something. I know I can’t have any real connection with anyone, but apparently I need to in order to have sex. I’ve tried so many times  without it and it’s just awful. It makes me feel weirdly sick and I literally can’t orgasm. I’ve never once been able to orgasm during sex. Guess it’s just one more way in broken. The only time I’ve ever experienced any kind of sexual satisfaction has been in dreams, and in those it’s usually with that one old friend who I actively try to keep out of my head so even whatever small comfort those dreams might’ve brought is corrupted.

Only conclusion I can reach is that I just don’t fucking belong here. Clearly I’m missing some critical pieces that I need to be able to feel like living another 50+ years of this shit is anything but awful. But yet I’m still here because I guess even killing myself is more energy than I have left to expend.

1611,SmoothCCriminal,1640260181,1,"PS: this is a long vent, originally posted as a comment to a post which I related to 10/10

Dear OP, and all the peeps who relate to this, I've got a message that you'll sooner or later realise and feel by yourself.

Yes, I'm one of you and I've felt the same. I've felt unwanted In groups, I'm extremely bad making friends, i always wondered how the popular kids out there got to where they are, yada yada.

I've spent years, a whole decade to be precise,...alone, coming home to an empty house, lying in bed doing nothing productive and staring at the ceiling.

Things started changing when i started watching anime out of boredom( attack on Titan, to be precise) developed a strong interest in a particular character that was really really popular in the anime fandom. This character was exceptionally skilled and has this do-not-fuck-with-me attitude . Did I relate to him? Hell no.. im smart enough to know and accept that I've got nothing special or unique. Then why am i talking about this guy? Well... It happens to be the case that this guy hangs out with absolutely no one, has zero social life, and not once, not once has it been shown that he longs for social interaction.

That's when I thought, there's a good chance that i actually don't give a fuck about making connections, why? Because 9/10 times I meet shallow people, maybe I'm losing out on great people...but taking that chance involves me having to deal with irritating and bothersome people I've befriended Just to get to know them better. Because knowing people takea time.

I thought hard trying to recollect my childhood. Did I really want to be in groups so desperately? Did I really want to be one of those popular kids? If i did...I'd definitely would have put my heart into it and moved mountains to win the approval of kids. I did absolutely nothing. I just went back home, alone and felt gloomy 24/7 !! And repeated this cycle over and over again for years and this expressionless, lifeless face stuckk. 
Why was i gloomy? I wasn't happy. Or was i? How do i know what the meaning of happiness is? Have i just accepted the society's interpretation of happiness that it lies in making meaningful connections, making tons of money, having a girlfriend etc? And yet made no efforts in those directions? Boils down to just one reason that this tiny brain of mine can think of....
I NEVER GAVE A RATS ASS ABOUT ANYTHING IN LIFE, and truly loved going with the flow. If  society's gonna label that as incompetent, anti social ,ambitionless.., so be it. I don't care about that either anyways. 


That my friends, was the day i felt liberated. I don't even care if I'm the only one feeling like this. Im good! Now that I've gotten decades worth of baggage Outta my heart and head.... I realised that i hadn't done so bad afterall! I was a brilliant kid in my school, college, and I've got a job that makes me get into the zone every single day, and I've delivered excellent results! I've had two serious relationships which didn't go well, but the heartbreak from those made me realise the countless issues I've successfully dodged all my life by not interacting at all. 

Now guys, look. If this comment ends up hurting sentiments regarding "" no! Humans are social creatures, how dare you say otherwise "" , i just wanna hug you and say I didn't mean to hurt you one bit. This is what my path in life made me see things from your perspective, and it in no ways should claim other mainstream perspectives are wrong.

1638,xfallenangelx95,1640244084,1,"If you want to send me a message &amp; try to be my friend – read my post :) I want you to read everything to avoid unecessary misunderstandings .ONLY chat requests and Private messages - PLEASE :)

I’m on reddit only because I want to find a friend – life can be tough and we don’t always get what we want.

I used to have so called „friends” but..they’re no longer in my life.Why? I don’t know but let me tell you one thing – A true friend would never just give up on you for no solid reason.What kind of friend would I like to meet on reddit? What are my expectations?

I would like to meet someone in a similar situation – why? Because I honestly feel like only a person with the same expectations and a similar outlook on life would get along with me. I want to talk to other people on a daily basis mainly because..I want to see someone’s effort and because I don’t want to feel like someone’s last option! Not again.Just to make things clear – I’m NOT forcing anyone to talk to me and I’m fully aware that not everyone has enough time to talk to others often and I know one more thing – not everyone wants to talk to other people on a daily basis which I completely do – UNDERSTAND.I often feel misunderstood by people who read my posts.People always giving me unwanted advice and criticising me are just wrong..I’m not a needy person! What I’m simply suggesting is that It’s always possible to find someone to have a random conversation with – someone willing to send you one message once or twice a week..but..It’s almost impossible to find people willing to make time for you.I’m not asking a busy person to make time for me by changing some plans! Absolutely! I’m here to find someone who wants to talk daily (throughout the day or maybe even night) of one’s own will.Someone looking for the same kind of connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their ""friends"" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you. I have a lot of free time (I don't want anyone to send me a message only out of sympathy or boredom though - friendships shouldn't be forced) so..send me a message only If you want to talk often and If you're a talkative person) I'm not really interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful messages. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.

&amp;#x200B;

•	I do NOT respond to any „Hey,hmu” or „u want to talk” type of messages (super short messages or messages full of abbreviations – I literally can’t stand abbreviations and acronyms in text messages)

•	I don’t talk to people underage and people way older than me (If you want to know why I just don’t feel comfortable talking to kids and people old enough to be my parents – especially online) 18-35 age range (I'm 26)

•	I’m not on reddit to get something off my chest or to find someone to talk to from time to time so If you’re too busy to talk to me or don’t want to talk often..just don’t contact me - I'm not trying to be rude - I just don't want to feel like someone's last option again - I've had enough of ""busy friends"" which is why now I'm looking for something different

•	I’m not looking for a relationship or someone to flirt with so If you want to be „more than friends” find someone else.

•	I don’t respond to messages I don’t find interesting which is why I DON’T mind being ghosted by people who think I’m not „for them” being ghosted after exchanging one or two messages doesn’t bother me.What bothers me is being ghosted by someone I like.Being ignored by someone after days or weeks of daily conversations.

•	I want to talk on reddit first just to make sure If we’re a good match.I’m also not interested in group chats

•	I would rather talk to someone from Europe because Europe is my continent (similar timezones) but even If you’re from the US (for example) but have enough time to talk often –you can send me a message.I just don’t want to wait any longer than 6 or 7 hours to receive a single message that can be typed in a few seconds – max minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Why can’t you see any of my interests listed down below? Because what really matters to me is..who you are (If you’re honest,talkative,understanding,caring and trustworthy – for example) just simply – It matters to me what you’re like! not what you like.Don’t get me wrong – you can tell me what you like or dislike but in my personal opinion common interests are important mainly when you want to find a gaming buddy on reddit (for example) or If you want to meet someone to hang out with in real life and..go bowling for example.What most redditors seem to care about are common interests – I don’t. I get along with other people despite having completely different hobbies but I absolutely don’t get along with people way different than me (different exceptations and outlook on life – some aspects of life – way different sense of humor or personality traits – It’s just an example)

Let me tell you one more thing „why does she have more/different expectations than other people?” Dear people – We ALL can choose what kind of people we’d like to talk to and maybe even become really good friends with and I? I don’t want anyone to be disappointed.We all have some expectations after all.(there are people out there looking for someone to play games with – for example – and I’m not one of them)I’ve met a lot of people forcing themselves to talk to me or talking to me out of boredom and I don’t want to experience anything of that nature ever again.Friendships should be natural – not forced.Both people wanting to be friends should feel comfortable and have something in common.

I'd rather talk to someone in a similar situation.Someone friendless..Don't get me wrong - most people deserve to be happy and It's good to have friends but people who have friends in real life are usually more focused on them &amp; have less time for others.Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on.Sometimes I feel like the only friendless &amp; rejected person in the world.I love warm-hearted people.Sensitive people who always try to understand others.Empathy is everything but please don’t send me a message if you’re another person in a different situation just willing to „help” me.

Imagine never getting any messages from others..always waiting for someone to text you..waiting &amp; waiting..spending most of your time at home (not by choice) I really wish I had at least one person in my life.One person who would make me feel important.If you really need someone to talk to due to loneliness and If you have time to talk to me daily (throughout the day and even night)I always make time for others.I'm literally always available.I could even stay up all night long only to talk to someone  I’m ready to commit but only If there’s some chemistry between me and someone else.I don’t do anything forcefully.

If you want to talk to me tell me your story - tell me why you're on reddit,what kind of friend would you like to meet :)et cetera

One more thing.I’m not looking for any advice – If you don’t want to talk just ignore my post or even block me but don't judge me and don't suggest me to change only because of you disagreeing with me.I'm not hurting anyone by being who I am and I'd never change for someone who doesn't even know me. I don't need more criticsm in my life or..sadness.

1644,detroitsmash3,1640241265,1,"Made this Reddit just to vent somewhere cause I feel like I’m losing my mind. Falling into a super deep depressive episode cause of how lonely I’m feeling. For years I’ve had fake friends fall left and right which I fine. But the one friend which is my best friend for like 7 years now I thought was solid really only hangs out or talks to me when it’s her only option. I completely get you don’t have to talk and see someone everyday to be friends but it’s a difference when they only want to talk to you cause they have nothing better to do. 

Like for example she brought up how she went to see the new Spider-Man movie with a group of “new friends” and I’m like that’s cool but kinda sucks for me cause I’d rather her had just keep that to herself cause I felt like it was a complete slap in the face. You can go hangout with literally everyone else including new people but not your “bestfriend”? And plus we work at the same job and we just recently started and she treats her new co workers wayyy better than me already lol. Like for example she was walking out with new co workers after work and I was also getting ready to leave cause the store was closing. She had to go back for something and she assumed that her co worker had left her so she saw I was still there and I guess she decided she’d walk out with me since “they left her already”. But the co worker came back and asked my friend if she was coming and my friend left without hesitation never looking back at me to even say bye. Ik this isn’t a super huge deal I just wanted to give some recent examples of how I feel she using me when it’s convenient for her. Like she only hangs out with me if she’s bored and has no choice. And basically how I’m just completely over my bestfriend cause I just told her this past summer I feel like I’m now only a convenient friend for her. 

It sucks to constantly go to work and home cause you have no where to be cause no one wants to hangout with you. Can leave my phone for days and come back to no messages or anything. I’m in my 20s and honestly feel pathetic to even be going through this. Idk if it’s me or if I just have a bad habit of picking the wrong people to be friends with but I feel so pushed aside and isolated that it hurts.

It's given me direction while also finding myself and has lead me to live to be the person that I want to be (I've lost 25 lbs, am lifting successfully, am being more honest/compassionate, spending time on investments and hobbies, reflecting what's important to me and emphasizing that in my life, and has made me more in tune with my emotional side). While this all sounds great, I feel more alone than I ever have in my entire life. People see the progress that I'm making and I just say ""thanks"" but never able to tell them why I've made these improvements to my life. I want to tell someone so badly about it that it's painful. It's comparable to being behind a glass flooded with water and I'm not making any sounds as I scream. It's unbearable and it happens to be confusing since it's both one of the happiest and saddest points I've ever been in in my life. I've even joined a subreddit here that mightve been able to help me but the mods were too strict and kicked me (once again, not anything illegal or immoral, just went against a rule within the sub) they mightve been the one group who could've helped but even that flame was snuffed out. 

Im still going to stick with this direction and determination that I've gotten from this since it's given me a better sense of purpose in this universe, but that doesn't mean that it's easy since Im essentially going down this path alone because I'm petrified whqt people would think.",lonely,Loneliness keeping things in,2021-12-23 13:53:19

1696,Dontdoubleclick,1640214900,1,"Hello reader,

I'm not quite sure where to begin this post, even writing it I feel unsure as to what to say or where it'll end. I suppose the title sums up the topic of the post at least so that seems like a good start.

&amp;#x200B;

3 days ago I broke up with my girlfriend, in the moment I felt so done with trying to fight for someone who had given up. Some context to that: We hit a rough patch where she found herself always being negative, she'd find faults in everything, bad mouth my friends and say things that would hurt me and even though we would talk about everything and find solutions and what I thought was resolving things, she'd either find the solutions to not be good enough or she would agree to them and not follow through. I understand being in a rough patch, I understand feeling down since I've been there sooooo many times myself but in the end I came to the realisation that she isn't really fit to be with anyone right now, she didn't have the emotional capacity or time to share her life with someone. I tried so hard but being hurt one too many times, I had enough and ended it.

Now, I've thought countless times about wanting her back and trying harder, trying more and just ignoring her red flags and flaws but then I think about how she'd tweet about me, what she would tell people around us about me and how she dumped our drama on my friends making them pissed at me because she'd go to them. I also think about how she has this romanticised idea about dating and how she thinks/wants someone to just swoop in and make everything alright, heal her past scarrs and fit into her self-centered personality but even with all that, a part of me still wants her back and I don't know if it's because I still hold on to feelings for her where a part of me still loves her or if it's because I just feel so utterly lonely and lost.

&amp;#x200B;

In the short amount of time that's passed since, I've gone from finally thinking I found someone, someone to build something with, a potential future, riiiight back to that nice, cozy feeling of perpetual loneliness. I feel so outside looking in, like all my friends have their lives and goals, friends and partners and I'm sat here with nothing. I can barely talk to the friends I do have because the conversation would eventually end up about how down I feel about my break up.

I used to be have a somewhat easy time making friends and finding something to do or someone to do things with but right now I feel like I don't have it in me. I just feel like an outsider and misfit to anyone I talk to and it's making me question if I'm ever going to be able to maintain a long-term relationship whether it be romantic or platonic. This is something that utterly terrifies me because the only thing I want out of life is to find that special someone but at this point, I can barely maintain a friendship and with that lil' nugget of insecurity out, I don't even know where I could begin to go up from here. Over the years I've somewhat learned how I can get myself out of ruts or a bad period but this time it feels different, just feel stuck and blind. I want to get more social in real life instead of on the PC but don't even know how you'd go on about doing that where I live.

&amp;#x200B;

1703,ExtremeTaco1,1640209759,1,"Bear with me it’s gonna be long, so I’m 22M never been in a relationship before still have my V-card and definitely makes me feel weird especially being the only person I know that still has it. 

A little backstory, back in high school in the beginning I was bullied very hard because of my looks by people that I used to be friends with in elementary, to this day I never understood why they did this but it really did some damage and left me extremely depressed and for a point in time with zero friends except my online friends I played games with. 

I never viewed myself as attractive and had a hard time even looking people in the eyes for awhile back then I had severe insecurities because of all of this as well as trust issues. I started hitting the gym very regularly and eating well back around 5-6 months ago and can now look in the mirror and view myself as attractive something that is very new to me and I’m still not fully used to it. 

One thing I still haven’t experienced is being in a loving committed relationship with somebody. Having someone to talk to at any time, have deep conversations and be intimate with and care for is something I will sometimes dream about. Because of all these insecurities and never feeling like I was good enough I never really attempted dating or doing anything with girls even tho it’s something I’ve wanted for awhile.

But many months back for a period of time I was seeing this girl, was kind of a spontaneous thing we worked together at my old job and we got along quite well and she started flirting with me. As time went on she would come over and we would watch a movie and cuddle, texting everyday, always hugging when saying goodbye, getting goodmoring/goodnight texts, asking how my day was. One of the times we hung out it was late at night and we were outside laying down on some grass looking at the stars and she grabbed my hand and started cuddling me, I swear it felt like something straight outta a movie. I was the most happy I had been in awhile at that time and it felt so great experiencing affection and I didn’t want it to end. It was truly the first time I ever felt wanted or “loved” even if it wasn’t real love it sure felt like it and I fell for her very hard. 

But because of having these insecurities for so long I constantly questioned myself why she liked me and I was overthinking a ton. The thing that I believe messed it up was she came over one night and she was clearly trying to initiate sex but me being so nervous about being inexperienced and not wanting to accidentally make her feel uncomfortable all I did was make out with her and that was it. I think this really disappointed her, she was my first kiss but I never told her.

After that happened she really fell off, she stopped being the same person she was in the beginning it was a slow fade that I was unaware of at the time but it led to being ghosted which hurt like hell and it put me in a really bad state and flooded me with feelings of self doubt and worthlessness feeling that it was all my fault it ended. I beat myself up over this for a good 2 months. This was actually what led to me working out and I’m damn happy it happened because if not I probably wouldn’t have started and would still not like who I am. I’m very proud of how far I’ve come since that bitter sweet time and I think it might have been a blessing in disguise who knows.

I guess what I’m trying to get at here is don’t let your past dictate your future and if someone is showing interest in you don’t question yourself why like I always was and just enjoy the time you spend together and let things progress. Still not 100% keen on dating as of right now especially with the recent surge in covid cases but I still hold out hope that I will someday find someone when I decide to put in the effort.

I can’t stress enough how important self love is as something I’ve only recently discovered and anyone here going through a hard time you will find it you just gotta put in the effort to get better.

I have a bf I see once a week and can talk to online every day. I have a stable job, even if stressful and frustrating. I have a room I can rent and I can now afford good food and some luxury items. 

I just miss connections. Having someone to talk to face-to-face every day, not 2 days per week at most.  

I miss having a home when I used to have a family when younger, even if they were always screaming at each-other. It's been a decade, and I thought by now I could make my own. I did use friendships or work as 'families' in the past, but that doesn't work anymore.

I'm pissed off at my one friend here that she never has time to see me more than 7-8 times per year. But still grateful to have her and I try to take her as is...it's just getting more frustrating.

And further I hate that I have to live with two flatmates who I do not get along with, and forces me yet again to just stay in my room. I can't believe I'm scared to go to the kitchen or toilet so I don't bump into them in my own home. But I guess it's not my home, just a place I can afford to live in.

My mother just came to stay here the past weekend while on transfer to her home country and just reminded me of the 'home' I used to have, which due to her cheating and others I had to leave. 

And now I feel like this, I just want to be left alone even more, which makes the loneliness worse. 

I feel like I need a change, to run away again from this life as I did before and try to make a new one. If things don't change I might next year as a 'present' for my birthday.

And I tried. I really stepped out of my comfort zone but if they tried too, maybe then I would have got a friend. 

It has been almost three years since I had an irl friend. Soon I will be graduating high school and I guess I got used to being alone. But because I was alone, I will never have a friend again. Nowadays I can't even talk to people online, let alone irl. I get anxious when people upvote or comment my posts. It's impossible for me to go and make friends. I became depressed and think about suicide every day. I also think I have avpd

And it makes me angry and sad when someone says they know how it feels and they are alone too. But they always have someone. Like a few irl friends. Or even one. It's not the same. Even if I had a few fake friends I would be happy. But I'm completely alone.

i will never be enough for a girl. most of these girls be already having a boyfriend, stuck on their ex, or already seeing someone. i went out, i approached girls at my retail job, in public. they always said they had a boyfriend, or when they gave me their number’s they always led me on.

i will always be someone option, or some last. im not enough to be a main. my personality is funny. i always make ppl laugh, and ppl told me im cool to talk to, or vent to. i will never meet someone who is single. i will always be someone option, never someone priority.

1729,Yamama77,1640198443,1,"Please don't hate me for this rant, I know they can be repetitive and annoying.

But I grew up with very limited friends.

In school I had a friend I got along with. He got shifted to another section and I never talked to him again because we don't eat lunch together.

In class grade 5/7 I started to form a circle of friends. We were kinda toxic usually insulting each other even though we ate and spent time together it was usually belittling each other. When I graduated from school I ceased all contact with them.

In my 2 years of high school, I was part of a little pack. I was a runt of the pack. Basically a group of friends who would attack other groups of friends, not literally. Usually mocking. Had some good memories of going to the cyber cafe to play counter strike with them. I was considered a brilliant student in school but tanked hard here. I dint fail but my academic performance was miserable. I ceased all contact with my high school friends as soon as I left because I realised they were good for me. One of them does substances and the one of the others had visited brothels.

College was hard to get into, my marks tanked in high school. I had two choices of prestigious colleges, I felt insulted the way I was rejected from one of them. With the guy handling it being very gruff about my performance. The other college however accepted me due to an emphasis of a first come first serve policy. I got into zoology and had good friends.
Let's say B, A, O were my closer mates a foreigner L and G were my other good mates. G was very lazy and I dint get to interact with him much in the later semesters as he slipped college alot. B, A, O were good and polite friends not like the toxic wolf packs I was part off in my past. L was a lout and he drop any pretence of being nice and joke around. I would usually pay for his meals since I felt bad he came from outside. I was cordial to my other classmates and never thought I had a problem with any of them.
It was always ""good morning"" or a casual joke and they were friendly enough. L warned me one day that one of the group he mixes with which were my batch mates joked of beating me up. I asked him why and he told me it was because I was ""too innocent, and a teacher's favourite"". My academics have improved greatly in college as Zoology was my subject of passion. We went to a college trip and L, me and another guy shared a room where I was mocked for snoring. Next day apparently one of the guys who was part of the conspiracy to beat me provoked L who had an injured arm. This guy means no harm but his jokes go too far and tension was there. I got involved in breaking up the stand off and someone whispered a hurtful remark behind my back more loudly than they anticipated.
Farewell day B, A, O were off dancing their asses off. L was probably with his other friends, I was with another group of classmates say E, J, A, M. E and A were male and J and M were girls. I was sitting in the presentation room as I dint like to dance and they sat a few rows in front of me. They were drunk. They smuggled boozed in. I should've left when they started making remarks at me. But my idiot ass dint and what followed was my humiliation and I wont talk about it. M wasn't involved as she left as soon as it started getting dicey.

So ends one more chapter with me breaking all contacts with my friends. B and A still contact me especially B. I have lost all contact with L who I regarded as a bigger brother. B contacts me often.
A contacted me once a year and often comment how I don't talk to my friends and joked about me being arrogant.

Next stage, University, made friends, good friends, one is a total nutz, edgelord, one was just a normal friendly guy from the rurals, one was a bookworm who grew apart from us spending time alone.
I talk to Mr edgy regularly till now but the time between message sessions has increased.

Also E and J got into the same University as my juniors when I was in second year. They avoided me.

So from this you can conclude that I have a problem of not keeping my friends around for very long, once the daily exposure of school ends I move on never to see them again. I have no friends outside academics. None of my neighbours are the same age group at any point of my life and I'm introverted.

I never had a girl friend, although a girl in university was always flirting with me, but she had a bad reputation so I dint want to get involved with her.
I never can make true friends. And I'm 100% sure it's me, as my friends contact me but I never contact them.

1749,M-ini,1640187932,1,"I just got this so idk how this really works. I want to call this venting but idk if it applies because it’s mostly my fault. Basically, I’ve always felt lonely since I was little even though I have 2 younger siblings but over the years it got worse. I eventually made friends but last year we moved and now it’s been a whole year and I haven’t really made any friends, where I’m at. Idk how to describe it but sometimes I tell myself not to make friends cause I don’t really need them but then they’re times when I’m like, I literally got no one and why am I like this. I know it’s my fault but I can’t help it. I think I have this fear of people leaving me. Like a fear of abandonment of some sort. It’s basically, if I make a friend, they’ll probably leave, pretend to be nice or judge. Not judging me about my looks or anything but just judging everything in general (Lol, not that I think I’m ugly or anything, I would call myself pretty in the mirror before I leave but when I go out I don’t feel it anymore unless I’m by myself or with friends- who I don’t have) I talk to people but I always distance myself for some reason. I feel like they don’t want to be friends with me so that’s why I don’t push it. And for some reason all my former friends were all either older or younger. I don’t think I really had a friend my age before. This is weird but I usually make my self cry on purpose sometimes because I felt like doing so in the moment. I don’t think I can talk to my parents or anyone else because they’ll probably not take it seriously. I’m tired of pretending to be happy and act like I don’t have problems. I’ve always kept all my problems to myself and I know it’s not healthy for me mentally but I can’t help it because it’s been like that since I was a child. I’m always the one to apologize first if anything happens. It’s become a habit and I would apologize for anything. I would walk into a chair by accident and apologize to it. People usually think it’s funny but when I thought about it, if something goes wrong and it’s not my fault, I would still apologize. It’s stupid but I can’t help it. It’s kind of pathetic, typing all this, but recently my stress had doubled because of other things and I just wanted to say something even though people might not read it.",lonely,"Need a friend/hug, anything, idk",2021-12-23 02:45:32

So I basically only have 2 real friends, well actually i’d consider them family. We are a trio friend group and we used to all live very close to each other and hang out all the time during highschool. A couple years ago one of them moved to a different state and the other left for college a couple months ago. We go through phases where we talk every single day and where we can go weeks sometimes a couple months without contact and pickup where we left off. I like this because i don’t really like texting everyday because i tend to get really drained i don’t know why but there’s times where i like to be left alone. So now I’m 18 living with my parents, going to CC, and work a part time job. I have no friends here. Everyone i was friends with in highschool either left for college or are just living their separate lives. I see them posting on snapchat and social media hanging out with their new friends and roommates and having so much fun. I envy them so much. I don’t hang out or socialize with anyone. It’s also my fault because I don’t make an effort to make new friends at college. I feel like i can’t anyways. I have no idea how to. I can’t talk to new people like i talk with my best friends. I don’t really talk much anyways, they usually call me to vent to me about something and i usually don’t have anything going on so i don’t have anything to talk about. I don’t mind it because i like listening to people just talk but I can’t just stay silent when i’m trying to make a friend.

1758,ItsMartina97,1640175706,1,"Sorry my English first of all. I've already posted here but now I’m trying to sum up my life to get better analysis and advices. I'm just trying to explain the whole situation with READING CLUES. My existence has always been permeated by misunderstanding, loneliness and toxic feelings. I’ve never felt real peace. I was precocious and started to read, write, do elementary mathematical calculations and think about existential stuff at just 3 yo. I was very smart, creative and deep, but painfully sociophobic since I went to nursery school. I was scared by male children, very prudish, and I started to develop the first signs of OCD. I was the student with better grades, I stood out in every subject and every form of art. Classmates started to bully me for this and because I lacked of social skills. During elementary school my OCD got worse but I told nobody about it, suffering in silence. I was scared about losing control and death, I forced myself to feel emotional pain to prove my sensitivity. Since I was 11 my mental health got too worse and I start to have rageful crisis in family: I changed school and people bullied me again. I stopped to study and was full of shame. I started to idealize other girls and have unrequited crushes for guys. I skipped to many classes cause of anxiety and panick attacks but my dad forced me to attend school with physical and verbal violence. I started to be pretty violent with parents because I felt alone and scared of people. At 14 I was diagnosed as OCD and went to my first psychiatric hospital. Here I was feeling better: finally people listened to me and appreciated me. I started to take psychotropic drugs that I'm still taking at 24. My father stopped to hit me but he started with cinic remarks and verbal violence, while nobody defended me. When I finished the month of therapy I started high school and I still was the outsider. I retired 3 times and then I went to countless psychiatric hospitals. I became obsessed with understanding myself through psychological theories. I started to eat nothing and do excessive sport everyday. I was becoming anorexic, obsessed with aesthetic. At 18 my aesthetic improved, and guys asked me to date on social media. I dumped my few female friends because they didn’t consider me very much and I was envious of their life. I started to live at night, just for dating. I was feeling more confident about my look and personality, but still couldn’t say NO to men. I was pretty quiet and people dated me easily. Sadly, men I was attracted to didn’t want anything serious or they had to move in other regions. Then I joined a female eating disorder community where I reborn: here I found my best friend, we had an amazing bond but I don't heard from her since years. I loved that year, even if it was difficult: we were a great group together, went through a lot of experiences and I developed my funny, brilliant, self aware personality. Psychologist diagnosed me the Histrionic Borderline personality disorder. When I finished the community project, I got back to my avoidant lifestyle full of obsessive dating fails. I lost all the friends of community and went to another psychiatric community in 2019. New friends here, that I lost again. Once I finished the process, I finally decided to start Philosophy major in college. My grades were all over the top, and here I met my first real boyfriend at 22: I wasn’t really attracted to him. At first he was the one into me, but when I became needy he started to underestimate me, saying that he was embarassed by me and he never loved me. When he dumped me in February 2020 I was traumatized. I dated people again til COVID appeared in our lives and I stopped College for lack of motivation. In this period I used Instagram a lot and started to model. My followers increased, I talked with a lot of guys but I got engaged with the only one that showed real interest in me: Simone. Me and Simone started to text as friends in the pandemic period and he supported me at distance. We started a cute relationship through the pandemia. We had brief domestic partnerships and he was so in love. Thanks to his poetry passion I rediscovered my ability to write: I almost won a national competition with my first three poems. I started to write constantly, and now I'm working at my poetry book and a philosophical theory of mine. It was a productive period, I was happier but I wasn’t attracted to him in a romantic and sexual way. So our relationship started to be toxic: I was too pretentious (I wanted to compensate my frustration receiving more attentions) and Simone was too arrogant and rational to got me. He did some beautiful things to me (like writing a poetry book to me and putting my name in his graduation thesis), but he was often scared to take the initiative. I was also tired of his passivity. With a lot of tears from both of us, I dumped him in April 2021. It began the worse year of my life, still the most intense. I started spring with better self-awareness and new hopes. I lived as a romantic character of ‘800: lot of dates and the first intense connections of my life that lasted 1 month at most. Anyway there were a lot of problems: from my side, I was in falling in love too fast, while guys were fast in attraction too but they were always acting flaky. I admit I just dated unstable guys because they were the only ones to court me and I thought they could understand me better. Besides the first emotional connection, they revealed themselves as commitment-phobes cause of their past traumas, or because they were still in love with ex, or apathetic feelings (one was starting to “feel again” with me), or because I pointed out their passivity and inconsistency (they promised something then did other). They all ended up to ghost or block me on social media. Everytime I was feeling stabbed and I can’t count how many abandonements I had this year. I just wanted communication and clarity but they were scared about it, they wanted ambiguity. I tried to kill myself everytime, but art saved me: whenever I wanted to die I felt the urge to write a new poem, and I was saved by the hope to communicate. 😢 My present situation is that: Simone is still here as my closest friend after a year of up and downs, even if he still acts scared to take initiative (but he's working about it). This winter I’m trying to make friends (online) but, except for a great beginning, they all fades away or keep it weak. The only exception is a female girl that's pretty consistent in keeping contact and doing sweet gestures. Of course I'm not passive and do the same. These new acquantainces appreciated me, our dates are full of chemistry and they proposed to meet again. Most of them forgot easily, others keep the interest but without intense effort. Plus, I’m obsessively asking myself why guys never like me romantically. They likes me mentally, aesthetically, often feel sexual attraction but do nothing constructive. Whenever I met guys very similar to me (same intellect, ideas, passions, humor... very rare) we just became good acquantainces/potential friends but they never fall in love with me. They ALWAYS get a crush for ""lesser girls"": lesser smart, lesser beautiful, lesser deep. I'm angry because it's always the same. Why being ""too much"" is such repulsive to everyone? I definitively STOPPED to date guys romantically because no good match would ever love me. Two days ago I met a guy from another region, an highly smart rational engineer, also very attractive. He traveled to meet me because he was very curious about knowing me better and the date was a great climax. We didn't have any expectations, just curiosity. Luckly, he gave me also a sort of probably explaination of why people leave me: while he said he has never met a girl as smart as me, also smart and beautiful, but he said I tend to confuse people because it’s like I give different images about myself: strong and insecure at the same time, flirty IG profile with sexy shooting pics and but deep mind and needs (I find that one ridiculous, but I can understand how linear minds work), many different vibes like I mix different languages in the same book. My thoughts are too deep to understand with both mind and heart. To resume the pattern: dates go often well, I have good social skills and we tend to talk for hours and hours. Anyway I appear umpredictabile --&gt; People can’t fall in love easily with me even if attracted, and often lose interest after one date (contrasting feelings) --&gt;  They start to act cold and step back --&gt; Just NOW I become insecure and pretty obsessed, so I ask for explanations and show clingyness --&gt; They run away definitely. (...). It’s like whenever people are attracted to me, they become scared and act inconsistently or they just find me like an engaging riddle to solve. I’m a great connection that doesn’t leave trace, a stopover towards other destinations, the girl everyone estimate but nobody loves. Who loved me always stayed in his comfort zone. I'm frustrated that all the few guys that have been serious about me were average/below average minds (not deep/engaging enough) and very unattractive: they were often unlucky with women and I felt like I was their only possibility. Not to be mean, but I deserve much better than that. I want to attract a smart guy with deep thoughts, intense needs and pretty cute at least. People I'm talking to can’t fully understand what I'm saying. Psychotherapy is worthless: will they give me love or new friends? No, I don't need abstract concepts. Now I’m physically and emotionally sick in my bed, I let myself go and sometimes have suicidal thoughts. I’ve also major depression. Days are passing and I’m doing nothing. I’d like to get back at writing my two books and continue my singing lessons. In 2022 I'd like to join a cinema academy for acting and screenplaying (I've a sit com in minds with grotesque self-deprecating humor), but I can't get the reason since I'll probably be forever alone. Being born so intense and vulnerable it’s just a curse and right now I’ve almost nothing in my life. I have mum, little sister, Simone, the new female acquaintance and a 18 year old guy who's writes me everyday but he's just a teen, even if smart and adorable. Translated: I'm happy about them, but I have no real friends yet (except for Simone), and no great mental or emotional stimulation. Of couse I have also poetry and philosophy, my hope! But my father still offends me everyday and I’m prone to rageful crisis. I’ve no more strenght, I can relate to the Joker of Phoenix. No hope for love, no hope for changes. I’m waiting for something since a lifetime, but I’ll probably end up like a pharaon buried with all of her possessions, without any possibility to spend them. 24 years lost in hope and exhaustion cause of a mix of high IQ, HSP and traumas. Any good analysis of the situation and practical advices to get out of this loop? I've decided to stop my virtual life and join associations like book clubs, volunteer, new job (til I join the Academy) and MENSA. I'd try to join it (I think my IQ should be around 140-145 according to Tri52 and preliminary test), but I'm scared that nobody would notice me in real life (I just get some flirty remarks AT MOST). Nobody notice me in every contest and I'm tired of this. So I don't know how to practically act even in this situations without feeling depressed. I still feel the unnoticeable teen while I'm anything but average. I want someone to notice me, and to stay.

1760,No_Crab_1804,1640174366,1,"I'm a 19 yo male, first year of University. I live in Europe. I've found a good friend through WhatsApp and we sometimes go to Uni together and ""hang out"". She is very busy and most of the time she replies to texts after many hours or a day. She says she is introverted, but I'm a lot more. We tried to hangout with other students but with no success. After a few months of knowing her, I've discovered she has a boyfriend and he is not her first one. My first question is, how is one capable of finding a significant other so easily, while I struggle even finding simple friendships? Does one go ""flirty"" since the beginning or it builds up on sincere friendship?

This was my first question, but now comes the second part of the post: she is very nice to me but sometimes she seems to be a little too ""busy"", like now. I wanted to go to Uni a certain day of the week, as it would have been the last day of Uni this year. We needed to go there a week ago but we couldn't, so we shifted everything by 1 week. But now she said to me that ""she can't because that day she gives gifts to her friends and is not in city"", which is understandable as neither of us live in the same city as where our University is. So I said to her I wanted to go anyway with someone, so we talked about how I should try to know someone over WhatsApp and convince them to go with me at school, as I dislike going alone and I want to meet new people. So yesterday I started contacting various people on WhatsApp but everybody seems so damn busy. One girl was nice and replied fast; we texted each other a good 10 minutes and ended on a good note (wanting to know each other a bit more). So after a few hours I send her a vocal message where I talk about stuff. I also texted her to take her time listening to the audio (that audio message was almost three minutes long), but she didn't reply.  I was a bit in a hurry so I prompted her, after something like 6 hours, ""hey, did you forgot? \[laughing emoji\]"" but nothing. Today I woke up and prompted her again, saying ""Alice? \[laughing emoji\]"" (made-up name) but still nothing. The messages are marked ""received"" but are left unseen. I wonder if she decided to ghost me or simply didn't have time to reply, even though she appears to be online quite frequently. I am saying this because there was some urgency, as I needed to know if she decided to go to the Uni with me or not. I tried to know other people but everyone seems so darn busy, as they have barely any time to look at a few texts. I realise that maybe I'm too alone to miss incoming messages and others have a much more full life, with numerous friends, romantic interests and whatnot.",lonely,"I feel like everyone has a full life, while I'm just alone.",2021-12-22 22:59:26

In fact, I really don't want to get into a relationship at this age, hell I don't even want to make any friends online because I know that they will never last and it's a waste of my time. 

In my case, I just want to spend time with my older brother again because its been so long since we've been able to do anything together without it only lasting for a very short time due to how far apart we live from eachother. I can't just visit him whenever I want to because, news flash, i'm sixteen and can't just fucking drive a car here and waltz my way to my brother's house. 

I just want to see him in particular because he's the one person I can lean on and talk to about my feelings, in fact, he has always been the only person that I can lean on without a problem. 


Just felt like writing this because loneliness seems to be commonly associated with lack of romantic relationships. That and how it seems that people who are lonely tend to outright refuse to reach out to people to rid themselves of their loneliness but in my case, I don't think it's always that simple. Think about it realistically, people on the internet are often times just unreliable to be an actual friend and some people are legitimately physically unable to get out and casually make a friend. It's easy to say hey dumbass why don't you just go and make a friend instead of moping like a bitch without thinking about why they can't just do that and it's annoying lol

1766,453019229912,1640167331,1,"I think I don't like myself.

As cliche as it may sound, I am constantly behind a mask even to the closest around me. Truth is, I have no clue what I'm hiding. I don't know why I'm crying, I don't know why I am typing this. Perhaps it's to let off steam, but why is there steam to begin with. I can blame it on various things, but frankly, every single thing has one common denominator—me behind each choice.

I chose this.

I chose to disappoint myself in every single aspect of my life, I could have been so much more already by now. I am smart enough to know where I am is an extremely fortunate position and I have a bright future ahead of me, unfortunately I am also smart enough to know I could have been so much more than that. 

This is the most I have cried in a while, it feels good, very good actually. My head feels heavy, my breath is getting louder, the music in the background's hitting closer to the soul.

The feeling is gone, I'm not crying anymore. I wish it lasted longer. Was that it? I wish it lasted longer than the 10 seconds it did, I should be happy it happened I suppose, maybe this writing thing is not so bad if I can have that feeling again later on in this prompt. It felt as though I flushed out a small part in my brain that's fuelling the negative emotions.

I think I just need a hug.

So where was I? Ah the could've been so much more, I really could have. You know what fuck this. Fuck am I trying to cry for, I had shit handed to me my whole life, only reason I am thinking like this is because I am constantly comparing myself to the best version of what could have been, I—

I don't know.

Why am I sad again? Fuck I hate that word, sad. I especially hate calling myself that, why would I be sad. What right do I have when I have parents dying to support me, friends around me I can talk to if I desired, family, never had to worry about money or food on the table. Why the fuck am I sad. What fucking right do I have.

I wanna cry again. I want that feeling again, it's been so long since I actually cried, and God knows I have been trying to. Typing this helped, but I want more.

This is unorganised, thoughts all over the place, kinda like how I always think, kinda like my life. Everyone says that. 

I think I am done for now, I don't think I will cry again today, which is disappointing considering how good it felt. But it's like I'm always too logical and critical of my own self for my own good, those little snaps where I let go felt like freedom, maybe it's that mask I was talking about, maybe that mask is me being this logical, critical, charming, extroverted, funny, great to be around guy that's just not me. 

What do I fear?

Why am I so scared of being myself; I went out with friends today. I made their day, I really did, I put on a show for them, they rarely stopped laughing. It felt good, I felt good. Only thing is they went home, and I went home, and I am here, like this.

I wish someone made my day.

I hate that I let myself down so much, I hate that I am lazy, I hate that I let my folks down so much, I hate that I am ungrateful. I hate that I'm like this, I don't know what 'this' is, but, there is something I hate, a lot.

I wanna change.",lonely,(18M) Long rambling of absolutely nothing,2021-12-22 21:02:11
1767,_humanERROR_,1640166959,1,"I've always had trouble making and keeping friends. I had not a friend in the world for 2 years and was absolutely suicidal over it. Then I experienced a 'normal' social life for about 15 months, I worked, hung out with someone every week, had multiple contacts, drank with people and got competent in the bar scene. And I'm glad I experienced that, but I don't want it anymore.

I have autism, trauma, possibly social anxiety. And that all makes a normal social life impossible. What it boils down to is that having friends and trying to make friends is just not worth the cost for me. I've literally made a list of pros and cons that scientifically proves that having friends is a liability to me. But here I'll just list the cons.

* Friends take up time.
* Because of social anxiety friends take up my mental energy. This means that in the hours before and after meeting up, I can't focus properly on other things, the whole day will be compromised. When I'm not hanging out with them, I get a lot of anxious thoughts about them leaving me or ruminating about our past interactions and if I seemed awkward or weird or rude.
* In life as an adult, a friendship can't realistically last for more than a year, and it will always end on a bad note because of all the reasons I've described here.
* When a friendship ends, I feel very uneasy that the personal connection was so frivolous and forgetful for all parties, that 10 years later we won't even remember anything about it anymore.
* Having friends is outright painful. I was ghosted on my 18th birthday by my best friend at the time for no apparent reason, and then on my 21st birthday my friend basically made a scene because she was jealous about my interactions with her boyfriend, an issue that she never ever expressed to me. Conclusion: my 'friends' couldn't even make an effort not to traumatize me on my birthday.
* Friends are not a real support system. Not when they leave you the moment you say anything about your personal issues. They'll say they're there for you, you can talk to them any time etc., they'll talk to you about their own issues, and then they'll ghost you because 'they don't need that negativity in their life' despite your efforts to keep things positive.
* When you're a female trying to make female friendships, you eventually realise that many other females look like they want to be friends with you, but in reality just want connections. And when they see that you don't have anything of value to offer them besides clicking in personality and vibe, they'll dump you.
* I get too attached to everyone and everything I'm consistently around. Whether it's my primary friend or if they constantly bring their partner along, or someone I barely talk to, or even someone that I really dislike or hate......My brain does not do well with change of routine or change of people, even if it's for the better.

My brain keeps getting stuck in the mentality of 'if only'. If only I said/did the right thing, if only I joined this, if only I chose this other person, if only I persisted, if only I did this or did that, I wouldn't be friendless again or I would be worth keeping around. This doesn't help that my autism diagnoses makes me thing I'm broken in some way and if I just fixed myself I could have whatever it is that other people have.

What makes things more complicated is that I don't want a romantic relationship either. I'm not fond of labels, but for the sake of not writing an entire paragraph to explain, I'm bisexual, aromantic and sex-repulsed, and as you can imagine I really value my personal space. I've tried finding 'my people', I've been in LGBT spaces, I've had autistic friends, I never made any friends in my own university course. So that's why my brain concludes that I must be broken in some way, if I can't fit in despite my similarity to others.

Expectations aside. I'm struggling not to feel lonely. I can't get a dog because I still live with my parents, other people just drain me or cause me hurt down the line, and my family is not pleasant to be around.",lonely,I don't want friends but I'm struggling to cope with the loneliness.,2021-12-22 20:55:59

Back in August I realized that I was planing all of our hangouts and they weren't fun anymore. So I stressed that we should take turns planing hangouts. They only planed two (one was fun and the other wasn't). One in September and another one in November. I planned two aswell one in November and another one in December (both were fun, even though we didn't do anything Intresting). 

I relized in October that I cannot wait for them to plan hangouts, so I looked around for events around me and I found nothing for my age group. I did email my community College to see about joining a club, while they gladly sent me a club list. They didn't respond when I asked about joining a specific club. 

Currently my sister is home from school until January 2nd, I do have fun hanging out with her. But she basically made me realize that my friends, don't hangout enough and when we do we don't do Intresting stuff. I understand that they are busy (they work and some have school), but other that there playing video games or drawing, so while they probably could make time to hangout more there not. Also I haven't seen my friend Flayn since September and she lives 10 minutes from me.

Even if there was no real fault of my own I would be beaten just for standing up for myself. I started avoiding my father and wouldn't even make eye contact when he would talk to me. I grew distant to him and we had minimal interact even though we lived in the same house. My father had gotten into debt and couldn't recover from it.

I was lonely in my mid-teens after my school and was in confinement type of situation wherein I had to study cutting all contacts for about 10hrs at a stretch everyday. I had no friends, no social life and also I begged my parents to pull me out of this. But I had to suffer it for 2 more years. I had a huge setback back when I was in my late teens. I started pushing everything away my family, my friends and my well being. I was spiraling down and losing my sanity. I was always a shy kid but this phase messed me up so bad that I started having extreme anxiety attacks. I lost all my self confidence and was scared of everything. Everything seemed so daunting and I had no way out. I started gaining a lot of weight as my lifestyle was extremely sedentary and I wouldn't leave my bed. I cried a lot and even slightest of things would trigger me. I started developing various digestive, hormonal and skin related conditions.

In my college I couldn't interact much with anyone and started using alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana as a coping mechanism. As a result my grades started dropping. I couldn't get a hold of my academics nor my social life. I started working out. I was going to the gym and working out for about 2 hours a day made me feel relaxed and everything started to feel normal again. But 4 months after I started working out, I had a shoulder injury due to which I stopped going to the gym. I couldn't get it treated because I lacked finances.

In my penultimate year of college, I had taken 8 weeks of therapy. I opted out because I didn't have the finances to continue. I feel therapy is a short term solution for a long term problem. 

I'm in my last year of college, I need to support my family as they have financial commitments but I don't have a proper career plan whereas my peers have already landed jobs. I applied for various jobs but I was reject because I lacked skills and common sense. 

I am a failure, I have lost all confidence and enthusiasm in life, I feel weak and pity myself, I have difficulty interacting and handling people. I'm unable to understand life and even the easiest of tasks feel so difficult. My social life is near non-existent. Apart from my family, I don't know how interacting with people feels like.

Through her interactions with me, she made me think she liked me by giving me compliments, saying she liked my hair, my shoes, smiling at me, noticing I grew taller, bragging about dancing with me, asking me where I was when I didn't take her class, telling my mom at a conference that I was a ""very fine young lady."" I thought she was a lesbian and was in love with me. This happened for a few others as well that I was in love with. She was divorced and had kids.

I fell in love with her. When I continually saw her, my feelings grew. She occupied every space in my mind. I built this fantasy about her in my head and convinced myself that she loved me. I replayed different scenarios in my head, my interactions with her in person and my fantasies. She pulled me off from my course and I wasn't able to do a lot of things, like having friends in high school, going out, doing activities, volunteering. Because all I wanted was to think about her. Even during the summers, I was wondering how I was going to survive without her for 3 months. I even purposefully took a class for two summers because all I wanted was to see her. And the summers when I didn't class, all I did was think about her.

I missed out on many opportunities like dating and been in real relationships. I yearned for her. I remember all of the things she said that were so momentary and minor that she long forgotten. I invested a lot in her. I turned down offers from guys to remain faithful to her. I have never been in a relationship, had sex, or been kissed to remain faithful to her.

Growing up I had a lot of trauma and issues with education that made making friends next to impossible. Now that I’m older I’m one emotionally under developed ass that gets it wrong at least 90% of the time.

I really hate that I always feel this alone and that I’ve pretty much given up on anything resembling a relationship, even my ex didn’t want anything physical and there was 0 passion I just tried to lift them up when they felt down and tried to be their for them and their family. I spent a lot of money even though I’m literally poor and spent so much time working on making them or someone close to them feel good but I wasn’t enough. 

I’m no prize when it comes to looks (in fact I’m more of a punishment) but I’m also not a crazy incel so if no one (and at this point it is no one) is attracted to me then that’s their right and cool. That said, I am sick of being the friend no one wants, someone who follows the group, not having someone who can make me feel wanted and the general expectation that I’m inherently not a viable love interest/option because of how I look. People laugh at the idea including friends eve if not to my face. For context I’m a lesbian (lowering possible partners) and I’m tran, which makes it even harder. At this point I have genuinely given up on a real relationship, I told a friend I liked her (not expecting anything to come of it cos she’s 1) straight and 2) in a relationship. But I felt guilty about how I felt like I was taking advantage and despite saying she was glad I told her and it wouldn’t affect the friendship she hasn’t spoke to me in over a week, so that friendship is over.

I do not believe that I am entitled to, expect, or deserve anything from them or anyone else. When I look at myself, to the best of my ability, I see myself as a half way decent choice for someone to be with. I like to point out my flaws as well so as to not think too highly of myself. I'm not the best looking person but I try take care of myself by going to the gym occasionally but mostly watch what I eat. I've been rated here on reddit being consistently around a 4 but considering it's reddit I'm not sure how accurate that may be. OLD is pretty toxic and disheartening so I've given that up as I've been shown that I'm not an impulse buy choice for people. I may not be the most stylish dresser or have a great hair style but I try not to look like a mess when I'm in public. I have tried to continue to better myself through education, with my career, and expanding on multiple hobbies. One of my hobbies being photography, I've recently tried to see what I need to do to get it displayed. The point of even bringing these up is to say that I try to have a life outside of relationships since it's pretty clear that I'm not meant for one.

I just don't understand why I have such difficulties and why I am never even a considering choice for people.

Is it better to go through this clearly abusive friendship than go back to the black abyss that is loneliness? Yeah both situations suck but I guess the question boils down to ""Would you like a turd sandwich or a turd sandwich with mustard?""

It’s literally a completely fake performance like actors reading from a script but even worse because you make it up as you go along and act like it’s natural even though it’s artificial. 

It’s built into language. Good morning, how are you, what have you been doing.

Like our lives and thoughts are pre packaged for us and that’s just the basic shit but it goes deep, into the way people talk about work, bitch about each other, talk about their love life.

The way deep life advise is always the exact same chick-flick copy pasted bullshit that’s completely impersonal but still is a genuine attempt to console you because people are just walking internet hard drives.  

I can’t even list all the fake ways we talk to each other because it’s so ingrained in our brains and It takes a lot of effort to deconstruct and realise how fake things really are.

1858,throwawayacct5162,1640131106,1,"TL;DR: For the last 2 years I’ve come to enjoy my own company, haven’t felt lonely, &amp; became pretty anti-social. But recently I decided to put some effort into trying to make friends without success &amp; am feeling real loneliness again for the 1st time in a while.

I struggled with pretty bad loneliness in middle school &amp; highschool up until the pandemic. When the pandemic happened &amp; I spent the last near year &amp; a half of high school online + at home, completely isolated except from my household, it was actually the least lonely I’d felt in a long while. I really enjoyed spending time alone + being by myself, &amp; there was no feeling of being left out either since everyone else was also at home. Even when people did start hanging out again I felt no desire for it, both due to not wanting to be out in a pandemic &amp; also the fact that I honestly became pretty anti-social &amp; just not interested in that type of thing anymore regardless of the health risks.

This past fall I started college &amp; just finished the semester, &amp; for the most part never really felt lonely during it either. I joined clubs, went to events, &amp; met people when it naturally happened, but never went out of my way to build any type of relationship with anyone. &amp; I was fine with that tbh, bc the only times I desired friendship were the times I was bored with lots of free time left &amp; nothing to do since I already did everything. Which didn’t happen super frequently. 

That said, I recognize the importance of at least having acquaintances so towards the end of the semester + the break so far I’ve been trying to talk to some people I met/knew in hs, &amp; tbh it’s been very depressing. I know convos naturally die out after youve gotten past the basics but from the jump they all seemed uninterested in even trying to get to know each other/catch up &amp; I had to hard carry the convo til they just stopped replying (which didn’t take long). The real kicker is a couple of these people reached out to *me* 😕. Now, for the first time in almost 2 years, I feel lonely again. I honestly wish I didn’t talk to any of those people at all, I was really vibing with myself &amp; that kinda reset everything. I’m at home for another month so it’s not like I can even brush it off &amp; just try to meet new people either.",lonely,Feeling lonely for the 1st time in almost 2 years,2021-12-22 10:58:26

1864,vape_love,1640128390,1," 

We used to be really close, in his words, I was ""like family""; we've known each other for about a year. but during that time, a lot has happened, which made us really close. We used to text every single day, throughout the whole day, and into the night, as well as see each other every night after school, and then when studying became an issue, once a week. We've been through drug addiction together, and recovered together, I thought this friendship meant something to him.

Then, something happened and I beat myself up about it every second of every day. I am a very lonely person, because I'm autistic, that puts 99% of people off, and I become a pariah everywhere I go, because I don't pick up on some ethereal 'vibes', or social cues, or what have you. So, I don't really have any other friends outside of him. I have 'school collegues', but that's about it, I literally cannot keep people in my life for shit. Eventually, I do something to piss them off or something, and they cut me off abruptly, with no explanation, with me confused as to what happened.

I just wish people would tell me what I did wrong outright, so I can avoid making the same mistakes in the future, but everyone just up and leaves. Including him, which I never thought would actually happen, I loved him (in a friend way), and he was my only true friend. This can only be compared to a heartbreak.

So, about a month ago, he started acting weird, so, his texts got rarer and rarer, and he'd take ages to respond, and when he did, it was 1 word answers, while he was active on Snap and Discord. He started making excuses to not hang out, like ""I need to study"", and then meet up with other people the next day, or just not come out at all. He asked me to meet yesterday, and acted like nothing happened. I asked him about why has he been distant, and he said it's because he's depressed due to failing in school. I don't know whether to believe him, because when you're depressed, you wanna talk to people, surely ? I should know, I am depressed. He also said ""I'm cutting some people off, less people to worry about their opinions"", which really hurt me. The same night, after we went home, I asked him what he meant, and he texted that he's not cutting me off, and that he meant some people from school. Still seems like he's cutting me off, and just doesn't wana hurt my feelings.

I have literally no one else apart from him. My family despise me, everyone else treats me like a leper, or gets bored of me, I have an expiry date, after which everyone who was my ""friend"" erases me from their lives. I just want to know what I did to deserve this, so it never happens again. Being autistic, I am crap at picking up non-verbal cues. I must have missed something. Again. This always happens, I'm at the end of my rope. Been laying in bed doing nothing the past week, I'm just hopeless- no one will ever like me, because of a neurological condition I have no control over. It's easy to say ""make friends"" when you're normal; I am not normal, and people just don't like me, despite my best efforts.",lonely,grieving the loss of my only friend.

Since my last relationship over a decade ago, it's feels like a curse that I'm doomed to be abused and lied to by everyone I meet, or the fear of being in that position that I end up hating myself to pushing people away. I can't ever explain myself because i don't complain nor express myself to people because I don't see the purpose in doing so. I don't want to be felt pity or sorrow by others, just want to be held and cry.
My sister is in the hospital for lymphoma. We never had a good relationship. And i can't say this to anyone, but I honestly don't care if she'd die or not. She's been the worst person ever and only mentally stable because she's on heavy medication. 
I work as a nurse for an agency, endlessly give my time and care for patients, feel more appreciation from total strangers than from my own family. 
I envy those who have their life settled and have their homes and started families. Recently turned 31 and head back to my parents once my work contract ends, and set course on another far away as possible from home, just not to be bothered and in high hopes of meeting new people. 
I don't like to celebrate my bday nor holidays because it's a constant reminder of my loneliness. I often jokingly think about ending it all, but I don't think I've reached that point yet.

i will never be enough for a girl. most of these girls be already having a boyfriend, stuck on their ex, or already seeing someone. i went out, i approached girls at my retail job, in public. they always said they had a boyfriend, or when they gave me their number’s they always led me on.

i feel like that “focus on yourself” shit is bs. my friend have no car,still live with his mom, working shitty job at 27, and he still manage to get girls or a relationship. my other friend introvert, he shy to approach women in public, but he gets all types of girls on instagram. im starting to think its luck. im tired of hearing this pseudo advice. what girl wants to be with a small dick man, who nuts fast, and inexperienced. i dont blame them for not wanting me.",lonely,i will never be enough &amp; killing myself.,2021-12-22 07:24:21
1886,timeandtimeagain11,1640117592,1,"I posted this in another sub already but... I guess I can post it here again since it seems like I've found my people. I also spent my 25 birthday alone earlier this year. 

I had a rough year in every possible way, I haven't seen my parent's in a year. I've spent most of the year alone, I got back on my feet by the end of the year in most aspects of my life, but I'm still gonna be alone for Christmas.

I'm not even shy or introverted I get along with people fairly easily.. 

Back in March I had an eye issue that wasn't properly diagnosed right when it showed up and made everyone around me think I was crazy, thankfully it's nothing big, but it was very disturbing. I started therapy because everyone told me I was crazy, they were wrong. I was sent to the psych ward where they were like ""hmm but you don't belong here you just need to see a different doctor"".

I spent so much time thinking I was sick and/or crazy..

On top of that I was broke for 6 months or so, I somehow lost my scholarship because of a database issue.

Add to it that I should have been ""fired"" from my school because I didn't find an intership in time, but they kinda felt bad for me so I have some extra time to find one. I'm the only one who somehow can't find an internship, I still don't have one.

I got back on my feet (mentally) all by myself, and even though I do have a few friends everyone is spending Christmas with family so I'll end up alone anyway. And it feels like I failed, I failed to have anyone to care enough. And even though I try to pretend I'm fine, I'm heartbroken. It might not be a big deal to spend Christmas alone, but it is for me. It feels like a reminder that beside my close family no one cares about me.  
  
I couldn't afford to fly back home, otherwise I would have been with my family. 

I hoped for a happier ending to this year.  
I'm grateful I'm healthy, and found some new hobbies though.

  
Edit : just watched a vid of a girl with a disability of some kind being overly happy about her sister's birthday and I'm feeling so ungrateful for my comfortable life...

1900,Any-Refrigerator-944,1640113409,1,"One of the many things life did not prepare me for is loneliness. I was, and still am, a very social person. Even though i ve spent my teenage years reading, ""locked"" inside the house, because of an abusive father, i always loved meeting and talking to new people. I may be quite picky with the people i befriend, but always managed to find someone who is on the same page as me. 

Recently, tho, i came to the conclusion that, from all the friends i have(which are 3), none are actually there. And i understand that we all have a life and things to do, but in the past 6 months ive seen my so called friends 3 times. And i hate this. I wish i could blame the pandemic, but where I'm from, the situation is not that bad and at least people my age(23) aren t scared. So they do have a social life, but without me...

It s the kind of loneliness where all i get is ""sorry, im busy rn"" and no rescheduling, the kind of loneliness where i have nobody to share meaningful conversations with, the kind where i don t have anyone to share the happiness of idk making an amazing soup or reading something fun. I have nobody that texts me ""hey, how are you, i miss you let s get together someday"", even though i ve sent a lot of these messages.

And all i can think about is wtf is wrong with me. What is so inherently bad about my personality that people can t seem to like me? And mentally i k n o w that it s not all me, and that maybe they really are t h a t busy, but i can t help myself. The one, hardest loneliness, is knowing that it s all my fault, how else cand a 23 something yo person end up with no real friendships???

Anyways, been a tough couple of years honestly since 2017. started off realizing the friends I’ve made in high school doesn’t really treat me as a friend. They just acknowledge my because I’m there and I’m always tagging along with them, but I still tried, but still nothing came up. Graduated in high school. No memories, no friends, no one to talk to. No one to share a drink, no one to enjoy being finally out of high school. Spent my vacation alone. All six months of it (our high school had a weird graduating time). Took the advice of one of my ""friend"" of trying to meet people online, look up what other people do, etc. seriously, just to get my life together and prepare for uni. But all of those needed some sort of person to gauge—which the only ""friend"" was always busy with something. But regardless took what I learnt online seriously, since they’ve also said uni is a fresh start.

Uni, everything looks okay, met new people who seems to like me and not annoyed with my personality. Until 4 months in, those same people intentionally left me out when they’re hanging out or going out. Immediately left the group. No point trying when they’ve made it clear they don’t want me to be in their group. Was down for almost a week. Skipped classes. But jumped back up. Took time to fully recover. 3 months. But after that I started, again, looking for people. I did, met people with similar interests in me. We hanged out, everyday. But pandemic came…everything became silent. Tried contacting them but they were just gone. I thought they were just focused on themselves for a while, which i understand, until 4 months later I discovered that they were still hanging out with each other, virtually. Felt alone. Lonely. 4 months had no one to talk to and assumed everyone was focused with their own shit, just to realize they’ve had each other the entire time. It hurted. Too much. Letting myself try so hard to find friends, and just be left out.

There was this girl I used to know. Only friend I’ve ever had. Never felt any kind of connection with another person before her at all, didn’t think I was capable of it to be honest. But with her I guess things just kinda lined up just right. Met her at my second job, bartending in a small town pub. Thought she hated me at first, she’s the type of person who seems to hate everyone. Always been my favourite type of people, even in games with romance options, I’ve always gravitated toward the cold, harsh women like Yennefer from the Witcher or Morrigan from Dragon Age.

I guess over time she warmed up to me. No idea why, guess I just made a couple jokes she found funny. She started texting me outside of work. Started wanting to hang out. Used to tell me she’d get excited when we were rostered on together. One night we went clubbing and I got high on MDMA and accidentally let slip a bunch of traumatic shit from my past. Fully expected things to be weird after that, but she still stuck around. She even started doing random nice things outta the blue afterwards. Like randomly drunk texting me when she was out with friends, tell me how I was one of the coolest, funniest people she knew and that she loved me (as a friend) and I deserved to know that because she couldn’t say it when she was sober. Never been told stuff like that before in my life, especially not unprompted like that.

Then of fucking course, I had to go and start having feelings for her. Felt like a corruption that just tainted the whole thing. Suddenly being around my only friend was fucking painful because I wanted more and I knew she didn’t. Between that and other life things, I was just fucking spiralling down, losing my mind. Started drinking a lot, cutting myself pretty badly, even had a suicide attempt that put me in hospital. And of course she was the only person who came to see me in there, not even my own mother did. She even told me to stay in her guest room for a couple days after I got out so I could relax. Was the nicest torture I’ve ever felt.

Eventually I got so blackout drunk I ended up in the hospital (again) and during the blackout I guess I told her over text how I felt. Don’t remember exactly what I said, but I remember enough to know it was totally pathetic. Riddled with self-depreciation. She took a couple days to tell me she didn’t feel that way about me and I quit the job after that. Saw her one more time when she drove me to a therapy appointment, but never again in person after that. That was two years ago. She’d send me the occasional text, I guess to check if I’d killed myself or something, but even those dried up about 7 months ago. 

Thing is, I still think about her all the fucking time. Tried moving away, had multiple jobs since, lost my virginity since, been with several other girls but they all just left me feeling sick, to this day I’ve literally never been able to orgasm during sex. Actively avoid sex now. Just can’t get her out of my head, no matter how much I try to move on. She shows up in my dreams at least once a week. Most of the time it’s me being angry at her for letting the friendship die, even though I know it was the best thing for us both. But sometimes it’s different.

Couple nights ago I had my least favourite type of dream about her. Or most bittersweet, I guess. I dreamt that she reached out to me. We met up and she told me she had feelings for me but wasn’t ready to tell me before. We swam in a pool together and it lead to us kissing. Then put my hand on her upper back and pulled her chest to my lips, so I could kiss her down the length of it, from her neck to her belly button. Felt so real. Can remember feeling the contrast of frigid beads of water clinging to her warm skin. Feeling the subtle goosebumps dotting her body. Tasting the hint of chlorine in every kiss, hearing her sharp breathing. She *wanted* me. And I actually wanted her. Only time in my miserable fucking life I actually felt some satisfaction from a sexual encounter. But it’s not even fucking real.

Woke up after that and feel the usual flood of emotions. Depressed because it always feels like losing her all over again. Conflicted because I know I don’t really want it to come true considering I know how much of a disaster a relationship between us would be for us both. And then this underlying feeling of just being a fucking creep. How would she feel if she knew I’d thought about her that way? How creeped out would she be if she knew how much I still think about her? I don’t think I could look her in the eye again. But I can’t help it, it’s in my dreams, I can’t stop it. But it’s fucked up, I *know* she doesn’t want me having fantasy sex with her. It feels like such a violation even though I know I’m not doing anything. 

I just hate feeling like that and I wish I could just delete all memory of her from my brain.

TL;DR - I fell in love with my best friend, she didn’t feel the same way and even though we don’t talk anymore, I feel like a fucking creep for still thinking about her all the time and having sex dreams about her that I know she’d be creeped out by if she knew I was having them.",lonely,Keep having sexual dreams about a girl and it makes me feel like a creep,2021-12-22 02:36:33

1933,asasice,1640096570,1,"Hey everyone. 

What follows is a long and personal message of how I learned more about myself and what's behind my loneliness. I've written it, then re-read it multiple times, and I don't think I want this out there. However, it's something I wish I read a few months ago, so I'm posting it in the hope someone finds it helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

For a little context: about half of year ago my long term relationship with the person who also used to be my best friend ended. I don't have a lot of other friends, so I found myself alone, in a pretty rough spot.

I got myself partially out of it by focusing on my self and on what I wanted to achieve. It worked up to a point. The loneliness sensation was always still there, but I was somewhat functional at least in most days.

After I found myself functional, I started browsing /r/lonely to see if there's people that are in a place similar to where I was at my lowest, to see if sharing my experience might help them a bit. So I wrote comments here and there, trying to focus on posts that were less responded to. Through this I got to meet some amazing people, people I am confident to call them my friends now, and we've had days were we talked hours upon hours about everything.

And while we were talking, everything was great! I felt almost fixed! But when I wasn't talking to anyone, I felt as lonely as ever.

We are social creatures, but yet, loneliness shouldn't feel so rough. One shouldn't need constant interaction to not feel lonely. Plus, I've been more alone as a child without feeling as lonely, and there are people alone right now who seem to feel better than I did. So it got my thinking why am I feeling like this? Is it because I only interact with people online and not face to face? That didn't feel like a problem in my past. Is it because they're just friends and not more? But loads of people are single and yet don't feel alone.

To be honest, I got very scared of not becoming clingy, needy. Having friends doesn't mean that you should occupy their lives constantly; they have their own lives and problems, and putting too much strain on the relationship means you'll lose them as friends. 

I felt stuck. Lonely, but sometimes afraid to talk because I risked becoming more lonely in the long term.

In an unrelated discussion, a friend recommended that I watch Daniel Sloss' standup live shows on Netflix. I did, and they fit very well with my humour, BUT the ""Jigsaw"" episode, surprisingly, gave me the key I needed to start my journey on understanding my loneliness.

Spoiler (as much as you can spoil a standup routine): in that episode he compares life to a puzzle where you lost the reference image. You have loads of different pieces, and you need to build that puzzle. You start from the corners, which represent the pillars of your life (family, friends, hobbies, job etc), and you keep building inwards, adding and replacing pieces as you grow. Eventually, the center of the puzzle turns to be what makes you happy.

Pretty cheesy, right?

But I started thinking about my puzzle. No friends, wasn't enjoying my hobbies any more, I couldn't focus on my job... I realized my puzzle was empty. close to 30 years of life and looking inward, I saw nothing. And I hated it. So a question formed into my head. If I hate my puzzle, does that mean that I hate myself?

I analysed chunks of my behaviour in the past, and with that question in hand, everything made a lot more sense. I'm drowning myself in YT and Netflix, in music and videogames, and I feel the need to be in constant touch with people not because I'm lonely, but because I hate my own company. As soon as there's nothing to distract me, I'm with myself. And that's what I can't stand. I was better at being alone when I was a child because I saw myself as a clever, kind person with a lot of potential ahead. Nowadays, when I look at myself I see that empty puzzle, the wasted potential, being so many years older than that kid, and yet, so many years emptier.

&amp;#x200B;

""I hate myself"". It was so hard to say it for the first time, but once it was out, I couldn't stop it any more.

So, where does one go from there? I wish I had a good answer for this, but I don't. I will share the pieces I've come up with.

Well, first step, I want to discover who I am. I might not enjoy what I find, but how can you improve something you don't know about? In order to do that, I have a diary where I write things that go through my head. I don't hold anything back, even if it ends up looking like a serial killer's. I swear, if I die, leave my browser history as it is; just burn my diary instead.

Next step, I want to allow myself the right to make mistakes. Shit happens, and I'm not perfect. So I'm going to go out there, get more involved, make more mistakes and learn from them without beating myself up over them. Hopefully this also helps me with adding pieces to my puzzle. New experiences, new people, new lessons.

I'm also going to force myself to focus more on the good things I have in life. It's so easy to focus on the bad, on the fails, on the mistakes. But there are good things happening as well. And I'm going to do a better job appreciating them, whether that's congratulating myself for trying something new, or whether it's making things awkward by thanking a friend for being there for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize there's a lot more for me to do still. It's a long journey ahead, but for the first time in years, I feel that my life and the responsibility of my well being is truly in my hands, and not in whether I have someone else by my side.

I still get lonely, it's true. But it's not the same. It's no longer dread. It's no longer fear. It no longer has power over me. It's just a temporary feeling that it would be nice to talk to someone. The way it should be.

&amp;#x200B;

These things are hard for me to write about. But I did it in hopes that maybe, someone out there, realizes that their problem runs deeper than just what's at the surface. I hope my story gives you the courage to look inward, and be able to give yourself a truthful answer to the question ""why am I lonely?"". And I hope you get the tools to fight whatever you discover there.

&amp;#x200B;

My childhood was complicated I suppose, someone always yelling or getting drunk. 

I've barely attended high school for the past few years due to just general depression and managed lost all of the little friendships I had with people.

1940,Hemoxsphere,1640092140,1,"I've () never been a big talker and its one of many reasons why its so hard for me to connect with people. Words don't come easily and I barely make any effort to communicate because I don't know what to say or don't want to talk at all. 

For years I've been the background friend. I have friends but no best friends. The closest ones to that are 2 girls I've known for a few years and it was easier when it was just us 3 but now the group (6+) has expanded and its like I'm just hanging out with them and their friends. They're genuinely good people and I think they don't mind having me around but they also don't care if I'm not. 

We're not as close anymore and it hurts because its mostly my fault. I don't make much effort to talk, at school I just follow them around and offer some input when needed but mostly just stay quiet and listen. Its even worse outside of school because I don't text at all. Its not that I don't enjoy talking to them, I'm just not a big talker \^\^!

I'm not in any active group chats so they have all these inside jokes and talk about things I have no idea about. I get its because I don't text, but it would be nice to just be a part of it anyway and have the option to talk if I want. 

The whole reason I even made this post was because last month I was told about a small party they were planning to celebrate a birthday. They hadn't figured out a date yet so I was waiting for them to let me know but today I saw their posts on Instagram about it. They went ahead and had their party and they didn't even tell me. It wouldn't have mattered that much to me (but still would hurt) if I didn't know about the party, but the fact that they told me about it but never bothered to let me know when it was is just upsetting. 

I feel incredibly lonely now because do they even consider me their friend anymore? or am I just someone who hangs around them. I don't even have the courage to text them about it because I hate confrontations and I don't want to ruin whatever it is we still have. I barely have anyone else to be with. 

I don't know if I will be able to make any new friends. School is the only place I talk to people (like classmates) but the only topics that come up are school related and I'm not interested in getting closer to them. Outside of school I don't talk to anybody at all besides family and some online friends. And that's the whole problem. I want real life friends but its hard.

I'm a very picky person; they have to be interesting, share some interests with me, and fit into my mold of an ideal person. But I won't even know that though because I don't talk to anyone. Its stupid of me to have high expectations when I can't offer much in return. I'm forcing this loneliness on myself, I wish I wasn't like this.

So I have mates here and there but every year for my birthday I feel like I’m forcing the people I want present to come and when they decline I end up inviting people that I’m not that close to « fill the void » cos I don’t want to feel alone on my birthday. That sounds horrible.

I’ve had best friends before but they all kinda dissapointed me and various ways so I’ve became a loner. 
I live in a different country than where I was born so my closest friends are back home and although I know many people where I am now I don’t think anyone would go out of their way to make my quarter of century special.

For my 25th I’ve invited a few friends to go to an event I bought 2 tickets for (before they sold out) and so far no one is up for it. It’s looking like I’m going to have to resell the 2nd one and go on my own. 
That’s so pathetic 🤦🏾‍♀️ 
I know no one is going to come visit , I’ll probably get some texts and calls at best but yeah… 

It hurts man cos I don’t think I’m a horrible person at all (although I have anxiety and depression and undiagnosed BPD so I’m not always bubbly and became introvert over the years) and I’m not sure why I always end up alone.

2022,VeryMentallyStable,1640046607,1,"It’s probably not the biggest issue I have, never been one of those massively sex-obsessed types of people, didn’t even lose my virginity till last year, when I was 21. But I guess it just bothers me to think about sometimes. Guess the urges come up and it’s depressing to think I can’t really see how I’ll ever be able to satisfy them. 

Don’t like people. Always felt pretty alone. Had a big group of “friends” in school, always had people gravitate to me in jobs and stuff too but I’ve never felt connected to any of them, really. Would always end up moving away eventually and have ghosted almost 100% of people who’ve entered my life. Met one girl once, at my second job and she is really the only friend I’ve ever really had. Long story short, I fell in love with her and she didn’t feel the same way and that basically lead to the death of that friendship. Needed to happen, in hindsight, it was basically torture being in love with the only person I enjoy spending time with but knowing she doesn’t feel the same way. But it didn’t make it any less shitty.

Anyway, I tried to move on after her. Got a new job, met other girls, lost my virginity. Problem was, every girl I was with just made me feel kinda sick. Just felt weird, and end up having… performance issues. Haven’t been able to orgasm during sex once. At first I thought it was my meds, so I came off them. Didn’t help. Had people suggest it was because I watched too much porn or something but I rarely ever do. Wasn’t nervous the whole time or anything either. Just felt this weird, sick feeling. Just felt depressed. Only common denominator in all my encounters was that I didn’t really feel anything for the girls I was with. 

I tried to feel something for them. Only a few were one night stands I’d never met or planned on seeing again. Most were co-workers from various bars I worked at, girls who I honestly seemed to have chemistry with, many of whom were clearly interested in a relationship with me. But I dunno, once I actually tried it, it’s like I just realised I was numb. I looked at them and felt nothing. Eventually I’d realise it wasn’t happening for me and I’d always find a way to ask them to leave. 

I guess I’m just realising how fucked my sex life is now. How I don’t really see a way for it to ever get better. It’s pretty clear I can’t have sex with girls I don’t feel an emotional connection to, but I can’t hunk of anything I want to avoid more than forming another connection like that with someone. I don’t really think there’s a solution. I know people say shit like “you’ll meet the right person eventually, don’t give up!” but I don’t *want* to meet that person. If I did, it’d only be so that I could satisfy my sexual thoughts for once, but just that. I wouldn’t want them to stick around afterwards or be a part of my life. 

I guess I just can’t enjoy sex unless I love someone but I can’t ever let myself have that kinda power over me ever again since it made me almost kill myself the last time. And if it’s a toss up between my mental health and a healthy sex life, I obviously have to prioritise my mental health because without that, I can’t function, whereas I can get by without sex. I guess I’m just sick of having to take normal things everyone else seems to take for granted and sacrifice them in order to stay functional.

TL;DR - I can’t have sex unless I’m in love, and I can’t allow myself to fall in love because of what it’s down to me in the past.",lonely,My mental state has murdered my sex life completely,2021-12-21 11:30:07

I don't know how long it's been since it felt like someone could help me. I am burning out but so are the people around me, so I can't stop giving. But when I need help there is no one. There is always a reason not to, and I'm difficult to help. I've done a lot of therapy and finished a lot of programs and have tried almost everything to give myself some momentum, but I focused on symptoms and not on the cause. There is a lot of trauma that was bandaged but never healed. 

I want to go back to therapy to finish what I started but I can't. The waiting lists are full. I don't know how long I will be stuck in limbo waiting for someone with the skills to help me. I can't afford personal trainers or someone to help me get on track health wise, and I'm struggling on my own.

When we first started talking our relationship was extremely sexual, but over the last year it's become more personal. I think the biggest reason we haven't been having sex lately is just because neither of us have the time/place to do so.

But I miss him so much. Yesterday we went out for lunch together and afterwards, we had a rough conversation about mostly my depression, and he told me to get out of the car and went around to hug me. I had my face against his neck and he was just so warm and I miss it so much.

I just want to lie in bed with him, I want skin contact, I miss kissing him. I almost asked to kiss him. I don't even care about sex that much, even though I'd like to have it, more than anything I just want to be close to him. I just want to cuddle really close and watch some stupid shit with him. I wish I could bring him to my place so we can lay in my bed and watch some stupid ass youtube while we cuddle, but that's not actually an option.

He's my only friend and I have no interest in having sex with anyone else right now, I don't feel comfortable being intimate with other people. I don't know how his sexual life has been when we don't see each other; we are very far from being exclusive, our relationship isn't exclusive at all, but I still feel a bit pained thinking about him sleeping with other people. Having a better intimate time with other people.

Ive been single for 5 years at this point, im shy and introverted, i dont have a lot of people to talk to.

It seems like every girl in my area is taken and popular on social media, i feel like i dont even have a chance (average looking, definetly not popular) besides being too shy in the first place. It felt ok when i was at school and could do stuff with my friend. Tho now in the holidays as an only child im home alone a lot, i asked him to meet up, he said he  has ""appointments "", i understand, he cant always have time. Tho he said hes going to a birthday party , on the day of my birthday. I have no idea who it is, he always came to my bday except this year.

2039,ThrowAwayPillow123,1640033503,1,"Background on me - skip if you don't care: 29 year old male, suffering from depression and anxiety since I was 9, and recently diagnosed with ADHD as well. I've tried over a dozen different ADs, currently on Effexor, as well as a low dose of Adderall (5mg). I've tried diet and exercise to control my weight (6'0"" 320 lbs) but can't stick to a regimen that works. I did exercise every day for over a year, back in 2012/2013, but didn't lose weight and felt miserable basically the whole time. I've tried CBT, ACT and DBT. I've tried rTMS and psylocibin therapy. ECT is no longer available for new patients for the next 2-5 years because of COVID. Support groups make me feel worse, ketamine is too expensive, as is more traditional ""talk"" psychotherapy.  

Basically, I'm lonely all the time. I haven't hung out with anyone that wasn't a family member, or a friend of a family member (small parties hosted by siblings, at our parent's house where I happen to live - I'm never expressly invited, but I am around) since well before the pandemic started. All I do is eat, sleep, work, and play video games. All I want is a friend and/or partner to spend time with, but I know that will never happen.   

I did try MeetUp groups pre-pandemic but even then, I never made any friends - and Lord knows I tried. Now, with everyone having to wear a mask and being even more afraid of single straight men than ever? No chance. MeetUp is slim pickings as it is - only 1 board game meeting close to me in the next 2 months and only 2 people have signed up so far! Nothing else remotely interests me.  

All volunteer positions near me, that I qualify for, have ridiculous shift requirements (2 6-hour shifts a week, which means either I work 14 hours one or two weekdays, or both Saturday and Sunday are given up to volunteering). Hobby groups, cooking classes, college/university programs, are all online-only now. The only in person activities seem to be physical in nature, which I obviously prefer to avoid.  

&amp;nbsp;  

So, now that I've established that it's not possible for me to make a friend, let alone a romantic partner (the latter being the only thing I've ever truly wanted in life), does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this aching in my chest, or the notion that I'll spend the next 30-50 years of my life alone?",lonely,"Struggling to cope with hopelessness, any advice?",2021-12-21 07:51:43

2052,AlternativeCity7144,1640025632,1,"So I have troubles with relationships, friendships, meeting new people, talking to girls and stuff like that...

1. My friends
I have a few friends from a previous school.
The problem is that I feel like I'm the fifth wheel.
I can't carry a conversation.
I two of my friends (both girls, one of them is my ex gf) that I feel depressed and they cared only when I was the one who texted first. I'm always the one who texts first.
I never got a text from them not even ""hey how are you?"" Or something.
Being friends with those two girls is eating me up from inside because I feel that I'm ungrateful for what I have.
When I was sad about being rejected by some girls they always told me that I'm attractive and I will be able to find someone and that I'm trying too much.
I feel bad for not wanting to talk to them after they did so much for me...

2. Relationships &amp; talking to girls
I've been trying to talk to girls in order to get a relationship or at least be friends.
Of course I was the best friend 100% of a time yet still noone talked to me. After being told that I'm a great friend I got ghosted.
Now I can't say anything to a girl unless I know her really well... I think that might be the biggest problem because once a girl knows me she just wants to be friends.
I'm probably not interesting enough for anyone.
There was a girl at the end of the school year on my previous school... I learned from her friend that she liked me I didn't really want to do it because she already rejected me once but I wanted to give her a chance because I thought it will make me feel better. Well when I wanted to ask her she ran away... I wasn't creepy or anything I didn't get a chance to say anything actually. She probably changed her mind again.
It kind of messed me up but... I think I was already used to it.
I don't talk to girls since then it always ended up the same.
However there is one girl I'm chatting with over discord. She lives pretty far away 6 hour time difference. She's the only one talking to me about stuff...

3. I can't talk to my parents
I can't tell my parents how I feel... Done it once... my mother always somehow makes it my fault.
I got hit with a hockey stick by some guy when I was smaller for no reason... When I came home crying she said that I must've done something to him first.
My father is a hard worker and always says some encouraging words that I heard several times before.
After realising that I can't possibly get help from my parents I just don't tell them about my day or anything. They're not interested anyway.

4. pp addiction
I built a pp addiction when I was very young around 6-7 years old. I don't know how it happened but it's ruining my life. I feel worthless and insecure every time I open that website. It just seems like I can't stop... It makes me feel a little better even if it's just for a moment... It's not worth the suffering after that tho.

5. Toxic feminism around me
I have teachers in my school who keeps demasculinating me and my classmates(30 boys btw) It hurts to hear every day that I'm uselles and noone really needs me.

I don't feel valuable.
I'm 16 and I really need a life advice from someone who's older than me I don't know what to do and I'm scared that I'll start cutting myself again.

I used to spend all my free time with friends, walk on the beach at sunrise with friends, listen to music with friends, talk about stupid shit with friends, make new friends at random times, feel alive…

It feels like someone else’s life when I think about it today and yet the best thing I can do is go back to the past and wonder what happened, analyze every relationship I’ve had in the past 5 years.

I am lucky to have a roof over my head and a nice one even. I enjoy how the sun hits my plants in the morning, or listening to music in my sofa. But my happiness is based on material things, not people anymore. I am happy because I have good speakers or because I bought a new plant the other day, but as soon as it gets rainy I feel down. 

I am not living life right now, I’m just following what is available. With a best friend living 4.000 km away and family 2.000 km away there is one person I can talk to, my ex boyfriend. But what happens when he gets a new girl or moves away? And how can I “train my social skills” when I either get anxious with people or simply stay silent for hours on end? How can I keep on trying when I haven’t made a single friend I can talk about life with or at least be myself with in 5 years? I have no energy to keep on trying and yet I’m probably more lonely than I’ve ever been I think.

so long story short, i took my cat in to the vets today, this suuuuper cute brunette, really short, honestly exactly my type from her looks to her mannerisms, was the assistant and throughout the whole thing she had kind of strong eye contact (masks on). and then at the end of the appointment the veterinarian asked if i go to any breweries in town and how he had a favorite one and told me the name of it. it was in front of the assistant. but i also wondered..... are they married....? the vet did say ""we"" go do this and that, but the vet looks to be quite a bit older than his assistant so i doubt they are married.

Umm I don’t have anyone to hangout with around me. If I did I probably wouldn’t be alone.. Possibly?

2066,HooplaInABagel,1640018949,1,"I'm here to tell you - it is 100% normal and okay to crave a relationship and intimacy, despite what others are saying.

What else is there to say? We as humans are naturally social animals. We require intimacy with a special someone because that's what undoubtedly leads to procreation, what mother nature intends for us. 

You may be that person who's always outwardly expressing how much you want to be in a relationship, to find that significant other, to experience romantic love, and just constantly be shot down by others who tell you to ""find a hobby"" or ""relax and enjoy yourself"". For those of us who have lives and interests outside of wanting a relationship, there's no explanation required - it's all horseshit.

It's like others who aren't lonely, who have people in their lives to count on, are physically unable to have SYMPATHY for those of us who are lonely. Sure, maybe what they say is all coming from a good place in heart. It is advice after all made with the intention to help your situation. But at the end of the day, sometimes all we need is just SYMPATHY. A sense of understanding and compassion for the pain that we're experiencing as a result. A hand on the shoulder.

2067,Mario199907,1640016606,1,"For the last year or 2 I’ve become increasingly more depressed and lonely. I had a good circle of friends but I’ve never had a relationship. When I was younger around 15-19 I wasn’t bothered by the whole relationship thing. But I did begin to develop depression around 15-16 from other situations in my life. But now as I’ve got older and see my friends etc get into relationships I’ve started to question if its something I’m ready for or open to. Only problem is I tend to be quiet nervous and overthink a lot. I do also have autism and ADHD which doesn’t help the matter so I tend it quite hard to connect to anyone of the opposite sex really. The issue is now I’m realising this I question if I’ll ever be able to do it. If I struggle to talk to females now then how am I going to be able to do it in the future when most likely women won’t give time or be interested in someone who struggles with the basics of a talking stage. I have some insecurities from the previous girls I have actually tried to get to know which have left almost like a mental scare on me which automatically plants seeds of doubts in my mine wondering if I’m actually good enough or if they are going to stay around to get to know me as I just feel like I’m missing something compared to the next guy.

Naturally, good relationship brings self confidence and the ability to adopt in the society. The odds and outcome from my opposite gender has made it difficult for me understand what relationship is all about. The fears of rejection and physical assessment has become an avenue to the high increase of loneliness in this present generation. Young men and women are now conscious of this response, unlike the good stories of sweet relationships that have been shared and enjoyed by the older generations.indeed the present generation are lonely , not because they are depressed.

2073,Debt_Sad,1640010723,1,"--I dont really have much goal with this post so I'm sorry if its scatter brained and makes little sense--

I am 21M and live in a smallish town in Canada. Life was okay in high school. I managed to make some friends (none that I spoke with outside of school), but I had enough social interaction that I was content. After high school I went right into college to become a paramedic. I honestly struggled to make friends in college but it was my own fault I was more involved with partying and drugs at that point of my life but still, I was content with life.

At the end of my first semester I got into a major car accident and I ended up taking the lives of 2 others in this accident and seriously injured another aswell as myself. I was 18 at the time so you can imagine the absolute guilt I have. It Took me a very long time to physically recover as I basically had to relearn how to walk again. Since that night 3 years ago my life has been a living hell. Anyone I used to talk to instantly cut me out except one friend. I did not really feel this at first because my recovery was taking all the time I had and I didnt realize my social decline. I was in the court system for over 2 years when all I wanted to do was plead guilty and face my consequences and they placed extremely heavy restrictions on me putting me in house arrest for those 2 years.

In the end I was sentenced to 2 more years in a federal institution that i was recently released from. I reconnected with the one friend and it was going good until depression too back over and I pushed them away eventually missing his GF's birthday because I really did not feel involved when she was around. She has since completely ignored me and deleted me from social media and he has not spoken a word to me.

I need to start over but I am so lost as to where to start. Obviously i cannot drive anymore and probably never will again so my traveling is limited as small town doesn't have the best transportation. I also have ruined my chances of any career I actually want due to me having a federal record now.
But what I really need is friends again. Waking up to the only notification on my phone being a weather alert instantly starts my day off with over thinking and placing myself in a horrible mood. We do not have groups or events that happen where I live that aren't geared toward 60 and up seniors. 

Unfortunately the last 2ish weeks have been filled with suicidal thoughts and it's really worrying me but I'm scared to tell my therapist as I want to making it look like I am doing really good to the parole board. My situation is just so fucked I dont even know what could possibly make it more bearable

2080,VeryMentallyStable,1640007076,1,"Grew up thinking I wasn’t even capable of feeling love. Didn’t love my family, none of them. They were all garbage. Never been the type to have friends, not really. Hung around a big group in school and stuff, people probably considered me popular, but I didn’t consider anyone a friend. Don’t think any of them even really knew me. Guess I haven’t been one for people generally and I’ve always been fine with that. Never really felt like I was missing anything. Knew I was better alone.

Then I started a new job, bartending. Met this girl there. Thought she hated me at first, she probably did. She was the kinda person who seems to hate everyone. My favourite kinda people, for some reason. Weirdly enough, after a while she seemed to warm up to me. Wanted to hang out. Would text me outside of work. Got to the point where she’d even occasionally drunk text me about how cool and funny she thought I was and how I deserved to know that she loved me (as a friend) because she knew I didn’t love myself. Was actually pretty nice. She was the only person I think I’d ever consider an actual friend. Then I had to go and start having other feelings for her and it ruined everything. 

I knew she wasn’t interested in me romantically. Used to jokingly flirt with her and she never reciprocated. Her friends used to make jokes about us being together and it always made her visibly super uncomfortable. Tried to push my own feelings down cause I knew if she knew about them it’d make her too uncomfortable to be around me. But I guess you can’t kill feelings like that so easily. Tortured me for months. Was a big part of the reason I tried to kill myself back then. She was the only person who came and visited me in hospital, even let me stay in her guest room for a couple nights after I got out. Was so nice to feel cared about, and god did it make everything I was feeling that much worse. 

It all came out over text one night while I was drunk, in the most pathetic display of my life so far. Thankfully I was so blackout drunk that night that I actually ended up getting taken to hospital, so I don’t remember what I said exactly. But I remember the gist. Very self-deprecating, wasn’t pretty. Barely saw her again in person after that. Quit the job the next day. She drove me to a therapy appointment about a month after. That was two years ago. Spoke over text a couple times. She’s texted me “Merry Christmas” every year since. Really hope I don’t get one this year, don’t want the reminder. Although I guess my brain reminds me anyway. 

Think about her virtually every day still. She comes up in my dreams constantly, had one just last night where we reconnected, she told me she’d always had feelings for me but wasn’t ready to tell me before. We swam in a pool together and it lead to us kissing. Then put my hand on her upper back and pulled her chest to my lips, so I could kiss her down the length of it, from her neck to her belly button. Felt so real. Can remember feeling the contrast of frigid beads of water clinging to her warm skin as I touched her. Feeling the subtle goosebumps dotting her body. Tasting the hint of chlorine in every kiss, hearing her sharp breathing. She *wanted* me. Woke up not long after to nothing. 

Thing is, I don’t want her anymore. I don’t want to reconnect. I know she’s bad for me. Haven’t heard from her in 6 months but if she reached out ever again, think I’d just ignore her. That girl jeopardises my mental health, my control, everything. I don’t want her. Tried to replace her, thought that was the answer for a while but every girl I’ve been with since has made me feel sick. I don’t want a relationship, I don’t want anyone. I know I’m better alone. I know the razor thin chance of ever meeting someone I like that much ever again would be nothing but fucking torture for me. But it’s like a part of my brain just hasn’t got the message, still craves it even though every part of me knows better. 

Just wish I’d never met her, my life was so much easier when I thought I was incapable of love.

TL;DR - Didn’t think I was capable of love, then I fell in love once and it fucking sucked so bad that I would give anything to go back to thinking I’m not capable of it.",lonely,Being in love once has ruined the whole concept for me,2021-12-21 00:31:16

2101,VeryMentallyStable,1639989736,1,"Last night I had a dream that a girl I used to be in love with. Was the only real friend I think I’ve ever had but long story short, I told her I had feelings for her and it ruined everything. Haven’t spoken to her for almost a year. Haven’t seen her in person for almost 2. Decided I don’t even want her in my life anymore, if she ever contacted me again, think I’d just ignore her. Don’t want a relationship at all, can’t stand people. But then despite all that I have a stupid fucking dream about her and somehow I’m straight back to feeling like shit over the whole thing.

Feels like I have dreams about her at least once a week. Or if not her, something else I don’t want to think about. But she shows up the most. Sometimes it’s just me running into her, usually angry at her. Angry that she stopped caring just like I was always afraid she would. Angry at her for buying me stupid fucking goldfish I have to take care of, for not listening to me when I told her over and over again not to, goldfish that now serve as a daily reminder that she used to be there but isn’t anymore, just like I knew they eventually would. 

Would rather not think of her ever again, but if I have to at least those angry dreams aren’t so bad. But this one last night was the worst type. I dreamt we somehow reconnected. She told me she always had feelings for me too, but she never said anything because she wasn’t ready. We swam together in a pool for a while and eventually I held her close to me and we kissed. Then I put my hand on her back and pulled her closer while I kissed down her chest. She *wanted* me to do it. She actually wanted me. I could *feel* her in my hands. Thinking about it now even, I can remember feeling the frigid beads of water contrasting with the warmth of her skin when I touched her, the subtle goosebumps on her from the cold. I’ve never ever touched someone like that before, but it feels so *real*. 

We went to bed after that, where we just talked, just relaxed. Just felt nice to have someone next to me, someone I actually *wanted*. Who wanted me back. Then I woke up and I was alone again. I fucking hate it. Why does it have to be so vivid, so real? Why’d I have to remember it? I can’t even *do* anything about it. I don’t even want this to be real. I don’t want her in my life. I’ve thought about it a lot, been forced to every time my brain feels like dredging it back up for dream material and I know that even if this was real I wouldn’t don’t want it. I don’t want anyone, I’m happier alone. And yet every time I’m forced to live it, it depresses me when it’s gone. I’ve tried listening to those lucid dreaming videos, tried all the techniques so I can stop having these dreams but it doesn’t work.

I'm 16. I met this super cute girl (16 f) at my math class.
I remember getting motivated about math just cuz l'd
look at her. We exchanged a few eye contacts initially
and then we started talking. Just as friends. I got to
know that she had a bf so I stopped talking and then
after a year I told her I had a crush on her. I got to know
that she broke up with that guy and she told me that
she had a crush on me too. We got into a relationship. It
was going well and like one day I'm waiting with flowers
to meet her after her sinus surgery she texts me that
she doesn't wanna see me anymore and that she's not
interested in this anymore. Like that's it. Nothing else
and then she found a guy.

I'm 18. My junior() got my number and called me. We
became good friends and then I fell for her. I confessed.
She said no. She doesn't feel the same way. But we
were really close. We were good at flirting part and
was a complete asshole and I hugged and kissed her on
her forehead without her consent. We stopped talking
after that. Cuz yea it was my fault. The next year I took
some time to realise stuff and work on myself. I had
to make up for the mistakes that I made. Apologise to
people I hurt ahhh it was an uncomfortable year cuz the
self realisation. Top tier Asshole.

I'm 20. The junior's friend (19f) got close to me. Told me
she had feelings. It was really nice and wholesome. She
was just perfect. It was perfect. We would have deep convos everyday, every night. She would keep asking me how my day was. She would call me randomly and say just wanted to listen to you. She would send me memes if I was stressed about work. One day we discuss about our relationship expectations and she was expecting a short term relationship because of her family situation and I was expecting something else. So we stopped talking eventually.

After a while the girl I hurt, my junior. She adds me on snap we get on a call. We start talking again. but this time it was soo fucking good. We became a thing and we were just perfect. I fell in love with her. Like actual love. She liked me back and she's someone who doesn't open up easily but she was comfortable about it with me. It hit the childhood trauma sharing phase. and I was soo happy with her. But she felt like it was toxic and is bad for her cuz I hurt her before. And she moves to another country to study and then I trouble her to stay with me talk to me get on calls keep me updated. She found it tiring and then she wants us to be friends now.

Ik I've been an asshole here but like I wanna work on it and I want to do that without losing her but again idk. At this point it has become tiring. It's like I'm losing my mind over this. I just want to be happy. People are like you don't need to be in one. It's not like I want to. It happens on its own people walk in find me interesting for a while and they just leave.

I’m 26… and well, lonely. 
I spend most days working 9 hours, come home to my cat, watch some YouTube or Hulu, and then go to sleep just to get up and do it all over again. 6 days out of the week.
I’m stuck in a rut, and honestly I’m getting tired of it. 
I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for years, only recently (a year ago) sought help for said illnesses. 
I’m doing much better in that department. However, I feel like it’s made my life the routine(rut) that it is.
I try to distract my mind and/or venture out into new territory…. It still just comes up short.
While I’ve always loved horror movies, supernatural genre, and “spooky” stuff; I’ve become obsessed with it all here very recently. That’s helped A LOT. 
With the holidays and such coming around, it has lessened my joy with said interests. Always being “shunned” or pushed to the back burner with my family. 
Anyway, I’m sorry for ranting. Thank you for reading if you did. I appreciate this platform to be able to do this on. 
If you’d like to talk about anything, it doesn’t have to be about this post or even me, my DM’s are always open.",lonely,Umm.. hi?,2021-12-20 13:25:43

I've tried and tried to come up with some reason as to why I'm unlovable, but come up empty of ideas every time.

For a long time it was 'what do I have to change', but last spring/summer I really learned to love myself and my time alone. Nothing changed romantically in my life, but at least I was content with my situation.

Over the last few months I started a new job, and immediately fell for one of my coworkers. We flirt nonstop whenever we're around each other which makes me fall more, but she's in a long term relationship (I know, master of my own demise). For her it's just something fun to pass the time at work, but for me it's meant a lot more considering she's the first person to show interest in years, however fake/conceeded it may or may not be on her end. 

I'm back to wondering what's wrong with me, why nobody wants me, and I just got out of that cycle I was trapped in for years. I wish there was something obviously wrong with me that I could fix, but everyone I've asked insists there's nothing wrong with me and I just haven't met them yet. But that's a load of shit I can't believe. If nothing was wrong, I wouldn't be coming home to an empty condo and dry phone every night.

Take me as an example. I do travel quite a bit, and until a couple of years ago my thoughts where ""someday I will bring someone with me"". Well, as you may guess, it didn't happen so far. Here I am travelling alone. Again. And I'm so tired.

I'm so tired of cooking for one. I'm so tired of going to bed wothou saying goodnight to anyone. I'm so tired of waking up and not seeing anyone. 

I started doing therapy some month ago (for a different issue). And I asked the therapist if it is something wrong or weird to wish for a relationship. The answer was pretty simple: it isn't at all. Some days we crave for the independecy and the loneliness. And when we get it, we decide it is time to, you know, build a stable relationship. 

But, ironically, of course, we don't get it for... whatsoever reason. 

And here I am. At the airport. Watching people going home to their families, partners and whatsoever. Wishing for the life they have.

2149,Flyaway_5,1639964733,1,"A bottle of toothpicks fell on the floor and I was putting each toothpick back in the bottle, thinking they would be resold. My coworker who was younger than me swept them up and threw them away. I kept on stacking clothes and they kept on falling, and my coworker fixed them in a way that they wouldn't fall, and I tried to stack them again and she said, ""Oh, no! Don't you dare try stacking them again! They were all falling!"" I was putting stuff from one cart to another cart and my coworker was left pushing an empty cart and said, ""Well then what am I going to do with this cart?""

I also am awkward and I don't know how to respond to sarcasm and jokes. Like when they say something sarcastic, I always seem to take it as face value and don't look for the meaning behind it. So instead of laughing and saying something back, I take it seriously. I never say funny jokes. I also am shy and don't say much.

""What's in there?""

""Hangers.""

""Well I know that obviously, come on now.""

I have a very unique perspective on life and the way I perceive people is different than anyone else. I also have received a couple of complaints about my eye contact. I have this habit of making intense eye contact while not saying anything. It's not really staring. I just gaze into their eyes. Like when talk to me, I would still look at them, as if I am waiting for something, and not look away as soon as the conversation is over or if I am not saying anything. Also, if I see my coworker while working, I have a habit of looking at them, even if I am not going to say anything.

My coworkers have said: ""Are you okay? You are always giving me that kind of look.""

""You are looking at me as if I am crazy.""

""Why are you looking me like that?""

""Why do you always look so scared?""

""What? Didn't your parents teach you not to gawk? It shows you don't have a brain.""

I had a coworker who generally talked to me, and she came back from a leave and said hi to me and asked me how I am. What the normal person would say is, ""Glad to see you back! How have you been?"" But I didn't say any of that.

Another one of my quirks is not calling people by their name. They all know my name and always greet me by my name like a thousand times. I know what all of their names are, but I just don't call people by their name, not even once.

Haven’t cuddled with anyone in a very long time.  I’m 23, in shape, good looking (I’ve modeled). But the circumstances of my life keep me distant from others. I’m fighting my way out of poverty with plans of becoming successful and financially stable so no time to chase women. I’m fucked up with ptsd after 18 years of an abusive household and having a gun pointed at my head and much more. I probably seem very unapproachable from the outside. Deep down I have a good heart but I have lived a very cold and harsh life and have been betrayed and hurt. Just wish someone could see past my pain and serious exterior and current circumstances for who I am.

Most nights I lay down and imagine what it would feel like to hold someone close to me. No family, few friends, and little support system to hold me up and be in my corner while I’m fighting against extremely challenging circumstances. 

I catch myself sometimes thinking about how much farther I’d be if I had just had parents or family to pick me back up all the times I’ve fallen. But every time life knocks me down it’s back to square one- no safety net.

Spending the night before thanksgiving walking through a nearby neighborhood in my city- walking past mansions and peering through the lit windows of warm houses filled with laughing and smiling families was difficult. I didn’t even have a thanksgiving meal.

Waking up from a dream where I could physically feel a girl I used to have massive feelings for so eagerly throwing herself into my embrace to waking up to an empty room and empty house was difficult.

I don’t know why I had that dream, maybe my brain was just taking pity on me and giving me a chance to experience something I was severely lacking if even for a brief moment.

I’m tired of being alone. I could probably walk out my door/send a few text and get sex tonight if I wanted. That’s not what I want. I want a real connection, I want to feel safe with someone, I want someone to actually give a fuck about me. But I’ve been hurt too many times and seen too much. I don’t trust women. Don’t even know if it’s possible to have someone love you back as much as you love them and be treated genuinely and with loyalty.

I left him and went into this deep depression. I relapse and started purging again [Bulimia]. I was uninterested in anything and everything. My friend,let's call him E was the only person who checked on me and cared,other than my bff. 

He always sent me good morning messages,goodnight messages and uplifting messages,even if I didn't reply. As days and weeks went by we started talking alot more. I was enjoying his company. I felt happier. I felt a sense of hope. I was looking forward to talking to him every day. Felt like a kid at a candy store. We were falling for each other. My bestie thought I was crazy because I never met him. I didn't care,I know what I wanted and it was him.

Later on in our romance, he would lie and I would catch him in his lies. He would gaslight me and backtrack everything. Yes it was a red flag but I looked past it. After this we started arguing alot. Then I started drinking. It made me feel better. I would binge eat and puke out my food,then drink afterwards out of shame. I hated myself every time I purged. But drinking made me feel better.

I confessed to him that I was drinking every day. He asked me if I can slow down. I said hey I'll try. He gave me an ultimatum, ""you either choose me or the alcohol"". I chose the alcohol because the last thing i wanted to do was make a promise i knew i was going to break. I told him I'll try. That wasn't good enough. And he also wanted my address,which I didn't trust him with it yet. I told him I didn't trust him because of previous lies. Because of chosing alcohol and not trusting him,he completely left me.

I wanted him to stay, I wanted him to at least let me try. Yes I didn't trust him,because of the lies. But we could've worked on that. On March he was getting off probation and I was so excited to see him. I had something to look forward for. Now I don't. I feel worse now than when I did when I found out my ex cheated on me.

2208,TheRealCipherQueen,1639945631,1,"Hi guys. For context, I'm a 19 year old autistic girl.

All through elementary and middle school I was bullied and teased, but I had one person who got me through everything. She was the most important person in the world to me.

My dad was practically out of the picture and my mom had her own issues she was struggling with, so She was also the ONLY person in the world to me.

And then we fell apart.

I was hurt, but I knew I'd meet a lot of new people in high school, so I figured I'd make another friend.

No such luck.

At least the kids were nicer in high school. No one really went out of their way to be mean, and I was actually on good terms with all of my classmates.

Now mind you, my autism was subtle enough to slip under the radar until college, so I had no understanding as to why my mom got frustrated that I couldn't just make a friend.

I was nice to everyone, saying hi to people I knew if we passed in the hallway, and at this point I'd managed to figure out that answering questions in class like Hermione Granger was off-putting, so even if I knew the answer I never raised my hand.

But I never managed to make an actual connection. 

I'm an optimistic person, so I figured I'd find my tribe in college, so for the rest of high school I tried to go out of my way to be kind, because I knew how easily that turned my day around when I was sad.

Starting college, still no friends. I even had a study buddy who I met up with twice a week but nothing came from it. We went our separate ways when the semester ended.

And then I let myself get really desperate. I figured if no one wanted to be my friend, maybe someone would date me. It seemed pretty clear that my companionship wasn't enough, so I figured if you mix in sex with it then maybe someone would want to spend time with me.

So I signed up for a dating app and ended up dating someone for nine months. I said ""I love you"" because that's what you do. 

But we never got past the surface level. We were always acting like it was our first date. 

Turns out they were lonely too.

And then they broke it off.

Back to square one.

Now, seven months after the breakup, I think I finally ran out of fuel. 

I cry every three hours and spend most of my time pretending I'm in a fantasy world.

I rig up my stuffed animals so that it feels like someone's hugging me.

There's only so long someone can go in isolation.

Maybe I expect too much out of people.

I'm at the point where I brought back my imaginary twin I created to cope in high school.

I just feel so frustrated and sad. I have a lot of shit going on in my life that isn’t good, so the fact that I reach out and try to make things happen is a big deal for me. But it’s so annoying when people won’t even try to work with me a little. Like I was trying to coordinate a thing so I could give an xmas gift to my friend, and he left me on read. That really hurt. Like guess I’ll give it to someone else?! 

In my head I know all of them are going through their own shit and they definitely don’t mean to make me feel so horrible but I wouldn’t know how to tell them this in the first place. I can’t help but feel like if I just vanished off the face of the earth none of them would care. It sucks. I don’t want to spend my college years friendless.

I have been mentally and physically abused by my ex, it's been almost 3 years since that horrible time in my life ended, and I still feel some effects from it. When it comes to relationships or dating in general it's difficult I could like a guy a lot, but after a while I start to pull away, I feel like they're lying to me, I'm not beautiful, you don't actually like me and you are just trying to hurt me, these are thoughts that run through my head, I'm so scared of being hurt again, I don't want to go through that abuse and manipulation ever again.

I don't have many friends here in Antigua, and it's really frustrating for me, I'm tired of being alone.

I feel like I'm a joke to everyone, where I'm from, like my life is a reality show to them. I was hit in public by my ex on several occasions, some were while I was pregnant with our child and I get these looks from people in my neighborhood and on the other side of town, I can't tell if it's a look of pity or of amusement at the fucked up little thing called my life. 

I just want it to stop, I just want to feel normal, I hate feeling like a pity case, I don't want to be seen as the girl who got hit in on the street anymore. 

I want to be able to actually trust a guy enough to not push him away at the thought of having a relationship. 

I don't like long distance relationships anymore, I met a wonderful man from Saudi Arabia here on reddit, and he passed away in January of this year, and I was devastated and shocked. 

I'm still sad he's gone, he was one of the few men who truly made me feel loved and cared for, he made me feel beautiful, even though he was thousands of miles away, I don't know if I will ever be able to meet a man who made me feel the way he did ever again, I wish he was still alive.",lonely,"Angry, Hurting and Distrustful",2021-12-20 06:22:19

She said if we did a survey most people would agree with her and and not with me (my take was that society is penis obsessed and that vaginas are appreciated and valued less than penises, boobs and butts, also I said oral sex is not anywhere near as commonly performed on women as on men, I guess she also disagreed cause she said it's all wrong for the majority and applies to a small portion). 

I don't agree, and I asked to see a male therapist instead of her, to ask him his take on it instead. Because it doesn't effect him negatively, since he's a man so he will be more blunt and less denial. Because it bothers me and makes me feel inadequate due to having a vagina. She also said men say ""are you a boobs or a butt man"" due to them being different sizes and so some like big or small, but vaginas are all liked and similar. 

She said she has seen thousands of patients and she thinks she is right and I am wrong and that most would be more likely to agree with her than me if we did a survey in our city. I think she is wrong and wishful thinking/delusional or just twisting it into a positive when it isn't, subconsciously. I also think men know men better, and male patients (and male friends) are WAY more likely to be open with a man &amp; male therapist about sexual things, sexual interests and deviances than they are to be with a woman, due to less embarrassment and less fear of not wanting to offend.

I'm a guy, about to graduate from university.

I've never had a real relationship… just ""things"" here and there. But thankfully, I've always made friends easily.

In high school, I became friends with a group of guys and girls, as ya do. One by one, each of my male friends got together with one of the girls in our group. Except me. I liked the one single girl left, a cute academic type, but she had no interest in me. But, she was not the best communicator in the world and more or less kept me hopeful for almost 5 years. I told myself she probably just wasn't ready for a relationship. I stupidly held out hope and barely looked for anything else.

It hurt when she ended up getting her first boyfriend last year. I felt guilty for feeling this way, and she's still my friend.

In university, I didn't hang out much with the people in my program until this last school year. Similar situation to high school; I became friends with a group of guys and girls, working our way toward the same degree together. And it's happening again. My classmates have been pairing off into couples over the last few months, but the one cute single girl I've taken a new interest in wants nothing to do with me. It's deja vu.

I just had a dream. I was hanging out with my uni mates, and I finally got together with her. Mind you it wasn’t like a sexual dream, just kissing and cuddling in dreamworld. We were just chillin on the couch watching movies when I woke up and realized none of it was real. This realization hit me very hard this morning. I didn't want to wake up.

I don't know how to keep doing this. I have a very fortunate life all things considered, and I remind myself of this all the time. But I'm incredibly lonely. Maybe posting this will make me feel that less. Thanks for reading. Peace.",lonely,I didn't want to wake up this morning,2021-12-20 02:28:17

2263,jita23,1639924647,1,"When I went to University for the first time, I was fairly confident that I am going to finally make new friends. It's been few weeks since my doctor told me I'l be fine, and encouraged me to stop visiting him for awhile to see if I can do this without his help. I was nervous at first yet very excited, as I really thought I had put my scary past behind me and could start from a ground up, was less shy and even attended a 3-day-long 'course' to get to know the campus plus meet few people from different fields (as I was the only one from my specialization there). 
Everything worked fine actually, atleast for the first few weeks it did. I made a study group with 3 other girls from my field, then got in contact with girls from the course and made a groupchat, and really started thinking everything is gonna be great. Boy was I wrong.
Pretty much everyone from my study group stopped attending the non-obligatory lessons (which I could not, as I usually had them between obligatory ones) and some of the oblig. ones they started to do online (as our Uni supports it), and I spend these lessons sitting all alone. They only write me when they need help with Chemistry, but never respond to my questions or do not bother when I wanna talk with them about stuff outside school. One even told us straight that she does not see us as friends (or atleast for now) and just wanna get the degree, and another girl made a friend who for some reason cannot withstand me, and I caught her few times trying to push me out of the group talks/games/etc. So, continuing the description - the girls from the course still talk with me about school stuff, but they do not count me in as their friend. They sit next to each other, hang out and plan trips in the chat, and I feel like a fifth wheel when they tag each other outside of me about wanting to do all this stuff. 
I am starting to freak out, as this reminds me of start of Highschool where everyone I hanged out eventually stopped talking to me or changed school, and I was not able to made new contacts because everyone was already in groups. Sure, one of the classmates that was in similiar situation started talking to me, but she constantly attempted to get into one specific friendgroup and after HS completly ceased talking to me. I feel so bad, because it makes me feel like I was only used as surrogate friend and she did not actually care about me as a person, and really am starting to feel like something similiar is happening with the people I am right now in contact on Uni - that they only use me to pass the exams, but do not look further behind that and are not interest in me as a friend. I am so scared that I won't be able to make any friends and will keep living lonely for another few years. I wanna hang out with people, talk about stupid stuff, do even stuppidier stuff, visit shopping centres and cinemas... I did not do such things for over six years and I miss it. It's like falling out of a bus without anyone noticing, and not being able to catch on it even after many attempts.
I am not sure what to do now. One member of my family told me that I should not bother with Uni people, that everyone there is only thinking for himself and those friendgroups I see are only faquade, but ... I still cannot get over the feeling that it is not true. Even if so, I do not even know where to find friends outside school, I attended some drawing class in the past and went to medical course but nope, I am not in contact with anyone from there.

Thanks to quarantine, I also developed a little bit of social anxiety. I’m also working two jobs because my parents are cutting me off next year. They don’t really have a choice.

Six of my friends/friends of friends have died in this short amount of time and most of my ""friends"" are back home. I don't really see or talk to them much.

Talking helped but I try my best not to burden them. I went to see Spider-Man with them tonight and I could barely enjoy it. I’m just a guy that they talk to help get through the day. I try my best to hide my inner feelings by cracking jokes. Idea how to connect with people. It doesn’t matter anyway, if I flunk out I’ll probably never see them again. I can’t even open up to my parents. I’m a man now, I have to suffer alone and figure everything out myself. It's hard opening up to them because I was already too emotional as a kid.

I have friends that only call me if they go out that is like once a month or something other than that I usually am pretty pathetically alone. I was brought up in Ireland till I was 9 and then flew to my home country india, so my english is also pretty polished. The girl whom I spoke to also said that I'm ""very very cool"".... Maybe all this makes me unapproachable? When I was in first year I remember a girl who came to my bus and said she wants to be my friend, also when I was in my 2 nd year my close friend said that "" You don't know how many people want to be your friend, you don't have insta , that's why your like this""..... I'm now about to finish 4 years of my engineering ... It's come to an end. I felt nothing but loneliness these 4 years .. Games don't even interest me anymore honestly, I'm growing up, and it sucks that I'm this way. I sometimes want to start a conversation with a girl in my class Or something but you know.... Those girls always tell everything they hear to the whole class... I will have to deal with that shet again... Well.... I'm sorry if I started off with attractive cuz I get it alot but when it comes to reality... ""What for""? .. I look good and people also tell me that but that's about it.. Ah well..... After I finish my engineering I'll write IELTS and go abroad and study, I'm going to start A FRESH LIFE FROM THERE. 
I'm going talk with everyone, I will never be lonely, I never want to feel this pain... This pain is like a worm slowly eating my inner stomach making a tunnel and loneliness will slowly seep into that tunnel...

I'm not sure if it's the brain fog, the apathy, or the complete annihilation of my brain cells, but I have not for the life of me been able to maintain a conversation with anyone new that I've met. Along with deciding to tackle sobriety, I also moved across the country. I thought this would allow me to start over, to finally be able to grow into myself, my sober self. Seems like I'm wrong. I feel like I have absolutely nothing to say. I'm lonely, but I have no energy to try and attempt making connections. Every new conversation I've had starts off as small talk and I just never know how to bring the conversation depth. I feel like every conversation ends up being fake and it feels like I'm constantly holding my breath. I just want to scream. I day dream a lot, I find myself yearning for sensuality and affection. My head fills up with fantasies about having connections with people I've never met. I feel so much, but my mind just draws blanks when I'm put into a social situation. I don't know if I'm being lazy, but I just want someone to know me already. The thought of having to get to know someone these days is exhausting. Just like any other addict, my substance of choice was my crutch. It helped me love and feel love. Or so I thought. I don't know if any of this makes sense, I'm venting without an endgame. How do I improve my conversational abilities? Or rather, how do I care more? Will the apathy pass?",lonely,"Finally sober, but lonely as ever",2021-12-19 18:55:24

2312,barnai_jumper,1639895099,1,"i've struggled with loneliness and depression for my entire life.  negative self-image issues and low self-confidence haunted my teenage years into my mid-20s.  no intimacy in my life until i was 25 and took it upon myself to hire a SW.  i had a positive experience that pushed me to get into the dating world.

went on a number of dates but couldn't find any connections.  until i met my ex-wife.  i could tell she liked me, but i wasn't really that into her.  i had been so lonely, i thought it was the best i'd get.  so i forced it.  for years.  instead of taking red flags seriously, i pushed through, and instead of breaking up, i proposed.

we got married and had a child together.  but my heart wasn't in our relationship, and she rightfully left last year.  since then, the separation has been brutal.  our child is the light of my life, but it kills me when they aren't around.  my ex has been slowly trying to cut me out of our child's life.  a year into it, and we're no closer to having any sort of agreement about custody, and my savings are draining on lawyers and child support.

i spent a lot of time earlier this year working on myself.  dissecting why i am like i am.  therapy, support groups, heart to heart talks with friends.  

in early fall, i thought i was ready to put myself back out there.  tried some dating apps.  nothing.  it was an unmitigated disaster.  to be fair, i'm really not ready to be in any sort of relationship again.  but i feel the same loneliness and depression that i felt a decade ago.  i'm afraid of losing more time with our child.  and i'm afraid that i will make the same mistake i did a decade ago, clinging to anyone who shows me any sort of attention in the future, because i'm not sure that i'll find anyone else.

i'm focused on my child's happiness 100%, but when they aren't around, i'm so lonely.  even when my child is around, i'm so mentally and emotionally exhausted.  i keep pushing through, but it feels like i'm one major life event away from completely breaking down.  i don't know what to do.",lonely,cycle of loneliness,2021-12-19 17:24:59

I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has leaft little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break! ( Just one left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends! 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. I'm currently working on 4 papers for finals week. It would be great to find some good company.

I know a lot of my piers are into hooking up, but I really don’t understand it. I am a profoundly sentimental person, I have always found casual sex to be repulsive and barbaric. I am 19, almost 20 and I have never been in a relationship, I really want my first time to be with my husband. The #1 thing that I want in life right now is a SO. I do not enjoy being single, I never have. I do not thrive as a single person. Perhaps being single might be more bearable for someone who already has a strong support network, but I have no one, I’m completely alone. My relationship with my family is toxic at it’s worst, and superficial at it’s best and I have no friends to speak off. I just wish I had one person in my life. Someone reliable, someone that I can depend on, someone who will never abandon me. I don’t think that’s too much to ask for, but in today’s world, men like that are impossible to find and gentlemen are a lost breed. I think as a society, we have lost something precious. That which was once beautiful and pure has long since been perverted. Romance is dead, and hookup culture has taken it’s place.  Idk, maybe I’m just old fashioned, either way, the knowledge that I have is a burden. All I want in this life is to experience true love, that’s literally all I want. If I can have that, I will die a happy person. My heart will be content and I will feel as though I truly lived life to the fullest. I feel incomplete, like a part of me is missing. I yearn for my other half. Ever since I was old enough to know what love is, it’s all I’ve ever wanted. I hardly see the point in living anymore, nobody gives a shit about me, they aren’t gonna miss me, so what’s the point? If no one cares about you, then what meaning does your life have? To exist without a purpose is as good as being dead. Many years ago I saw an anime called Darling in the Franxx. I feel like that show resonates with me now more than ever. Those of you who have seen it are probably familiar with the Jian. The Jian, also known as “the bird that shares wings” only poses one wing. Unless a male and female pair lean on each other and act as one, they are incapable of flight. They are imperfect creatures, born incomplete, but for some reason their way of life struck me as profoundly beautiful. In many ways I am like the Jian, I cannot fly without a partner, but perhaps one day, I will find my other half and my dreams of flight will finally be realized.",lonely,"All I want, all I have ever wanted is a SO.",2021-12-19 15:30:15

I got off pretty lucky compared to some people with it. I seem to have a relatively normal looking face. I’ve been told many times that I’m quite handsome, but it’s hard to know how genuine people are being, especially once they know about my condition. If you have a normal functioning face (which is pretty likely) imagine what it must be like to try and connect with other people in a social setting without the benefit of one of the most important non-verbal communicators in one’s arsenal. Imagine not being able to flash a smile at someone from across a crowded room, or grin when someone says something wry or witty. Imagine knowing that you can never smile at the person you love while you hold them, or preparatory to a romantic kiss. Imagine not knowing if you’re even capable of kissing, given that your lips don’t function. Imagine knowing all of this about yourself and trying to understand your place in the world of dating and sex, and wondering if there even is a place for you at all. Imagine being an adolescent and being interested in girls, but feeling certain that they could never be interested in you. Imagine being nearly 30 years old and still not knowing if you can be accepted and loved. Imagine, in short, what it’s like to be me. I wish I could start over with a different hand. More than that, I wish I could share my pain and frustration and not just get the same perfunctory (though well meaning) responses every time. “Work on yourself.” I’m always working on myself. As we all are. That’s all life is: working on yourself. I have an education, I have a plethora of interests and hobbies, (none of which are video games) I have a minor (ha) genius for music, I have a sense of humor, I spent the pandemic losing nearly 100 pounds, and I’m generally a warm, loving and caring person. I’m not perfect, I have a list of flaws a mile long, (not the least of which is being a redditor) but the idea that I’m some nobody with nothing of value to offer anyone is simply absurd on its face. And even if I had nothing but a smile and a plucky attitude, I would still have value. Because all people are worthy and deserving of love and acceptance. Now, I’m very lucky to have a loving and caring family, and even a few very good friends. But when I think about the fact that I will never know what it’s like to be young and in love, to hold and be held by a woman who thinks I’m worth something, to take a starlit walk and hold each other’s hands, to make passionate love and then lie there naked, vulnerable and entwined in the essence of  one another, to feel loved and to have the joy of making another person feel as loved, when I think of these things, I feel empty and afraid. I feel despaired that a person should have to feel this way, and guilty that there are those who feel worse than me and for good reason. To put it simply, I just want to start over and try again. If you’ve read this and are concerned that I might do something to harm myself, first I thank you sincerely for your concern. Second, you can rest assured that I have not had, nor have I ever had any ideation of self-harm or suicide.

I'm 2 years older than her and here I am - like in many other parties I've been in my life before - alone. Like, literally. I had to excuse myself to my room (we're in this rented mansion for the weekend). 

Though I have friends and have been to many, many parties in my life, I just feel like I don't belong. At all. It exhausts me mentally. I start to get physically sick. Makes me super annoyed. The noise. The people. I rather stay alone in my room right now.

It is necessary for me to take breaks if parties takes too long. As if I really need to recharge after staying close to people for long periods of time. I go some place by myself, smoke a cigarette or something then after about 10 min I can come back. It's a coping mechanism that I implemented in my life to last long in parties. 

Honestly, I'm not a girl of many faces. I usually don't care at all to put on masks so people don't usually push me to things I clearly don't feel like doing. But I do notice that people get uncomfortable by me not dancing and enganging in parties like them. I have heard of people asking if I had autism because I guess that what looks like (though I'm not really, I'm just in the spectrum). 

I mean, some portions of parties, and even some parties, are okay. I can have a little fun out of them. But most of them are... er, boring. I just rather be left alone.",lonely,This Thing I Was Never Able To Do,2021-12-19 15:16:38

I am feeling very sad lately. I have been lonely the most time in my life.

I will spent christmas on my own again, as my mom prefers her lover over me. I have nearly no friends as they all disappeared when I felt very depressed and did not wanna go out on the spot. The guy I love ignores ever since I confessed and claimed he likes me back. I feel like I have no one at all anymore, I have my imaginary friends, that's all.

I hadn't gone out in months and so when my cousin asked me to go to a birthday today, I figured I should. I ended up forming maybe 4 sentences the whole night and I played a round of kicker. I'm not terrible in social situations, I think I'm easy to talk to and I can contribute interesting things to a conversation. There was just nothing of substance there. I felt completely out of place, no connection to anyone, as always. It always ends up being not worth it.     
    
I somehow always leave these things miserable. Can anyone relate? I guess I'm hopeful to find that one genuine connection, which I was lucky enough to find in the past, even though that ended horribly as well.    
I have this unbearable hunch that I'll feel this lonely for a long time and I kinda don't want to. Not to say I'm suicidal right now, but I'm not impressed with life either.    
    
It's very weird when I say it but I think I have a lot to offer. I'm getting an engineering degree and I know a lot about a lot of things, I make music, I love exploring psychedelics, my mind is open to pretty much anything. I'm always told I look good. I just feel like no one gives a fuck.     
    
Obviously theres a lot more to it than tonight, it's just the most recent example. Even my own dad really doesn't care about me and I finally pulled the plug earlier this year and blocked him. My former ""best friend"" too.

Over the span of 7 months I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years, lost contact with my close childhood friends and suddenly lost one of my bestest friends. This meant my adult friendship group went from 6 to 5. People always say that odd numbers never work and I have been made fully aware of that recently. 
I try my best to spend time with my friends but I’m busy. I work two jobs, I’m a student who also competes in dance competitions. I have very little spare time. But of the spare time I do have I try to spend it socialising with my friends. My problem is they don’t want to socialise with me. Now this could all be in my head but there have been a few instances that have made it feel very real. I will come and join them in the living room and one by one they will get up and leave. One may go shower or go to work but often one will go join the other in a room with the door closed. Suddenly I find myself on my own. 
Quite often I will make the effort to text them and the replies I get and blunt or nonexistent. 
I’ll reply to them in the group chat and I’m ignored. Whereas others get replies instantly.
This could all be coincidence but the other day I went to visit our friend who passed away. I went with my mum as it was agreed we wouldn’t be able to find a time to do it as a group. I told them about it in advance and no one raised an issue about it at the time so I presumed it was ok. I was trying to be transparent and communicative. After my visit I sent a message in to the group chat simply updating them on how it went and what I got up to. I was ignored. About an hour later I send another message. I am again, ignored. It was, understandably, a really difficult day. My support network I should have wasn’t there for me. A simple heart takes 3 seconds to send. I felt so alone. 
I don’t know why this has happened. I try my hardest to be friendly as best as I know how. Do I talk to much? Do I not talk enough? Do I smell? Do I pull a funny face when I talk? Do I not like enough of the same things as them? Was it somthing I said? Somthing I did? Am I just bad at making friends?
I’m still friendly with them, I feel like I’m in the friendship group but also I don’t anymore. I don’t want to not know where I belong. Tell me straight and let me go or make more effort.

That any signs of ageing means less attractive 

That younger are seen as automatically superior beauty wise 

That being called old or older is an insult and being called and told you look young or younger is a compliment 

That men prefer younger women and will cheat on their wives with younger women when they cheat, that rich men all want younger women 

And that younger women (and men) think that they themselves and that women in general will become invisible to men with age. 

My therapist said she knows MANY young men who only like older women and MANY older men who only like older women and have no interest in younger women. 

My therapist said I am wrong and that she is right and that is you did a survey of people in our city, the majority would be more likely to agree with her. And that the beliefs I am talking about are a small portion. She said she has seen thousands of patients and she knows. 

But then I see it all around me online, with famous people and in comments online and in social media...women being obsessed with ageing. And with women I spoke to online. 

So I asked to see a male therapist instead and I will voice my concerns to him and ask him, since this stuff bothers me. And I feel a male therapist will know better since it doesn't effect them negatively so they are less likely to be in denial or twist it into a positive to convince themselves. I feel like they know men better too, their male friends are more open with them and their male patients, etc are more likely to be open with a man since they can't offend them with the topic/tastes/beliefs.

I tried to get one of my 20+ year gal pals do to a girls day and for 2 months now she’s put it off to the point I stopped bringing it up. 
I’m lonely - I want someone to text throughout the day, hang with one time a week maybe… I just want a dang friend really :(

Yet we tried to rebuild the love that was lost for the past 6 months. I guess nothing was good enough so she finally left. Before this I lost my best friend of 4 years 1 1/2 years ago and it’s never been the same since, I cheated on my girlfriend and he kept the secret, until he couldn’t anymore and told his girlfriend. Which is bestfriends with my ex, and the secret got out. Me and my ex worked over it which eventually led her to not hanging out with her best friend no more. That made her best friend depressed which made her boyfriend aka my bestfriend mad. He suckerpunched me and slammed me on the ground. That was the end of our friendship. Now a days I see pictures on social media with my ex, her sister, my ex best friend, and his gf all hanging out and having fun and it makes me want to cry like I’m the biggest fuck up in the world .

But my dating life is nothing to write home about. A girl I used to be close with years ago reached out. We made plans and she flaked without even calling ahead. I called her on it but I wasn't angry, I told her canceling is no problem but that it's just rude to do that to someone. She folded like origami and apologized. I accepted her apology but it's very unlikely I'll ever give her another chance. 

The girl before her had these weird trust issues and *needed* me around all the time. We eventually had a fight and went our separate ways.

The girl before her flaked as well but we had *some* water under the bridge. I gave up on her too.

So I see a pattern emerging here. In all three of these instances it legitimately wasn't my fault or my problem. If it wasn't me, these girls would have just done it just the same to some other guy. But it doesn't make me feel any less lonely.

I know I'm not perfect, not even remotely close. But I have so much to offer and it just sucks so badly that I'm actually struggling to find a partner. I think I'm decent looking and have the confidence to go after what I want which is like half the battle. I feel more unlucky than anything.

Why am I so scared,

When I am alone again?

Who am I running away from?

What am I running away from?

Why am I even running away?

I am running away from myself,

I am running away from being with myself,

Because I don’t know how to be with myself. 

When other people are around,

Even when love is given,

I am alone.

Other people cannot teach me how to treat myself,

Other people cannot teach me how to love myself,

And when finally alone,

I have no excuses,

I have no distractions.

What happens when I end up by myself?

The leading part of me is destructive,

And the other trying to survive.

It is only when I am alone that I can fully dive in the blackwater,

To free myself from the darkness.

When others are around,

I know I have a helping hand in case I drown.

Real freedom does not come without great sacrifice.

Paradoxically, It is only when I drown to death that I am fully liberated.

* Literature
* Art

* Quirky
* Sensitive
* Playful
* Creative

* Time and dedication - I am currently out of work/education due to mental health reasons so I more or less can dedicate my time to you.
* Patience - I understand you may not want to open up straight away and that’s okay too.
* Good morning and good night messages - I don’t know about you but these genuinely make my day.
* Space (whenever you need it!)
* A place for you to vent.
* Endless cat pictures!

You tell me! Perhaps this is something you could tell me?

But as soon as I come home I have no one to talk to. No one to chat with. Very dire situation with girls too. Like I thought that maybe my efforts were less so I started to have convos with girls I already knew but no one would respond after 2 sentences. So wont even bother to say about new unknown people. I just dont have any hopes of this loneliness disappearing.,lonely,No way out,2021-12-19 07:37:09

2418,Emmet_03,1639858829,1," I think i just need to write this down.

I feel really lonely since... im not sure, i would say since my girlfriend broke up last year but even then i felt lonely, because it was a long distance relationship over 2 months and i only saw her once in real life but thats not the thing i want to talk about. I want to talk about how it feels to be lonely to me and how i try to fight it (and how i sometimes even make it worse).

I wake up and find my bed half empty. I go for a walk and find no one is holding my hand. I watch a movie and no one is laughing or crying with me. I go to bed and no one is saying ""good night, i love you"" to me... I want to share all these things with someone, i want to cuddle, i want to lean on someone, i want someone who leans on me, someone i can tell everything, someone who doesn't laughs about but with me, someone who fells asleep in my arms...

Thinking about these things hurts in my chest and makes me so sad that i sometimes lie in bed crying for hours. Sometimes when i try to sleep i imagine how it could be if someone was next to me and i lay my arm around them and said ""I love you""

What could help?

Often the things that i thought could help only make it worse. For example hugging a pillow, watching a romance movie, writing down my thoughts (like now) meeting friends (the few i have) or going outside for a walk. A few of these actually do help - but only for a short amount of time.

As i already said; I want to share my life with someone i love and who loves me...

If I had a girlfriend, she would be my queen, i would be there for her in all situations, i would love her always. No matter how she looks like, how she dresses, in which mood she is. I would be so thankful and happy for every second i have with her. I believe in true love and would never in my life cheat or leave her in danger.

And yes. I know. Somewhere she is.

I really want to believe this and i do! but over the time it gets harder and harder to believe, when other people always let you know you mean nothing to them, you see other happy couples and no girl even looks at you...

2445,realitymagic,1639846309,1,"Keeping busy really helps to steer clear of the gaping void at the heart of a life without friends or companionship. 

And it’s a good thing. Cleaning up, doing dishes, working, reading, watching tv, drawing, playing piano, etc helps so much. And even better, it is all a small step towards a less lonely life, because the more you get into things the more the world opens up for you to participate with other people.

But most of me wants to crawl into the cave of eternal loneliness because it’s comfortable, it’s perfectly shaped to match my body, it’s a perfect pillow. And given how dark, and shit, and empty, and cold a lonely life is, it’s empowering to embrace it sometimes. To acknowledge that loneliness isn’t okay. It’s an injustice. It’s bad vs. Good. It’s sadness. And I should be sad about it, and that fact makes me want to be sad about it, and in a fucked up way, I enjoy being sad about it, because I should be, because it’s terrible. 

But it’s medicine for me to keep busy, especially when I don’t want to. Because keeping busy isn’t only a nicer way to live, it is also, potentially, a way out of loneliness. And that makes me wonder how much of this dread I’m giving to myself, if loneliness is just my own personality, in my nature. Because when it hurts the most I want it, I like it, I choose it. 

So I have to be strong to get rid of it. I have to get shit done. I have to force myself. I want to make music every day, I want to write, and read, and keep my house clean as fucking fuck so that all the people who will never see it because I’m so lonely would be amazed at the beauty of how clean I am if ever, as in a dream, someone would spend time with me.

People tend to push themselves to the boundary of being ""abnormal"" for the sake of being the unique out of multiple people even if its with some sort of abuse, mental issue, suicide, anything works. I mean I most definitely do it too so i cant really say shit but I never know what people decide as normal. For instance I was invited to a ""friends"" thanksgiving at their house with their parents due to talking about it in public. Anyhow watching the household environment where everyone in the family played games, eat together, solid conversations was astonishing to me cause thats what i would call abnormal (not gonna go into that cause thats mot interesting to hear about). But this also reminded me of how so many people constantly meet each other weekly and i cant even even try to keep someone i know online to  talk to me despite that person being the closest thing to a irl friend as im being avoided entirely. And this is the case with multiple people as well cause I realized that Im not gonna recieve anything unless I put effort into it. Despite that Im the only one I know who has left their comfort zone entirely, changed their entire personality multiple times, and take any fucking opportunity even if its risky or not but I cant even find someone to even talk to for more than 5-10 minutes or so. I feel like I cant grasp whatever chance I recieve as I had the opportunity to have many 1 on 1 conversations in a month but none of them lasted at all. Even my family obsesses the sibling who entirely fakes being upset, sad, whatever to gain an advantage to even the point of where people believe shes suicidal while having great relationships, scores, practically everything is smooth. Yet Ive stabbed myself with a compass on my wrist trying to hit the vein. Though its all probably cause im utilizing it as a popular method which is completely egotistical on my part. But theres people who constantly talk about smoking, illegal driving, working, etc at a illegal young age and that works out for him with meeting people so im probably just fucking it up.

I dont even feel its right to call myself having depression or something like that cause Im just using that to make myself feel like im superior than others just cause Im claiming that ""fact"". Even with memory I dont know if i just convinced myself I have shit memory cause I cant remember any basic activity as it all just feels like its faked for the same reason as the other one. 

To be fair the only reason I can think of ending shit is just for being a lazy fucker and running away like a bitch cause Im too fucking retarted for even thinking for myself. Though thats probably gonna be the one thing that actually might gain some attraction to me for maybe an hour or less if im lucky.

Anyhow despite everything of all the bullshit that I said, Im still curious what others would call normal. I apolagize for the shitty consitency of this dump.

That any signs of ageing means less attractive 

That younger are seen as automatically superior beauty wise 

That being called old or older is an insult and being called and told you look young or younger is a compliment 

That men prefer younger women and will cheat on their wives with younger women when they cheat, that rich men all want younger women 

And that younger women (and men) think that they themselves and that women in general will become invisible to men with age. 

My therapist said she knows MANY young men who only like older women and MANY older men who only like older women and have no interest in younger women. 

My therapist said I am wrong and that she is right and that is you did a survey of people in our city, the majority would be more likely to agree with her. And that the beliefs I am talking about are a small portion. She said she has seen thousands of patients and she knows. 

But then I see it all around me online, with famous people and in comments online and in social media...women being obsessed with ageing. And with women I spoke to online. 

So I asked to see a male therapist instead and I will voice my concerns to him and ask him, since this stuff bothers me. And I feel a male therapist will know better since it doesn't effect them negatively so they are less likely to be in denial or twist it into a positive to convince themselves. I feel like they know men better too, their male friends are more open with them and their male patients, etc are more likely to be open with a man since they can't offend them with the topic/tastes/beliefs.

2532,dazev_the_wise,1639799807,1,"Hello all,

I would like to share a bit of my story. With it I don't intent to bring solutions to anyone given that I haven't found them myself. Rather this serves just as a pressure drop rant and with any luck it will resonate with somebody else's story. For me it helps knowing that while I might feel a particular kind of loneliness, I'm not alone in feeling that feeling.

I'm a 29yo man, and I loved her, like I never loved anyone in my life. The first time we saw each other was at the university. Me a 25yo phd student, she a 21yo bachelor student that kept doing firsts years in different courses because life is just too ephemeral.

 It was her eyes that got me instantly first. These curious and naive beautiful green eyes enlarged by her thick glasses. The second thing was her colorful dresses that fitted perfectly with her body. Never wearing a bra, sometimes you could see the nipples through.

I remember this distinctive feeling whenever we crossed paths of just being mesmerized by her beauty, the cliché memory that everything else went out of focus. What a rush of adrenaline.

We met through her friends that helped her(us) break the ice. I tried several times at the cafeteria where we had lunch but she was always in big groups and I just didn't have the courage. But it happened and I also befriended the ice breakers which are people really close to me now.

Man, her laugh. Never have I heard something so genuine and contagious. Camping, traveling, hiking, singing, dancing, picnicking, talking about literature, poetry, physics,... there was no end in sight to the things we liked to do in common. The first two years were very intense with passion and adventure. We had sex several times a day when together, we did everything humans should be doing, either having crazy make-out sessions on random public bathrooms to intense make-her-orgasm-while-kissing-her-like-it-was-the-first-time, where for a moment you have eternity to take your time to feel every inch of her body. I smelled constantly like pussy. 

We moved in together in the first few months, and with her everything was just easy, it's like she was a very close family member that I had somehow forgotten. As a introvert person, being around her was the most refreshing thing ever, I loved our moments of silent staring, like you would get transported somewhere, this imaginary place that was only ours and we didn't need speech to communicate. Her heavy breath when she fell asleep on my chest and cuddled closer to my neck, nothing was more peaceful that feeling her tired naked body against me. 

I loved her family and she loved mine. For a while, our dream was to build a family and have kids too, with which we could teach what we knew, pass on what we learned so they could achieve even greater things than we did. We wanted to provide fun, safety and love to little human beings. We even got a cat, we took care of him and saw him grow. 

Things started to turn sour by the end of our third year with the end of both my PhD and her bachelor's. The corona pandemic made us have to be in the same room for several months. Our plans to live abroad suddenly were not the plans that she wanted anymore, she also developed a serious depression. Having had to spend so much time alone with me in a single room was too much for her. She wanted me to go away. 

So I did. We broke up 6 months ago give it or take.  I'm in a different country now, getting to know new people and new places. But not before we had casual sex because even though she doesn't love me anymore she is still horny and I was not in control. I've never been so low in my life. The new people are nice but being older it takes longer to really get to know them and connect. I thought that I would get my happy ending already and I thought that I had it all. I'm living a life that feels alien to me, I don't recognize me anymore. Having to rediscovery myself has been a hell of a challenge. 

Having had gone through similar situations, albeit smaller in every sense, in the past I know that if I allow myself the future holds great things that will be surprising because, of course, they are unknown. My emotional self doesn't think like this though and if I can I will indulge in my self - pity and loathing. 

One thing is for sure though, I am able to love and love a lot. So I'll keep this love safe for the next person that deserves it.

It's hard to connect when the relationship is that shallow.  My last relationship was particularly tough.  I gave so much of myself and compromised who I was to make them happy.  I felt so desperate to not be alone and it hurt me so much to walk away from it.  It was an incredibly toxic situation.  I am confident in myself, who I am and what I'm capable of.  But I'm tired of being alone. Deep down I know I shouldn't sacrifice who I am to be with other people, but at the same time I have no idea how to find someone to share my life with in a meaningful way.

That any signs of ageing means less attractive 

That younger are seen as automatically superior beauty wise 

That being called old or older is an insult and being called and told you look young or younger is a compliment 

That men prefer younger women and will cheat on their wives with younger women when they cheat, that rich men all want younger women 

And that younger women (and men) think that they themselves and that women in general will become invisible to men with age. 

My therapist said she knows MANY young men who only like older women and MANY older men who only like older women and have no interest in younger women. 

My therapist said I am wrong and that she is right and that is you did a survey of people in our city, the majority would be more likely to agree with her. And that the beliefs I am talking about are a small portion. She said she has seen thousands of patients and she knows. 

But then I see it all around me online, with famous people and in comments online and in social media...women being obsessed with ageing. And with women I spoke to online. 

So I asked to see a male therapist instead and I will voice my concerns to him and ask him, since this stuff bothers me. And I feel a male therapist will know better since it doesn't effect them negatively so they are less likely to be in denial or twist it into a positive to convince themselves. I feel like they know men better too, their male friends are more open with them and their male patients, etc are more likely to be open with a man since they can't offend them with the topic/tastes/beliefs.

I had maybe 3 actual friends i was close with but not that close that i felt 100% comfortable with them. Its not that i dont want to be close with anyone its just that anytime i do everything goes to hell. 

My homelife is horrible, my mom tries to ruin every friendship or relationship i have by manipulating me. My mom tends to play with my freedom as she pleases. Whenever i say anything she gets upset and changes it into something its not but when i try to explain im the one lying. When she actually does get upset she says dumb shit like ""ive given you too much freedom it seems you think im gonne let you go tonight"" (context: i was gonna celebrate christmas w friends. FRIENDS SHE KNOWS AND HAS MET MANY MANY TIMES). She doesnt have any friends, doesnt work, has a terrible relationship with my dad and shes probably very lonely too. Every time i try to do something fun with her i regret my decision.

I wanna move out so bad but my family isnt allowing me. Everytime i told my sister about how much i fucking hate my life she says its bc i need to stop wanting to be white. Since when is wanting freedom equal to wanting to be white. I have two jobs but i dont make enough to actually move out but i can get a studentloan tho. Its just tough because i feel like if i move out or even talk about moving out i get shot down immediately and i will lose my family. Its like choosing between family or myself. 

Last time everything went to shit i learned to love being alone and i did. I laid off social media, i got into poetry and spirituality. After a whole i started socialising and even getting into a friendgroup. At first i was so happy even my homelife wasnt terrible everything seemed to go well. 

Now the friendgroup is becoming more toxic, my uni classmates are horrible, im drifting apart from my old high school friend, i need to quit one of my jobs bc my sister doesnt like it. My mom threatened to go to my jobs and embarrass me. I feel helpless and i want to disconnect myself from everyone and everything. 

It feels like im living life on autopilot. I seem to be everyones second choice. I cant even pick up on reading again bc i want to read a book about the sad pathetic feelings im feeling. Every sad book i read is about heartbreak or sadness caused by love but how can i relate to these books when i cant even comprehend the concept of love. 

Its currently 1:04 AM and i feel the lowest ive been in a really long time. I read through old diary pages and im in the same exact spot i used to be.  When will it be my turn to be happy and to be free.

&gt;Catastrophizing: Focusing on and emphasizing the awful, horrible, and unbearable nature of a situation.

Once you realize what they could be, when you realize that you'll never be that happy couple you see opening presents together, when you understand that the most you'll ever get is a fantasy. Each day that goes by I understand this more. As the days count down towards Christmas, each day I dread more than the last. It feels like a little part of me breaks with each coming day, I don't even know if there's anything left.

Anyways, sorry again for bothering anyone with my feelings, just don't know where else to put them. I hope you have a Merry Christmas or a happy holiday to those who celebrate anything else (:

I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years not long ago  and she would put up with my nonsense and it felt like she was genuinely interested in what I had to say. But as far as my boys go they don't really seem to care.

And it's not that my hobbies are weird, it's just that no one my age group is really into it. I'm 20 and I am really interested in older cars. The fact that a car from the 60s can run without the help of a computer is amazing to me.

I recently bought a 1966 Chrysler Newport and the owner of the car is a retired firefighter and me and him actually got along really well. He asked me if I could help him wire up some stuff on a older truck he has. I think this is cool but the fact that I have to be friends with someone three times my age shows how far off my hobbies are from people my age lol.

 I also like talking about guns and playing DayZ on my computer, which is a very niche game not many people play. 

The one hobby I feel like I can relate with people is weight lifting, as I do it very frequently. But I wouldn't really consider it a hobby since I don't really enjoy it. Mainly doing it to look good naked.

I always start out focused and calm but eventually i start commentating on whats happening in my head eventually leading to whispering going to straight up talking as if im streaming to thousands of people watching, or playing with a friend and having a good time together.

I guess it's my way of being immersed in the game but sometimes it can get quite something more than just that, especially when i play STALKER or some horror game late at night when everyone is sleeping. I usually snap out of it early but at times i completely pause the game for 5 minutes straight without noticing a thing cuz i'm imagining a whole conversation relating to the game in my head.

But then i quite literally WAKE UP and find myself staring into the familiar dark void of the pause menu, or maybe i've been fantasizing for so long that my monitor completely shut off as i realize i've been staring into my own reflection like some kind of lunatic for god knows how long.

For the first 13 years of my life i was used to playing games like Minecraft and Portal that are heavily centered around isolation all on my own without problem, it was only after i found out what it is like to have fun with others that i realized how lonely i was.

Is anyone else experiencing the same? It doesn't even have to be about games, you could be watching a movie or listening to music one moment and suddenly you wake up to find you've gone through an entire conversation in your head.

It’s there in the morning and a few hours after that. And the main point. I can really feel my heart struggling in the morning. Like it was behind. I walk to the kitchen and back and I feel this mild pressure over my chest and in the ears. And the heart is beating so agressively I can see it through my shirt.

We were just friends, since we were both dating different people but then when I had a breakup she was a great listener to my sad ramblings. We connected over stuff like the show Twin Peaks (I'm pretty obsessed with anything David Lynch has made).

About a week ago, she told me she broke up with her partner, and then one thing led to another, we started flirting, even sending some lewds (not explicit ones, I only sent her a shirtless pic and she sent me a pic of herself in lingerie). We admitted that we felt a deep connection to each other. But we're living in different countries (even different continents although we're in the same timezone).  

But now she told me to stop messaging her and she doesn't want to elaborate. I'm at a loss. Bear in mind we never met in person, but online friends can sometimes be the best friends in my experience.

I would give anything to go back to the way things were two weeks ago. We were messaging each other regularly but not every day.

And sometimes, I find myself feeling so desperate and lonely that I entertain the thought of hiring someone to pretend that they want me, that they care about me... that I am capable of being loved, unconditionally and without judgement. How pathetic is that?

All I want is to be able to sit on someone's lap and wrap myself around them as they hold me tightly, keeping me from falling apart as I sobbed into them. To feel heard, to feel loved.

It's not that I don't have friends or family who love me... but they don't know everything about me. And the touch I need, the attention I seek, requires the understanding that I am broken and I am falling apart.

Every dating app bio is ""I could smoke you out,"" or ""looking for a drinking buddy."" 

All my friends just want to go clubbing and get drunk as shit and get high all the time.

Does no one just want to hang out, play a video game, watch a movie, play a fucking card game?

I just hate that everywhere I go, everyone I meet just cares about not being sober and it makes me feel so disconnected and lonely because I love being sober. I've seen what drugs and alcohol do to people and want nothing to do with it. And finding friends/partners that hold these same values seem impossible.

I used to be pretty okay being around these people, but now it's all they care about doing. Everytime we hang out, they HAVE to smoke and drink. I'm just tired of it.

It was a weird feeling, doing something social by myself, but weird in a good way. So, I got to the movie, sat down, and the guy with the seat next to me was a really chill man &amp; we both talked about marvel stuff, before and after the movie. 

We went our separate ways after the movie, and the walk back to my car was surreal. 9 at night, cold, the lights from the Christmas decorations in that part of my city surrounding me. It felt as though I entered a new phase in my life, where I am now able to do stuff without the burden of feeling alone. It feels good to just, go out, do stuff, meet good people, and simply enjoying the night. Definitely the confidence boost I so desperately needed.

Anyways, that's all. I had nowhere else to really share this, so here I am. For anyone in a similar scenario, dealing with self-worth issues &amp; the like, please know that even in the darkness there is light. Things do get better, slowly but surely.

Young gun that recently turned 23 in his junior year of college. Living with parents and big fam (6 total) in a big city.

Don't get me wrong, like the most of us here we love simple things, our family, special moments and so on. It is just that everytime when a social active moment occurs (once in a while) I really appreciate that moment, more than the others I am with. Sometimes so much that I regret going or having that moment of the fear it being the last time.  

Everytime I get confronted by happy colleagues (I am a trainee currently) who tell about visiting their friends in the weekend or what they did. 

Classmates who go to a restaurant together or have lunch and show pics.

Old friends going to the cinema's or having fun with each other.

It is so difficult, everyone always says that not everyone's life is as glamour-like as it seems to be. But how do they have so many companionship to do so many cool stuff with then? I feel like the real down to earth people who value friendships and companionships are the lonely people. We do not do thinkgs just to do them... we do things because we like to be with people as well, people we can trust, we care about, can talk to, can call up, can text anytime, can do fun things with personally. And it works the best when they care about us too.

I feel defeated in a way I never felt before and the feeling of failure consumes me. I never meant any wrong and I just wished people could see this, but they can't. I had spent a year and a half on my own, not leaving my house or talking to people in general. In the meantime, I lost my grandfather who raised me to a months-long battle with cancer and almost no one was there for me. As I finally reunited with my friends I never felt so good in my entire life. I abandoned a years-long vice for an entire month and that was a record. I truly felt loved and cared about, and then that happened. I do know that your mental problems are yours to deal with, but as everyone has their own perhaps we should be more considering, right? Maybe I am wrong and do deserve to be alone and not forgiven, it is just made worse by the fact that there is no one to blame but me, I caused my own demise. I always forgave people who did me wrong, from bullies to abusers, yet now I received none. Perhaps it isn't right, perhaps it is. Everyone, I spoke with just said this was a ""lesson"" for me to take to the rest of my life, but doesn't everybody make mistakes? I have searched for stories of people who screwed up as much as I did and lived on but I haven't found any and everyone around me just acts and talks all perfect, doesn't this happen to anyone else? I am that bad? I have learned a lot in the last few days about forgiveness and about caring about people's faults, does none of that make me better? I much prefer people who screwed up, admitted, and repented than people who never did and keep on doing the same petty mistakes over and over. That may be me wishing that I had a way out, that somehow it was me who was dealt with unfairness but I know I wasn't. The world isn't harsh, the people on it are. Now I have no one to talk to, no one that sympathizes with me, and no way to redeem myself. I just feel abandoned and defeated and I don't know if it's too much or too little, everyone around me seems to have never erred, no one on this scale at least, and no help comes my way.

So today I woke up about ten minutes before my alarm, and immediately turned over and fell back asleep. During this sleep I had the most vivid dream of my entire life, where it was just me and a girl, who I seemed to be dating, hanging out. We played video games, teased each other, and overall just had a good time. This went on for what felt like years, like I was having an entire relationship with somebody who will never exist. It felt so real, and I felt so happy, until I woke up to my alarm again. And it all hit me at once. Those hours, days, years of joy I had just experienced never happened, and never will. And I kept trying to fall asleep, to go back it, and I couldn’t…like grasping desperately at sand just for it to fall through your fingers. And it is here is this moment that I realize that it is just my minds holding onto a hope that I won’t end up alone forever, that somebody exists out there for me, when in my mind if it was the case I would just fuck it up before it even got going. I’m in my first year of college right now and I haven’t even spoken to any girls outside of class and lab. I don’t even know how it ended up this way. In highschool I had friends, I talked to girls, but I haven’t dated any since I was freshman. Any time I tried to start getting into another romantic relationship either I would fuck up and push her away, or she would just burn me. It got so bad that I haven’t even perused anyone since the summer after 10th grade. And now my high school friends have either began working or school and have moved on, and once again I’m left alone and empty handed. Years of work building relationships gone. It was never supposed to be like this, dreaming of girls that would love me. In elementary I would tell myself middle school would be better(I was bullied), when it didn’t get better in middle school I told myself highschool would be better, and it was….but it also had some of the worst relationship betrayals in my life. So then I’m high school I told myself in college I would have the time of my life, but instead I just sit in winter my dorm or library studying, playing video games, or working out in depression filled rages.

2656,pgllrq,1639752109,1,"TL;DR: Say 'F\*\*k you \[username\]' to my new friend. His username is the same as his hometown name, so he feels offensive. I lost him now. Hard lesson learned, but I'm still questioning myself.

He is  and still in school. I'm 22M and I'm in college. He's still so young so I'm not sure what I did was right or not.

I just met a new great friend on my games a week ago. He is the first friend that I can talk a lot about my interest since my interest isn't really common for the most majority of people. Every time I talk with him I really enjoy it because I feel like I have a lot more freedom to talk about something that I usually don't speak out about.

2 days ago, I played game with him, and I made a joke with him by saying 'F\*\*k you \[his username\]'. I told him in the same way that I told my other friends, which was normal and funny. What I didn't think when I made that joke is that his username is the same as his city. He felt I offended him and his hometown. He changed his mood and was very angry with me. Note that he is also not very good at English, so I think it's another reason why he feels attacked.

I apologized to him, but he didn't believe I truly feel sorry about it. I don't know what can I do other than just apologize. Yesterday I asked him what does he want so he can forgive me. He said that he wished we didn't meet in the first place and he didn't want us to be friend anymore. I asked him if he is sure about that because it cannot be reversed, he said yes. So I had to let him go. I said goodbye to him and blocked him right after that. I blocked because I feel so ashamed of what I did and I think he shouldn't meet a toxic person like me again in case he changes his mind, not because that is what I want to do.

I don't have a lot of friends in my life. He is the first one that has the same interest as me, and I invested a lot of time, energy, and emotion this week. That's why I feel so hurt when I have to let him go because I don't know when I will be able to meet someone like him again. I'm lonely and depressed, and I cried so hard when I click the block button. I just wished I could find a better solution to save the situation, but I couldn't and it's all over now. I did it in the middle of my final online exam in college, and I had to ask my classmate for cheating because I couldn't continue to do the test myself. I was hurt and painful like when I lost my long-term best friend 4 years ago.

He is a great friend. I'm very glad that I met him and we talked. I just wished I can clock back the time, and as he said, I just learned a hard lesson for my life.

What would you do if time clocks back and you were in this situation? Am I good at handling this situation or I can do better? Let me know your opinion about this

Seems like I'll be by my self during this Christmas and New Year's celebration. 

I've living by myself for the past 7 years now. Friends have come and gone. Now, due to the pandemic, almost all of my friends are gone back to their native places.  I stayed back because I still have my stable job.

The fact is, I am lonely and not lonely at the same time. I enjoy being by myself. But however, in 2021, as the months went by, I've come to realize that I cannot go on like this forever. In the future, I would need people around me. I would have a family to take care of when I'm to get married. In truth, I'm unable to form any kind of friendships, even the surface level kinds. I do have trouble networking with people. Both my siblings are incredibly social and have a robust group of friends. I really admire that about them.

I shrink inside whenever I've to go make new connections. My social anxiety is bad and my shyness ticks off other people as being rude. There have been few instances when I was thought as someone rude while I was doing my level best to stay up float during that social event. Looking back, it was phenomenal that I stuck through that social event longer than I usually would have. It was a milestone for me. From the get go, I've been told to stand up on my own feet and have my career on focus. But it seems while focusing on getting those things on track, I willfully overlooked (or, rather ignore) the social side of the life. I've a job of my own chosen field. I enjoy my work, nonetheless. However, in the journey to being ""independent"" or ""self-sufficient"" what did I get out of it? At best I can say, I've sincerely failed at life.

Me and my ex broke up earlier this year and although we still live together for financial reasons, they are going back home for the entire Christmas period. Over the last 3 years I've spent Christmas day with them and before that it was with my family. 

I feel a little saddened by it. I have no problem being alone, I largely enjoy spending time by myself but it feels different at Christmas. I don't want to go back and see my own family, my parents split up last year and it would be spent going between three different households and spending the time with my senile nan I met earlier this year after 10 years of no contact. It just wouldn't be worth it for my own mental health and financial reasons. To be honest, the way I'd like to spend it is just with friends but they're all 5 hours away with their own families so that's not really possible. 

I'm not too sure what I want to do on the actual day. I've bought a few ps4 games for myself to open, I might make myself a dinner. It's hard to know what to do 100% as I'm so used to existing on Christmas day as either playing games while my parents do dinner or doing dinner and watching films with a partner. 

It'll be quite strange this year but already thinking of a plan through it seems to make it a bit easier.

2677,Lone_Wolf_888,1639741233,1,"Having gone to a single-sex high school, I never had any real and proper opportunities to be with girls. I didn’t have many friends who would have connections with girls, and I wasn’t too much of an outgoing type of guy. 

However, when I started uni, I decided to have a different mindset and push myself out of my comfort zone. I had this idea that I would, at some point during my studies, I would break my hoo-doo and finally get a girlfriend.
But it’s been four years since I started uni. Now, after finishing my undergrad and moving onto honours next year, I have been upset to the point where I cry myself to sleep almost every night knowing that I have never had the experience of falling in love with someone and being in a committed relationship. I have tried so hard to break this curse, but I don’t understand why it has failed.

All of my best friends who I met at uni have been in long-term committed relationships. While I am extremely happy that they are having the opportunities to share life and love with someone, I have been really jealous knowing that they somehow know what the secrets of love are and I don’t. Sometimes when we hang out, they may bring their girlfriends along, chat and gossip relationship stuff, while I’m just sitting at the corner of the table, remaining silent with nothing worthy to contribute towards their conversations. And whenever it’s just myself and my friends, they may have conversations about their girlfriends and their relationships. Whenever they bring them up, I just feel reminded how sad and depressing my single life is, and I’m forced to sit out any conversations of the matter, knowing what I want to say would kill the mood of the conversation, which is the last thing I want to do.

Then, there’s the family side of things. My parents, grandparents, and other relatives keep on harassing my about how I’m still single and not in a relationship yet. Every time I speak to my grandfather, he constantly asks me the same questions: “Do you have a girlfriend yet? Who’s your secret girlfriend? How’s your quest in finding a girlfriend?” I am constantly forced to put on a wry smile and respond “Nothing new to report” or something else similar. On top of that, it has been really depressing for me seeing all of my family friends be in long-lasting committed relationships. Whenever someone throws a gathering or a party, all of my friends bring their significant others along, and they all mingle together talking about couples stuff most of the time, while I’m just sitting at a corner or a chair just left to observe how things pan out. What makes things worse is the constant barraging of people who would approach me and ask me questions such as “Do you have a girlfriend yet? Is your girlfriend here? When are you going to invite your secret girlfriend over?” Every time, I’m forced to put on a forced, polite smile and respond with “I don’t have a girlfriend.” It may sound like a small one-off, but dozens of people do it at every function to the point where it just infuriates me. Sometimes I just feel like bursting out and just shout back “Get off my case and leave me alone! For the hundredth time, I don’t have a girlfriend! And I don’t know when I will have one!” There have been numerous instances where I just really wanted to burst my feelings out in frustration, but I constantly have to restrain myself. I’m extremely worried what would happen if, or when, that will occur.

And then there’s my dad. He’s been trying to push me to go beyond my comfort zone and just ask girls at random (or, at least, have a conversation with them first). I always have to explain to him that we are living in the 21st century, where if you were to just randomly approach someone, you would be lucky to get away without being called a ‘creep’. I have told him that you just can’t do these things. But what he doesn’t know is that I have approached girls, started conversations with them, and then asked them if they would like to grab a coffee sometime or the like. But that’s as far as I went, as all of the girls that I had asked just straight up reject me. Sometimes, it can just be a simple “No” or “I’m already in a relationship” or something like that. But, on more than one occasion, I’ve had the more… hurtful… responses. Stuff like “No way,” “You’re joking, right?” and even the occasional “Ew” response. In fact, one girl I tried to ask straight up responded with “Who would ever want to go out with someone like you?” This one hurt a lot, and it hurt for a long time. I don’t think I’m unattractive, but clearly these girls see something I just don’t see. I feel that they just take one good look at me and turn their heads away, without giving it a chance to get to know me. This is the real reason why I don’t approach girls anymore, because I’m just straight-up fucking done with getting hurt. I even had a crush on this girl, and before I could muscle up the courage to tell her how I felt about her, I saw her drunkenly making out with some random guy she had just met. I will never forget that sight, and how painful it was to watch it all unfold.

I tried my hand on online dating, but I had absolutely no success whatsoever. I can’t remember how many times I deleted, reinstalled, and re-deleted Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge. Every time, I’ve only had single-digit likes with girls who I wasn’t into, or were, for some reason, thousands of kilometers away (why would Tinder think this would be a clever idea?), or were those random matches you get, but are really just bots at the end of the day. I did end up going on two dates during my three-year on-off experiences with online dating, but they were the absolute worst dates ever known in existence. And this is despite the fact that my standards were set at an extremely low bar to begin with, considering my literal non-existent dating life and relationship experience.

I am aware of various phrases that are said with the intentions to cheer people like myself in this situation. Phrases such as “There are plenty of fish in the sea,” “You will find someone someday,” “The woman of your life is probably on the other side of this door/wall/bridge/whatever,” etc. have been thrown towards me quite regularly. However, over time, I have come to realise how meaningless these words are, and how empty and fake they are at the end of the day. Every time someone tries to say them to me, I just respond to them with “Quit it. It’s worthless what you are saying. You don’t know how many fucking times I have heard those exact same words, over and over again. I appreciate what you are doing, but it never works, and it’s not worth saying it.”

There comes a point in someone’s life that they would need to understand that some things were just not meant for them. Am I really not meant to fall in love, be in relationships, and potentially live the rest of my life with someone who I truly love, and someone who truly loves me?

Or am I just being too hard on myself? Am I just overthinking this? Am I just having crazy thoughts in my head?

ever since i was a child, i’ve never been able to form meaningful relationships. sure, i’ve tons of friends, tons of people to talk to, but when it came down to it, i’ve never had one person i could rely on. with my family being very, very inconsistent in my life, i’ve never felt like i could count on anyone to accept me, let alone, be there for me in general. 

now you’re probably wondering, well, u/wintrrwidow, surely there must be a reason that nobody cares about you!

i mean... okay, yes, there are reasons... but with society becoming more progressive and understanding toward mental health and such, you’d think you’d be able to find a reliable friend who won’t chastise or belittle your mental issues.

all of this to say, because i’ve never really had anyone i could rely on + everyone i tried to rely on left me or let me down, i find it hard to try to make any meaningful connections with anyone, especially now that i don’t have an immediate community to search through, like in high school.

so why am i posting on this subreddit?

well, your guess is as good as mine. the truth is that i’ve never felt more alone in my entire 20 years than i do right now. at this point, i’ve given up on finding love entirely, i just want a hug. doesn’t even have to be a long embrace, just a hug will do. i just want to feel like i’m worthy of someone caring about me.

People will only like you if you give them a reason to, whether that means being attractive, funny, smart, ect. For most people, this isn't even a consideration. They just have to be themselves. Being likable comes as naturally as breathing. I do not have these things. There is nothing inside me which could be described as likeable by anyone.

I am going through one of my darkest moments in my entire life. Having all kinds of thoughts. And i am an overthinker... as if i needed that extra dab. 

Whenever i have these feeling (which is almost every day) i keep telling myself "" one day you will look back at your older self, and you will proud of what you've become"" 

My grandpa, before he died , used to tell me  : "" no matter how bad it gets, you should always keep your head up. It's not easy, and it will never be. At the end of the tunnel, there is always light""

2704,major_kneegrow,1639720939,1,"I'm 23. Why can't I be like normal people. I'm super antisocial and shy and I hate it. I can't make friends in person and now I can barely make online friends anymore. I only make new friends/meet new people online because I don't talk to people in person except for random people at work but its just small talk like ""hey how are you?"". 

I feel so lame when I meet people online because most of them either like drinking or smoking and I don't like either one of those. Also most girls I meet are bisexual or want to try things with a girl to see what it's like and I just instantly think ""great another girl who's gonna get more girls than I have my whole life even if its just a one time thing"".

I'm so lonely I get jealous of pretty much everyone who does anything I mentioned above because I feel like I'm far from being a normal person. I thought finally getting over my anxiety of getting a job would help me drastically but it hadn't at all. I thought it would be the first domino I had to knock over to start to get things going but it's changed nothing except now I have some money I guess but theres nothing I could buy myself that can make me happy.

I really wish I had a girlfriend. I dream about having one a few times a month. I've only ever been in 2 online relationships and it's been over 2 years since the last one ended. The girl was a psycho that was lying about things to purposely feel bad for her and said things to purposely hurt me.Ever since then I haven't gotten a girl to like me as anything more than a friend.

 I've tried dating apps a few times but I don't get many matches at all no matter what I put in my bio because the pics I have are shit. I have bad teeth so I don't smile and I don't have anyone to take good pics of me. The few matches I get, the girls either don't reply to my first message at all or they don't reply after my second one. The fact I'm actually attractive looking makes it worse and I'm only saying I'm attractive because that's what girls have said about me when I showed them what I look like. Based off that I would think I could atleast attract the girls who are just looking for hook ups but nope. Every time I try dating apps they make me feel worse to the point where I almost get depressed and I'm not talking about the ""I feel really sad so I must be depressed"". I was actually depressed once and that shit was no joke. 

Meanwhile my closest male friends can pretty much get any girl they want. The one that hooks up with a lot of girls even said I look good enough to be able to get loads of good looking girls. I'm not even looking for hookups but this current attempt of using dating apps I'm looking for anything. I don't want to just hookup but I'm so lonely that I'm not ruling it out. I mainly want to be in a relationship but it looks so unattainable no matter how confident in myself I am.I know I have everything a girl could want in a boyfriend except for perfect teeth and a good paying job. I guess I just don't know how to talk to girls online anymore like I use to.

I feel so sad every time I have a dream about having a girlfriend or when my high school crush is in my dream or some girl I met online who I fell for because they're nice to me. Like this morning I had a dream about my high school crush even though I'm pretty sure I don't like her at all anymore. But for whatever reason I can't stop thinking about it because she gave me chances and I was just too shy to take them. Our freshmen year, I for some reason texted her bf and said he's not good enough for her and he wanted to fight me the first day of school after the weekend and she kept him from doing it. She walked him away from where they usually stand that day when I go to my friend to see his girlfriend. Her bf was Jr on the varsity football team and I was just some 90 pound weakling at the time. The next school year me and her had the same class in one semester and at one point she broke up with her bf and I tried to talk to her again. She had stopped texting me because her bf told her to stop texting me and then I guess she still didn't after they broke up because she wanted me to try talking to her in person. I texted her telling her I'm too nervous to talk talk her when she's with her friends. The next day I walked into the class we had together and she got up and stood by herself like 10 feet away from where I sit and waited for me to walk up to her until class started. Lol and ofc I just sat in my seat cause I was still too shy and she went back to hers when class started. I think the same day or maybe a few days later I looked over at me and she looked at me and I looked away really quick. Then I looked back 5 seconds later and she looked away from me as soon as I did. We did that for the next like 5 minutes. Lol then the next school year we had another class together and she was single again. At one point in the semester our teacher gave the class assigned seats and it was a science class so all the tables where just big tables for science experiments and it was just 2 seats per table. And like it was some prophecy, he assigned me and her at the same table. It was just me and her there for weeks and I still couldn't talk to her. I pretty much gave up and just let go of the feelings I had for her but every time I feel lonely I think back to that and wonder if things would have been different if I wasn't a massive pussy. 

I know this is super long and most people are going to stop reading after the 3rd paragraph but oh whale. I messaged my high school crush after i woke up from my dream this morning and never got a reply all day and idk if she saw my message cause we don't follow eachorher on Instagram so I'm sure my messged went in the chat request section. So after I got off work a few hours ago I unsent the messages. I asked in the message if I had a chance with her in high school.

When will the loneliness end. Family can only fill that void for so long. The clock is ticking. I feel pressured. I dont want to be 30 and still be looking. I dont want anything more in life than to experience my life with someone else that I love and cherish. Dates after dates, nothing. I am so frustrated. I dont know what im doing wrong. I have dating apps, granted they probably make me feel worse but literally i have nothing else so it makes me feel that the only girls out there are on bumble/tinder/hinge. I go out. I have friends. I just want to give up. I miss cuddling. I miss looking into someone eyes and falling for them. I miss telling someone stories of my day whether big or small. I miss telling someone about our future together. Its not fair. Im picky but I have been hit on by some pretty cute women but at the same time some pretty cute women have called me unattractive and such. So, I dont know where I stand. I dont want to sound like im bragging about that. Its not fun, its fucking awful. You have to take chances because youre at that line of attractiveness where its a grey area?? Is that the right word??

Its stressful. I dont feel like im making sense. At the end of the day though, my thought process is ""oh, shes probably not interested in me...so I wont make a move.""

I posted on the r/amiugly and r/rateme subreddits to see if I could regain some reassurance that nothing is wrong with me or maybe to push me closer to the edge, theres always an overwhelming amount of people on those communities that call me ugly, unattractive, or rate me low.

Its like saying theres a certificate i need to achieve before i can find love. Everyone deserves to be loved despite what they are going through. Finding yourself is an ever going process that doesnt end. Im trying, im trying to keep this smile on my face. 

Everyone enjoys being around me because I am so fucking funny. I do stupid shit, thats my knack I guess. Im clumsy. People like that. I like it too I guess. Whatever makes people laugh and smile.

I (25/M) have been working my current job for about 4 months. Last week I fell and injured my knee on shift. I couldn't walk without crutches for 4 days and am still off recovering and in pain.

Today is 7 days since I was hurt and the only person from work who checked up on me was my manager, asking when I'd be able to work again.

I dont have any close friends but I thought I was starting to make friends with some of the people there.

2730,statcous,1639711002,1,"I've been lonely for the past 8 years since I moved to another country with my family (I was a teenager at the time). Even though I can speak the language pretty well now, I can't express myself and my emotions properly in this language.

Needless to say that people don't want to date (or even be close friends with) people they can't conveniently conversate with.

A year ago, I joined an online hangout group for students who want to practice a language. A few months later, I ended up becoming a leader of an English group and had lots of fun talking and getting to know people from all around the world.

A few months ago, I (digitally) met and started collaborating with the leader of another group. We ended up getting surprisingly friendly in a short span of time and talked to each other for hours at a time. Since she already was in a relationship, I decided we should part ways after our professional collaboration ended.

And so we did. But now, after having experienced connecting with someone and feeling like I could tell them anything, I feel lonelier than I ever did before. My friendships here are all shallow and I don't trust any of my friends enough to open up to them in any way (apart from the fact that I can't even properly tell them how I feel in their language).

I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this to be honest. I've started self-harming again for the first time since high school.

2731,Slow_Taro_3993,1639710962,1,"Not quite sure if this ""story"" fits this subreddit, but here goes.... I apologize if this post is way too long. 

I am 29m. I've always been social. I can talk to pretty much anyone with no trouble at all. From the outside people would take me as very socia person. But the truth is quite the opposite, unfortunately. My last relationship ended years ago. I never even thought about looking for another relationship since, I've always been working non stop ever since I could work. During last relationship, I was accused of cheating because of the profession that I was in (truck driver). The truth is the opposite, I never had the time to cheat, always work or in this case driving all over the continental United States delivering here and there. Every time I knew I would be in the area of the ex's place. I would take a time off work. And stay and treat her and her family out and well. I was so serious about the relationship that for their 30th anniversary gift, I paid off the mortgage of her parents house. I even asked her father for his approval for his daughter's hand in marriage, to which he gave me their approval. A couple months later, happened to be my birthday month and I had taken the whole month off, for a month long cruise and had bought a ring. As I had arrive to their place, she met me at the front door informing that she was wanting to break things off. Little to her knowledge that I had the ring in my pocket and i had made an offer to buy a house near her parents place so she would be close to them. Just need to sign the paperwork to close the deal. I had everything planned out. But just like that, it was shattered to pieces, like glass.... And that was the last time that I spoke or seen her. This happened about about 4 years ago now.
 Perhaps, I haven't had closure yet. I'm not sure, honestly. Not to sure about anything these days. All I know is that I live in a house alone with all the money that I made. Only spent about 30% of my gross income while I was working because I hardly had any bill to worry about except a couple bills I had at the time.
As I type this out with my phone in the dark, I realize maybe the reason I feel so lonely is because i haven't had closure. I honestly haven't seeked out another romantic relationship since then. I've accepted that I'll most likely never be in another relationship again. Social just lonely. I have many friends but none of them know of the pain and loneliness I feel. I usually cry myself to sleep every night. I feel so alone in the world. I have my best friend (female) who I talk to every day. I'm scared to open up to her because I'm afraid to lose her as my best friend, so I haven't mentioned any of my troubles to her. Maybe it's the way I was raised, that affects why I won't/can't open up about my feeling or emotions. No matter how hard I try, i cannot make myself talk (verbally) aloud about any of this. This is the first time EVER  that I told anyone about a little something personal about my inner demons that I struggle with every single day. 
I apologize for the long post and I'm on mobile, so forgive me if there's anythings wrong with the way its typed. I literally typed it as I thought it.

My girlfriend of 5 years my best friend.. My only friend. She cheated on me over and over. She sent the man hundreds when we ate ramen and ravioli. We arent together anymore.. I broke it off. But we live together.. Im in a different state then what I know. Where my childhood friends are but we havent talked in years.. She was my only friend. I dont know anyone here. Just coworkers at my shit fast food job. Too awkward to make them my friends they think im a serial killer or something.. I walk to work and home from work. Ive never been this kind of guy but I count the cars on the way home every night.  I wish one wouldnt see me or would be texting or something. I just feel like a loser.. And so alone. The girl that was only supposed to care for me.. She was perfect in everyway until this. She was a virgin when we got together.. We promised forever and always. We grew so close. My only friend and now I just watch her text and smile down at her phone when im here in silence cause she isnt interested to even talk to me. I try and skate to feel better like I always have and I just end up sitting on the curb. Listing all my loser qualities.. Knowing im too shitty to fix them. My fucked job. She is the one with a car. I play on a wooden toy. I dont go out. My teeth are beyond fucked. I couldnt swoon a girl if I wanted to. I cant even get a dude to be my friend without them bailing on me. I was beyond lucky to even get her to like me as a friend much less promise forever and always.All I can think is im the problem. I know I am. I just want me fixed. Maybe therapy or a priest could help. Maybe that car. But this alone feeling is unbearable. I just dont know how to approach things.. Hard to even try when you dont have anyone to even say these things to. Regardless if they were listening or not. I guess thats why im her. I would die for some ears.. I mean I would much rather someone care but at this point I would take anything. Maybe typing all of this out makes it better some. Idk.

2740,lvz3r0,1639708694,1,"Hello, i write this confusing lines (english is not my lenguaje and i do not even understan myself) more to relif of something that happened today.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in an office, and to said the truth, aside of the problems related to work with clients and the imposition of seling, it is a very good vibes working enviroment, but the problem is me.

&amp;#x200B;

I had being working in myself, in the sense to became more social or something like that, it worked a little, but in the end i always are the guy who sit in the corner and litteraly do not speak a single word in the social gatherings, i suffered this kind of social akwarness before and was treated as shit, here is not the case, but in seems to me they treat my with condecence, but whatever, the point is i tried to socialice but i am mentally/physicaly unable to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is i said to me ""it has being enough of my being a coward, i will put me in unconfortable situations to grow up or break me, but at least had not the how could it be? gosth in my head""

&amp;#x200B;

So in the office they will be a end of year office trip celebration, they will going to a beach, and based on my resolution of put me to the limit i was very secure to going to the trip, thinking on how it could be me in the beach gathering with co workers but nothing to said i take the desicion of tell to my boss i will not going to the trip, but regreting like an hour later because i lost an opportunity to break my boundaries and also an oportunity to travel.

&amp;#x200B;

We recently went in a trip to a beach, but was work related, but we enjoyed a little of free time, and i was able to interact with a small group of people, one of them a woman who as being a problem to me, she is a very great person, by troble i mean that i have feelings for her and it seems that she had some feeling for me, also in the office i had had very good and relax conversation with this people (but of course very shallow, and maybe they do not even care of that, but for me is a giant step) and has being in a good mood by this like a month, improving my self and seeing results.

&amp;#x200B;

But then this woman act in certain ways that makes me feel bad (and also i think do the same to her, but by my social inpediment, and in this dynamics i notices that she could feel something to me) so today was one of that, she acted a little wierd with me, so i concluded that it not worth to trying to improve or socialize, i will be always an asocial guy, and that why i decided no to going to that trip, but latter on this woman acted strange trying to join me in conversation, and speaking a lot to me trying to open a dialogue, and when i leave the office and said to her ""i will see you the next year"" (vacations) she smilled and hug me for the Xmass and new year hugs.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is i can not really interact with people, neither take the corage to clear out the situation with this woman, so i have to feel bad for no having the corage to go to ths trip? even if i will fail in the most social interaction? but succeding in a some social interactions?

&amp;#x200B;

I realy feel bad that this woman had enormous power in my emotions (it is not probable that she is some kind os sociopath that play with me, but i think she is also inmatture in this aspect) but feeling worst to ditch this unique opportunity (i had to wait until next year) and yes, it could have being and unconfortable situation being me in the beach and just unable to interact, but maybe, like in that work trip, i could find time with a smaller group of people to interact and improve, and even with this woman, i think she was looking for this also, but whatever.

It was the only thing I was currently looking forward to as I'll most likely spend Christmas on my own and limited opportunities because of my village and covid makes everything worse. To make matters worse I also was trying to suggest doing some stuff on the weekend or maybe next weekend as well since they don't celebrate Christmas and most likely would be free.

I also got rejected by my dream college and watched my crush that I met there only respond okay to me asking him out and then watching him ghost me when I finally had the courage to try and catch up with him over text after he left to go back to his country.

My issue is whenever this time of year rolls around, I get this feeling of loneliness overtake me. I think it's normal as this is usually a hard time for most people. I lost my dad when I was a teenager and honestly he was the one who always made a big to do about my birthday and Christmas. When he died, I kind of just stopped celebrating.

Then “she” sends a pic of her face.

Now it should have stopped there but she looked pretty I feel sad and thought this was an actual human being.

Next week I end up with seizure like chills and fever, I somehow went through it for a night, got admitted in hospital next day. Couple friends were kind enough to take me hospital. But I was pretty much alone for the entirety of my stay there. Loneliest I have ever felt. My SO couldn't care to even make a call, my parents were oblivious of this. All I could think was if I died nobody would even know of my death, only my parents would notice I'm gone. 
This was few days back, I was told to rest for a week. Didn't really leave my apartment ever since. Days become hazy and blurry. 
I have these people whom I call friends, who forget my existence once I don't put in effort from my side. Couldn't care less if I live or die. 
Same with my SO, he's just there (it's ldr). Other than matters related to sex he's distant and unwelcoming. Doesn't let me see anyone else while not having any time for me. 
I love my parents to death, but they're in a tricky situation and I can't call them to another state when I'm unwell because they don't get any leaves and would effect my younger sister's school. So I just lie wherever I can to keep up the appearances.

The people who do have these cliques and friend groups. I use to think they don’t deserve those friends and that I should be the one with friends because “I’m a nice person and they’re a mean person”. Went as far to depend on karma to slap them in the face.

But after being in many groups that leave you with little to no friends it makes you lose your mind. Start to tell yourself “maybe I’m the bad person”. Because you’re starting to see all these “bad people” maintain their friendships longer than you, they’re doing more than you in life, they’re happy while I was here sad and lonely. I’m not really sure if I’m truly a kind person, because If I’m all these nice qualities, people should want to be around me right?

But I learned that’s not the case. It's not black and white, good or bad, people flock to who they like no matter the qualities and flaws a person has. It's just how much you can like them.

I'm so lonely my chest feels like it has a sucking wound, depriving me of feeling even the most miniscule amount of happiness.

Leave the house, do something, *anything* else other than the same shit I've been doing the last 5-7 years.  

But what? With COVID, every social activity I can think of is only done with groups of pre-existing connections. That is to say, in a MeetUp of 20 people going to a restaurant, it'll be 4 groups of 5 friends. Or the board-game meetup of 10 people, 3 groups of 2 and a group of 4. Never anyone who comes alone. People with no friends aren't welcome in these settings any longer. It has become impossible to make new friends for someone like me - someone awkward, with no pre-existing social network, no social skills to speak of, no charm or good looks to carry them through that weird first encounter.  

And besides that, going out and attempting to socialize with strangers, is absolutely fucking terrifying. What if I accidentally creep someone out? What if literally everyone ignores me when I try to start a conversation? What if I am never invited back to that particular group/event/area because I made someone uncomfortable due to my awkwardness? (All of these things have happened in the past.)

I'm currently having what I like to call an *episodic depression*, it's sudden, it can last up to a day and I usually feel like utter shit. It happens when I either think or talk about certain things, and most of the time, I know that what I'm feeling down about is kinda stupid really, but I just can't shake myself.

Right now, one of my close friend just celebrated is 3-year anniversary with his SO, and I'm truly happy for them, they're way too wholesome. But it made me think, I'm single (has been for a long time) and I don't see a relationship being on the menu for me in the near future.

Now, I'm a pretty happy guy, but that line of thinking jut got all my insecurities and self-anxiety to rocket. Would someone want me? What if I end up alone? What if I don't get to experience that fucking amazing thing that some of my friends have?

It's killing me right now, I even fucking cried (and goddammit, when was the last time?). And fuck, I know that I'm not a lost cause (I even started to do some sports, gotta lose that lockdown extra weight), but why do I feel so fucking alone right now?

It's bothering me so much that I needed to write that. I needed to vent (but not to my family, they don't want to understand, it's always the same).

Lately everything seems to be getting ontop of me. I'm talking to a nice girl who I really like. We seem to be hitting it off. There's never a dry text and the other night things even got a little sexy. But then on the other hand she'll leave me on delivered for hours at a time while posting on social media. The thought of not knowing if im good enough for anyone always crosses my mind. I know it's not her fault but it makes me feel a little lonely and anxious. I've always had a voice in the back of my head telling me no one really likes me and my friends are putting on a facade just to be nice. It's always saying I'll never find a nice girl to settle down with and I'll always be alone. I tell myself it's not true but I don't know, sometimes it gets the better of me. I don't know what it is or what it means for me but I don't like it.

Aswell as this feeling of loneliness and anxiety, I feel I always have to prove my worth. I started playing the guitar to try and impress people and make myself interesting. I do enjoy playing but I thought it would make me stand out and make people think I'm cool and when no one really cares it puts me down.

i have been alone for the past five years. my last relationship broke me, as i learned that the boy i’d been in love with for 2 years actually would have préfères dating his other friend than me. we were together for a year. 
he managed to convince me men do not want love - do not want companionship, a life to share, a family. 
i had to come back from this - tbh i still really haven’t, especially if my last experience has been with an arse who’s basically ripped my heart in two and broke any form of self esteem i might have had back then. and it wasn’t much. my past relationships were damaging and non consensual. 
i have been alone for 5 years. and trust me, i’ve tried. the men i’ve ‘almost’ dated in the meantime turned out to be incels, racists and freakin mussolini apologists. two men I actually respected turned me down last year. 
i only know women. i don’t go out much. i feel so out of touch from the rest of the world. all of my friends are in happy, stable relationships. and here i am waiting for what? my mister darcy? for anyone to see something in me that i might not even have?
i am full of love, yet shy, traumatised, and invisible. how can i ask of someone to handle me, my traumas, my triggers, my depression, my everything? i am turning into someone sour, someone envious of others’ happiness. i can barely stand who i am. and i hate the thought of it … but i might need the help of someone able to see the good in me to get past it.

I feel sad. Always lonely. I figure because nobody understands me, no matter how much I try to be one their wavelength. Sometimes I get ignored, mistakes that I do will go loud and I got isolated. I always apologize because i feel bad for the mistakes I made, they take alot of time processing my apology. During that time, their or ""my"" friends would gang up on me, basically bully me, isolate me from groups because I made my best friend mad. What made him upset? I was dissociating and couldn't hear what he was talking about. He wanted to sit next to my other friend, but I didn't realize it. I spaced out.

It keeps going, every silly mistake I made becomes a big deal and I sometimes wonder if my friends are mature or not. I get more self-conscious, I lose confidence, less interaction, more reserved.
Quite the opposite of the what I used to be, careless and cheerful. Loud too. I'm always quiet, my voice took a toll quite alot, I get more lonely.
They sometimes ask why I'm quiet. I didn't want to make them feel bad, so I lied.

I have no friends now, go figure. I have extreme trust issues. People who hurt me gets chances, once they run out, I'm completely shutting them down.
I'm fine with getting hurt, I just hate being angry.
I get angry rarely. When I do, there's this burning sensation in my chest that I feel like exploding.
I try to sleep it off. Punch something perhaps. 
But never someone. 

Once, my friend went to school looking gloomy. She came embracing the hugs of her other friends. I wondered. She looked sad. Really sad. The rest was confused. And we soon found out she lost her mother to tumor. There was this particular sensation that I feel when she cried, it was probably the first time that I felt it. As if I'm in her shoes. I could imagine her emotions vividly and feel them too as if their were mine. It was weird. 

The class was confused because this top student that's always bubbly, cheerful, talkative, comes to school, silent and gloomy. 

Also I notice that when my father gets upset, his voice gets less louder than he usually is, his voice also gets softer. His face goes a bit red and he keeps looking down and always in a hurry. 

Kinda the same to me, when I get sad, I go silent the same as when I'm angry, resort to sorting out my thoughts and keeping myself busy. 
It would burst at some point so I have to be prepared.

2810,Difficult_Can_9799,1639677135,1,"Everyone always says ""we care, we hope you get better, it just takes time"" and then leaves me, I have no friends, my family has left me in the hands of professional help that quite frankly doesn't help.

Everyone just left me and told me they needed some time away, which I understood, but at the same time, it drove me insane and I lost what I had left, so now I'm here alone, constantly being told to get better, and that it takes time.

The truth is, time takes too long for my liking, call me what you will, but I'm not prepared to wait a year, five years, maybe even a decade, to get better, that's too long, considering I've suffered for months now.

To those people at my school who spread the rumours about me supposedly planning to kill everyone, fuck you, I hope you're happy with the result you got, because you've ruined my life and sunk me into a depression I can't get out of, and it's taken everything from me, I have what's needed to physically survive, but not mentally, what's the point in surviving if there's no good outcome?

I don't really know what to do anymore, I went out for the first time by myself in nearly three months, it was horrible, I haven't been to school in three months and I have nothing going for me, no one really cares, I just drive everyone away from me.

I'll admit, I'm the big issue here, I would always go on and on about my problems, shrugging off any positivity as a result of my mental health following the aforementioned rumours, then one day I attempted to kill myself, the next day I had lost everything, I've been to hospitals, therapists, put on medication, but none of it helps, no one really wants to build any form of relationship with me and its nothing but pain.

I waited 13 years and found the perfect friends, and when you spend the first 13 years of your life with no friends and a family that barely cares it feels great to find someone.

Sometimes I talked to her about my problems...but this time I am not ready to share with her. I won't ever be ready to share with her.

I tried a new part time job teaching. I applied it last month in a university website i graduated from. Everything looks fine, received the offer letter from the website and email. I also accepted the offer in the system. i contacted with person in charge of application said you need to claim for the teaching hours i did. I reply not until december as the lead teacher of my subject said.

The subject lead subject teacher explain everything to me, about the subject and stuff. feels ok. Only need to do it for 4 week. Assign for 3 hours per week. 

Did 1 hour per class. 3 classes today. Feels exhausted. In last class i accidentally heard one of the students whisper to her friends she does not understand. After no one respond when i asked if there is any question.

But at least one of the teacher message me i did an ok job, the he ask to replace him tomorrow for an hour because he got some stuff todo. And i agree just because why not. i got a free time and i can claim it later maybe.

I check the same website where i registered. When i click the claim link. It said there is error on my profile with a link? With a note below it this profile is marked for delete. i clicked the link but everything looks fine to me. All details filled. Then i reread my offer letter said and i miss a part that i need to return the offer letter two weeks after accepted it so that i won't be null or something.

Maybe it is my mistake because I thought everything was fine and no need to do anything anymore after the person in charge contacted me as i said before. After that I messaged her not noticing it is outside office hour. I ask on how to do the claim properly and apologize to her after i messaged that and tell her i will contact back tomorrow. Still no reply though. And that makes me really worry now. 

Thanks for reading this. I am just worry. Because my life is always full of worry when i want to try something to change my current state: jobless, no income. I do have savings, but maybe only for a year and a half. Tried apply for work but sometime worry that i might not suit to work, because of previous burnout.

We used to be close. We used to be each other's favorite people. We spoke all the time, we connected on whole other levels. We cared about each other.

But now? Whenever we speak, it feels more like we're using each other. Our relationships just feel like take, take, take. Or try to take. None of us really want to give anymore with the change in dynamics.

Like . . . If one of us is having a bad day, we'll complain about it. There's no consolation or advice on the other end, though. Usually there's someone passive-aggressively hinting that theirs was way worse.

It feels like we're always trying to one-up or cut down each other. And it's so sad. When did it become like that? I remember when I'd chat with them and do nothing but laugh and smile the whole time. Now? It's just sad.

I want to end our friendship at this point. I feel lonelier with them than I do without. But then I look around and realize I have no one else. And I'm the only one in our group in that situation. They've all got other friends than can — and do — spend time with.

I don't. So if I get rid of them . . . who's left? I don't have anyone, and with my social anxiety it's impossible for me to go out and make new friends. I'm too awkward in the real world, and living as isolated as I do doesn't give me many opportunities anyways.

It's just depressing.

I feel like I have nothing and no one. I miss having friends I could laugh and smile with. I miss actually being EXCITED to receive new messages. I miss when I knew I had people that loved me and cared for me. And I crave that connection so much, but I don't know where to start making new friends online or offline.

I isolated and met this girl I made this girl my everything cause all my friends were gone it was just me and her when we’d argue I’d go as far as make my mom figue out a way to get her ass back from the streets I didn’t want to lose what I thought was all I had we would fight 24/7 for years but I didn’t want to lose what I thought was my last friend at this point my dad was almost dead and I remember him telling me he loved me and he was sorry for the way he treated us my mom was beaten and forced to obey more than we were  But I was still sad my dad was dying he was my dad dude? Me and the girl got in a fight cause I was literally going insane cause she would be out at parties with exes and stuff I started smoking meth and ended up hitting and pulling out a knife on her cause she had stabbed me 30 stitches  the day before with the razor she was using to cut herself as a way to get me to be sorry I went to prison and my dad died being in isolation full of killers was not easy I was devasted by life I learned that in order to get by I couldn’t trust anyone friendships and trust was destroyed pretty sad how I never got a single letter from anyone NOONE. it was crazy cause everyone had called my mom their mom and basically loved with me ever since then life wasn’t the same.

I understand kids  can be alot to handle. 
I never asked any of them to baby sit or anything, so I don't know what happened .

I've been texting my best friend of 16 years,and he never replies back to me.
He finnaly met my son 3 months ago,but then after that he has been ignoring every text,call.
He just dropped me . And I have no idea why.

My other friend we met at work 8 years ago,and always had lots of fun, we got each other on a whole nother level.
She is almost 40 years older than me,but even with the huge age gap,we got along great with each other. 

When I was going through post partum depression really bad,I still would pack up my baby and go over to her house,even though it was hard.
I told her that it be great if she came over to my house sometimes and she never even tried.
I sent her my son's birthday invitation, and she just ignored it. Ever since I sent her the invitation, she hasn't texted or called.  That was 4 months ago.

I recently met a very nice lady at a job I worked at for a while,we worked great together. 
I would buy her coffee every morning, and always helped her with the patients she had at work.
One day,she just started treating me differently.  Would tell the nurse I was doing something wrong, or when I needed help with a transfer, she would never come and help me..even though I always helped her with transfers or showers.
I decided to quit that job and went to work somewhere else .
All of a sudden she started texting me again,asking for advice on what to do about how her boss( my previous  boss)is talking shit about her and what she should do about it.
I got excited  that she wanted to talk again,and I gave her some advice and recommendations on what to do. I told her to not quit yet si ce she is also going to school to become a nurse and to focus on that. She thanked me. 
I was very hopeful.

A month later I text her seeing how she is doing and wished her and family happy Thanksgiving.
No response. 


I find it funny how everyone just doesn't want to talk to me. I did some inventory of my self, and decided to wrote down things I can work on.
I thought maybe it's because I come on to strong.   But then maybe I don't try enough and it seems like I don't want to be bothered. 
I am just very confused. I spent my whole life trying to people please and to treat others how I want to be treated, and I'm always left hanging. 

I love my husband and my son,but I want friends that I can go do things with or just to share time with.

I guess I should use this time to work on myself then since I have nothing else to do.

2888,boxeduniverses,1639630986,1,"I've been thinking a lot and that's the problem.

In my endless overthinking I randomly remembered a bit of a creative writing class I took in college. We talked about passive protagonists and active protagonists. Passive protagonists wait for the story to happen to them. They react to the extraordinary circumstances that the author pens and forces upon them. They do not move forward so much as they are shoved forcefully forward, dragged kicking and screaming into the story. For many, many passive protagonists, there is usually a transformation which occurs that turns them into an active protagonist.

It is the active protagonist that drives a story forward. They make decisions and sometimes they are bad, but they keep everything moving. While it is the author that is writing the events, it feels as if the protagonist is calling the shots. Even if they are bumbling, crawling, and tumbling ungracefully through life they are still going somewhere. They are still making great friends, experiencing great highs as well as lows. It feels like they are living.

2897,TheBronzeLine,1639628209,1,"I don't have any IRL friends. I lost them all over time and just going about their careers. I'm essentially a shut-in. When I'm not doing (stuff) to make money I like playing video games. Some of them have a strong potential for social interaction. I recently got back into PSO2 (phantasy star online 2) and I remembered how lonely I was before my haitus. It actually started with Phantasy Star Universe on xbox 360. It was my first truly social mmo and I got addicted way too fast. When I realized my addiction I immediately shut off my xbox and went cold turkey, didn't touch it for a month. But it stuck with me for all these years. Then there was the time I spent playing Halo 3 custom games with lots of random people and folks on my friends list. I loved it, possibly slightly more because of all the interaction. I laughed so hard I cried, I laughed so hard through half the night, I had so much fun playing the dumbest and genuinely creative made-up game types.

&amp;#x200B;

I never got that IRL. I was bullied too much to ever work up the courage and my parents were zero help. So I became that quiet kid and that quiet kid grew up into quiet man who went to college. I count 3 occasions when one of my female classmates remarked to me (it felt random to me) that I'm so quiet. Even had a handful of people in my life look at me, remark that I don't smile. Then there were those couple of times when-before adulthood-they saw me and urged me to smile. I did, only because it was embarrassing and I had zero way of combating that. I still don't. I don't understand it at all. Both times I just wanted to shout **SHUT THE FUCK UP! STOP LOOKING AT ME!** or something that without giving context and it doesn't make sense in that situation, but it's what I felt like saying.

&amp;#x200B;

Had a few years with a real girlfriend. Loved cuddling. Absolutely loved it. But we both started college, saw less and less of each other. She fell out of love, broke up over skype. It just snowballed from there. I started doing (it) more and never questioned it. Nothing illegal, no drugs...just not comfortable at all saying what it is. Halo 3 and Reach, Phantasy Star Universe, Chromehounds, got super into them mainly because of the social aspect and we would get together whenever we had free time.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I noticed people in games being less social over the years. Communication became minimal. And most recently, my time playing PSO2 with all kinds of player avatars occupying to virtual lobbies in their cliques and online relationships and friends and...it just keeps making me sad. But it's not what made me realize how lonely I am and why (it) masked it and became the reason why I kept doing (it). Now that (it) was revealed I'm facing my loneliness in its raw form. I've gone to clan after clan in PSO2, clan after clan in Elite Dangerous, hoping there would be lots of activity for me to just jump in and warm up to me and me to them...no. It's the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

IRL I'm quiet. I don't want to tell you anything. I'm afraid and I just can't shake it. I've come to strongly dislike small talk. But online? I admit I'm the clingy friend and I don't want to scare you away *but it drives me up a wall and I'm that stressed out cat hanging on the ceiling.* I don't know how often one checks their clan's server on discord, but I used to check it obsessively. Now though, all this compounding together...I don't think I'm depressed. Maybe it's just that I've let my past experiences and time alone get to me.

&amp;#x200B;

But most recently, I found myself wanting, maybe even going into the territory of craving, someone to cuddle. I discovered there are ""professional cuddlers"" that you pay by the hour or per day and their prices for time spent seem...outrageous. But if I had the spare cash (and if I lived alone-no don't fucking say it) I would be a frequent customer of those professional cuddlers.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I think about my age I'm realizing it's probably too late for me. Wasted 10 years, unfulfilled, empty, passionless, unsuccessful, lonely, making money online just to barely hold up my end.

&amp;#x200B;

I want hugs. I need hugs. I want that nice small ring of online friends who are always looking to play together when time allows. I want to love, sit her on my lap and kiss her head, pat her head and do sickeningly sweet baby talk that I wish I did before. If I told you my age you would say something like, ""Oh! You still got time!"", but I know that's untrue. You don't know the rest of the details I'm to embarrassed and shy to share online. It's too late for me. I need to love, to cuddle, to play and laugh with friends even if it's only for an hour that would be enough to hold me over till our next game date. I'm even considering starting a online romantic relationship even though I've done that in the past and it never lasts and I can see through it, feels so fake and hollow now but I'm worried about growing so desperate that I might consider actions or changes in life that I wouldn't normally do or accept.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's too late. I've wasted 10 years that would have been spent laying the foundation for a better life. I could have easily done it. Failed. No one told me when to run and I've missed the start again and again, and again, and again.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't give me hope. All I can do is just focus on my work/projects and *try to not think about how lonely I am or how much I want those social and intimate connections.* I want to break free, but I'm scared. My gilded cage can be comfortable, at least I'll know it's a gilded cage. But...

&amp;#x200B;

But the thoughts of *what if* scare me, trying to give me hope to the point where I almost cry if I kept feeding myself hope. IRL you would never know. My face is stone. But when I see that small group of friends or that little clique that shares one of my interests, I just have flashbacks of all 12 years of school being rejected, bullied, alone, clinging so hard to my small circle of friends who really have saved my life just by helping me maintain a link to people. Now I have no body and my *housemates* don't count. Don't ask why, I know they don't. I just live in my small room at the computer all day working on things trying to make enough money to finally get out on my own. I'm not that bitter guy who is jealous of you for having friends or a romantic relationship, I just wish I had it too.

But throughout these past few weeks I finally made one friend with a guy who was super cute and shy and seemed really nice. It was easy talking to him and I didn't feel scared to. I haven't made any friends at all, people either leave me or they get tired of me and abandon me. 

But I made a friend. I asked for his Instagram earlier because I wanted to text him too. This wasn't a me falling in love thing or anything like that. I was just happy to finally have one friend. After school ended I felt so good, I'm usually always depressed and paranoid. My anxiety is horrible. But in that moment I felt a little bit of happiness. 

I texted him later and I was just trying to be goofy and funny. I asked him how his day was, his responses were short and just cold. I figured he was either a dry texter or he was being shy. I wanted him to feel comfortable because I knew what that's like, so I teased him saying ""your really shy"" and ""I'm hyper sometimes so I text alot, your probably just really calm"" I was going to say he didn't need to feel shy with me if he was but I didn't want to come off too strong unless he actually told me he was shy. 


After that I waited 20 minutes, he saw my text and then blocked me and removed me. I don't know what I did wrong, I was just texting him, I just wanted to be friends. Maybe I'm just too fucked up or weird or something. Somethings wrong with me. Maybe it's Because I'm ugly or I'm gay or maybe I hurt him on accident. 

Now I have to see him in class everyday, until I go onto my next class after this semester is over. it's going to be so awkward and embarrassing.

2934,VeryMentallyStable,1639618866,1,"I don’t know why it’s something I think about so much. Guess despite how I feel about relationships, I’m still lonely. Feels like a sick joke that my brain simultaneously can’t stand the thought of being with someone but constantly laments how alone I am. Not that I’d even want to have people around, I prefer being alone. It’s a choice. I don’t like people knowing me, don’t like them knowing anything about me. Don’t really care to know anything about anyone else either. Never been the type to have any friends or anything. I’ll try, when I start a new job or something but I can only put up with it for so long before I have to move away, delete all my social media and disappear again. 

Anyway, I guess it’s come up again not too long ago because I was talking to this girl, she messaged me here on Reddit. We were talking for a while, guess she related to things I’d posted or something. After a couple months I realised she was dancing around the fact that she had feelings for me. Maybe part of me even had some for her, I don’t even know. But once I realised that I didn’t really know what to do. Talking to her, she was one of very few people I didn’t immediately hate. I still had days where I just wanted her to leave me alone and I didn’t want to talk to anyone, but it was at least bearable enough of the time that I kept talking to her for months, I guess.

She never got to tell me she had feelings for me, if she ever even would have. I stopped talking to her before she could. That’s what I landed on after days of conflicted feelings about what to do. Part of me wondered if I did have some feelings, if maybe I should bring it up with her and try to work on it or something. But then I thought that if I have so many messages telling me I wasn’t attracted to her, then at least part of me mustn’t be and therefore I’d just be settling for her to kill my loneliness, which is unfair for everyone involved. 

I’ve never been in an actual relationship and the thing is, I think I only like the idea of them. Only like the handful of “scenes” that pop into my head when I think about them. But to get to those moments, you have to go through a lot of stuff in between, in fact the in between parts are most of it, and I think that’s where I know they’re not for me. Thinking about real relationships, what they actually are day-to-day, it makes me physically sick. I live with my mum and her husband right now, and watching them together just disgusts me. The way they talk to each other, the things they talk about, the things they get excited about, it’s all so pathetic. It’s fucking sad. My throat tightens up when I hear them laughing in the next room. And it’s not just them, being around anyone in a relationship makes me feel like that. It’s why I can’t go to weddings. And that’s the stuff I’d have to be able to endure to get to the “scenes” I fantasise about all the time, so that’s how I know I’m not meant for a relationship.

Another thing it made me think about, something that comes up every time I have a close call with a relationship like this, is that I just can’t be attracted to someone who’s into me. I don’t know why, don’t know what it is exactly, but as soon as I figure out someone has a crush on me, it’s an instant turn-off. I don’t know how to describe it exactly, it’s like the dynamic shifts and they feel beneath me, like they’re smaller. I guess I’d need to feel like someone was my equal to be interested and then having feelings for me feels like it puts them beneath me. Maybe that sounds bad, just don’t know how else to word it. But I guess, weirdly enough, I can only be attracted to women who don’t like me back, or at least would never admit it. I’ve always had a thing for cold, emotionally unavailable girls and maybe that’s why. 

A lot of the time it feels like a girl being nice and caring towards me is also a turn off. And while that’s mostly true, I don’t think I could ever be with someone long-term who was kind and gentle, I also don’t think it’s entirely true. Going back to those “scenes” that play in my head, some of them involve being emotionally vulnerable with each other, but it’s reluctant, I guess, or some of them involve being cared for but it’s more unspoken. So I think it’s more that I can’t handle someone who’s always expressing their feeling to me and when they do, I need to feel like I’ve earned it, like if they do love me on some level, that I earned that love.

Anyway, there’s probably some psychological reasons behind it all, guess it doesn’t really matter though. Brought it up in therapy a few times, but as with all things in therapy, it never seemed to go anywhere and I honestly don’t even know where I would like it to go. Think at this point I’d just like someone to flip off the switch that makes part of me feel like I want a relationship at all, so I could just live on knowing they’re not for me and never having to think about any of it ever again.",lonely,Thinking about relationships makes me physically sick,2021-12-16 12:41:06

2950,MarchAgainstOrange,1639613981,1,"So, I have been lonely (in a romantic sense) for quite a while, and trying to ignore my inner turmoil over it almost as long (mental health is a bitch.) I am not FA, I did have a few short-lived relationships in the past, but it still feels like IDK, this love language that everyone else aside from me seems to understand and speak intrinsically, it feels like my parents just didn’t buy the necessary DLC for me to get it if that makes sense? As if my brain is missing a vital software installation.

There is this girl, we are sort of colleagues, I am getting the most mixed signals from, in the history of ever. Basically, whenever we are working around each other, she seeks me out to talk to me or even leads me away to talk to me. We have so much in common, sense of humor, hobbies, worldview, political affiliation, love for music (slightly different genre but whatever), games, shows, movies etc. etc.

When we interact it’s very friendly with lots of playful teasing and lots of humor, her body language is very open towards me, eye contact, she smiles a lot, man she has such a pretty smile… Sometimes I catch her glancing and she either looks away immediately in shame or I manage to ease her nerves by catching her eyes and smiling at her quickly enough.

That’s our real-life interactions. Texting I literally have to bend over backwards to get more than a 2 word reply out of her. Like quite literally. The other day she had a bit of a breakdown, as she is struggling unbelievably with self-worth and she was asking why she is even alive. Of course, with me having feelings for her that stung me really really badly as well and I composed a bit of an essay of why she is an amazing person to try and get her to feel better about herself. (I blame her social media addiction and her upbringing for it, she is so pretty and great yet just can’t see it.) And all I got in return was a 5 word sentence as answer.

I thought of a little Christmas present for her, nothing too fancy just a really small and personal thing that tells her that I care, and just as I was about to gain enough courage to make a move today happened. Today we were talking about movies and favorite travel destinations. In which she said she watches these movies mostly for people like Henry Cavill or Adam Driver’s Ben Swolo, and that she wants to go to Japan or South Korea (she is an Anime fan) to find herself one of those “gorgeous” men there. Even joked she would fly over there already wearing a wedding dress.

I mean OK, I know women are mostly about sub-communication so why would she tell me that? Because I look nothing like any of that, I am fat, not obese but for sure dad bod++ without being a dad. The answer seems obvious. I know looks aren’t super important, especially for women, and I am working on myself quite successfully, I have drive and ambition to better myself not just my body but professionally speaking as well, even before I developed fee fees for her.

I mean that’s what I meant among the texting thing with mixed signals. What’s the intended sub-communication for this? If she wanted me to make a move why tell me she loves chiseled actors and far east Asian men? I know why. I mean there is some friction, she is a bit younger than me, nothing super bad like 20 years or more between us, she’s 24 and I’m 33. Believe me I was agonizing over that as well, felt like a fucking sexual predator just for feeling that way, until I got the advice that it’s totally fine if it’s her soul that I am interested in 1st and not her body. Not to say I am not interested in sex, she is very pretty and I’m not blind to that but that aspect is merely a part of the package, as I said it’s her personality that made me fall for her.

So, IDK. Mixed signals are an understatement I feel like. And yeah, I am old and a bit fat and she’s young and pretty. I know I have a lot of great qualities for outside and inside of the bedroom, but I guess I can look forward to another lonely Christmas where I cook an excellent meal, just for me, and something for my cat, and then Netflix until I doze-off in tears. Seeing my parents and other friends and family on 25th and 26th as they all have someone special unlike me, and then on New Year’s just watch Netflix again and go to sleep at 10pm.

I hate myself so much, my SSRI induced fatness. Which is why I crave the sweet embrace of death every moment of every day of my life. Fuck this existence man, I didn’t ask to be put into it. Don't be alarmed, I'm too much of a coward to do something drastic, but how the hell am I supposed to continue like this when my loneliness has reached a point where it even causes me psychosomatic pain? Dating apps? I am a bit fat, it's all about looks on that cancer, everything else is secondary. WTF man.",lonely,How am I supposed to continue like this?,2021-12-16 11:19:41

I miss my dads. They were both there for me. I used to phone them, see them once every 2 weeks or as often as I could. I really miss their endless support and love. I feel so alone without them.

My brother and I would beg our one dad to take us to the mall or go on a drive. He would always do it because he loved us. He would take us the long way home so he could see us just for a little bit longer before he went home. I would phone him if I felt scared on late night walks and wanted to talk to someone. Dad would always give me advice, for anything- like getting jobs, or cooking. He would tell my brother and I stories from his alcoholism and homeless days. Or his childhood with our 6 uncles and grandparents living in a log house in the woods, because our grandparents didn't trust the government, and didn't want them taken to residential school. Dad loved his truck, always wanted to update and take care of his vehicles. He always told me about my 2 other younger siblings, and how they were doing. He always wanted the best for us. I am a very lucky person to have been able to call him my dad. A lot of people thought he was mean and uncaring but us kids know otherwise. On his last day, I phoned him and promised I would join him and my bio dad, and that I did not resent him for having to leave, but I would miss him a lot more than he would ever know. 

My bio dad has been gone for 2 years now. He would take me our for coffee and we would walk downtown. He knew all the people down there, he just liked having me around. He would always let me take the front seat in cars. He used to ask me to foster kittens for him, when the mom cat abandoned one. Dad never really knew what to get me for christmas or my birthday, he would always just get me an assortment of random things, sometimes art and sometimes makeup. I miss his weird yet loving gifts. I still have most of them, because I don't have the heart to donate them, eventhough some things I know I won't ever use. I miss his odd yet endearing ways. He would find rocks by the train track that ran by his house and paint them into animals. He used to look at the mountains through binoculars all day and look for wild life. He was a difficult person to love sometimes, because he could be smothering sometimes, other times he would be distant and hard to get ahold of especially when he was drinking and partying about. I will always hold on to the knowledge that he loved me very very much though. I did not get to properly say goodbye to him.

Rest easy to my dads. I know you had your differences, but I am glad that you two had resolved your issues later on in life. 


They both used to phone me on my birthday. This year I don't have that to look forward to. I miss them so damn much. My birthday is going to hurt this year. I have friends that want to do things with me, and I may take them up on it, but I think I may be very sad this year.

2963,nin_wehh,1639609794,1,"My entire life I have been struggling with loneliness. I was bullied during my younger years, raised in a very dysfunctional family, and I've never really had any real friends. My desperation for someone's company led to a really bad marriage that turned abusive both verbally and physically. I've been free for almost 3 months and this is what I've learned about myself:

I don't love myself and I've never loved myself.

If I loved myself, I would not seek validation, love, time or affection from someone else. I would be comfortable being lonely or not feel lonely in a room with people.

Reality is this, I've suffered from this problem for 30 years. It's not going to take one day to fix this issue. I just want to remind myself and yourself that it is important to be comfortable with yourself and most importantly, love yourself. Remember that you are kind, strong, independent, and beautiful. Your positivity will attract people towards you. Your negative mindset will drown you in darkness and people will not see your true self.

Since I joined here, many of you have sent me DMs and you have made me much stronger in my recovery for self love and healing from the abuse.

As I come up on two years sobriety and divorce (I stopped drinking the second I moved out, I’ve changed immensely and grown as a person, but I am so so alone. I’m so alone that two days ago one of the office women said I looked like I needed a hug, and against better judgement I accepted, but instantly started crying as soon as she hugged me, because I have no interactions with people, and I hurt and am just so frustrated with where my life has ended up.

My stepdad told me last time I saw my parents “you picked the wrong time to fix your life, you’ll be forty soon…I hope you enjoy living alone because that’s the reality of it. I haven’t been able to shake that. A cousin told me “you had it good in your marriage, I don’t know why you’d leave it, because you’ll never find that again” but she didn’t know the whole story.

There’s nothing left, just my dog and my cat. The most human interaction I get now is at work. Not many people want to pet your dog when she’s a black shepherd, hell not many people are even willing to walk past us on the streets, but the assumption remains that having a dog is a great way to meet new people. 

Why did I do any of this? I mean I was miserable where I was due to what was happening, but fuck if I’m not more miserable now. 

How in the hell am I supposed to meet anyone being sober? People say it doesn’t matter but in this day in age, it seems like admitting you have a drinking problem and doing something about it gets you (some) respect, mainly from others who have struggled with it, or moms and dads, but I feel like it’s more of a nail in your coffin than anything else. I know my “friends” dropped me over that, I wasn’t a drinking buddy anymore, and maybe that’s all we really had all along.

I won’t break my sobriety, because I refuse to start drinking again, but in some ways I think me getting sober is ultimately going to be my own undoing, because I am not equipped mentally to spend the next 20-40 years alone.

I was born in India but moved around to uk. and ever since then ive pretty much stayed. as a kid you learn to change the accent of your voice, hide your parathas that your mum made for you, mess up your hair that your mum put oil in, avoid having friends over at your house and if you do, make sure its been sprayed to avoid that ""curry smell"". a few years down the line, I then hear casual racism and eventually people throwing stones at my windows. I eventually am told by reinforcement that its better to stick with my own kind. where I am REALLY from.

I eventually start staying with just brown ""friends"" at uni, doing a very ""brown degree"". it was an easy choice, but I was too anxious and nervous to interact with others. my uni life has been something which if I could redo I would put myself out there and meet new people and press the restart button. but at the start I picked the wrong people. and thats really had a detrimental effect on my mental health. ive dropped confidence from those Indian boys who push you down because they want to feel superior. the asian girls who I liked kept leading me on and led to nothing but a broken heart.

I feel that after all this I dont trust anyone. im having difficulty forming real friendships. I went to graduation a few days ago and it hurt because I felt like I didnt relate to anyone. im too scared of my old ""friends"". it brings back bad memories. and sometimes I even start speaking to myself out loud because it can be consuming at times that I feel like I dont have any friends. or anyone that I can relate to or speak to. or be close with. apart from my family.

yes people are going to say put yourself out there, get a new hobby and all that. which im doing. but im just making this post to say that I dont feel like I related to anyone. I feel like an odd piece of puzzle where I dont relate to white people, or brown people.

despite me wanting to get closer with people ive made choices which only cut me off further. ive deleted my social media. ive blocked all those people who have wasted my time.

Hello to anyone who decides to read this. let me introduce myself. 
I am a lost broken soul who has been on this earth for 26 years. I just recently got out of a toxic relationship, so I am just looking mainly for friends. Not the kind of friends you talk to for like 5 minutes having the same conversation over and over

I am talking about a friend to really connect and bond with. Someone to chat with anytime and have nonsense late night discussions. Possibly someone who likes gaming and will become a gaming buddy. I honestly don't think I really know what it is like to have a true friend. Maybe someone can change that.. who knows?

a little about me. I enjoy gaming, bowling, listening to music, and anything horror or conspiracy related. I have dad jokes and a cringy tiktok... I have social anxiety (INFP) if that matters. I also deal with other mental health issues. I have my own looks on life and other stuff that some people don't seem to agree with.. So if you have any questions or want to chat feel free to message me, or add to add me on Discord or Snapchat (both are on my profile)

Hope if you decided to read this you decide that maybe I am for you, and we can chat and maybe structure a true friendship.

My loneliness stems mostly from family. I’ve dealt with my own personal issues that scarred me growing up. At this point, I have no relations with my dads side of the family and barely my moms. There’s a few cousins I have that are pretty chill but seeing them doesn’t happen too often. 

What affects me most is my living situation. My mom, brother, and I stay together currently. My brother has caused us plenty of trauma but my moms too scared to kick him out. My mom always complains about my brother to me but fails to do anything about it, and other relatives are done with him at this point. Yet, when she’s around him they’re all buddy buddy like there’s no problem. I couldn’t care less besides the point he uses us (hardly works, pays no bills).

I’m considering getting my own place sometime next year but will be here until then. My job is providing me so many opportunities and I actually get treated like a family there. At home, I live amongst double standards and get picked on sometimes. There’s no support here and it does get draining. I try to stay in good spirits but my 2 family members are really immature.

My mom wants me to go on vacation with her for her birthday in 2 weeks but I don’t want to go. Positive me was all for it, but I’m just tired of pretending everything’s okay.",lonely,How to cope in lonely home,2021-12-16 07:19:24

2999,simpleguy66666,1639596000,1,"I am 24 y/o male living in India. The entire year has just been one blows after another and I am just tired now. Want everything to finish, not sure how. 
My heart aches almost all the time out of loneliness and I don't feel I will ever feel love or let alone have any female interaction. Dating apps are just too demotivating for an average guy like me, and outside that I have no way of reaching out to new people. 

Here's what happened this year which led me to this miserable state. 
I had never had any girlfriend (or even any kind of romantic female interaction) before this year. In March, my school friend asked me out for a date over a friendly chat and I was over the moon. We soon got into a relationship and it was like dream. I used to smile all the time, be so happy than I had ever been, more happy than when I got my first job, my first salary. 
Then just like that, one day she decided to end it, only after 2 months saying she is not in a state of commitment and left off. She would say that she still wants to be my best friend, but hasn't replied to my texts. 

Then, thanks to my friends , I was able to get out of this rut. But then all of a sudden, everyone went away for MBAs, got busy at job and so on. I  became all alone. 

I live with my parents and they always fight, which makes situation worse. All of a sudden, I was all alone.

I have an office friend (a sweet and caring girl), who was like my safe space. She was the one who got me into therapy last year this time around, and I had opened upto her so much, which I couldn't to my guy friends. We used to talk regularly till September, and I sort of liked her as well. But she had a boyfriend, so I didn't do anything. And once she broke up, I don't know why but I built a fantasy world about me dating her. But sadly she has started dating other people using the same dating apps, and has also stopped talking to me. We barely speak now. And this causes me so much pain. More than losing her as a potential romantic interest, I fear losing her as a friend. I am always falling for girls, who don't even look at me, and that just kills me. 

I am scared, really scared that I will end up all alone. And I want to cry and hug someone. Someone who would cuddle me. While writing this only, I am crying and just so much anxiety that I just want it to end. I am grateful for everything that I have, but when I see everyone around me having a flourishing romantic life and me sitting alone in a dark room writing my feelings in a journal or a reddit post, it breaks my heart. 

To whoever, who reads this entirely, thank you for listening to me. You are an angel and I really wish no one has to suffer what I am going through.

Thank you",lonely,Just want my anxiety and this year to end.,2021-12-16 06:20:00

I miss people, but I respect the rules of the health authority, and I respect people's choice to continue to be cautious. But, I *do* get lonely. Seems like it would be impossible not to be. 

I have had days where I take a break from work to curl up in bed with a soft blanket and just cry my face off at how alone I feel. I set a timer, let myself get out all the feels and self pity and sorrow and anger and unhelpful shit so that I can go back to being a kick-ass person at work.

So, I am happy to work from home in these times because it means I can take that break and let it all out. And I am happy to live alone so that I don't freak out my roommates or family when I need to just let it all out.

I cry until I laugh about the ridiculous cycle of it all. I laugh at myself and my situation and my privilege until I cry at how disheartening it is, especially knowing that I have it so much much easier than many people do right now. I'm warm, I'm safe, I know where my next meals are coming from, and that they will be *good* meals. That's a *lot* to be thankful for in this fucked up world. And yet. ... And yet.

Maybe I'm finally losing it. Maybe I finally understand what appeals to me about Shakespeare's comedies, how he builds up the absurdity of the situations, the superficial conflicts that get resolved without anyone coming to much harm, the guarantee that every play ends with a happily ever after and usually a wedding just for good measure. A Midsummer's Night Dream seems like fabulous escapsim. ""Lord, what fools these mortals be"" indeed.

I sob so hard my body shakes, but then the shakes turn into laughter, and then the laughter back into sobs. It shouldn't be so damn funny. It shouldn't be so damn sad.

Then the timer goes off and I tell myself to get my fucking shit together and act like a fucking adult. Nobody ever built the life they want while laying in bed crying and succumbing to nihilistic hedonism all day.

Deep breath, and time to go back to kicking ass at all the other parts of my life. I am probably absolutely batshit and unredeemable at this point, and I might be walking this road alone, but goddammit I'm gonna be an army of one or die fucking trying.

The journey is often lonely isn’t it? When you’re aren’t successful, nobody is supporting you, everyone is telling you to quit, job is better than passion

Then there’ll also be “friends” who’ll use you for your money, ask you out just to make you pay some of it while they get girls in.

And there’ll be “friends” who promised to help you in your business, only to either give you a sloppy job or abandon you entirely

3028,TerriblePabz,1639584997,1,"I started working for my dad at a small commercial flooring business he is about to buy. Before this I was working at a small classic restoration shop doing paint and body work. I wasn't making very much and my boss at the time treated me like dirt.

I vented to my dad about some of my frustrations one weekend and he subsequently offered me a job the following weekend. It took a couple weeks to get things together, interview, and then finally start the new job. Originally I was told I would mostly be driving to jobsites to inspect quality, deliver materials, or do a moisture test.

It's been 6 months now and my dad is finally starting to sign paperwork to take over the company, but I keep getting told to take on more responsibility (specifically other employees that leave entire job) and to be grateful... I make about 30% less than anyone else in the building, I live over twice as far away as everyone else (an hour without traffic on a good day), and because it's my dad he holds me to an impossible standard of expectations.

For instance, at my house the power has been kinda spotty and I'm a heavy sleeper. So I have a really loud alarm that also shakes my bed to make sure I wake up. Sadly it has to be plugged into a wall and nothing else wakes me up so when the power goes out at night (fairly common) I am immediately doomed to be late. Or like waking up to one of my dogs having projectile diarrhea in the middle of the night and all morning. I obviously have to clean the mess before I leave for effectively 10 hours and I'm worried about my dog. So I have been a few minutes late a small handful of times.

I absolutely detest being late to anything in my personal or professional life so I am really hard on myself when it happens... but my dad practically makes a sport out of dragging what little confidence I have through the mud when I ""embarrassed him"" even though the owner of the company likes me alot and just makes lite hearted jokes when I am a little late.

My dad takes it so far that he will effectively not talk to me for a day or two and intentionally send me to jobs that are ridiculously far away just to get rid of me for the day. And this isn't even counting how he lied to me about benefits, pay, bonuses, and growth when I first started... I agreed to do one year here... I know I could leave sooner but my dad and I have always had a strained or nonexistent relationship. Now I feel like the only option I have to no resent him further down the road or cause him to resent me (equates to me not being able to see my little brother anymore) because I left before my 1 year...

All I do in my down time is look for other way to make money or other jobs... I need a lateral move or a step up for my own sanity...

I know this is super rambley and probably doesn't make much sense... I think I just needed to vent, but if anyone has any suggestions, questions or ideas I am all ears.",lonely,I (24m) started working for my dad and have never felt more alone.,2021-12-16 03:16:37

well to preface  I have social anxiety, so much so that I have to overthink what I post online, and me being a non English speaker and a fairly liberal Muslim just adds to it,

 all of my friend and family doesn't understand internet culture (beside a couple of exception) so that makes conversation really hard, I also have a dream of becoming a writer and again there is no friend that I could vent to because they have different goal than me, 

And honestly I have made a couple of close friend over the year and they just kinda went away, whisked by the wind so to speak, I have this one friend,

 let's call him J, he's a good kid and between the two of us he is the more silent one and while we are in school, meeting face to face this is all fine and dandy but when lockdowns hit and the fact that we are not in the same highschool after graduation, it honestly wrecked our friendship, we rarely talk, I even tried to start a conversation but it only holds up for five minutes at best,

But oh well, we gotta move on right? So I just let him be, living his new life 

while I tried to make new friend in my new school, and mostly my classmate are awesome, we have a couple of philosophy debates and all, and most of them understand internet culture so it's the friend group i've been wanting for right? Well yes but every blue moon because besides when there is work or announcement from school we rarely talk in the WhatsApp group and even if we did it's just gonna be 1 minutes talk and done.

And the worst thing is I kept it all to myself untill this post and it's just bubbling in my head, the steams trying to escape, almost exploding my head

I honestly almost gave up at this point, I feel like I was destined to be alone forever and that thought haunts me, I couldn't even cry it out because I just can't, it's not even sadness anymore but a lingering heartache.

 I hope this work because I know the first step to fix our problem is to admit it and here is my post to admit it.

So what do I want? I honestly want nothing, not even a stranger to talk to, i'm here to finally tells my loneliness to the world and hope that the ache will be lighter 

But anyways thank you for reading my vent that some of you might find weird, I hope you have a wonderful life and I hope you will find love and peace in your life because even thinking that some people is going through similar thing as me is both calming and upsetting so I really hope you knows that you are loved and that this dark time will past.

I work from home, ironically talking on the phone all day but other than calls from I really don’t interact worth coworkers much except to answer their questions on chat.

My son is autistic and won’t let me talk.  If I try to have conversation with my wife then my son is physically aggressive towards my wife.  Pinching, hitting, biting, etc….   

My wife goes to bed shoot 8, my son falls sleep with her or a bit later.   In the mornings she leaves the same time I do to take my son to the bus.

At thanksgiving I managed to piss off anyone I had a conversation with.   No one calls me anymore, what few friends I had we have finally drifted apart.  Mostly when we had them over our son would start hitting and freak then out plus they’re kids don’t like my son, so just sorta stopped coming around.  It’s been about a year since we’ve had friends over.

So, I like to talk and ramble about topics but for about a year it’s just all locked up in my head.   I’m generally an introvert so I’m surprised by my feelings, but I need human interaction that’s more than just conversation with my son which daily repeats and goes like this: He touches my head and says what’s this?

People change. Nothing is what they say. Always changing the meanings. We aren't the same. So why should anything matter. I try my best to be who I think people would like, I haven't got there yet but I don't see a difference. 

I want to feel perfect. I'm not happy. I know no one is perfect, but my definition of perfect is different to others. I want to feel perfect to me, then I might feel happier. I might feel good enough to pursue my greater dreams. 

I hate not knowing how to feel or what to know. I hate feeling like I have to jump through hoops for people that don't exist yet. I wish people liked me for me, and didn't judge so quick. 

Words people say stay with me. Why say what you don't mean. I can't get them out of my head. I'd rather not try if people feel this way about me. When I'm just me and can only fix so much, things that are very difficult to change overnight.

3078,ihatemyself810,1639554382,1,"We were best friends since 4 years in uni and she was the the best person I ever knew. We fell in love and we dated for 2 weeks. It was the best time of my life. It was special and nothing like my past experience but then it all went downhill. I failed to protect her from a social situation. We got in trouble and it was my job to get us out of it but I froze and couldn't say a word because it reminded me of something traumatic that happened 3 years ago. She got over us in 5 minutes which made me doubt if she ever really cared. After ignoring me for a week she talked to me and I apologized and accepted everything I did wrong. I am ashamed of myself. Then 2-3 weeks later we met at uni for semester end exams. We went out with our friends after every exam to get some food and that's when we noticed that she started smoking. She always found excuses to leave and smoke. She smoked like 4-5 times a day and I couldn't stop blaming myself for what happened to her. I tried talking to her many times but she shut me out whenever I got even remotely close to talking about her addiction. 

My life has been miserable from the day we broke apart. Every day has been a struggle and I hate myself to the core. One day when she came back to us after smoking, I couldn't control myself and I shouted something like ""do whatever you want. I won't stop you now"". With this I got up to leave and I noticed a plastic folder (stick file - for keeping A4 size sheets) in my bag. I threw it out and it hit her. I didn't realise this and she left. It's been two weeks and we haven't talked since then. I tried talking to her and apologized a million times about what I said. Few days later a friend told me that I hit her with that plastic folder. I didn't realise it before. Since then I distanced myself from my friends and her. I left all group in common with her and nobody cared. I can never share my feelings and in the end I burst out in moments like this. My friends think that I don't like them, I don't want to talk to them and they went out without me. They posted pictures on social media. She looked happy and I don't blame them for going out without me. I love my friends but I find it impossible to open up and connect.  I don't think I'm important enough for someone to listen to my problems.

 I cannot live knowing that I hurt her. I did not mean to but I feel like I physically abused her. I loved and cared for her but I ended up hurting her. I will never forgive myself and I don't expect her to forgive me. I have done everything to talk to her, apologize and make it up to her but she didn't reply. My life has turned to shit and I hate myself. Somedays I wish i didn't wake up. I wish I was a different person and this was all a dream. I have never ever been in such a bad place before.
Now I don't know if I should try again. I feel like the only way I can respect her now is by staying out of her life forever. All I want is to apologize to her.",lonely,I hurt my best friend and lover,2021-12-15 18:46:22

3081,That_Viking_Chef,1639552878,1,"I know I’m not the only one. Even outside of this group. There is probably at least one person feeling the same way I do living within a couple miles of me.

But damn, does this feeling suck. I don’t know that I’ve been truly happy for a while. I don’t really feel like I have any real close friends anymore, not like I used to. Most of my friends are co-workers, in the the sense that we get along well and enjoy working together. But I don’t feel like I’m a part of any of their circles or cliques, and we never really see each other outside of work. I have a couple friends that I’ve known since high school, but they all seem too busy to keep in touch anymore. 

I know some of that is my fault. I’ve been flaky in the past, but I’ve tried so hard to break that habit and keep in touch. I have one friend especially, he’s always been like a brother to me. We were always close, and even if we didn’t talk all the time we never had problems. Granted, he’s married and has a kid and works two jobs plus kinda has side gigs he does for fun. I understand we won’t be able to hang out like we used to. But I’ve tried to set up times to get together, and work around his schedule. I even gave him my basic schedule, and told him I’m open to hang out whenever he has time, but they conversation seems to go in circles and get nowhere, and I never hear back from him.

I also never really hear from anyone. If I don’t reach out to my friends, I just never hear from them. Like, I feel like that forgotten friend that pops up every so often and people go “oh shit, it’s been a while!”. Like, yeah, no shit, did you lose my number?  I don’t want to be petty, but contact goes both ways, you know? It hurts to feel like no one really thinks about me.

On top of that, I’ve been missing my ex pretty hard lately. We used to be really close; she was really my one and only friend for the last year and a half or so. But she moved to another state, and while we still talk and are still friends, she’s gotten more distant lately, and it just really kills me. I felt sad and alone when she moved; now I just feel almost totally empty. It’s so hard sometimes just to be in this town, because so many things remind me of her and make me miss her. And she has a son and a step daughter that I met when we were together, and I got so attached to them, and they got attached to me, and I just really miss spending time with them too. I’ve never missed someone like this before. I don’t know how to let go. 

I don’t know. Maybe I’m just being whiny. I have great family around me, and I love them dearly. I do have a couple friends that I have heard from lately, which helps keep me going.

I didnt even care if it meant my cat would be without me, I knew my roommates would care for her in my place. Nothing mattered. I started an online discord server when i got out because I was determined to make a change. My loneliness had been of my own device, failing to reach out to others, self isolating in fear and heart break and spite for others. I was hurting so deep I felt no one could ever be close to me again. When I drank I was always irresponsibly alone with no one to make sure I got home safe. My loneliness was now threatening my self preservation. I had to find others to care for or keep getting in dangerous careless situations with no one to live for or look out for me and God knows what would have happened. The discord server quickly grew and became really fun and active with regular virtual stream nights.

If you want to see true loneliness, step into my world. 

When you’re lonely in your thirties (and up) that’s when you’re legit-certified lonely because you’re deep into adulthood and start to realize that society has socially ostracized you, regardless of your personality. 

For twenty years, I’ve lived a life of solitude - no direct family, no friends — just work, cardio, reading, sleeping, etc. — rinse and repeat. At work I play a good role of being cheerful and positive person, but once I clock out I’m much like Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver.

My advice if you actually think you’re truly lonely (and it’s what saved me despite decades of solitude): 

1) Philosophy

2) Orthodox Christianity

Once upon a time having a birthday during this ""season"" was great... it was a holiday sandwich buffet between all the other gatherings with friends and family. Except now, while other families gather it just serves to remind me of my shortcommings. 

You see, for a long time i always imagined i would find a family to share and call my own. A loving partner to grow with,  children to from, good times, hard times and everything in between that makes it all real....  

20 years ago i was a homless college dropout 15 years ago a struggling 20 something finding my way through.
10 years ago career oriented and building q foundation
3 years ago a first time homeowner

However, i guess i was so busy building a stable life to be worthyy ane proud to share from the nothing i camw from,  i never really learned how to make it come to pass. 

Now, its been so long, i dont know how to not be alone. I travel a lot for work and will be home in the morning to once again see and hear the empty nest i have built...i will ask

All of this i have poured myself into for so long is for what?

I've also give thought about what I consider friendships and relationships. Friendships would be people you relate to, do stuff together with, and have each others backs, very sparingly though.

Relationships (as in a significant other) are everything above plus having strong emotional connection with them and wanting to be with them I think. I don't think I want this. Just sex but I do have my hand and toys.

Thing is I can't relate to most people regardless of age. Sometimes I dont want to relate to them. I will avoid them yet I'll put myself out there somewhat. After watching friend groups socializing with each other and couples having fun I separate myself from that to not be tempted to do things. Unfortunately I'm human and I have that aching need to socialize and be accepted. But god damn that wouldn't turn out good.

3168,NinjaCustodian,1639519678,1,"Two years ago, almost to the day, laying in bed. My beautiful girlfriend’s head resting on my shoulder. I was just filled with the most beautiful feeling.. true love. I’d resigned myself, years before, that I’d never feel so completely in love again that I’d never find another soul mate. But.. here I was / we were. 
I said to her how I felt, and that I believed I’d never feel ‘this’ again. She told me that she’d never felt as she did then, ever before. We talked of the future, her recovery and the upcoming Holliday.. Christmas eve with my family.  Christmas Day with hers. 
We ate breakfast, I showered and got ready for work. She told me she loved me. And said: “you don’t know how fucking important it is that I know you know that I really fucking mean it”, while shaking her head slightly for extra emphasis. 
When I got home that night, she was gone. As in dead. On the kitchen floor. She looked beautiful. Peaceful. Her eyes closed. Her lips though, we’re the color of black raspberry ice cream, a dark purple. CPR didn’t get an response. 
The medical examiner listed her cause of death as ‘unknown’, but I know it was suicide. 
I believe she didn’t have enough confidence in her recovery, and knew she couldn’t hold her shit together. Her journal reads how she laments letting those who love her down. And that she didn’t believe she had another recovery in her. 
I wish I hadn’t called 911 so fast. I wish I could have just held her, and kissed her goodbye. My house became a circus immediately. My kitchen, a crime scene. The police considered me a murder suspect.
Every night since, I’ve dropped to my knees, and had a chat with her. I tell her how her mom and sister’s doin’.. and how much I miss her. 
I can’t even get close to a woman now, like when a friend’s girlfriend wants to hug me (for some fucking reason) without triggering some sort’ve panic / ptsd shit.

Hello, I'm from england and I'm 13 and my mum is homeschooling me

But I hate it, and if you're wondering why its because it was probably last year when i realised I'm not learning any where close to as much as I would in 

public-school and I really hold a grudge against it.

In terms of friends I've got a few so thats not why. Also since I'm homeschooled I can't go outside without my mum, and if you wondering why my mum is 

homeschooling me well I'll answer your question, since england is the ""knife crime capital"" she thinks I would get involved in knife crime but that only 

happens if you hang with the wrong people. This kind of sounds sexist but its based off statistics, since women are usually house wives ""USUALLY"" ok 

not trying to be sexist so if a woman doesn't get a proper education it won't be as bad because when your a house wife you don't require a job to be a 

house wife yes I get it its hard work but its all possible because the male has a job. So I don't think she understands it properly And I'm not tryna be a house husband :/

If you have any advice let me know!

3178,TheDoubleThe,1639515610,1,"I mostly meet people within video game communities, so this definitely skews what I see, but I look around at all the girls I know, friends and even just mutuals, and like 80% or more of them are in relationships, over 50% of those girls are in relationships with other girls. I'm not a straight boy or anything, I (think?) I'm a bi enby. I just hate seeing how absolutely easy it seems for girls to get into relationships. My best friend has entered her third relationship she's had in this year. I've seen more than one trans girl come out and then acquire a girlfriend within a month of coming out as a trans girl. It just seems like the easiest thing in the world for girls to find relationships and impossible if you're not a girl. It makes me feel like I'm just a worthless human for not being a girl.

I wish I was a girl and I also wish I just \*only\* liked boys instead of being bi, but I think these things have caused an identity crisis. I used to be a straight boy, but now I'm here. I can't tell if I genuinely like boys or if I've tricked myself into it. I can't tell if I want to be more fem (thus why I'm enby) or if I've tricked myself into it. I honestly have no idea who I am or what I want. I feel like I'm ashamed or scared to share parts of myself, but I don't know if those parts of myself are even me or not. Somewhere along the way to where I am, I lost myself. I can still be happy with who I am right now, even if I hate a lot of it. I've gotten so much better at being happy recently. The past month has been one of my best months in a long time, but I saw my best friend enter another relationship and it really just pushed all of those feelings of worthlessness and loneliness onto me again.

I never thought I was going to get out of a rut I was in before with a broken heart, but I did.

Most of us face serious issues that can appear difficult to dissolve.

Perhaps one reason is that we allow our problems to remain in an abstract fog.

1. Where would we start?
2. How would we plan?
3. What book should we read?
4. Where should we go?

It can be quite easy to evade this abstract fog like the plague (i'm preaching to myself here in addition to you).


I think that one distinction might assist with this fog.

The distinction between a basic plan and an explicit plan.

A basic plan is a structure of behavioral mutations that result in a new output.

An explicit plan is a set of tasks that allow one to reach a permanent result.


Learning to drink more water requires a basic plan.

Building an apartment complex requires an explicit plan.


Basic plans are theoretically simple. They involve one factor. Pain. 

That's it. 

You need to go out there and interact with someone/a group of people.

That's going to involve pain.

What if you can't handle the pain? Try going near and observing those people? Can't handle that pain? Scream at yourself in the mirror. Can't handle that pain? Go outside and ponder your inability to socialize for an hour. Can't handle that pain? Cry for 15 minutes about how stupid you are.

A basic plan simply involves you voluntarily swallowing more pain. As long as you are committed to doing that, you'll make it. 

An explicit plan is a tangible outcome that requires multiple tangential factors.

For example, becoming a doctor requires certain grades, certain decisions, and certain actions all at once.

What plan does your problem require?",lonely,The distinction between a basic plan and an explicit plan.,2021-12-15 06:46:05

My person of 3 years moved to another city to get some space (and a new job) and since I work from home I'm pretty much alone 99% of the time.  This is what has helped me get through it and over previous relationships.  It's also good for just self care.  If you're not dealing with the loss of someone you care about consider it letting go of the person you THINK you are to become the person you truly are.

**Letting Go:**

* Change the soundtrack to your life: Music triggers me. I hear it and I think of my person. First thing I do is stop listening to the same music I listened to with her. You can go back to it of course but just letting go the feelings/memories associated with these songs will make a huge difference.

&amp;#x200B;

* Change of habits: (examples) Switch from coffee to tea. Stop eating junk food. Basically don't do the same activities you did with them.

&amp;#x200B;

* Quit: drinking, smoking, porn, drugs, and anything else that might be considered a ""vice"". Your mind and body needs clarity to let go of and process the feelings you had. Whenever I drink my mind goes numb, I end up a mess, and can never let go. Also, addiction sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

* Read at least 10 pages a day (in actual books) in rotation if you have to: Doesn't have to be self help books but books that help you discover who YOU are with or without a person will make a huge change in your life. This past week I've read parts of 3 books. If one gets boring I switch to another. I can recommend 4-5 books right now that would change your life if you open yourself to the ideas in them.

&amp;#x200B;

* Learn to cook (new things): This is technically part of the change of habits but it really an essential skill that will make you feel and eat better (women love men who can cook). Cook classes are also awesome for meeting new people!

&amp;#x200B;

* No HOOKUPS!: This one was hard for me at first but I realized the more sex I had the worse I felt. If you're already part of a lifestyle that has a lot of casual sex this then disregard. Letting go requires clarity and other than the 10-15 minutes of kenjataimu (google this, lol) you get after sex, it really clouds your mind.

&amp;#x200B;

* Change of scenery: If possible, move out of the apartment, city/town, state you're in. I left Nebraska and went to the East Coast to get away from the memories of my person there. I'm getting ready to move to another city for a similar reason. You don't need to haunt the same old places.  It's torture...

&amp;#x200B;

* Go somewhere: The world is amazing, beautiful and full of loving people. Maybe your next person is in another country? I went to Turkey after my first wife left me and met an amazing woman. Brought her to the US, married her, and we were married for 11 years. There's no reason to ""stick to your own"" as my somewhat racist father would refer to dating anyone outside of the small town I grew up in.

&amp;#x200B;

* Be in solitude: The best way to deal with losing someone or being alone to me is losing everyone and to find who you are without external influences. Go for a long walk in a forest, on a beach, or somewhere else where there won't be anyone but you and nature and listen, think, and reflect on what makes you you... This is really the most essential step for me personally. When we shed the expectations, rules, and even words that define our existence we find ourselves. Be mindful that every time a memory or thought of your person comes to mind and avoid those thoughts as much as possible. (PS. turn your phone off)  You have no name or identity in the forest other than the one you give yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

* Crying is OK: Crying is basically the reset switch for your brain. Some days I wake up so angry, sad, or anxious I wanna scream but instead I cry (and sometimes scream too). I'm a 45 year old man. If I can do it, you can.  Crying helps settles your mind and gets those emotions OUT where you can eventually let go.

&amp;#x200B;

* Exercise: This is a huge one. Exercising releases chemicals that improve blah blah blah. You know the spiel. It's true. Doesn't have to be a lot, just 20 minutes a day, maybe just go for a walk (in nature if possible).

&amp;#x200B;

* Understand the difference between subjective and objective thought: Each situation you experience has two parts; the objective which you can't change and the subjective which is literally up to you. Ex: Objective: My gf didn't text me good night before bed. Subjective: ""She doesn't love me."" ""She's with someone else."" ""She's intentionally not replying."" All the most painful thoughts will flood your mind because when you're already sad and hurting your mind is basically going to give you more of the same. Maybe she just fell asleep or her phone died?

&amp;#x200B;

* Unplug: Get offline. Turn off notifications. Go into airplane mode. Doing this for at least a few hours a day helps because that hurt we get hearing that notification we want to be them but isn't HURTS. I hurts bad. . Notifications and text alerts trigger the same chemical (dopamine) in your brain that drugs, alcohol, and gambling do and it's addictive.

&amp;#x200B;

The basic concept is to lose touch with the person you were and find yourself again. Find the things you like that are just yours.  We grow as human beings all through childhood, then the second we hit our teens an early adult life the expectation of internal growth changes to growth based on external factors.  It's sad but it really does a lot of harm...

3206,_GreyX,1639501702,1,"3rd say since I joined reddit. I have been unproductive all this while. It's been 10 days since the person I was attached to blocked me. I missed her today, had strong impulse all of a sudden and ended up checking all the apps we used to talk on for her message, but nothing. I succumbed to my impulse, despite having decided previously to not visit any of those apps so I could forget her. A part of me still keeps hoping that she will return. I don't think I can make any progress if I keep having that hope, because it's only going to keep hurting me.. only going to take me back to zero

I also feel more scared today about life. The fear of ending up miserable lonely old person has eaten up, today, any hope I had left of a better life. I don't think I believe that things aren't in my control. I know they are, yet, the fears are powerful today. I have in past, during a long phase of unemployment, witnessed how my confidence eroded and self-doubt developed, against my will. I had become worse in front of my eyes. It was like I wasn't in my control.. like my environment was more powerful than me. I don't want to descend to misery like that again, now that I am unemployed again.

And i do have friends just not in my city. She is the only person i have here

I have 3 good friends in the little town I used to live in and i had a friend and her friends that are pretty nice in the town my mom and lots of family lives.

Both towns are kinda far away like I need to take a plane 

And i do make friends easily because i was bullied so long that I’ve learned to catch on to what hobbies someone has and the way they talk and what they like basically and then present myself as someone they would like. And it works almost every-time. But thats not me and I can’t turn it off like i act different to everyone and it’s exhausting and idk who i am because of it.

Yea I used to get bullied a-lot because I’m hard of hearing and had a severe speech impediment that took like 5 years of speech therapy to get me to be ok at talking still not that great. But turns out that most people are more mature now then a elementary and middle school kids

Yea i also have social anxiety and terrible self esteem even though people assure me that they like me 

Idk even when I’m not alone I’m lonely.

I think there are teens my age in my neighborhood but i just put my earbuds in when walking my dog and hope my dog finds me a friend idk shes so weird she will go up to people randomly but not usually other dogs. She just likes attention and getting petted I think 

It’s also so much to keep up with friends because I’m always just mentally drained. 
I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety 

I mean idk what i even want. Maybe a friend i can always hang out with close by. 

I saw this girl with purple hair and headphones on walking her a dog a few times but she always had headphones on like me

I want friends but I can’t even go up to people to start the conversation but once i do i know how to make friends with them like I’m not anxious at that point i become a social butterfly 

I don’t go to in person school so meeting friends at school isn’t a option. And I want to meet someone and just be myself but idk who i am

Like even my closet shows that with my inability to choose a style because my fashion is different based on who I’m around I also tend to drop people when it’s not going good because i hate confrontation and drama

Its just so much more complex then just having no one which isn’t the case. 

But when i say I’m lonely I get told I’m not because i have friends and family and a girlfriend 

But loneliness isn’t that simple I think it’s more of that feeling of being disconnected which I feel all the time 

Even when im with someone im alone inside because i can’t truly connect with anyone. Like it seems the other person is always having a better experience in the relationship with me. Like they feel that they know but they don’t

And of course im not saying i want a friend solely just for venting, cus its wrong to pour all my emotions on someone, it would just be too overwhelming for them. I think its also important to have conversations about other things like our interests and hobbies. I just want an honest friend to have fun with and just be supportive ://",lonely,Just feeling down and drunk now :(,2021-12-14 21:30:03

3282,DrafteeDragon,1639455608,1,"I used to be a big advocate of the “i’m never alone when I’m with myself” motto. The comforting idea that because I like who I am and could be confident and I’d always be surrounded by a good presence, i.e myself. In a, “I trust that I can get through this” sense. 

Recently my identity has been shattered. I don’t recognize myself anymore, I’m not genuine, my trust issues have been multiplied by 100 and I can’t rely on a family that I don’t have anymore. I’m so alone, I don’t know what to do, I cry myself to sleep all the time, I’m distancing myself from everyone even though I try to act as normal as possible. I’m overthinking everything, it’s ruining my friendships and even some of my own family is giving up on me. I’m giving up on me. And yet there are people everywhere around me. They don’t understand, they don’t ask, they move on. And I get it, i really do. It’s better this way. Sometimes I wish I could ghost everyone and disappear to start again.

But how do you deal with it? The crippling feeling that no matter what you’re on your own, that the ones who you thought cared vanished when you needed help, that your can be betrayed by your own persona.

I’m so tired. Of everything. I wish someone loved me the way I try to love people. I wish someone cared.

I started dating this girl 6 years ago and all her friends moved away, had kids or went under the radar.  We both have like zero real genuine friends. We like to rave, and go out but the connections with intoxicated people always fades the next day or week. Sometimes it lasts but in the end I feel like we push to hard to hangout and with how disconnected or a.d.d. people are these days it's just hard to have people in our lives that care about us. 

Me and my gf are both basically single children of our respective parents and we have each other, but real friendships when things get hard, or we want to have fun, is something I wish I had. We both missed out on a 4 year university and I feel like we missed networking and ways to meet people our own age.

So basically growing up I developed agoraphobia and panic attacks around the age of maybe 3/4 shit maybe I always had it anyways I always was unable to make friends or keep friends. Jump to 13/14 and I’m suicidal every day. Tried multiple times only time I got close was doing the neck knot off a room fan. Somehow my mom heard me banging my feet against the bed and bawling my eyes out and found me and took me to the hospital. They doped me up and sent me home with anti psychotics. Always was the black sheep in the family circle, cousins found me weird and never wanted to talk to me. Aunts and uncles would talk shit about me. Around 15/16 I made a group of friends but the drug using kind. Started with weed and… well you already know the rest. Did everything under the sun and ended up with a crippling Coke/psychedelic/stimulant addiction and wouldn’t be able to leave my house. Could never hold a relationship or friendship longer than a couple months. Was always told I was “too much” and I don’t blame them I’ve always been a mess. Around the age of 18/19 I get clean at a rehab and end up worse than I started. I now live with GAD, agoraphobia, MDD and mania on a daily basis and need klonopin/ Kratom and Thc to keep me leveled. I had a wife of 3 years and she was the most wonderful person ever and we loved eachother so much and I feel like she understood me to the core and I’m so sorry to all of you if you never got that chance I really am I hope you all find love💙, but I fucked up bad. Relapsed on alcohol and pills again due to not being able to handle my emotions. We got a divorce last summer and idek how to describe how I feel. Maybe you can tell already but I’m too numb to really try to articulate my words better. Idk I just really want someone in my life again, even just a best friend, someone to hold. But there’s also something so serene about loneliness I feel like I’ve went as far as you can go for my age and I’ll never be the same. I wake up wishing I was still in deep sleep.

Been feeling lonely as of late so I thought I would make some friends. I live in the UK (north) and currently spend most of my time studying. I have lost quite a few friends as of late so some new ones would be ideal. Some local friends would be ideal (Liverpool is the closest city to me). Honestly, I am standard. Enjoy music, play games, and study. Have been struggling massively with my mental health as of late so someone I could have a healthy discussion about that with would be massive.

I only play PC. Currently looking for friends to play FFXIV with so if you play that, give me a shout. Realistically, I am only looking for people who genuinely want to be long-term friends. I have had enough encounters with people who start a conversation and then disappear into the ether. I would preferably like some people to talk with on discord – I use that A LOT throughout the day, especially when I am studying (the company helps).

I've had successful relationships as well as friendships but when things fall apart I feel incredibly lonely.  After some time reflecting and discovering myself I realized that I am an empath and what I was actually feeling was a lack of external energy.  Some will laugh and make fun of me for saying this but as humans we crave the company of other people.  We are social creatures by nature and inter-dependence is part of our species.

Additionally, when I am in social situations I find myself overwhelmed by other people's energy.  This makes finding new connections incredibly hard because I basically feel their anxiety, anger, and sadness and absorb it, often times losing touch with myself.  Perhaps what is making you feel like social interaction with others is difficult is just the overwhelming intuition you have about them based on their current mood or energy.

I feel like my only worth to this world is what I make for dinner and taking care of our kids keeping the house clean 
( I have adult ADD so somethings can be a struggle ) 
I know my husband loves me but he’s addicted to his phone and anything that can distract him from our Mundane life

I’ve read books
 I’ve seen therapists

When we met I was single with a child and he seemed so interested in building a life with me that maybe I ignored certain things 

But here I am now years later With two more kids who love their father 

still I cry almost every day and I am unhappy 
I feel selfish if I leave
 not to mention logistically I would be ruined nor can I afford to raise three kids on my own
And should I take these kids from their normal routines just to make myself happy
How selfish am I for even having these thoughts
Is my life even my own anymore to have these thoughts 
or do I need to wait another 15 years until my kids are older to try and find  happiness

Basically became a NEET all of a sudden. During those two weeks, none of my friends messaged. Heck, my phone didn't even vibrate with message notifications. My notifications were mostly emails from spams. My phone was on a normal setting. I relapsed to my old habits because I felt hopeless. I've been wondering if happiness is something I can really feel again or is it just an illusion or spur of the moment feeling. 

I locked myself in my room for two weeks, only going out when I'm out of ciggs. Smoking became my coping mechanism. Honestly, I think I would be dead if I were living alone but I'm still living with my parents. I've been faking smiles and laughter to get my mom off my back. She's believing it I guess. She was scolding and giving me cold shoulders because I felt depressed. I've told her that I want to go for therapy or even counselling and she refused saying that there's nothing wrong with me, then proceeds to force her ideaolgy and mindset onto me. So I pretended my smiles and jokes, pretended to enjoy myself, so she could be happy. 

These two weeks got me thinking. If anything really were to happen to me, would any of my friends know? Would anyone even care? Why should I reach out to people when the thought of me don't even cross their minds? They say that ""the world doesn't revolve around you"" so why do I have to revolve my world around others. Why do I always have to be the first one to reach out first.

That oral sex is not commonly performed on them by straight men compared to blowjobs on men by straight women and gay men 

That they are seen as gross, taboo and have a stigma (feminists and women online say this ALL the time.) And insulted the most out of any body part. 

That gay men are far more openly disgusted by vaginas than lesbians are by penises and that lesbians are more open to being with trans women than gay men are open to being with trans men (same for straight men being more open to sex with trans women than straight women are open to sex with trans men, because straight women need penis sexually.) 

That women mostly feel insecure about their vaginas and even refuse to be given oral sex, whereas men mostly love their penises, feel proud 

That society is penis obsessed. Bachelorette parties are full of penis paraphernalia, they are drawn everywhere, talked and joked about more, casual, normalised, sexualised more. 

That vaginas are not appreciated anywhere near as much as boobs, butts and penises are. (Since they stick out and people are fascinated when they are all large.) Boobs and penises are seen as the most female feminine defining feature and the most masculine and male defining feature.

I have spent a while looking at all the posts from this subreddit and it resonated within me - A while ago i was in a dark place, similar to a lot of the folks in this subreddit - Though now a days i am much better, i still teeter on the edge of that abyss. Something that helped me climb out of that abyss was connecting with others - forming bounds and talking - and although now a days i am alone for the most part - i had enough support during the days of my struggle that now i know how to walk alone. 

It's hard to try to stand up on your own when these dark thoughts cloud your mind - when you are in the abyss - struggling to climb out - Sometimes what we need is just someone out there to remind us that every one of us is valuable and that we all deserve an opportunity to live. Someone out there to support us and give us the help we need so we can start to learn how to stand up again. 

I know a lot of us lack that support  - those humans bounds which are so necessary for us to develop as humans and so i want to offer my help - my shoulder to lean on, my ear to listen to your troubles, my voice to offer advice, my companionship. You don’t have to struggle alone - I understand how important just having one person to show us companionship can mean to us especially during these dark moments of our lives. 

I want to be your friend, companion, your support - I want to help anyone who feels alone, unwanted - who feels lost in that abyss - thoughts clouded by dark clouds. I am always available online so i will do my best to maintain communication with you - voice, text or even video - I don’t mind  - I want to help people.

3402,RevelInIsolation,1639405825,1,"Warning: May be a long post about absolutely nothing. 

Please don't see anything I see in this as an approach to life. It is possibly the worst thing to do to yourself by depriving yourself of human needs deliberately.

I just ran out of choices to make.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been alone for a very long time now. I have no family. Never did. They pretend myself and my mother don't exist. I was never wanted as a part of their lives. 

I have no friends as I cannot connect with people. I can hold conversations and talk about mutual experiences, but we will never be friends, from your side or mine. You will also find you know nothing about me no matter how much you speak to me.

I will never open up to my mother because I do not want to cause her any more hardship on whatever she's already experienced. 

So I'm even a stranger to my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

The funny thing is, my mom used to tell me when I was younger that I'll have my own family some day instead, to make up for my own shitty family.

Sorry to disappoint. I really am.

On that topic, I am comfortable with the fact that I will never be able to experience having a relationship with someone. Sure, it would be nice to meet someone who will love you for the person you are, share intimate moments with, laugh, cry, have kids, all that stuff. All that sounds great.

But it's not in the cards for me.

To add to that, as a guy who is 26, I am also well aware that my lack of experience is becoming a bigger and bigger red flag. 

But I have about 49 other, bigger red flags, so I'm just forming a collection at this point.

I don't really offer anything to anyone for them to consider me for a relationship or a friendship. Nada. I'm a good listener, but that is all. You share, I don't.

My only skill in life is being able to successfully hide my thoughts and feelings from the world without people noticing that what I put out is completely fraudulent.

&amp;#x200B;

I imagine someone is going to jump down my throat about my self-pity, lack of desire to change, etc.

No doubt, with enough effort, change is possible, and I wouldn't put it past anyone in this sub that if you take the right steps, you'll be able to value yourself infinitely more. You deserve it, and you should do it for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

In my case, I tend to run into too many of the same issues, I guess.

There are things you experience over time that mold you into whoever you are. In my case, my experiences made me cold, distrustful, petty, aggressive and solemn. So much so that I refuse to reveal anything about myself to others, and I tend to create an image around people that I want them to see that has nothing to do with me. It's rather easier when we as people love to talk about ourselves. I am just a listener. You can trust me, but I will never, ever trust you.

On top of that, I rather dislike myself as a person. More like loathe myself. It has been ingrained in me since I was about 6 years old, when I first got told I was nothing. 

That naturally puts me in a terrible place for any interaction. Hence I will never open myself up to someone.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to that question, Why will I never change this about myself?

Because I tried, many times. I was sometimes partially successful, and probably could have been more.

But the same situations kept coming around, in different situations, with different people, throughout my 26 years.

I'm not cursed(I think?). I just believe I am very, very unlucky that it keeps happening to me.

You ever been in a school where a teacher would mock you in front of the entire class? I was about 10 years old.

Or gone to a workplace where the staff were told not to speak to you and they placed you far away from everyone else, like you're a fucking mental case?

15 years apart, but similar situations.

&amp;#x200B;

Add in bullying, terrible people, an alcoholic stepfather, a disillusioned and uncaring mother, many disappointments and interactions with people that caused you to revert and you have me.

&amp;#x200B;

There comes a point in time, when, for your own sanity, what's viewed as the negative reaction(as mine is) becomes your saviour and what keeps you alive. 

As lonely and painful as it is, I am alive because I closed myself off. 

Like anyone else, I can only take so much pain before I break.

&amp;#x200B;

My experiences aren't the worst or any worse than most people's. The problem is they're too consistent. And I'm too isolated to have any kind of comfort from them. From when I was young, till who I am now.

I'm like an abused dog(weird association, but it works). You have to put a lot of time and attention in before I allow myself to become receptive to you. 

But as people, we don't have the time or commitment for that.\\

&amp;#x200B;

And now, because of myself, I am stuck as myself, which is somebody unwanted.

This is my life, and I have accepted it. Moving along, existing, waiting for death to take me some day. I wouldn't wish this on anyone as any form of punishment, but it is mine, and I accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

Those friendships, relationships and family: things I want, are slowly starting to fade from my mind, which allows me to cope better.

However, what is still there, is that at the end of the day, what I want is for someone to say to me: ""I like and want you to be around.""

That's it. No more, no less.

The covid lockdowns sort of dredged it all up for me and I've been quietly torturing myself over it. I;ve never really had the space to process it. Now I'm reflecting on how much it's impacted my romantic and sexual relationships since. I've never really gotten over it. 

I realise it was immensely fucked up. I also want to be able to recognise that it was fucked up without also reducing the profound impact it's had on me. I'm TWing this post not because it felt abusive, but because I know what this is on paper and I don't want to trigger anyone else. It felt very far from abuse. Very dysfunctional yet completely passionate.

Last time I posted about it, I got completely ripped to shreds. I dunno, don't wanna seem like I'm defending myself too much because people on reddit can practically smell that. I guess I just felt like they misunderstood my actual intention.

I'm here because I wish I had people I could talk with about it. It's a very lonely secret to hold. 

My partner knows about it but for the simple fact that talking about ex-lovers is really awkward, even before all the other taboo stuff, he really doesn't wanna know. I also told my closest friend, but she's also uncomfortable talking about it because finding out your best friend was sleeping with a teacher you had a lot of respect for doesn't make for great conversation. So I guess it's not quite a secret but you know what I'm getting at here.

Despite the whole thing being a total cliche, I feel really alone in this. I've started heavily self-medicating in the last year as well because of it. Despite being in a long term relationship I'm having a lot of impulsive thoughts about reckless sex with others (kind of how I acted before I met my current partner) - obviously wouldn't act on any of this now. 

(Before anyone mentions, yes I'm trying to get back into therapy, but I'm also SO paranoid about disclosing what happened).",lonely,When I was 18 I had a really cliche affair and I feel really lonely keeping it a secret,2021-12-14 00:18:48

Looking back at my childhood for a very long time I had a hope that it will go well for me in adulthood. Can u imagine how delusional I was? I had lonely fairly poor childhood and I guess those people that were around me,relatives and some not really close obligatory friends gave me sense that things might turn out good for me. I always dreamed of being competent in my job,raising my smart children and having parties like grown ups do every other week . Thats how I see happiness. And now the reality has finally kicked in. I'm autistic depressed raising a son who's autistic too. I know I should go and finish or start new studies because it will be beneficial for my future. Or maybe not?I have discovered that I often lack eye for the detail and don't see obvious things. Here goes my dream of a job,a career,of something. Say hello to minimum wage jobs where everyone is annoyed with u and calls u stupid behind your back. Now I need to come to terms I will be raising my son on minimal wage job,even know,he would benefit from extra help we have waited already 3 years from the government and they told us we will have to wait another 3. My son will be 9 by then. He's smart,but because he suffers from a harsher version of autism,I have basically doomed him for the same life and loneliness. Has anybody noticed that autistic people are basically like rejects of society? People pity you,tell you its not that bad to have it,but also don't want to be your friends cause its a social life death? So here goes my last dream of having a parties with adults, u need to have friends for that and most people are self centered narcissists. Hell,even my own mother have told me,don't be friends with this or that person,u can do better than disabled or autistic. I'm autistic too but she denies it,turns it into a joke. I was supposed to be born severely disabled but didn't. She knew that and was willing to raise me like that, only to put other people down who actually didn't get lucky and were born with disability. Im lonely and depressed,these factors in my life doesn't make me wanna get up and try. I feel like I will just end up dissapointed by things out my control.

I’m a kiwi :) *Born in New Zealand*
I am looking for someone, anyone who is genuine and can bring a great conversation and hopefully friendship. 

My hobbies include spending a lot of time at the beach, walking, swimming and hiking. Anything outdoors really. 

I have two Persian rag dolls and a Siberian husky. 
I am huge on trust! Absolutely hate liars with a passion. 

I work roughly 110hrs a week as a gantry crane operator loading and discharging container ships at the port here. 40 of these hours are by choice. When I find someone who is worth my time I will make time for them. 

I’m roughly 175cm, light skinned and I have green eyes with dark hair. My blood is rather mixed. My mum is from Croatia and my dad is Serbian. Both my dads parents are from Serbia and my mums parents are from Russia. 
I don’t speak any of their languages and have not been to any of those countries. 

I am very open minded and trusting. Maybe a little too much to be honest.

3424,areyouseryus,1639390168,1,"hi guys,

I am 24(F) yo. I am doing my thesis and my goal is to graduate till February. I have zero friends. In March 2020 I was in a good place. I had a couple of friends in uni, i had some high school friends near my house so it was a luxury even to find a day to be alone and do anything that i love (i am an extreme introvert so you know the drill). In the first quarantine i lost them all. Literally, my uni friends where mean to me and i was crying every night, my high school friends ignored me and even lied to me about their new boyfriends/jobs/working place/shifts etc. Yeah it was messed up and of course i told to myself ''you don't need these toxic human beings around you''. So i cut ties. Super easy for me since kindergarden. I never had a steady friend for more than 3 years... 

Am i the toxic one?

Am the only one that is constantly left behind in life? (i mean yeah obvs, still a virgin, never went on a date, never had a fling just to vent about to my friends-women tend to like that or at least the girls i chose to be friends with-, jobs that i never had cause i am super into my studies and i have my huge plan after graduation that nobody of them seemed to ever embrassed or listen to.

\*Just to be clear, i don't say these things because i want to hear ''no you are right they were horrible'', i am just saying what happened, the events..\*

Fastforward to today. I am extremely alone. I mean i was never the kind of person that had an extreme intense life, going outs, hangovers. None of these things. Maybe this is why people always dump me beacause i am such a prude. I mean if i had a different father more open and more like ''go out have some fun'' and not a ''where are you going to go-with who-are there any boys-be carefull-what time are you gonna return'' for a whole week before going out, maybe yes i would go out more often..

Since september my life is this: wake up early because i am a gradma, pack my crappy laptop-notes-pocket money and go a)to a starbucks b) to my faculty's library. When i don't have the money for the starbucks i go to choice b, but i feel there extremely unwelcomed because it is small and the security check is awfull and always telling ''i remember you, you alwayes here''. Dude fuck you. The libraries are for studying okay? So what i want to be there every morning? it's my damn right. There another enormous uni library a little far away but i am afraid im gonna see people that i used to know so.. i don;t know...After i finish my work i go for a walk. But to be precise i just want to go for a coffee with someone and not again with my mom..I go to the cinema a lot. Like 2 times a month. Alone. I love it. I go in early screenings just to avoid big groups of people that have a great time. I delete all my social media because noone messages me and i have nobody to message excpet my mom and brother. I lie every time to my dad that i am going out with my friends even if i am by myself because if i tell the truth i am gonna be in trouble and i can;t bother with this anymore. Also i start bying loads of make up  and i spend 20 mins to do it before step out. I mean i went to the supermarket like a hollywood star. I need that. It;s like a mask like ''yeah look at me i am good, i have a social life, i have plans for the evening, maybe a boyfriend or maybe someone's in love with me''. Pathetic.

Lately i am sobotaging my self. I turn off my alarm in 08:10 A.M and after that i go back to sleep till 11.  My mom's asking me ''aren't you suppose to leave'' and i am like ''i don't know what happened i overslept, tommorow''. Oh also if it past 11 i don't leave the house because i feel like i lost the whole day and i am not going to find a free spot on starbucks or the library (it;s empty like always). Yesterday i hit rock bottom. My brother (16) said that he made plans with his friends and was going to leave. I felt bad and even a little jealous. I had in mind to pop a movie to see with mom and brother...my eyes were red as i walk him out of the door. So i stayed with my mom and watched 2 shows on TV. 

We watched a travelling show, and the guy was in London. Yeah that didn't go well....

I have all these dreams, all these big plans of success and i am always like i am different (i don't like anything in my country-music-shows-pleople-customs-narrow mindedness-) never clicked with anybody..i accept the fact that i have a very different taste and that if people can't respect that it's their problem not mine even though in my whole life i put on a show trying to blend in unsuccessfully obvs. 

I don't know anymore. Some other day i thought i saw a super toxic girl from uni and i really wished to just say a hello but it wasn't her..

Do things change? Do we play a big role in our path-karma-happiness-luck or the stars, universe make these  desicions? I don't leave the house before i read my horoscope..why? bcause it gives me hope for the day. Every sunday night i go to the bathroom and cry because a new week is ahead and will do the same zombie life again. Maybe after my graduation things will go into place...idk....

(sorry for long post)

i will be happy to read your thoughts, be honest. Thanks.",lonely,What have I become?,2021-12-13 21:09:28

It’s kind of isolating. I had friends in grade 10 from junior high but I slowly started feeling awkward around them and withdrew from the group quietly. It hurt even more because no one really noticed I was gone and I did start cutting myself. 

Quarantine hit and online school improved my mental health but everyday was so monotonous just being in the house all day. I did stop cutting though.

I’m back in person school now and while I’ve made friends we are not really close. We usually talk about homework and tests and nothing else. I sit alone in the library and it feels like shit to be surrounded by people with friends. I did try to make friends at the beginning of the year but everyone’s established their groups already so it’s weird to squish myself in. 

When I see my old friends I usually try to avoid them and any eye contact. They never did anything wrong to me but it kind of hurts seeing them.

So I was a dealer around my hometown (just weed and x) and was doing really good for myself  and then one day I was really messed up off the xans and me and my gf af the time had passed out in her bed, everything sounds normal right? No, she ended waking up a little before I did because she heard banging on the door and it ended up being her whole apartment complex basically, standing outside  freaking out because apparently her car had been running for a few hours and the door was locked and everyone was checking to see if she was okay.(apparently they were banging on the door for like a hour) well after they all left she woke me up and when I went into the living room my wallet was laying face down on the table and all my money was missing. The only people I seen that night was her, my friend Dave (not anymore) and his friend Matt. They all said they didn’t touch it they didn’t know what happened but money doesn’t just disappear into thin air lol. So a few days passed and I had searched everywhere looking for it I couldn’t find my money nowhere, it was in my backpack before I went to sleep I know it was because I would never take it out. I forgot to mention this, it was 1400$ ! So I continued to keep hanging out with the same people that I was with that night and they all seemed to act normal, my gf thought that I just dropped it. But in my mind I didn’t know if they were all in on it together and stole it or if it was just one of them that did it solo orrrr if I was just messed up on xans and hid it(this was the main thought). About three months go by of me being super paranoid, ripping my gf apartment apart anytime she would turn her back to me and being super anxious because I never got my money back up from that moment. I have fallen into a deep depression hole because of it and I’m stuck and have been since then. This happened may 12, I think about this everyday still. Then one day me and my gf are sitting on the couch and the neighbor came over and said that there friends/boyfriends had broken into the house multiple times while we were asleep/out of the house. We have no idea how they were getting in but they were and that was around mid august that she told us that. Now put ur self in my shoes and try to imagine what it would feel like to wake up to ur money missing. Something that you have put ur blood sweat and tears into saving and someone just took it from u and you had no idea who did it, now also imagine going three months being paranoid as fuck around ur friends and gf when In reality it was ur neighbor who did it the whole time… I have one more little story to add because this just happened a few weeks ago. 

so I cut Dave off just a few weeks ago for multiple reasons but the main one is: I went over to his friends house to buy some xans off him because I was feeling very very depressed, I don’t wanna go into detail about it but I was wanting to see what was “beyond this world” if you know what I mean. and my breaks locked up on my car, (I know I’m a dumbass who drove 100k miles without changing my breaks lol) so I had already popped the xans and I’m sitting in my car and my current gf now came and picked me up and I left my car there. Well when I came back to get my car about a week later it was gone. Long story short, I didn’t know where my car went I called all the tow lots and they didn’t have it I thought someone stole it and Dave said he didn’t know where it went he thought I came and got it so I obviously wasn’t gonna make the same mistake and not trust his word again that he didn’t do it. About a month later and still no report,  Come to find out his friend told me he actually had my car towed to a chop shop a few towns over and got 500$ for it. Crazy crazy shit huh, like this past few months have really really messed me up. 

So the advice that I’m looking for is. How do I stop feeling like im in the deepest darkest hole anyone could possibly be in? I feel so down and worthless that I have no energy and I have no desire to even get outta bed half the time. It’s been really messing with every factor of my life. I haven’t been able to get my money back up because my wallet was in my car and I don’t have a social security card anymore. Also everything I owned was in my car. All my nice clothes everything. I have one pair of shoes now lol.",lonely,A crazy crazy story time also in need of advice. I know it looks like a lot to read but please trust me it’s worth the read.,2021-12-13 18:28:49
3452,abeecee145,1639379968,1,"i'm gonna be 20 in a few days and maybe it's because of the pandemic but i feel like i was 16 just yesterday. i still feel like a kid and i just want to be hugged. i spend everyday alone after work. i feel like i've let my teenage years pass me by. and i know it's bad to have negative self-talk but no amount of positive thinking will change how objectively ugly i am. i genuinely feel embarrassed to leave the house because i feel like a burden to others with my ugliness. i know that sounds absurd but it's gotten to a point where, even though i know it should sound absurd, it sounds completely factual to me. i never realized this when i was younger but when you're a woman, being attractive is almost like a requirement to be accepted in society. even if you have a good personality, your appearance comes first. it's kind of why it's rare to see any attractive men with ugly women while it's common to see ugly men with attractive women. i'm sorry but women look at and value the personality of men alot more than men do. of course the personality of a woman matters to men, but if she isn't attractive first, men won't stick around to even get to know her personality. 
and if a man is ugly, it's unfortunate. but if a woman is ugly, she's a slob. if a woman is ugly, people go beyond even if it's subconscious and make personal assumptions about her because, even if people don't intend to do it or just think it subconsciously, many people subconsciously view women as objects. even women do this too because of our internalized misogyny. if a man is cold and reserved, it's just seen as normal. if a woman is cold and reserved, she's a bitch. and especially, if an ugly woman is cold and reserved, she's worthless. i don't say all this to try to claim that women have it harder or start a gender war but i just want to explain why i feel so uncomfortable with myself. being as ugly as i am is one thing, but being this ugly as a woman? it feels like a crime i should be embarrassed of rather than something unfortunate that i should comfort myself about. i suffer from social anxiety because of this and i find it so hard to leave my house or speak to anyone. even when i take a walk, i feel embarassed for no reason. i feel like i've failed as a woman and i'm just simply disgusting to others that i feel embarrassed. sometimes i feel like my own parents dislike me because i'm so ugly and it hurts. sometimes i try to cuddle with my mom when i feel touch-deprived and alone, and she just pushes me away but she would never push my conventionally attractive siblings away. sometimes i feel like my own dad looks at me with disgust and it hurts a lot. 
even at work, i try so hard to be smart and productive but i find that my manager doesn't care. He never speaks nicely to me and speaks to me as little as possible, and gets visibly irritated when i speak to him briefly to ask a simple question, but will buy other attractive female coworkers coffee and initiate conversation. one time, me and another female coworker who i now lost contact with were chatting and having a good time during our break, and the manager saw us. his entire demeanor towards me changed and he started being nice to me just because the other female coworker and i seemed to be friends. once she left, he was back to his mean, cold self. i wanted to hate my manager for being shallow, but i found that i just hated myself more for being so ugly as a woman. and that makes me angry that i think of myself like that as well as sad but i cant help it. 
  
i just wish i could not be ugly so that i could at least have the chance to be loved, no just simply liked, by others. or i wish i could have been born a man so my personality and character would be valued more than my looks. i feel like i am still a vulnerable little kid deep inside even though i'm 20 with a full time job and i just want to be hugged and taken care of and told everything will be okay. i just wish i could be in the presence of others without feeling disgusted with myself. i don't even wish for a boyfriend or partner but i just am tired of feeling worthless and embarrassed to even leave my house. i've never had male friends, and only have had female friends, and i now realize it's because i had so much internalized misogyny inside me (and still, admittedly, do) and believed that i was worthless to men even as a friend because i am ugly. i once read a book that showed a study that found that men tended to only befriend and maintain friendships with women who they found attractive and how people in general will see attractive people as trustworthy, kind, and give them the benefit of the doubt, especially for women, while feeling negative emotions when viewing unattractive women, and i truly think that was the start of me realizing how my physical appearance defines me. after that, i started realizing how important my appearance is and tried so hard to make myself prettier with things like makeup and weight loss, but it didn't change much. 
my features are ethnic, manly, and extremely large.
when i was a little girl, i never thought that my appearance ever mattered and i felt proud that i got good grades, played instruments well, and could make my friends laugh. i was so happy and never felt lonely. 
when you're a little girl, noone faults you on your appearance. but now i'm a grown woman and i hate it. now as an adult, it's become so clear that one's appearance, especially as a grown woman, matters so much in life and it makes me feel extremely depressed and hopeless. i can't change my genetics and my issues are things that plastic surgery can't fix. i wear heavy makeup everyday only to cover my entire face with a hat and mask and keep my head down at work. 
i miss being younger and being oblivious to everything i know now. everyday after work i just lie in bed and try to remember my memories from childhood and relive them because they were so good. i genuinely feel like i am completely alone. i don't see myself ever getting out. and i know i should go to therapy but i can't bring myself to sit in front of a therapist and admit any of this stuff. i'd feel so silly and shallow and just embarrassed. i really don't think anything a therapist can tell me would change how i feel. i'm only typing this out here because i know it is anonymous and i just want to let it out of my system and feel like i am confiding in someone for the first time in a long while. i also feel like this post is sort of just a rambling mess of my thoughts but i'm tired so i'm just gonna post it",lonely,feeling so alone and unloveable,2021-12-13 18:19:28

Like yourselves I have suffered in silence. Confiding in strangers who can relate to me on forums like this. I have recently gone to a gym where the coach is also a life coach. Working out my stress and talking out my problems have made my problems seem very small. This is with a cheating wife, hostile work environment, and having little to no friends. Also I have 101 nervous tics. 

Life can be over whelming but get some help. It sounds stupid and you may think that well it won't work for you. The truth is that we are all very alike. We try to use the easy out like junk food, alcohol, or bing watching a worthless piece of crap show. The REAL way to beat loneliness is to get help and to put yourself out there. Choosing not to is your crutch, you are making best friends with your self hate because much like an ex it is familiar dick/pussy. Much like Buddha I have reached enlightenment by embracing the pain and still seeing the silver lining. Yes my wife cheats but I have a beautiful boy, yes my work is toxic but I have plenty of people who love me there, yes I live 300miles away from my family there is a telephone. 

It was the hardest thing ever to dig myself out of the mental grave but I am so so so happy. I wanted to end it all but life is about choices and as hard as it may look.... Happiness is a choice, this means doing the things you love regardless of the outcome.

I am trying so hard to try and see if I can get back out there again and start dating again after the split and I just get so numb and sad thinking about how quiet it is here. I am so scared to get hurt again, be used and then no longer be wanted. I have friends but they never visit, I have family but I always have to be the one to call or see them. I just want some sort of gratification so bad for always being there for everyone else in my life and now I just feel like I have nothing.  

I took a walk earlier to watch some Christmas lights down the road kick on their timers before sunset and it made me feel dizzy how far my life has fallen down a void since last holiday season. One of my best friends died, and the funeral in January was the last time I saw the old gang somewhat get back together. My grandma died in March and had to wait until May for her to be put at peace. It was the last time I saw my entire family. 

We finalized our Divorce in February after a very difficult split. Now I only get to see my girls some nights after work and alternate weekends. I just want my daughters here right now, they are the only thing that keeps me going at all. All that I can hear right now is the wind howling outside, its so cold and dark in here.  I would give anything to hear my 6 year old snoring from the other room after a long day of going to the park, walking around Target and getting ice cream sandwiches together.  

I am so tired of trying to self soothe myself and say things are getting better since February. I am lonely as fuck in this stupid house I bought and can no longer afford to move from.  I have no idea what to do. I need to be covid conscious for my children and job. I need to be able to support my kids but I also need to get the hell out of here. I need someone so bad. I miss warmth, I miss laying next to holding a special someone on a cold morning before making her coffee and bringing it to her in bed. But at the same time I am so stuck and it makes me so sad right now.

as a guy, i don't really have much. i don't get showered with attention, even for my accomplishments. i'm not encouraged. i've never been in a real relationship, other than one abusive one i took a chance on just because of how lonely i was. it's like my level of pain and loneliness is much more amplified and i have to smile through it, day after day. it's even worse if you don't fit the typical mold people expect of men. if you don't have a deep voice, if you don't have a strong frame—somehow society looks down upon you. people don't even move aside for me on sidewalks. they literally always expect me to step aside. i don't go outside anymore, partly because of things like that.

I'd wake up to the sound, go to sleep to the sound, and anytime a machine wasn't working, she'd be setting it up again or doing some of the manual work...and now, it's not around. 

She decided that I deserved a better partner than she could be to me. I appreciated the sentiment, but ultimately it wasn't my decision.  She's in Germany now, living her best life. We talk, when she feels like messaging me. We share memes we think the other would appreciate, but always I feel that vast void between us that wasn't there before. That void where you want to feel that level of closeness to someone outside of your self, and it's not there. I gave up all my friends for my ex, because I wanted to be available to do for her and what did they know about our relationship. I moved over 2000 mile from my family when we decided to go make our own life together. I really don't have anyone in my life besides coworkers, and they're all remote workers like me. I could probably die today and the only person who would notice would be my boss, and then my landlord when my rent wasn't paid. 

I can handle most of this. Sure, it's annoying not to have anyone to lean on, but I can bounce back from that. More than anything, it's the silence that gets to me.

Every time I have a female friend she just turns 2-faced. The few friends I do have never even call me, they just hang with me when we run into each other at the bar. Maybe they're just being polite.

Lately I'm dealing with some very raw emotions surrounding a girl I used to adore. We are so much alike, and she really seems to like me a lot (so she acts like), but she tried to move in on my boyfriend a couple years ago. I cant get the truth out of anybody if he cheated on me with her. They slept together one time, years ago when he and an ex broke up and he got attached but she declined dating him, and he ended up back with the ex a week later. So there's a history, albeit seemingly fleeting and insignificant. But it doesn't matter now, as he dumped me 2 months ago out of the blue. I tried again to get the truth out, but nothing. Something went on between them, I just don't know how much or how far. It hurts that she did that to me. It hurts that she is so well loved by so many, so she must not be a shitty person to them. So why to me? Now she's in ICU after a car wreck, no clue if she'll come out of it. I keep thinking about her, hoping she recovers for the sake of those who do love her, especially her boyfriend who dotes on her.  But I also feel so hurt by her, and I'm clearly the only one who feels this way, which makes me feel like shit.

Sometimes I worry I'm just a toxic vampire of a person. I worry that when I'm around other people and having a good time that I'm actually just draining those around me as a tradeoff. 

I have an ex from 10 years ago who was a narcissist who convinced me that everyone hates me, that  I'm the problem, that  I'm a horrible person,  that I'm the abusive partner, and that I make everyone around me miserable. I worry he was right. I worry I'm actually an evil person who makes everyone feel like shit. There's a reason people are automatically, almost instinctually adverse to me. Maybe I deserved it all, including what this girl did to me. Maybe she thought she was saving him from me.

It just hurts so much to feel hated, to feel like I cause everyone so much pain just by being around them, and nobody will even tell me what it is about me that makes me so unwanted, so I can try to fix the problem. I am left alone AND blind. 

TLDR: I feel like I bring out the worst in people and worry that I'm actually evil and deserve it, and that I should stay away so they can be happy, and I don't know what it is that makes me so wrong and unnatural.",lonely,I feel like I'm the only one bringing out people's bad sides,2021-12-13 13:56:03

I can try to be sympathetic but even doing so feels uneasy and false, it doesn't sound like something I would ever say or it comes off as trying too hard and I can't force myself to care for someone no matter the amount of attempts I try. 

I normally end up ghosting those who wanted to seek a friendship with me because I don't care for them enough the way they do for me. I don't often care enough to check how they are doing, catch up, hang out as much as they do with me, and would probably prefer if they left me alone. Plus, personally I feel as if I am projecting my own thoughts and feelings on to them with this, I don't genuinely believe people mean what they say and it's rather more of a temporal infatuation that they are going through so I occasionally disregard their care and attention so they don't believe their own lies and give them an easy way out from their emotional delusion state. 

I occasionally leave them behind in hopes they find someone better that will make them happier and I don't think I'm really hurting anyone because people come and go and you can't really hurt someone who has no sentimental attachment to a stranger. Until I can figure out what's wrong with me I refrain myself from making any sort of relationships, I just wanted to get this off my chest because I feel I can never really have the amount of care and emotions others have and it's gotten very lonely and depressing.

It's about looks primarily and heavily. (But we already knew this.)
I've recently befriended this gorgeous woman, we are coworkers, and quickly bonded over LOTR and star wars. Super cool, super pretty and super sweet. Honestly my type. 
But we recently got a new man in the office, and he's the kind of guy that is every girls dream. 
Intense eyes, gorgeous smile, tall and nice build, luscious hair. (you get the picture, tall, dark and handsome).
And immediately, she fawns over him, hasn't even talked to him. And comes over to me and starts discussing how attractive he is, and how kind he looks. 

Fast forward to our Holiday Party. We are all at the same table and she's texting me about him, saying she wants to make a move on him, etc. 

I was doing some music for the party and she comes over to listen to me play, and he comes up and pulls up a chair for her to sit on, and walks away. IMMEDIATELY she's whispering ""oh my God he got a chair for me! He's so sweet and amazing!"" 

Today is the day after the party and everyone is texting photos to the group chat of the night before, and she texts in a photo of our table. 

Apparently he texts her from there, privately, and they've been planning to hang out and watch LOTR (which is something her and I also bonded on) and she sends the screenshots of their conversations bc she's all excited that they're talking, texting and planning to meet up...


This isn't the first time I've been on the sidelines watching this kind of thing happen. This doesn't happen for us ugly men. No women are whispering positive thing about us. The most women whisper is that we are ugly losers and laugh at us. 

No one is texting us from a mass group text to meet up with us. No one is secretly crushing on us wanting to get us into bed.

But this is just an example of how easy it is for normiés. This has all happened within a span of a week. 

And just because he was attractive. And the only ""personality"" he displayed was pulling up a chair for her. It's that easy when you're attractive I guess. 

I could slay a whole dragon for a woman's affection and she's still run away from me. I'll always be just a friend...never a boyfriend, or lover.

I would consider him as a best friend but we no longer talk to each other. Our falling out was caused by me. I failed to talk to him and started to indirectly distant myself. 

After working at my current job (fast food joint filled with hs and college students) for 2.5 years, I've finally started feeling more comfortable and social but not enough to be friends outside of work. During those 2.5 years, I was stuck in my mind and quietly observed others.

I'm at a point in my life where my lonliness is finally kicking in after numbing it for several years. 

I noticed that my younger sister() has several friends, a huge friend group that she talks to all of the time. And I'm jealous. My room is adjacent to hers and so I hear her and her friend laughing and spending time with each other. It's torture. I keep getting constant reminders that I have no friends from my sister and older brother (20M). 

I recently started seeing a therapist and concluded that I have childhood trauma from my parents.  Behavior being emotional neglect and abuse. I received constant comparison to random children, witnessed and recieved domestic and verbal abuse, watched my brother comtemplate suicide and go to the hospital for it, being told that I'm the black sheep of the family, having constant arguements with my dad, having the police called on me for getting mad, getting in trouble for things that I didn't do. But after all these years, it seems like I am the only one affected by my parents. Its not fair. Why am I the only person faced with this trauma. 

Why am I such a broken person. 

I want to live my life and be at peace. I don't want to feel unfulfilled nor be alone anymore. I want to be happy. I know suicide isn't the answer, I want to live my life.

I don't feel safe being alone with myself. I been with myself for too long. Can't I have someone to fill this ongoing emptiness? But I can't even enjoy being with others. I'm know I'm prone to being abused by others and not caring for my own wellbeing.

Sometimes I wish I could go back to a time where my smile, my laughs, and mood were more genuine and relaxed. But that's impossible. 

I yearn for a friendship where emotions are shared,  heart felt hugs are given, tears are shedded... anything.

I wish I could get hit in the head and forget the past. I can become a new person with no attachments to my parents, siblings, and whoever else in the past. Be unbothered and live in the present.",lonely,Why am I so broken compared to my siblings?,2021-12-13 12:56:15
3500,unvrsdheart,1639359407,1,"I'm just going to vent my frustration since I have no one else in life to tell. Maybe someone on Reddit will have fun with this idk.

at the start of last year i met a friend online and honestly didnt expect much of it. but we ended up talking every single day. i'd rush home from work excited to play games with her and for the first time i kind of felt what it was like to have someone of the opposite gender interested in you. i didn't take it seriously cause we were just friends but eventually i found out we literally live an hour away

for the first time i ended up leaving the house at 24 y/o to go hang out with a girl. it was probably the best days of my life so far. we hung out a few more times after that and it was amazing to me. i didn't have feelings for her other than a friend for the first few months but after meeting her in real life i developed big feelings and actually felt human for once. actually having my feelings returned for the first time in my life.

after like 7-8 months of being friends I asked her if she wanted to be something like serious. she turned me down and said we live too far away and she isn't ready for a relationship. fair i understand. but she would constantly treat me like a boyfriend. telling me ""I love you"", asking for me to sleep on the phone, showering me with picture of herself. But still refused to be together with me when I asked. So I just cut all contact with them for my own good..

It took be a good 6 months to get over them. I was finally content with them not being in my life anymore but I was so lonely after experiencing happiness for the first time.. Recently she decided to message me and said that she misses me and that she was lonely. I knew I shouldn't have replied but I'm so fucking lonely and still had a tiny bit left that loved her. we talked and I felt happy again. She would message me again at nights and tell me how alone she felt and I was stupidly there to help

Until she told me that she's literally""e-dating"" someone she met on Valorant ( the game I begged her to play with me and got her into a year ago ). After she rejected me because we live an hour away to find out she's now edating someone across the world feels so devastating. And why the fuck is she texting me alone and lonely go text you new bf that.

And the final stab in the heart was that she said she doesn't remember anything we used to do. she doesn't remember our trips to the stores or anything. And blamed it on her depression causing her to forget. so while I was there mopping and losing sleep for months none of the stuff we even did together mattered. It make me never want to pursue anyone ever again. I'm so lonely and emotionally drained because of this person..",lonely,heartbroken for the first time,2021-12-13 12:36:47

However, I think it must be said that many people just come here to vent about their deep longing and how they feel like no one will understand them or 'want' them. and I sympathize, I know that feeling too well.   
But the problem is when you get onto a sub where everyone is basically repeating the same toxic ideas ""I'm unloved"", ""I will never be loved"", ""I hate people"", ""I'm unlikeable"", ""No one wants me"" you're more likely to embed that in your mind even more. And it's not just the posts, when you go in the comments it's long comment threads all about how everyone thinks they're lonely or unloveable. This enforces the idea that owo certain people are just \*cursed\* to being lonely for whatever reason and they'll never outgrow it  


obviously, this isn't all posts, maybe not even most. but it's prominent for sure.

So here's my reminder to you that no you're not impossible to love, no you shouldn't hate people, no not everyone will hate you. even IF you are a terrible person  (which most of you aren't at all) you can change!!

3509,Flyaway_5,1639353999,1,"When I was in high school, I was in love with my 50-year-old teacher. We are both female. She consumed every space in my mind for almost 4 years. She was the only thing I thought about. Something about her attracted me, and I fell in love when she was nice to me and noticed me more, like always saying my name, smiling at me, giving me compliments, noticing I grew taller, bragging about dancing with me at the dances. I even thought she was a lesbian and was in love with me because of her interactions with me. I replayed different scenarios in my head, like my interactions with her in person, and also fantasies. I built this fantasy about her in my head, like we were together. I have never been in a relationship, been kissed, or had sex to remain faithful to her. I turned down guys and never dated anyone in high school, and even now.

I was so in love to the point where I could not stand being away from her for so long, and during the summer I did not know how I was going to survive without seeing her. So I purposely failed a class on purpose twice just so I could take a summer class, just so I could see her. And even during the summers when I didn't take a class, she was all I thought about for 3 months. I yearned for her. All I thought was when I will see her again. I was also very jealous. I know she was divorced and had kids. The thought of her kissing or having sex with somebody killed me. I wanted her all to myself. Every time I saw her interact with so many students right in front of me, it was very difficult for me to deal with and I couldn't handle it. She wasn't the only one this has happened to, this happened for a few others as well whom I was in love with but was never in a relationship with, and they were all women older than me.",lonely,Was this love or an obsession?,2021-12-13 11:06:39
3510,Some1inreallife,1639353412,1,"I've only had one girlfriend at 16-17 (I'm 22 now), and from that experience, along with my other current personality traits, I would be the boyfriend girls wish they never dated. 

Important context: At the time of dating her, I was on a medication (Keppra) to treat my epilepsy, but it also turned me into an emotional trainwreck. 

Even during that one relationship I had, she threw herself at me. She even gave me her number, held my hand, and my first kiss right before leaving. I felt nothing emotionally speaking. I recognized her face after seeing her several times, but I never knew her name even when we kissed. I wanted to trade girlfriends so badly. Which goes to show that I never loved her to begin with. Even as she was head over heels in love with me. I didn't breakup with her because at that moment, at least a girl actually had romantic feelings for me. So I only stayed because of how lonely I was. 

She said she'd never leave me. But she did. Even though I basically learned to love her, the way I lashed out at her one time effectively proved I never did. She didn't break up right away, but she eventually did. Even though I later got off that medication, it was still too late, the damage had already been done. 

Even today, I have bonding issues with women I think I'm actually interested in. Even if I like to think I'm bonding with her, some of it feels 75% artificial and 25% natural. So I'm basically pretending to bond with her more than I actually am. It's really bad because my reactions to her compliments/flirtatious touches and comments are weak. So she assumes that I'm not that interested even if I am. This also means I'm more likely to cheat on her even if we did get together. 

I'd also be so avoidant to all potential arguments as I don't want to upset her which would lead to me caving to her, even if I was in the right and she was wrong. 

I like to think I'm not a clingy guy, although there were a few moments where I definitely was clingy around women I'm interested. Thankfully, it wasn't worst case scenario clingy, I've seen worse examples from other people. Although to avoid this, I'll be too avoidant thus not giving myself the ability to express any feelings I may have towards her.

Finally, I think I'll be too emotional for her. Obviously, I'm not going to cry over something silly. But I might cry over a real emotional struggle I have. From what I've seen from actual relationships, men are given one cry pass in relationships. After that time they cry in front of their girlfriends, their crying is a red flag. Which means, I'll have to suppress my sadness just to get by in front of her. But eventually, I'll snap. And then she'll leave me. 

Any girls reading this, please avoid me like the plague. Even if we're both interested in each other, just know that these terrible weaknesses will ruin the relationship. Even though I am trying to better myself, these are my most difficult areas and ones I don't believe I'll ever perfect.",lonely,I feel like I would be a terrible boyfriend.

I've kinda always thought she's great and all but thought 'no, she's with someone, let's not go there' and moved on. Over the last couple of years, we got really close. I'd be the person she would come to with her broken relationship stuff as well her family imploding stuff. She knows I'm heavily depressed and sad and all (and tbh is the only person who knows about my daily fantasising about suicide).

Few days ago, she essentially tells me she has no idea if it's her imprinting or being sad but she has feelings for me and ends up telling me about it and how it's because I'm always there and make her feel safe while her fiancee is a moron. Here the fuckup begins. Instead of me saying 'nope, you're engaged', I go with it, thinking this is a good idea. 

She tells me she’ll give her fiancee until the end of the month and see what happens and if she wants to carry on with him.

Loneliness and the want to have someone who understands me takes over and I of course think this is legit. We meet up, talk a lot. And kiss. Not planned whatsoever. It just happened. This was all over the course of two days so super quick.

She messages her fiancee telling him there's someone else coming onto her and he needs to get back from his placement for the weekend to sort out their relationship. They sort it out and it's ended up bringing them closer and I feel like an absolute fool. 

She's the person I'd go to with stuff (much like Yang and Grey from Grey's Anatomy). We're still talking and 'friends', but it just feels so different. The blowback from calling off the engagement would've been horrible so I get why this is the way it is - but her telling me 'this is what I want, he makes me happy, it's not just obligation' ripped the heart out of me.

However, the problem isn't just not having a partner (by choice) but also not even having any friends.

So I don't  have anyone I can just talk to all the time or feel like I have a friend or friends that I can message at any time of the day and they will actually answer me-- no matter what the reason is.

I depend alot on friends to keep me from being completely lonely. I wish I can find more- but it's hard online because people usually just want to date, have a fwb, or just nudes sent.

When i was younger i thought that by now, i would have friends and be a lot happier than i was, i thought i’d have life experiences like being in a relationship or getting a job and figuring out what i wanna do with my life. unfortunately im nowhere near how i thought my life would be. I tried and waited for a better to come, but i’m not either always stuck or only getting worse.

3543,Throwowowowawayway,1639342765,1,"Hi everyone,

A couple of weeks ago I (23m) stayed at a hostel abroad for four nights, on my own. I had broken up a 3 year relationship two weeks earlier, and this trip was a way for me to get my mind off things for a bit. 

While there, I hung out quite a bit with a small group of volunteers from the hostel, with whom I got along well. One girl in particular I felt I had a good connection with. I thought we had similar personalities and senses of humor, and she was very affectionate towards me, offering hugs and sincere talks over tea etc. 

On the day I left, I almost didn't get a chance to see her to say goodbye, because she was away for the day. In the end, she waited for me in the city so that we could walk together a bit on my way to the bus home, which was lovely. I'm only including this to make it clear that it wasn't just me being an overly attached creep, and that there was reciprocity to it.

Anyway I left, and I texted her the next day to try and keep in touch. She answered and I did again, but then nothing for a few days, so I sent another text. She hasn't sent anything for ten days now, and I'm bummed because I was really looking forward to keeping in touch and maybe seeing each other again somewhere down the line. I've been thinking about it more than I'd like to admit, and wondering if I did or said something wrong. 

I know this whole thing may sound silly, but I've been feeling rather lonely because I recently moved to a new city and because of the breakup, and meeting the volunteers and her in particular was really comforting. 

I don't know what to make of all this, and I'd love to find more people to bond with but I'm not sure how and I'm kinda scared too.",lonely,Feeling lonely and stupidly obsessed after a trip,2021-12-13 07:59:25

If you are reading this, and think that I’ve got some of your attention so far, if you think that eyes can send a deeper messages than those with words, if you believe that a healthy amount of humor, wit, and chaaarm are totally okay to keep a conversation alive and prosperous, if you think a guy can still complement a woman on the way she thinks, talks, dresses, without having any other motives is still something normal and acceptable, and if you think that Adele is an over hyped singer (jk… don’t go off on me already), and lastly, if you can talk/chat beyond a basic hi or what’s up… then I want to get to know you and possibly be your new friend :)

He smiles everytime he sees at me. And it's very confusing- I didnt know what or how to feel, only that I liked the way I felt when I was around him. So yeah, I start to like this guy.

I know it doesnt seem like much of a deal, but it hurt like hell. Made me feel bad about myself, and then depression and anxiety got worst. I started to hide every feeling- good or bad. I just didnt want to get hurt again. Not by dates, not by friends, not by family. I didn't wanna feel any thing.

3562,1999till,1639335996,1,"
Hey everyone!

This is a super long story so I’m going to try to make it as short but potent as possible.


I’ve dated this girl a couple times off and on since 2018-2019.  Long story short the last time we broke up we didn’t take for 1 1/2 years almost 2 years.  We reunited at the beginning of this year as “friends” (I put that in quotations because we never really could do the friend thing because we were in love) but things never escalated and I kinda made it clear that I just wasn’t going to get carried away like we always do when we show up back in each other’s life and start dating again.

Now the reason we start talking again is because I randomly popped back up on Snapchat and kinda had a pretty big glow up since we split last.  I didn’t use social media when we were together so me coming back and posting things on my story was new and she saw that.  I wasn’t doing it to make her jealous I was just trying out social media again to see if I liked it.

I have a whole bunch of friends now.  My life was just way different from when we’re together and she saw that through my snap stories.  Everything was different.  To put it short I really glowed up and changed for the better.

Nothing really happened we start talking, nothing crazy really happens for a while but we do start talking kinda often.  

We talk about normal stuff but we start to flirt (she’s the one initiating it) but nothing crazy and this goes on from Jan-may 2021.

During this period we both let each other know that we still think about each other often and still care about each other.


Again, we talk casually, occasional flirt, nothing serious but there are periods of times where we talk every day.

One night she sends me unsolicited pics of her boobs.  They were censored but that was really far fetched to do that as she was seriously flirting with me.



At this point in time I was not trying to date her and still not but I do have feelings for her.  

Anyways, it was clear that she still had feelings for me but even still to this day my humility is telling me that there are other scenarios in this situation.  And that’s why I’m making this post.  There are so many perspectives on this situation that I need to know how other people feel about this.

To put it bluntly.  This person is not the healthiest person.  Very co dependent.  Doesn’t really have irl friends.  And has spent the past 3 years playing video games in her bedroom, with online friends she’s been very dependent on, especially one in particular that I will get to in a second.

Past 3 years she hasn’t done anything but played video games in her bedroom with her online friends, and focused on filling her loneliness with a couple relationships she’s been in after me. (They weren’t healthy and didn’t last long, just like ours but even worse). She did have a job tho.

SO, that one co dependent friendship I was talking about has ended this year.  She had been friends with this guy (they weren’t romantic) for a few years.  Pretty much ever since I knew her (2018). That friendship took a huge toll on her mental health and personal life.  He definitely manipulated her and abused her.  She was super co dependent on this guy.  She relied on him emotionally.  He even had an impact on our relationship and ultimately played on her vulnerability and convinced her to leave me.  (Which is whatever we needed to break up)

That friendship ended this year. And it killed her.  She was super depressed as she had no one really left.  He was the only person she had really gotten super close with in the past 3 years.  And btw she has a huge problem with loneliness and depression so this really fucked her up.

So NOW,
She’s depressed and invites me to hang out because she needs some company (which is fine nothing wrong with that, but kinda lame because there are politics between us)


She vents about everything that’s going on in her life.  No friends IRL, no life,  lonely, depressed, been crying all day, etc.  in this conversation she casually drops the bomb that she has been talking to this guy online. (Which is fine, nothing wrong with that)
This guys is across the country, we live in Southern California.

Mind you, she has been flirting with me for the past few months and has sent lewd pics to me of her breasts and what not.  Not only that she just got out of a co dependent relationship and is now using this new guy to vent about that previous toxic relationship.

Also this same day she got a really short haircut and this haircut is something we talked about when we dated in the past.  She literally got the same exact haircut I told her she would look beautiful in like 2 years ago.

So here she is, she’s having this quarter life crisis.  She’s leaving toxic online friendship, she’s been flirting with me for the past few months and now she’s talking to this guy online.  She hasn’t had any direction in her life at all since I’ve known her.  Met her when she was like 20 now she’s 24.

It felt so real I woke up I had to stop my self from texting her something.

It’s been 4 months and I thought I was finally over her.

In that 4 months I reflected on the relationship as a whole and it wasn’t perfect. She is very introverted and has other mental health issues and she always needed time for herself to recharge.

I respected that but the cost of it was well we didn’t really see eachother in person as much as I’d like. Tbh a lot of our relationship was digital. At the time it didn’t bother me cause I was just so happy and finally content that I had a friend a confidant I could share my time and love with.

But I never did a traditional date either.

I always had put aside money for dinners, movies, conventions. Not that I’m not grateful for the time we did spend in person.

I dunno I just feel like shit like my day feels ruined. It’s my day off and I wanted to go to the movies today cause I finally got my Christmas shopping done just put down my first car payment

I always think that a need to fix things in my life (shed some pounds, gain some friends) before I can think about being active on dating apps, and of course I’m NEVER in a position where I feel confident about taking that step!

Anyway, a couple of days ago, I get an alert that someone likes me, and I look and it’s someone that I had noticed (and had thought if I was ever ‘ready’ I’d definitely be interested - same age, similar interests and music tastes), but then I though OK, maybe I should take the plunge, so I indicated that I liked her back. 

Since then we’ve exchanged a few messages, and now I’m feeling really scared.

I do really want to give dating a whirl with the hope of finding someone special, but I’m scared that I’m too awkward, that I’ve got no friends, that I’m overweight. It just feels insurmountable at times. Aside from that, from her profile - I’d be punching above my weight!

I rarely have any interest from anyone (but to be fair, I don’t really put myself out there). There’s been times when I haven’t acted and let chances pass me by. On one occasion I ended up ghosting someone because it was reaching a point when we’d soon need to meet up, and I thought that I’d be such a dreadful disappointment. That was the last time anyone showed any interest in me and we’re talking 7-8 years ago.

3597,im_just_trying123,1639324132,1,"There is a theory of human personality in psychology known as the Big Five personality model.

The theory centers around a simple fact: 
When you aggregate a series of random personal questions like ""are you outgoing"", ""do you feel like crying when other people are crying"", what you observe is a statistical correlation between various clusters of questions.

For example, people who answer strongly agree to ""I am very tidy"" are more likely to answer agree/strongly agree to ""I always double and triple check my work for mistakes"".

These questions that cluster together, such that they indicate a particular behavioral axis (fancy term for the a set of gestures that a person is strongly predisposed towards or against) are then given a simple label like ""orderliness"".

You can then produce a test that is designed to target a particular cluster and give the test to a statistically reliable sample of the population and what you get is a spectrum of human personality, which is measured with percentiles.

For example, you can be in the 70th percentile for ""trait"" orderliness. Which means that when contrasted to the general population, your self-report indicates that you have a greater proclivity towards orderly behavior (tidying your room, following a method, double-triple checking your work, being precise and not tolerating mistakes, being efficient and quick in your work, etc) than 69% of people.


The Big Five is just one reliable model for testing human personality.

One of the facets of the big is trait neuroticism.

Trait neuroticism measures the proclivity a person has towards feeling negative emotions.

It turns out that some people feel more negative emotions than others according to their self-reports. 

People who are high in trait share certain features.

1. They catastrophize when presented with trivial obstacles. 

For example, if they need to head to a physical location but are suddenly lost, they may simply panic as opposed to pivoting and asking around.

2. The are moody.

They will recall a bad memory and remain angry/sad about it for no good reason.

3. They are sensitive to judgement. 

They will ruminate anxiously over what it is that people will think about their hairstyle or clothing.

4. They avoid the risk of social/physical harm.

People who are high in trait neuroticism would avoid going out in harsh weather or risk asking someone on a date because they struggle with anxiety.

5. They have poor willpower.

People high in trait neuroticism are more likely to engage in immoderate behaviors. 

For example, smoking 3 packs of cigarettes or eating 4 plates of rice. 

People high in trait neuroticism require excess in their moments of relaxation to feel any satisfaction.

6. They have a poor attention span.

People high in trait neuroticism are easily stressed when presented with intellectual information or long sequences of data (like a 200 page book).

7. They are self-critical and sensitive to self-doubt.

People high in trait neuroticism are very easily discouraged and will actively avoid risk. They will also feel inferior to others and internally degrade themselves.

8. This is the crucial bit. They are sensitive to loneliness.



Yes. It's quite possible that all of us are simply high in trait neuroticism. Which means that we are simply more likely to suffer from loneliness than other people.

3611,GingerAsp,1639314190,1,"Hey,

I am new here (original, I no ) I am 33M living in the UK. I have been lonely most of my life until I had friends met them in my late teen (19 years ish) was working met the loce of my life we where married on our 5th anniversary and divorced by the time we hit our 5th wedding anniversary.

When the marriage ended I lost my friends and I lost a lot of family. I had to move back to my parents, lost my job, lost all sense of me. Lost the will to live (failed attempt). 2 years passed from that and I met someone so last Xmas was wonderful until certain realisations set in and that went down the Bog.

But I felt happy for a few months, then after close to 3 years not working I got my self a morning job, that has turned into a different job now but still happy with that and the socialness that brings me whilst I am working and serving customers.

But yet I am still lonely. I class my self as a gamer but I have no one to plat with and trying to find a group often leaves me to not bother and try and solo instead.

I am starting to ramble and trying to get to a point.

I think my Point is I am just looking for other people M or F just to have a chat with maybe join up for some Gaming (xbox1). Sometimes just having some1 to message on any type of platform is helpful.

I didnot talk to a lot of people and I was quite comfortable in doing that and never felt lonely. I rarely talked with girls as they mostly wouldnt talk to me because I looked bad (had developed a lot of abscess on my whole body as a side effect of my treatment of a disease). I thought things would change eventually but due to conservative nature of my family somehow I developed social anxiety and never went out.

Now I am in my 20s and just sitting in my room for all day long. Not able to concentrate on anything. Just feeling lonely no one to talk to and nobody to share feelings with. I just dont feel comfortable going to interact with some of my old friends to as it feels bad to shed a lot of emotions on them and make them low.

I had to move back to my country and  I'm just not able to make any friends here. I dont have any old friends here and never had a very good relationship with my family. I visit them sometimes, but to me they are not people I could trust or confide in.
I thought I would be able to meet new people at work, and I did, but I can tell that they wont be more than just work colleagues. 
I never had a boyfriend and now that I'm 33years old I've gotten very used to being alone and I'm not sure I could handle having a boyfriend in my life, but since I never had a loving relationship with my parents I'm really desperate to at least once experience love in my life. But I'm very self-concious, have a low self esteem, and weight issues which also hold me back. Corona obviously isnt making the whole situation better either. I first thought I'm gonna be ok living here since I will be able to at least go visit all my friends and enjoy life during my holidays, but its almost been 2 years now that I havent been able to meet anyone and I'm falling apart.I feel like corona is taking away from me the last few years that I would have been able to go out, party, and have fun. I already always had to limit myself to living the way I want to to when I was abroad with my friends, because I'm just not the same person here in my country compared to when I'm somewhere else. Not sure if it also has to do with the fact that I have to change languages and english makes it easier for me to express my feelings. I'm still very bad at it, but I can at least somehow express them. Wouldnt be able to do that in my mother tongue, maybe because of my upbringing where feelings wouldnt be talked about, so I had to learn how to do that when I was far away from where I grew up.
The loneliness really starts to physically hurt and I started eating uncontrollably again to fill the emptiness inside of me, which, of course, isnt very helpful for my mental state either.

Many months pass and I got sick of being accused of being a “home wrecker” so I ghost all my friends, including her, she reaches out weeks later furious because I’ve been ignoring her but all I told her was that I “needed some me-time”. Recently she broke up with her boyfriend while I was away on a trip in México visiting family, from which I had to try to comfort her the best I could through text, some days go by and when Im reassuring her that it was his loss for breaking up with her, she says “I love you”… nothing else, just that, but she has never been the type of girl to say I love you to anyone except her mom, not even to her other boyfriends did I ever hear her say “I love you”, I responded “I love you too” but in a manner that seemed on the topic of reassuring her, but all the responded with was “thanks” and then left me on read for several days. I had bought some gift for her (handmade things like artesanal shirts and some other stuff) and when I came back from my trip, a couple days later I went over to her house to give her the gifts, I really wanted to get out the car and hug her as she came out of her house but i felt that she would have taken it the wrong way and I still have no clue how she felt about me, when she got into the car she said she had missed me so much, gave me a big hug, and almost started crying from her excitement, we spent the rest of they day hanging out with her friend and the place she works at and I enjoyed every second of just being at the same table as her.

I know her well enough to know her type (tall, skinny white boys who are borderline white trash but still funny enough to hang around with) but the only thing I got going for me is that I’m tall (6’4) an somewhat funny… any advice??",lonely,“Girl problems/boy bf dilemma”,2021-12-12 19:08:46

I see all these couples out and among my friends and when I see how much they love each other I always wonder why my first SO didn't love me like that.

I want to cut off this part of my brain that I can't control, I hate what it does to me.

3654,SingleLonelyGuy,1639294593,1,"So, I barely get a few responses / interests on my dating posts and those leave within three days. No matches on dating apps.

Since I have been trying to find relationship since long, i have talked to atleast a hundred women so far. And these are the statistics of reasons why it didn't work out. In most cases, we discovered we are not a good match and ended on a good note. 

1) **my career issues - 30 %**

This one's on me. I realize I need to work on myself and love myself before someone else can love me. I understand most women want a well settled ambitious man. So it's fine if I don't meet their requirements but it would be nice if they tell me explicitly that they are not interested due to this very reason.  I'm passionate and ambitious. Just need direction, guidance and support. I want to get settled in a long term relationship before I start to actively focus on the professional aspect of my life. 

2) **misunderstanding. Miscommunications. Them getting offended due to my bluntness &amp; straightforwardness - 20 %**

How do I get the facts across honestly? Gotta bring to light the bitter truths and harsh realities so we can work out the practicalities of the relation. 

3) **looks - 10% probably**

People are too polite to say on my face if they find me unattractive/ugly. But I'd prefer that frankly. 

4) **incompatibilities like preference towards kids(even though I'm flexible as per my partner's wants) , sexual aspects - 10 %**

It's crazy really how the most minor of things can actually be something that turns off the other person. These are some cases that caused these women to lose interest. 

- Like I just said I'm attracted more to western fashion than traditional Indian apparels, but I'm fine with whatever she wishes to wear. 

- I chose to reduce/eliminate my consumption of non vegetarian, but I am totally fine with whatever she wishes to eat 

- I don't want to waste my personal time on gaming, it's too addictive and I definitely don't want to spend money on it. But I have no issues with her gaming. 



5) **unknown reasons - 30%**

Sometimes people stop replying due to mysterious causes. Could be their mental health issues or maybe they found a person already or they neither want to breakup with me nor in a position to move forward because their interactions are going strong with another person. So they just leave me on seenzone.

It's more like a vent but I'm open to advices. I'm just losing hoping of finding my soul mate, even though I'm open to her being from any country (I'm from India) and plus minus 7 years from my age. Not much into looks either as long as there's sufficient attraction.",lonely,I'm 26M. A vent on how hard the partner search process is. And it gets pretty lonely without love.,2021-12-12 18:36:33

3661,Gh05t1yWasTaken,1639292209,1,"About 2 months ago I got into a really good and healthy relationship, or so I thought. Trigger warning now there is mention of suicide and self harm. The relationship started when I asked a boy from my school out and he said yes, so for about 2 weeks everything was going fine and then he went to a mental hospital and I didn’t see him for 3 weeks and had a hard time taking care of myself because I relied on him at the time for mental stabilization. So when he came back you can imagine how excited I was to see that he was ok and that hopefully he wouldn’t do anything again because now he was supposedly better. So a day after our 1 month he told me he didn’t wanna be in a relationship because he needed time to focus on himself and his mental health. So I was really sad and a little confused. I never really knew why he went to the mental hospital but I found out later that he tried to OD and failed. Hearing that crushed me, it made me feel like I wasn’t enough of a reason for someone to stay alive. When he broke up with me it made my sadness worse. The day of the breakup I took a ruler shard and scratched my wrists and arm up. So about 2 weeks ago I found out he was dating someone else after telling me he needed to focus on himself and his mental health and that hurt so so bad. I asked him why he lied to me and he said that our relationship just didn’t feel right and never really went into specifics of why. Ever since that breakup I’ve tried different things. I took up multiple hobbies and even started dating someone else and it didn’t help. Ever since then I keep hearing about him and his new boyfriend and Jesus Christ does it hurt.

3667,dreadlobo,1639289562,1,"There are people who will want to take advantage of your loneliness. Be careful out there. This is my cautionary tale:

Recently, I read a post from a guy looking for friends and possibly more on /foreveralonedating. Checked his profile and saw that he actively wrote  encouraging and supportive comments to people on /lonely /alone /makingfriends. He also made posts of his own looking for connections and even venting.

In his posts he claimed that he didn't have anyone to chat with, he wanted someone to talk to daily, and that, whenever he met new people, they often became excited, but soon they'd get bored and quickly toss him aside like a toy. I felt that...  and I decided to message him out on a whim.

He messaged back! From my POV we had clicked, and things were going smoothly. Talked constantly for some days, and not a single red flag in sight. In fact, it was all going so well that I actually started caring for this guy and was looking forward to a meaningful friendship perhaps even a relationship (if somehow I got extremely lucky).

Then, all of the sudden he brings up that he was going through a tough situation and that he needed some economic support. He asked if I'd be willing to help him out with cash in exchange for nudes. I let him know that I could possibly help him although the nudes weren't necessary. He insisted and I agreed solely because I thought that maybe in his mind he couldn't accept it for free, but by giving me something in return he could feel like he had earned it.

After some inconveniences, I was able to send him money via PayPal (a double digit number, nothing too meaningful). He sent me two photos. We chatted for a bit that day, then exchanged like 10 lines of conversation on the following. But, then he didn't message me the following day nor the day after.

He came back about 5 later to excuse himself claiming he was busy with work. We exchanged less than 10 lines on the following day as well, and that was the last I heard from him.

If you're wondering where he might be... well, he's back on Reddit leaving supportive messages and  looking for friends to drown his 'loneliness': I know this because I came across one of his posts which prompted me to check his profile out one last time.

You might think that it was extremely naive of me to send funds to someone I had just met (and I agree with you), but he played me so well that I would have felt terrible if I had not helped a friend in need having the means of doing so. When you're lonely and someone that can fake kindness, interest, and rapport comes along, you fall. You fall hard. I was engulfed in all the attention that he was giving me, and I thought that for once I had found a friend. You see, not once did I get the feeling that he was going to cast me aside as soon as I wired him the stuff.


Honestly, I don't know if that's something he regularly does, or if it was a one time thing given he was able to tell that I'm a person who can be easily take advantage of if you can appeal to my emotions.


Nonetheless, I don't care about the money. What I do care for is my trust in people... it goes to show that not in a safe haven like this can we be truly free from manipulative individuals seeking benefit at the expense of others.

Don't be stupid like me.DO NOT BYPASS YOUR COMMON SENSE! If it's to good to be true, it most likely is.

When I go to work I get to watch couples come in, sometimes holding hands -- a brutal reminder of what I can't ever have. Something people like us can never have. 


I used to use porn to give me **SOME** semblance of dopamine for just a fleeting moment -- that doesn't work anymore. Nowadays if I try, I'm reminded of the impossibility of this happening in real life. I'm reminded that if the girl that took her clothes off in that video knew a guy like me was on the other end watching her, she probably never would've posted it in the first place.


I've all but given up on the possibility of meeting someone. The very thought of it is beyond my comprehension at this point - and with every passing day it just gets worse and worse. It's taken such a toll on my somehow still beating heart. Maybe I'm being melodramatic. It just feels slightly better to be able to write all this shit down and post it to the three people that might read it.

3699,Craterkhan,1639280906,1,"20yr old fit male here. Ive always struggled with depression throughout my whole life. Now though its reached a head. My family has always been really poor and as such the money I make working goes to supporting my family, as such little is left for me. When I was 18 I found a girl who 'liked' me despite my quirks. However over the course of 2 years with her, I let her abuse me physically and emotionally as I couldn't necessarily argue against her due to my status. I finally broke up with her a few months ago after I found out she cheated on me 3 times over the course of our relationship and it ledt my self-confidence and physical worth destroyed.

Now that Im semi-recovered though from that ordeal its gotten worse. Without much money to my name (I do my best for my 10 year old little brother taking care of him and cooking his meals) I haven't been able to purchase a car or go to college. If that didn't hurt my already fragile self-esteem enough, I am of Syrian descent and its easily visible. Today I got called a pedophile simply because I 'looked like I would be one' by a middle aged woman due to my baldness, yet if I grow my hair out to normal I get called a terrorist. All would be well and good if my family actually cared about me, but I live under my moms roof and she does not take medicine for her bipolar disorder, therefore im subject to random outbursts of rage and degredation.

Thus I feel like, apart from that one girl who had no redeeming aspects as it turns out, I can't advance myself socially at all. The friends ive made in highschool have become distant so the only friends I have left is you guys online. I really dont know what to do with myself rn. I want to be able to start my own life up and be happy about moving into my 20's but its just been a hellish downhill road. Things were OK when I was younger, but not anymore.

3704,glass1algae,1639278697,1,"i just don't know what i'm doing at this point. i never really did to be honest, i was just living day by day with no plan, no direction. 

wake up, work, shower, sleep

that was the general consensus, trying to make friends through work, meeting up with my one close friend &amp; fwb when he had time. once a week, or two weeks.

but now i'm living an hour from the town that i had called home for the past five years, no car, trying to transfer with my job.

i am really lucky that my sister loves me and had room for me in her house, even temporarily, but this situation is temporary, undoubtedly. the ways that we live our lives are very different. the biggest factors being that her and her husband have custody of two kids at the moment, and that they are very religious and structure many things around this; i am an atheist and would even go as far to say that i am anti-abrahamic religions, not to say that i don't believe in freedom of religion.

this wouldn't be too much of a problem, aside from the fact that i really don't eat in front of the kids because they'll ask me why i'm not praying (had that happen before), except for the fact that i am both gay/bisexual (hideable) and transgender (less hideable.)

i actually just started testosterone about three and a half months ago. i was pretty much in the middle of figuring out myself out especially in terms of how i present myself. my voice has just started deepening.

and all of a sudden i just kind of have to let go of that. it's so frustrating. my testosterone is literally in a bag in my room, and i just have to... leave it. i was about to get my hair cut again, which is another big part of presentation, and i had to cancel that appointment over this whole scenario and i'm not sure when i'm going to even do that among all the other shit i have going on, but i really am not keen on growing my hair out any more than it's already grown.

i'm already losing the sense of self that i've been building. when they say my deadname it's hard to respond; that's not me. i want to correct them when i am called she, or a girl or a woman or anything inherently female. it's an internal struggle.

they don't even seem to believe in the concept of friends... 

the friend i mentioned earlier, he goes to college in a town that was just 25 mins out from where i used to live, but his parents actually live in the same town as my sister. he's coming back for break this week, but talking to them about being able to see him is already so strained. i didn't even mention him coming in the house, which wasn't my intention, but my sister was already hesitant to say whether or not he could pick me up.

i need friends. sorry to them, but blood isn't always thicker than water. we still have issues. i can't be here 24/7 (unless i'm working). i can't have only my family. that has never resulted in good for me.

i'm just so anxious. i've been put off from seeing a therapist before by her husband, but now more than ever do i need one and to get back on meds. i'm almost inclined to just start taking my antidepressants again even though i know that isn't entirely safe.

i'm lonely, and sad, su**idal, lost.

Being a smart and introverted boy, I was the perfect target for frustrated boys that needed to bully someone.  My mum tried to kill herself a few times when I was young, due to childhood trauma.  With age, she has become a very loving mum - but when I was younger, she had to fight her own demons.  I could escape my world by studying, and enjoyed math, greek, latin.  During my teenage years, I had always a crush - but none of them has ever been answered.  As a young adolescent studying at university, I got it really bad.. with a crush which took me 5 years to get over it.  I found myself standing on a bridge, crying, considering to make an end to all my suffering, after I once went to the girl's place - finding her in the arms of a guy kissing.  I didn't.  I wrote a lot in these years, to recognize recurrent patterns where I got stuck. I found I was stuck again - and tried to find a way out. I started to read about Zen/Buddhism/Yoga, considering that my longing is the root cause of suffering.  The desire came forth from an emptiness inside me.  Each time I learned a nice girl I thought I could make a meaningful connection with, there was my own emptiness causing a strong desire, scaring the girl away.  Years later, not much has changed.  I met very interesting girls past two years.  All of them had Uni degrees and could easily win a beauty contest.  They came into my life by fate - and then I worked hard to get closer to them, but then..  I start to get consumed by a strong longing, which makes me emotional unstable and scaring them away.

3749,Greenmind76,1639265255,1,"My situation is this...  In 2018, I met the most amazing girl.  She was significantly younger than me but we had an immediate sexual and emotional chemistry I can't explain.  We met in July and a few months later I moved to her city...and a month after that we were living together.  When I met her I was unemployed (no opportunities in my city) and broke.  She was 21, I was 42.  A month after moving to her I had a job making $60k a year...  A week or two later I got a better job making $74k.  The money was never important to her.  She never asked for anything...

When she graduated from college she told me she needed some time to live alone and to grow...but she could never find a job that would allow it.  We continued to live together and had a pretty amazing life.  We would travel and go out...  Eventually I got a new job making $100k but it was incredibly taxing, keeping me busy all hours of the night and really restricting our travel...it sucked.

The covid came into the picture...We both started working from home and spent almost 24/7 together.  We didn't go out much because everything was closed down.  Our lives were pretty much just a boring and sometimes toxic routine.  I became obsessed with covid, politics, and all the other crap going on in 2020 and just wasn't any fun but things felt solid.  I bought a house to live in with her and it was good, but in her mind she still wanted to be alone and ""grow up"".  She had never lived by herself.  She went away on vacation with friends and came back to say she still needed to experience that before committing to me long term.  

She started looking for a job and eventually found one in a city 2 hours away.  We spent the weeks leading up to it in stressful but understandable anxiety of the change and what it meant for us.  We started having sex daily again and really just enjoyed the time.  

On the 5th of December she took all of her stuff and moved.  On the 6th I started a new job making a lot more money that was fully remote (I can live literally anywhere) but when I asked her about coming with her she said she still needed time alone without me there.  She didn't want to have me to fall back on.  I understand her and have been patient.  She really does need to grow and having me to fall back on made it so she never had to.  

Since then we haven't really been speaking too much because it would make us both sad and cause the adjustment to the change to be even more difficult.  She's planning to go with me to my parent's place for Christmas but I doubt I'll see her before then (but maybe)... so right now I'm just focused on myself, exercising, reading, and focused on the new job.  It's all I can do.

I don't need anyone to give me hard love.  I get that enough from others in my life who never understood our relationship.  I don't need anyone to tell me she's using me or that she doesn't love me.  She had 3 years to do that and gave it up to be her own woman and I respect and love her for that.  I truly believe she loves me since she's leaving when things are at their best (for me) and the opportunities for her career just don't exist.  I feel like the connection we have is strong enough but daaaaaamn it's been tough for the last week.  I wake up alone, work all day alone, spending the evening alone, and go to bed alone.  I have nobody to talk to when she's busy which is a lot of the time.  I know there are a lot of factors involved that are working against us but I also believe in trusting her and the universe will give the right results, regardless of if they're what I want.  I'm going to sell my house soon, mostly because the market is crazy good for selling and then in a month or so I will either move to her city, move to another state, or leave the country.  No lease, just Airbnb or short term stays...  Basically travel and find myself again.  We both kinda got lost in each other over covid.

Please just give me some good vibes, encouragement...and help me not feel alone and hopeless.  I'm not going to do anything to make her try to come back.  I'm going to focus on myself, support her efforts to grow, and be a better lover/man for whatever/whoever is next, be it her or anyone else.",lonely,Need encouragement and/or someone to talk to,2021-12-12 10:27:35

Now, I'm just walking around the city bored on the weekend, lonely as fuck. I wander around and look at girls and think, wow she is beautiful, oh wow look at her style, etc. 

Went to a flee market where people were selling their clothes and there were so many cute girls, there was a DJ and food.

But I can't just go up to one of them and tell them that I like them and ask them to hang out? Or can I?

I always have to think about this scene in one of my fav movies ""Hitch"" where this is mentioned exactly: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQTRXTVAxWw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQTRXTVAxWw)

Actually, I should just do that. But I just don't have the balls to do that right now, and that's normal, considering that I'm a 25 y/old virgin.

It shouldn't be this hard, right? And if someone is mentioning ""dating apps"" one more time, I'm gonna throw up. I did everything to be successful on them, but it seems like the universe has shadow-banned me on all those apps. I'm fairly good/average looking and active. It doesn't make sense.

I feel like college and work are the only places where you can make a real connection with someone, as you already have mutual interests. My college time was crap and then there was covid. I met some girls at work, but I won't ask them out at the coffee machine. Or should I? It shouldn't be this hard wtffff",lonely,It shouldn't be this hard. (m/25),2021-12-12 06:07:21

I have died in 2007 and that is the truth, what mattered most died in 2007.

Now in 2021 i'm still on autopilot,what changed is i have a job working 3 years now job that i've gotten in 2018 but it's very low payout so it's like not a job at all - no decent money = no decent life. There are no people in my life and you know why? dead people have no friends the living dead have no friends or lovers they're just dead.

So i'm writing this reddit post from the perspective of a zombie. I am the living dead and most loners or lonely people are as well. You died a long time ago now it's just patterns,autopilot, routines just to keep the body alive because of the instinct of survival.

Do you believe you are a empty husk,a zombie or do you still lie to yourself that one day you won't be lonely anymore?",lonely,The Living Dead,2021-12-12 00:00:13

To add some context, I’m in university where I have a roommate, a club that I regularly attend, classes, and a couple online friends that I knew from high school.

I feel like I’m stuck in this loneliness and I never have meaningful conversations with anyone. I talk to my roommate maybe once a week just about basic things like class. I talk with the people in my club about the topic of the club, and other small talk. And finally I really don’t talk to people in my classes. 

It’s very frustrating, because everyone around me already has friend groups, so I don’t want to inject myself into them, and it feels like I’m just existing through life without making connections.

Id love to have a romantic relationship, but literally nothing has come my way. I do know that doesnt just come instantly. What hurts is Im nearly 30 and Ive had 1 long distance relationship, ended when she got married to someone else after we stopped talking, and a handful of any kind of sexual/romantic encounters at best. I guess i dont know how to date or engage very well? 

I always hear you'll find someone eventually, but what if eventually never comes? Then i just die sad and alone. It cant just be that my relationship luck has been this bad, i must be doing something wrong but i cant figure out what. Maybe i come on a bit strong? (not 'lets get married on the first date' strong, i think i just show more interest early on) but im not sure how to seem 'confident' as i hear women like confident men. And I havent found a therapist that has helped with this issue either. And i feel like its not a physical thing, as i like to think im okay looking and i generally take care of myself (good hygiene, normal diet, etc). I just dont even know where to start trying to figure out what im doing.

As a note, dating apps have been awful for me, im lucky if i get any matches that arent bots or instagram models, let alone an actual response, so that really hurts my confidence even more.

I asked God for a cat, I went to a vet but didn't like any cat
Until 2 weeks ago there is a very calm and nice cat that came to me in my work place, he wanted to spent time with me, then he came to me one day Hurt so I took him home with me in order to get him to the vet, yes it's a street cat but he's so different I swear, anyway he is totally healed now and today is his 6th day with me

Now the thing is

I always knew that I only wanted a hug in order to heal this pain inside my chest
A hug that my father and mother never gave to me and I always needed
All I can say now a hug from a lover
When I hugged this cat for the first time today, I felt something in my chest, in that pain, but it wasn't enough, but it was good and I cried,
I got this cat to heal him and put him on the list for adoption
Now I don't know, I feel like I got used to being alone and that's how it is should be, and sometimes I think this cat is my best friend, sometimes I feel like I want space from this cat, sometimes I cry ( btw last time I cried was year and half ago, so it means a lot when I do it),  I feel something is wrong with me and this cat might affect my life goals and achievements ( yeh I'm achieving things in my life and I'm making good money to live) 

So should i keep him or no I should make him leave and wait for something else to happen one day

I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth.

3856,eveel0ra,1639205124,1,"i go down this self destructive path a lot. this week i’ve lost more people than i can count. i destroy my friendships almost on purpose and i don’t know why. this week two of my close friends fucked me over and showed me their true colours. after that i went on a war path, i deleted all my friends and my social media, blocked all of them, and actually started the process of moving schools. i had two close friends, one i blocked for just asking if i needed help or if i was good, so i basically said fuck off why would i need ur help i don’t need anyone. other friend was a girl i’ve known for years, she hasn’t been showing effort into our friendship and i realized today it made me break down so i went off on her and blocked her. 

I don’t know why i did that honestly, i think maybe if i find excuses to push everyone away and be lonely i’ll feel more secure and like i won’t get stabbed in the back one day. hurt them before they hurt u kinda thing. it also makes me feel guilty cause i know i can be hurtful doing that and leave ppl upset as well. i push ppl away all the damn time, and then i cry when i realize i have no friends no one to talk to hangout with or socialize with. i isolate myself so much then get mad at the outcome. i wish i just had one genuine friend who cared about me, a friendship i could lean on. i don’t know who’s fake or who’s genuine anymore.

3861,KingVaginalongcorn,1639202526,1,"Lately I’ve been so lonely and sad. The situation with my life is very stressful and quite hard on me. I never realized that I have been keeping things to myself so much that it just exploded. I felt like wanting to disappear. I don’t want to die, but I just want to disappear from all of this. Never before have I felt so weak. I don’t know how to heal myself because I was so overwhelmed with stress from life and studying. I couldn’t rely in anyone because everyone around me just want to point out all my flaws and tell me WHAT I should do. I know that they have good intentions but I already do that to myself all the time. I always feel very disappointed with myself when I realize that I cannot be the person I aspire to be. Sometimes life is just hard. Sometimes you just need a good listener, you know? But all of my life nobody have listened to me. I had a pretty shitty childhood. I was the odds one out. People made fun of my insecurities and tell me “come one man it’s a joke” and I never liked it. I am very anxious with relationships. When I befriend someone I don’t want to lose them. That’s why sometimes I think I care too much. But when I need people to listen to me, they can’t stop for one damn second to speak. 

Yesterday, my friends who I used to be very close in high school asked me whether I was okay since I was acting weird. One of them was nice to me, he was a very good listener and very empathetic. But the other guy, he just kept arguing with me like “Why, why don’t you think this way?” “Why don’t you do this?” “Why don’t you do that?” 

Gosh don’t you think I fucking know? I know about my shortcomings and stupid insecurities. But not everyone is born the same way. I have a past that had shaped me into becoming a person like this. I had shitty parents and shitty friends. I don’t want to blame them but I cannot say that they didn’t play any role in my upbringing. I hate it when people tell me what to do in a way that is so damn condescending. I know it’s my fault. I just need someone to listen to me. 

I felt a little hurt by that. 

I know I’m weak, sorry for being ME. 

Nevertheless, I am grateful for the other guy who was very empathetic and understanding. But at the same time I am still very sad.",lonely,Sometimes all you need is someone to listen to you and that’s it.,2021-12-11 17:02:06

Only difference is now I have one semester left of school and after that I can move to a new city, that's literally the only thing that keeps me going.

It's weird, because we've only met a few times, but she made me feel like I belong. She's younger than me a few years, I'm 29 and she's 22, but it felt right. We had common interests, we would talk for hours about random stuff, I could discuss anything with her. And out of the blue, after a shitty demonstration of my insecurities, she decided that we shouldn't talk anymore. Now I'm back to where I've always been. I'm alone. I have no one to even talk to. Depression is already back, even though it's only been 3 days.

Tonight, a few friends came over to have a birthday party and I had some fun, but at the end, I was alone among them. I'm just around, but I don't really matter. I miss her already, I just wanna text her. They're all gone by now, my roommates went to get the girls home and I chose to stay. Alone. The silence is deafening, only a few bugs to keep company alongside a few passing cars.

Will it ever go away? Will this loneliness ever be a memory instead of a reality? Am I bound to live on this dark silence, pretending to belong? She wasn't around for too long, but that was enough to show me how life without this crippling loneliness feels.

I can't get her back, I tried. She thinks I tried to play her, but I think I was just trying to love her, after all. I can't handle being broken again, so I'm fighting it, I'm fighting for my life again.

I have a simple question for you.. would you like to be friends? I am not talking about the type of friends who talk very little and make small talk and it never goes anywhere. I am talking about a friend who will send random pictures or facts at 3am just to try to make you smile. I am talking about the type of friend who can talk for hours about nonsense and debate about just random stuff. 

ex: Is cereal considered a soup? or Strap on spelled backwards is no parts

I just have a whole bunch of useless dad jokes and shower thoughts flooding my mind, so why not share them?

I want to grow the type of friendship where we can be ourselves no matter how awkward or weird we are. 

pssst.. I am awkward and weird... just saying.

I guess what I am trying to get at is I am just trying to make a friend who will accept me for me and just someone to be goofy with and talk nonsense with... maybe someone who also plays games and likes horror and conspiracy theories (that would be a plus and bonus)  Also would like it if you were in the US just because time zones are a pain. 

Disclaimer: I do have social anxiety and other mental health problems that kind of get in the way of the whole being social thing, but I try my best. 

If ANY of this sounds interesting you're welcome to add me on my discord (it's on my profile) or just send me a message here to see if we click. If none of this interests you then.. Sorry?

i think as it’s been a while i’ve just started to grow lonelier and lonelier. i get the sick feeling in my stomach of nausea- as jean paul sartre likes to state. i have friends, for sure- i’m extremely grateful for them. but it’s not quite the same. i feel like there’s people all around me but i somehow still feel lonely. i want to be able to share my days with someone, or crazy stories, or make someone smile. 

i like to help people, it gives me a purpose. i think in most of my relationships in the past i’ve picked people who need help or are a bit lost in life. my mom calls it wounded bird syndrome. i find the most broken people and try and help them.

The friends I've worked so hard to make over net keep getting smaller each day. I came to reddit in October to try and escape my loneliness, but that's the only consistent force in my life. It's always the same people claim they want me around, but if they can't find anything to use me for they leave my side. Maybe I'm just useless? If I had more to offer maybe I'd have more friends?  


I recently found out that my mother has passed away, and whilst I didn't have a good relationship with her. It still is coming as quite the shock to me.   
My phone's been blowing up, but not with well wishes from loved ones. It's all just hate voicemails from my family members like ""It's your fault she died"" or ""You knew she was struggling mentally. How could you do this to her?"". How was I supposed to know that I was the only thing keeping her alive? She never acted like she cared about me when she was alive. How is this my fault? I moved because I was sick of her and my father's emotional abuse towards me. Somehow it's my fault for moving away for my own sanity?  


I'm just so tired. I've been alone my entire life, and no matter how hard I try I'm always the problem. It's always my fault something goes wrong, or nobody wants to stand by me longer than a month or a few weeks. All I ever really wanted was a friend that cared, or a family that loved and worried about me. But at this point I don't even think I deserve to have that. I feel like I'm invisible to the world, if I died nobody would care or even notice my passing. I'm forgettable, people say otherwise to me out of pity but I know the truth.  


In the end, it's the same as it has always been. If I vanished with out a trace nobody would care. I'm just screaming into the void, but I can't even hear my echo anymore.   
Maybe something's wrong with me and I'm not ""Normal"" enough to have human connections.

3911,cinnamonrollwattson,1639187197,1,"(this is going to be a very long post, I’m sorry…)

The past few days have been really shitty for me.
I did my finals exams at my main school in person and I horribly failed us history (but i’m still passing) and algebra with a 20 somethin’. I failed physics and algebra both for the first time in first semester which means this is the first time i’ve ever failed, usually i’d get in the 70’s range and still pass but…this year was different and this happened.

My mom is really, really mad at me and tells me constantly, “If I do it right the first time, I won’t have to do it again.” I have a backup plan and my mom will be getting a call from my case manager on Monday about some help.

I just can’t stop crying ever since yesterday my mom found out about my grades. My algebra is a 63 and my physics is a 64, she told my dad to take away my xbox then they didn’t know where to put it in their room so they put it back in my room.

I later on asked if I could at least watch youtube while I eat or at least watch something because I’m not watching free tv, and they allowed me so now i’m able to do that.

and then today 20 minutes ago I asked my mom if I could go back to playing my games because it’s winter break (but ofc i didn’t say it that way) and the way she said, “Are you asking me if you want to play games?” and I tried to change it by saying “I’m asking what is the plan right now, since I can’t do second chances on finals.” she sounded so pissed off and now I have to wait until Monday.

Now that I explained all of that…here’s all the parts that make me feel like absolute shit.

I’m so tired of school, i know my mom wants me to pass and go on to the next grade but she’s also giving me a hard time by constantly yelling at me then when she did take my xbox away, (I have it back now) but I still don’t have any privileges to play for lord knows how fucking long knowing my damn mom yet I bought the xbox with my hard earned money  yet she still thinks she can manage what I can do and not do with what I ACTUALLY BOUGHT FOR MYSELF.

I try and try and try so hard, I really do. I know how to manage video games and school but my mom makes me so much more stressed as I breath. I always say to myself in my head, “Yes mom, I know I fucked up like I always do, I know I always make you mad because that’s all I know what to do, i fuck up, you get mad, I start to cry then sucidal thoughts and constant headaches flood my head. What’s new?”

I just can’t stop crying, my head hurts and I don’t know anymore. I want to die, I really do. Nobody understands me that’s why i’m making this post for advice. I really don’t deserve Christmas at this point. I failed so I don’t deserve jack shit, no presents and definitely not fucking happiness. I didn’t earn anything, I didn’t work hard like I usually do and now i’m in this mess because my dumbass didn’t listen to my mom and try to manage the grade ahead of time but noooo i just had to wait until the next test or quiz

I just wish I was a nerd and smart as hell but instead i’m just a dumbass that screwed everything up like i always do and now I can’t even enjoy my winter break by playing my favorite video games in christmas form.

I hate my fucking life I HATE IT I FUCKING HATE IT ALL WITH MY DAMN SELF .

3920,NaturalMaybe,1639185201,1,"Sorry if this doesn't make much sense, I write this as I think

Now, I know what you're gonna say. ""Stop being picky, get some humility, be more forgiving of others' errors, yada, yada, yada."" I've heard that a million times. But if we get to the core of it, am I really asking for too much? Being able to hear and listen, being thankful for the romantic/friendly gestures, being educated and courageous enough to speak about what she's passionate about, being truly supporting during downs and proud during ups — if that is too much, no wonder humanity is fucked. It is so rare to find a decent person nowadays. I've only ever met one, by luck and out of desperation — I clang to our relationship because it was either that or clinical depression at age 13. If I were more optimistic, I'd think, ""You see, you gave someone a chance and look what you have now — the best friend you could ask for."" But I'm not naïve. Spectating people instead of interacting with them led me to rightfully believe that my friend is more of an exception than a rule. I look at the people around me, calling each other friends, and I think, ""Do they really believe that what they are having is friendship?"" Most people's relationships are a bit more than just acquaintances. Do they settle on this because they can't be bothered to find a genuine connection, or is their definition of friendship so devalued to the point they don't think about how could it be better? I may never know.

Sometimes I think whether I am justified with demanding the qualities mentioned above from people I let in my social circle. Frequently during my lowest points, I respond negatively to this. When I contemplate whether I have been a good friend, a helpful teammate, or a decent stranger, I doubt that I am worthy of what I'm asking. But every single time after I talk with my friend, I think yes, I can want it because I'm ready to give out the equivalent. I would do anything for the person I love, from keeping one's spirits up when feeling down to remembering a childish thing they mentioned a couple of years ago and gifting it as a present. I'm a good storyteller, and, most importantly, I LOVE listening when someone passionately talks about what they are excited about. And it doesn't even need to be close to my area of interest; I just want to hear someone get pumped up about what they know. If I can excite my artsy friend with talks about how Earth can be destroyed through various quantum physics mumbo jumbo, then surely you can tell me about philosophy, drawing, cooking, music, etc., and expect to be heard. After all, I spent my life listening to people more than talking, and even if you don't want to, you're gonna get pretty good at it. It is heartbreaking to have so much love to give yet not enough people to distribute it. Even my talks with my friend are way more intimate than were ever intended, and it almost got both of us into trouble. I need to portion myself, but when there is no one else to love, both currently and on the horizon, what are you going to do? I can't just give it out to anyone, and finding a new outlet for it is tiresome and time-consuming. Moreover, I doubt they'd listen.

God damn it, the ability to listen. If I had to choose one trait I look for, that would be it, not even close. How little people can listen! It just blows my mind. The information overload that is already happening is partially due to people's inability to shut the fuck up sometimes. Everyone has a voice, and everyone thinks it's their obligation to fucking broadcast it to the rest of the world. What happened to observing the world? It is just as beautiful without your voice repeating the voice of the masses. I want actual conversations with attentive listeners and exciting ideas. They don't have to be long, or serious, not at all! We could create crazy theories about video games, geek out on movies, talk about our plans for the future, share experiences, and just generally have an excellent civil time. It's so simple yet so hard to come by. With people I've met throughout the years, these themes usually die out when I finish, and they either respond with a generic ""Yeah"" and let the conversation die down or just get bored in the middle and stop paying attention. When you ask them something, it's even worse because they usually use the inquiry to talk about something completely irrelevant, just because they want to. The most simple form of reaction to someone talking is to either ask a question or answer what has been asked, yet unachievable for most people. I just want to be heard because, again, I have and want to give so much to a person, yet nada seem like worth the trouble.

Overall, sometimes I wonder whether I will find someone I could genuinely romantically love. My kind of people seems to slowly die out, and those still here act precisely as I do — avoid social connections like fire. I often wish that I had lower standards so that I'm not constantly miserable and would've had an easier time finding a partner. But then again, I'm not asking for anything that I wouldn't be able to give in return. I just hope that I get to meet this person by some accident before I meet the toaster in the bathtub.

Guess I liked spending my nights in the city, looking down from my apartment window, and just seeing other people living their lives. Maybe a friend visiting from time to time... My husband is the best, but I'm so isolated and he's so tired after all his working days (I have my own company and work from home), that I just have no idea what to do anymore. I haven't seen anyone for the last year and a half, except for my husband. My circadian rhythm has changed cause I just can't stand being here alone for hours and hours. I get up around noon now, so the day feels less long. I work at night to keep myself busy while knowing someone's around.

I always looked forward to Friday evenings and weekends, my husband and I would have so much fun together, but with his new job, every Friday is a nightmare cause he's too exhausted and I'm alone again, with no one to talk to. Every weekend is so anti-climatic, I don't know why I even look forward to it anymore.

One person was upset with it because he felt like he was losing his best friend which was the friend. But he ended up losing him because of his asshole actions. He influenced the other friends that I was the bad guy. He hated me and still does.. I think, who knows. I had another friend who’s friendship I appreciated the most.. act different like if he didn’t know who I was. As if we weren’t friends for years. Everyone obeyed this friend like a king and wouldn’t rationalize his actions or words. He always wanted people to kiss his ass. He never apologizes when he’s in the wrong and only sees things in his shoes instead of others. This friend is my cousin. We were very close growing up. I’m not gonna lie, we had a lot of fun times. He was the cousin I was the closest with. Everyone turned their backs against me. I try to avoid the group at any social gathering that could associate them to. Since then I’ve always felt lonely. Me and the friend dated for a few months just for me to end things because I just couldn’t handle the drama anymore. I didn’t want to associate myself to them anymore including the friend. I’ve been lonelier since and now I only got myself. Sometimes the loneliness is a killer when it’s just you and your thoughts. I just been hurt since then. Friendship break ups hurt the most. Very heartbreaking for me. I have a hard time opening up as well. I hate speaking. I tend to regret speaking. I start to overthink about things that I say and whether or not it was the right thing to say. Since the fall out happened because my cousin’s gf found some text messages between the friend and my cousin talking about how I didn’t like his gf because I felt like she wasn’t treating him well. He deserved someone who will go above and beyond just like he is doing for her. I had this conversation in person with him for this same reason too but somehow it was searchable since she did look into his phone while he was sleeping. Something that she does because she doesn’t trust him because of a past relationship of hers. Now I don’t even say anything or share an opinion on anything. Since then I’ve been wanting to escape as well. I want to leave everything all behind and start fresh. I want to move out of state and meet new people. I feel like living here makes me feel alone.

3977,Crafty_Rip7662,1639156553,1,"Just over a year ago, I was in a really bad place. I had just broken up with my girlfriend, and realised how toxic the relationship was and what it had done to me. She had slowly taken me away from all my friends, and made it so I was completely reliant on her for company and social interaction. She also used to constantly gaslight me, convincing me I treated her terribly and by the time she finished with me, I had literally no money.

Since then I’ve been saving, even more than before I met her as I made a massive dent in my savings. I’ve expanded my social circle, although all my friends live hours away and it’s hard to see them, it’s better than it was before. I’ve got over my insecurities and accepted myself, and no longer feel like I need validation from anyone. I’ve wised up to the dating game, and feel like I’m ready to get out there, but there’s a problem.

Now if we are talking day to day, this does not apply, but in terms of dating, I cannot trust women at all. I want to, but I just no longer have it in me. I’ve had a few opportunities in the past year to form a connection with some women who I was really interested in, but I just found that my trust issues formed a barrier in these relationships I couldn’t seem to get past. I took another break, about 4 months, and now I think I’m ready, but I still feel that distrust in my stomach.

I know it’s unfair, and I know that not all women want to hurt or use me, but I can’t seem to shake this feeling. A lot of you will probably hate on me for it, but it’s not personal, I’ve just had a lot of bitter experiences with women all my life, romantic or not, and I just cannot give anyone the benefit of the doubt anymore. Guys, if you’ve been through something similar and got past it, how? Ladies, if you have ever helped a guy with issues like this, how? And if you just want to tell me how evil I am, I’ll take that too. Either way, I hope anyone who reads this is feeling okay and stays safe in these trying times❤️.",lonely,I think I’m ready to let someone in my life.,2021-12-11 04:15:53

Sometimes it was just a shared look, or often it would just be a text at the exact right moment. We had many days of waking up together, spending the whole day together, and then going to bed together. Nothing has ever happened between us sexually or even romantically for that matter. I never wanted to admit it at the time, but I was deeply in love with him. I would wait in my car outside his house for him to get home from work at midnight and I would think “oh this is what a straight guy must do for a girl.” We watched tv, did odd jobs for his family, and goofed around with our larger friend group during summer and after school. When he called me his “Best Friend” it made me feel not just wanted, but truly needed. He suffered from serious anxiety and OCD which wasn’t very obvious to our peers but I could sometimes tell the way his obsession would manifest into dark mental places and would patiently talk him through his fears and loops. We were outcasts with style. I had come out my junior year and when I was facing a lot of judgement from my conservative town he offered complete support and acceptance. We spent almost every day together for about two years until he went off to college. It was devastating for me but I tried my best not to let him see how much pain I was suffering from. I became spiteful and it soured our friendship. He’s married now and we still keep in touch and share a matching tattoo, but a small part of me still believes we’ll never find another connection like the one we had. His wife is a beautiful person in and out and I’m really happy they found each other… I’ve experienced about every kind of emotion while dealing with this, but I think the one I’ve landed on permanently is gratitude. To know what it means to really love someone, unconditionally, is at times the strongest light I have to get through some of the most difficult times.

4020,Mint_choco_soju6853,1639124683,1,"When I was in college, I went through a long steady decline into depression and mental breakdown. At my worst, I had two semesters where I got a complete 0.0 GPA because I could not even show up to all the final tests. The first test I went to, I spent the whole 1.5 hrs crying in the toilet by myself because I could not even walk thru the test hall door. I just could not move ahead in college anymore by myself. My family wouldn't let me come back home because they had sacrificed so much... But I just could not do it myself. It felt like I was running in a race and everyone was waiting for me at the finish line, but no one came to help me up when I had fallen in a deep pothole mid-race. 

It's crazy to think back on those days and remember it all as facts. I think I must've looked so crazy to everyone, abandoning whole semesters like that - but I could still remember the pools of tears, the shaking of my body from fear and anxiety, the literal horror and anguish from waking up in the morning knowing I was still alive. I remember every night praying to die in my sleep because I could not in good conscience actively kill myself, but i needed some intervention to stop my life. Just cut it. Done. So for all the suicidal posts here, please trust me. I really do understand that feeling.

Things have changed now. I abandoned all dignity and came back home, ready to disappoint everyone. I was prepared to kill myself back home instead, so funerals would be more easily managed by my family if my death was closer. I thought, if I had to kill myself, may as well see the worst of my situation.
Thankfully, my father and brother were there to tell me things I never expected, but really needed to hear, and I could finally heal. I moved on - it was hard, but I made amends. Now I'm working in a job that I love and have enough money (small salary but still) to gain some sense of freedom. I could drive and that made all the difference to me. I looked forward to waking up every morning.

But... Depression is a bitch isn't it... It never leaves you. It just lies in slumber and you need to constantly keep it in check.

This year, I have been sooo lonely. Socially I have friends, but inside I'm still as alone as ever. Things that used to be little nothings, like colleagues talking about things without including me, suddenly became so heavy. Walking alone instead of being accompanied by someone became heavy. I started feeling no reason for waking up anymore. I go back to being extremely nocturnal, only able to fall asleep after 6am when the sun is up. I started crying randomly again. 

Loneliness used to be just a slight discomfort for me, but I'm so afraid that this will trigger me to go back in depression. I'm so traumatized by the person I had become then, and i don't want to go back there.

Sorry long read, I was just sharing what I felt today.",lonely,I'm scared of relapsing to depression again,2021-12-10 19:24:43
4021,Smileyturtle1343,1639124406,1,"I wrote a short story that I hope may speak to someone's loneliness out there, so maybe if only through an anonymous forum we can find those that aren't ghosts.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear, to Whom it may concern

I write this letter with a question. But this is a question that can't be understood without a story. Unlike most questions, I am unsure whether it has a clearly defined answer. It happened during the day. I find that the darkest of tragedies don’t occur in the rain, or in the fog, or the blanket of night. They happen in clear weather on a bright day. It’s a shame really. I suppose sometimes the light can be blinding. I woke up that morning and everyone was gone. They were there, but they weren’t. It was a day like any other. I walked to the closet and got dressed. Prepared for the day I’d lived a thousand times, yet also full of uncertainty. When I stepped into the kitchen I was met with an ominous feeling. An uncanny valley. It was my parents. Something was strange about them. I’m not sure if it was always there, or if it was that I had only just now noticed. They were translucent. I could see humanity beneath the surface but couldn't touch it. Almost like a veil had been placed between us.  “Mom! Dad!” I shouted. They didn’t hear me. I did all I could to get them to hear me but it’s like I was a ghost. I stepped in front of my mom to get her attention. She suddenly phased right through me. Not only that, but an intense wave of pain went ricocheting through my core. I could feel it in my bones. It wasn’t one of those sharp intense quick pains. It was a pain that rocked me, a dull ache that would play on repeat in the back of my mind for a long time after. Then she called my name. Gently and softly crying out in pain wondering where her child was. I was standing right there yet she didn’t see me. Then I saw it. A ghostly version of me coming down the stairs. I tried to speak but as the ghost entered, I felt the energy sucked out of me. Another wave of pain echoed through me as she stared at me, and then back at my parents. The only thing I could think to do was to rush back up the stairs in hopes that running from the figures would stop the pain. To my relief it worked. I entered my room and my doppelganger disappeared. It was strange, I had this unsettling feeling making itself home in the deep recesses of my stomach. A dark fog threatened to descend but I hadn’t given up hope just yet. I had a theory. I quickly ran out the back door and drove to school. After careful observations every day I noticed a few things. When I was alone my ghost was nowhere to be seen. The minute I entered a crowd of phantom people, however, the ghost returned. The pain I felt with my parents didn’t always appear with others. With some friends, my ghost didn’t follow me, or she was fainter. Sometimes parts of her would appear such as one of her ears or eyes. But she only consistently vanished completely when I was alone. There were some anomalies. A rare moment of inevitable connection where for the briefest ripple in time she would retire. Sometimes she would be gone for a very long time, but it never felt long. I always noticed the ghosts that caused me pain though. I kept note of them. I carefully avoided them. With my parents though, it was different. I loved my parents but the immense amount of pain and energy it took to be around them was overwhelming. I knew they tried but they never seemed to understand why they hurt me. Eventually, I myself understood why they were hurting me. I tried to explain it to them many times. But I knew I couldn’t change them. I didn’t want to hurt them by leaving, but what am I to do if being around them deeply hurts me? I love them and I don't want to leave them. For a while I was alright. I was able to scrape by using avoidance. But everything changed when my sister became a ghost. Once I saw it happen to her, I couldn’t sit by anymore. I realized that people created their own ghosts. The ghosts were a defense mechanism against those who cause pain. The ridiculous irony was that the pain never ceased ghost or no ghost. Those that caused pain caused it regardless. Some souls I could trust with my physical self. Some I could trust with parts of it. But my parents, these people I want nothing more than to trust and have loyalty to, have hurt me in ways so deeply, I lost my own reflection completely. There’s not much left for me to do. I’m unsure of how to cure this deep ache, or how to purge these ghosts. I talk to a preacher once a month. We strategize and talk about possible solutions. They often help me understand the crazy situation better, but they don’t solve it. I’m at a crossroads. I make a decision to leave so they can’t hurt me or stay. It’s really not such a simple choice as it may seem though. You see, if I leave, I lose any sense of family and stability I have left in the world. Any hope for that once had childhood joy I experienced. Every relationship ever built; every battle won. But if I leave, I gain myself back. I gain a removal of the pain. But I lose hope in eternal love. Because if I leave my family, endless love no longer exists. That means all love is temporary, and I will inevitably end up alone again. So, you see, I’m not sure which direction to go. I have a few years before I comfortably take this road. Although I could begin now, it would simply be more difficult. I suppose all my life would be more difficult without them. I don’t want to leave. I love them, they love me, I don’t want to hurt them. I don’t want them to have to feel what it’s like to lose a child. But maybe they’ve already lost a child. Because I’ve lost myself. So now I have no one to tell me which path to choose. I live in a world with ghosts, I catch mere glimpses of their humanity. So, I guess, the real reason I am writing this letter, is to ask if anyone’s out there. I don't know honestly if anyone will respond. Perhaps I am writing this letter to the void. I really hope I am not the last person on earth.",lonely,Am I the last person on earth?,2021-12-10 19:20:06

This has always pushed me towards looking to go into the Trades but recently I decided to get into Game Design for college, since video games have been a major part of my life for most of it.   


I constantly feel myself wanting for things, for specific games to exist, for experiences to be had. I think this parallels my lonely wish for companionship, in a way. So to channel my shit into positivity, I create stories, characters, settings. Recently, as I grow deeper into this loneliness, I've been thinking up a cyberpunk setting of my own, a place where I don't have to worry about pre-established lore, where I don't have to worry about licensing. This setting that I made allows me to channel my loneliness into the depressing, human stories that the Cyberpunk genre is known for. It helps me feel not as lonely when I create stories, when I write down experiences I wish I had in reality. Because in a way I'm living vicariously through these characters, existing in their stories. Of course, I don't publish these stories, nor show them to anyone.   


These personal vent stories are my own because more often than not each character represents a small part of who I am, not entirely a self-insert but still close enough. I think having different characters represent different parts of my mental state helps me as well, allows me to organize my thoughts in a way that I can read and predict. It helps me analyze what's wrong and what would help it. Also writing these characters to sometimes have depressing endings is cathartic in a way.",lonely,I (19M) find creativity as a nice outlet for my loneliness.,2021-12-10 18:34:13

4069,anon84975134567890,1639102918,1,"23F. Abused from around age 6-18 by one parent, because I was autistic. Beat me, kicked me, dragged me around - any time I did anything characteristically autistic. That parent tried to kill me a few times, the earliest time I was around 7. The other parent is emotionally unavailable, not capable of being loving at all. It's Aspergers btw, low support needs, was actually a gifted kid - and well-behaved according to every teacher, guess they were just ashamed. 

Was actively told I was unloved, that they had never loved me. That I deserved everything I was getting. 

Was homeless at 18, after the third time they tried to kill me. Got put into supported housing and was surrounded by drug addicts who would purposely spike me and give me high doses of whatever they had to make me OD for a laugh, and then try to take advantage of me. 

Got myself out of there, put myself through university, became the first woman in my family to get a degree, living on my own now, became disabled two years ago. Can't walk properly anymore. Got diagnosed with a bunch of rare, life-long complex medical conditions. One of those means I may need neurosurgery soon, another makes me allergic to literally most things (MCAS), won't get into the rest. Had to defer uni with a lower level degree than I wanted, due to all the medical issues, still need to finish it.

Got a restraining order against the parent that tried to kill me, represented myself through court while doing that degree. I am so done with everything, I am emotionally numb now, I miss feeling things. I work so hard to have a good life that's inclusive of my disabilities, but I am still so alone despite putting myself out there so often. 

I just want somewhere soft to land. I'm tired of being independant. I am tired of struggling. I don't care about feeling strong anymore for making it through the childhood I had, I just want someone to love who also loves me. I have so much love to give and refuse to give it to a toxic partership or friendship. I keep hoping to meet someone who wants to get to know me rather than just sees me for what they can get out of me. 

I got close to someone recently, realised the other day they weren't genuinely caring and were just trying to use me. Tapping out, mentally calling it on getting close to anyone.

Before I met him I had no friends, and was in the process of cutting off my toxic mother and sisters. So I was completely alone. And even then I was on Reddit trying to make friends, but as a female all you run into is creeps and horny guys that ghost you if you're not hot or wanting to date. So I was struggling HARD. 

He was everything, and it's so hard to move on when you know you'll never meet someone like that ever again. Can you imagine spending all your life waiting for true love, and you finally get the opportunity for lifelong companionship, and you screw it up? I blew it. This man was truly written for me. I still believe he is my soulmate.

Now I'm right back where I started, on this stupid app desperate for someone to find me worthy of their time. 

Music helps, writing in my journal helps, seeing other people go through what I go through helps, but nothing truly compares to feeling loved and having the promise of lifelong companionship within arms reach. The gut wrenching feeling constantly wrings my soul and I'm just about empty at this point.

I'm unattractive, overweight ( I've started to work on getting in shape), and socially inadequate from having social anxiety all my life. He accepted all of that, and took me in. He wasn't perfect, but he was written for me. And I blew it.

I don't even know what to say anymore. I can't even look at myself anymore. I'm all I have left now, so I HAVE to get along with myself and forgive myself for what happened, so that I don't continue spiraling down. But it's hard. Id rather have never experienced love at all.

I simply can't see people's faces, and I avoid looking straight at them due to naturally avoiding eye contact due to shyness, or just finding it creepy to try and still not being able to.   


The matter is I feel I just can't socialize, the visual impairment combined with shyness and the fear of being creepy, it all makes it really difficult. I know there are totally blind people out there who don't have any problems in socializing, but I see that as just the kind of thing people without a deeper understanding would say to me, as if I shouldn't be complaining about it but just go on and talk. The thing is, blind people are clearly recognized as being blind, so people already know how to handle it, or at least know their condition from start.   


That's not my case, I do use thick eyeglasses and have long gone through the ""glasses angst"", but I still don't want people to treat me differently, not that I don't want them to notice (that's impossible depending on the place, i.e a supermarket), I just don't want to feel ""handicapped"", something I'm definitely not, it's just a moderately limiting condition, like I can't drive or such, but that's all about it.

but even if it’s upsetting, i still prefer being here than at home because that place has a lot of painful memories stored. here i at least feel like i’m part of a community, in contrast to my house where i felt isolated most of the time. something i’ve realized is that i have to work on myself and figure out what my passion is in life rather than thinking so much about other people. the thought of having a multitude of friends and being in a relationship is fun, but life isn’t worth it if i’m not content with myself and my future plans. i’m definitely hoping to get out more come next semester, i’m taking more classes, considering joining different clubs, was even thinking of getting a second job but that may be too much lol…. i just don’t know where to start and if my efforts will be fruitful.",lonely,i don’t know what to think…,2021-12-10 11:16:59

the last 3 years of birthdays i've had haven't been ideal, and only get worse each year. it's just a really difficult time for me when everyone seems to always have atleast someone there to talk to meanwhile you're sat inside unable to do anything with anyone on your ""special day"" except vent about it to anonymous people on the internet.

4140,TheGoatNapoleon,1639075387,1,"Good afternoon everyone,

If you happened to see my post about a month ago on r/socialanxiety about starting a virtual “Social Anxiety Anonymous” support group, I just wanted to let you know that it’s finally happening! 

With a kick in the butt and some help from an amazing Reddit user, I was finally inspired enough to get to work on the group. To create the group, I’ve read through hours worth of materials provided by the official Social Anxiety Anonymous (SAA) group and I've created a dedicated discord server where we can discuss the reading materials and participate in weekly support meetings. Links to both the SAAs' group's website and our discord server will be in the comments below.

Now, our first step is to gather a few more members before we begin voting on a time and day to host our weekly, hour-long support meetings. These meetings will consist of: reading through the 12-Steps to Social Anxiety Recovery, reading from helpful materials provided to us by the SAA group, sharing our weekly successes and struggles with social anxiety, asking and answering questions about social anxiety, and leaving time for people to chat and make other socially anxious friends if they choose to do so. 

If this sounds like something you’re interested in, please feel free to click the link and join us on our dedicated discord server. The maximum capacity for our group will be limited to 15 members. 

This could be a great opportunity to meet some like-minded people and make some new friends!

Please know that in order to protect the privacy of our members from the public, new members will not be able to view any of the channels on the server until our moderators change their role to “Member”. If you have any questions, please ask!

Cheers!",lonely,Starting a Social Anxiety Virtual Support Group,2021-12-10 05:43:07

I thought I’d be married or at least be living with a long term partner and definitely thought i would have a couple of children. I wish i could wake up every morning to a man who loved me and my babies, have someone to talk to and have fun with and just get through life together but instead i wake up alone at 5am to walk to work. 

I have moved back with my dad to help him out and to look after him a bit, due to his illness he is only able to say a few strained words and cannot write so communication is hard and conversation impossible.

I long for my own family, I’ve wanted a baby for 5 years but that just hasn’t worked out. 

What can i do? By nature I’m shy and quiet and take a long while to feel comfortable around people, but the loneliness and emptiness i feel every day is getting to a point where i feel I cannot cope with it anymore, its like I have physical pain in my chest but at the same time feel empty its hard for me to explain this feeling but its there most of the time and especially when i get into bed.

I think at least 50 people either texted or rang me to wish me a happy birthday, the day after my birthday I went to see my 3 best friends, they all made a fuss of me and my best friend in the whole world (at the time) gave me a litre bottle of jack Daniels and said ""I love you man, you're my brother"".
I was so happy I actually cried.

Now exactly one year later, I have no boyfriend, these 3 close friends are gone, my old best friend thinks I'm a monster, my ex hates my guts with a passion, and all my other friends don't like me anymore.

I have 5 friends total, one lives far away so I never see her, one is always busy, two of them I haven't seen for nearly 5 months, and the last one I'm not really that close with.

I'm dreading tomorrow, I'm gonna be home alone.
I don't think anyone I know is gonna ring me, or even text me.
I would give ANYTHING to go back in time, even if just for a day, just so I could see them all again, have a drink with my best friend, cuddle my boyfriend, have a party.

4181,cookietime1820,1639056143,1," For the past few days, I fell extremely lonely. I have seen many people this summer (thanks to dating apps) and had many great experiences. That was my first time doing that, and I don't regret that part (even if it was not wonderful sometimes). I had a sexfriend, and we have seen each other a lot, one of the best sex I had. And maybe you have guessed by now, but I've become attached to him. I was talking about how I wanted, maybe, a serious relationship with someone else, and he said that he was also talking to someone and that it could be exclusive. That's when I realized. I didn't want it to end, but I had to admit how I was feeling, so I could move on. I told him, and he said he was seeing someone else, it was not possible. 

It's been a week and I've seen the other guy I was talking to, because I wanted to move on (not my best idea, I should have known it doesn't work like that). It appeared that it was his first time, and he didn't tell me, so it was a bit weird, and he said to me this morning he didn't want something serious for now. 

What happened to me this week is not the first time, I've experienced many disappointments for the past months. I am really not feeling well, I feel like shit cause there are just 2 options for me : They don't want something serious, or they want something serious but just not with me. It is difficult to admit, and it hurts a lot. I just want to feel loved.  Maybe I should talk to a specialist about it cause my anxiety is more and more present in my life, my emotions are like rollercoaster I can be so happy and at the limit of depression in the same day. Hopefully, I have a good friend who I talk to a lot. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this post, I think I just wanted to talk about my situation and maybe some people feel the same way... I just try new things to feel a bit better (and I hope I didn't make some mistakes cause English is not my native language haha)",lonely,I feel so lonely what should I do,2021-12-10 00:22:23

4188,Card1_B,1639051769,1,"This is just what I've learnt, take from it what you will. It might help, it might not. 

I've had friends in the past, and I've worked hard to keep them, but have nothing to show for it. I always avoided being the one to make plans because I thought no one would listen and to be fair, I was right. 

I remember after finally plucking up the courage to make plans in a group chat, I was left on read.

But more importantly, I've had no real luck in romantic endeavours. 

It makes me question, am I loveable? Am I even likeable?
Maybe I am just an annoying, undesirable person to be around? How would I know though? I don't have anyone to confirm or deny this in my life. 

I've had many suicidal thoughts about my potential undesirability. Don't get me wrong It's not about sex, it's about being desired and giving desire. 

I'm leaving so much out, but I want to get to what I've learnt most importantly. 

I've attempted suicide before (twice)(but for different reasons each time), failed of course probably too scared to go fully through with it. 

But after the last time I had brief moment of clarity. I remember thinking how people at work treated me bad, but for once I had a thought which was: they should be grateful I even show up after all I might not have been able to show up ever again. Then I realised, why can't I have this attitude all the time (obviously not in an entitled way) but in a way where I deserve at least a little appreciation even if I just appreciate myself. 

I remember thinking, if I'm going to kill myself, why not let go of all the self hatred and attachment to the need of finding a partner, is that not that the same as death? 

I realised that it's not my lack of a partner or lack of anything, it's my attachment to the lack of things tied to my self worth that was bringing me down. 

I tried a 90 day challenge where I let go of any thought (meditation/mindfulness style) of attachment to needing anything just to see how I would feel. And after awhile I even forgot that I wanted a partner. I was so focused on just enjoying what little time I have on this planet. 
I could be dead, so I may as well enjoy things the way I want. 

I still don't have any friends, but I have goals and I'm optimistic that if I just work on my self, relationships will come. You can either be optimistic or not, but not being optimistic doesn't help so you may aswell be optimistic even if nothing comes of it. That's at least how I think now. 

I see posts on here from people who have lost all hope, but I would ask them, if you're going to give it all up, why not give up your attachments to needing anything. 

I'm not saying I can fix your problems, I truly wish you the best. It can get better, I'm living proof. And we can be all lonely, together.",lonely,"My journey with Loneliness, Suicide and what I've learnt.",2021-12-09 23:09:29

So 2 days back i told her how i  felt, i was soo anxious for her reply, i kinda knew the reply she was  going to give me. She said she has a thing for me and likes me, but not  that very serious, she doesn't wana be in a relationship yet and doesn't  like long distance ones, and i saw this coming, she also said that  she's open to dating me when we meet next year (she's gona do her  master's in USA and I've applied for some universities in US too, so if i  get into some uni, i can meet her), this aspect made me soo happy, but  at the same time, she said to keep my options open and do not just  settle for her, if i wana date someone i can do it and she is gona do  the same. Then yesterday she said we'll date if I'm single next year and  that has made me sad since yesterday, idk what to do, i really really  like her but she doesn't feel the same about me. She says she wants us  to be very close friends first and then lets see where it takes us, but  does she really wana date?, Idk i might be overthinking.

School work piles up since I procrastinate too much, so I always find myself busy, and despite how hard I try, I never seem to do well academically. I have no particular strengths or interests, besides wasting time, watching tv or scrolling endlessly online. 

Mental health for me has been a big issue for years, and I have considered suicide multiple times in the past. There’s just too much going on and I wish I could lie down forever and give up. I see myself amounting to absolutely nothing. The future really scares me.

She was a great woman and I was quickly falling in love with the bar scene. I ended it and every woman after that has felt like retribution for doing a great woman wrong.

4300,varuezx,1639001426,1,"I'm not really good at writing stories soz in advance and I'm not sure if anyone is really gonna read the entire story, but yeah I don't really have anyone so here ya go internet.

So yeah, I've been lonely for quite some time. I'm 24, but I've had quite the rough childhood. My parents are pretty crazy (physical &amp; mental abuse), so my sister was taken out of our home by youth services when she was 14 (I was 11 at the time). For some reasons youth services didn't check on me, so I ended up growing up in some shitty conditions. I've gotten severely depressed at the age of 15 to the point where therapists forcefully put me in a closed mental institution for my own safety. But being in a different environment had a really good effect on me, so after a year they put me back in my parents home where everything went to shits again real fast.

I can write hours on how shitty my parents were, but where I broke was when the following happened. I wasn't allowed sleeping in my own room, because my mom thought I would hurt myself. Me as a 16 year old at the time, did not feel like sleeping next to my parents for obvious reasons so I got into an argument with her. After the argument I went to sleep, only to wake up to my dad sitting on top of me hitting me in the face, because I made my mom cry. My dad is a p big guy, so my mom had to drag him off me and yeah was a kinda shitty exp. That was p much the moment I just took off and ended up without a plan.

The story is really long, so just to make a long story a little shorter. I ended up in a youth shelter cuz I really had no place to go and stayed there for 2 years, when I turned 18 I got my own room in a student housing. Never really had friends because I was in such a shitty situation and all I could do was play video games to lose touch with reality. After a while I made some friends, dated a few girls, but I still never lost the feeling of being lonely. I think it's mostly because I can't really level with people, since our state of minds are just so different. I also thought it is just a feeling that became a part of me and just the sheer fact of not having anyone that actually loves me, no family, no parents, no friends that really understood me, you may know the deal.

I've been holding up pretty okay all things considered, I just learned to live with it, but that all changed half a year ago. I met this girl on my job, who everyone said is literally the female version of myself. She has all the same interests from video games, to climbing, to card games to stupid things like plants (and much.. much.. much more). She looks like everything I ever dreamt of and we levelled on every aspect, we even talked in the same weird manner and yeah. She also didn't have parents (I mean what are the odds). We got on extremely well extremely fast and started dating after a month. During this time was the first time in my life where I experienced true happiness every day and didn't feel alone even though she was really the only person in my life.

But yeah life had to kick me in the face once again, because 2 weeks ago (after 4,5 months of dating) she came to me on a Saturday to break up with me. This was completely out of nowhere, she showed no signs, we were having laughs and went on a dates the week before and yeah just like that boom it's over. Apparently she was already in love with someone else who she had met through the internet, but had the need of someone close by. She thought she could hide away her feelings for the other guy, but after a while she couldn't anymore. She actually liked me though, but I guess he was better. She said some pretty shitty things that spook through my head 24/7, idealizing how he was just perfect for her in every single aspect while she was casually ripping my feelings apart. I just keep hearing her say it over and over in my head and yeah it really sucks. Anyways so now I'm back to being alone and man has being alone never felt this bad before. Like I said before, I got used to being alone, but now all I want is to feel that feeling again when I had her in my life. It kinda has become to the point where I just randomly burst out laughing about just how shitty and lonely I feel. And yeah experiencing happiness like that for the first time in my life is something I will never forget, but I feel like there is not really anyone that can ever give me that feeling again.

Why do i have to go through all of this? Why do i have to live a life that I didn’t choose? Why did i have to give up on my hopes and dreams, sacrifice everything? Why did i have to pursue what someone else thought was good enough for me?
Life isn’t a life anymore. I’m just surviving. My days are just going by, determined by someone else. There’s no drive to achieve something, to accomplish something. It’s just pulling through the day somehow. And then fade into nothingness. A new day starts with a question, i.e. why? Why did i have to wake up? Why go through that crap again? There’s nothing to look forward to, nothing significant, nothing meaningful. 
Why motivate yourself to get out of it? What’s in store? Why even? It seems so easy to just give up and end it all. Anyway I don’t really do much for myself. It seems so much of a struggle. Not like someone is there to care for it. People may talk stuff about self love and all, and might use it to blame us. I guess they haven’t lived a life where they have never been accepted, been made safe, made felt loved, have had a home, after a very long time, but for a very short while. Or maybe they’re really headstrong. For them we are worthless imbeciles. Maybe so, and in that case I’m fine being that. I’m fine being made to feel guilty for not trying. No one gets it, how hard it is to try, how exhausting and draining it is.
It really hurts, you know, not to have a person who cares just for you, who is concerned about you, stuff like why you’re not taking care of your hair, teeny tiny stuff which your logical side plays down mercilessly. It hurts, when you know you have no one to run to, when you have had a shitty day. It hurts when you know there’s no one to hold your hands tight, to make you melt into a warm embrace when you have had a hard time. And this absence is something i have dealt with for almost the whole length of my existence. It hurts when you don’t have a safe home, where you can be weak, where you don’t have to be strong, practical, logical and mature. And you won’t have to feel guilty for feeling all of that.
It’s not like you have tried. You have tried, you have kept up your spirits after setbacks, but just to get pummelled down again. So much so that you break down, as it’s just you fighting pointlessly. You are trying to gain something meaningful and happy from something that someone else deemed as happy and fulfilling. Here you are, at a level more than decent as per the damned society, but it does not provide you the slightest amount of happiness. Your bank balance might be a source of practical comfort, but that’s as good as it gets. And it’s not enough. At the end of the day, you go to bed feeling unloved, uncared for, numb, tired, worthless,  under-confident and undermined. And worse, you feel guilty for feeling all that. You are supposed to feel grateful, for whatever you have. It’s like an imposition.
Why try? To keep this life that you didn’t even want? To forget all of this shit, shit which happened to you even after you didn’t do anything wrong? After all of these sacrifices? All of these disheartening dips, not spaced with good times? Should you force yourself to be happy, just because people might die to have what you have? And what about you? Are you happy?
And, does anyone care if you are?",lonely,Why try?,2021-12-09 07:35:38

I have my own place now, but these past 3 years I've spent Christmas with him and his fiance, who then became his wife. Obviously before then I spent Christmas with my parents, who live a long way away now.

But now my brother has recently split with his wife. I was wondering what was going to happen with Christmas, so I asked him. He said his ex's parents have invited him to theirs for Christmas...

What about me? I know it sounds selfish as hell, but ... I'm going to be sat here on December 25th, with my dog, and no-one else. Probably no Christmas dinner either because I can burn boiled water. I'm a shit cook. And cooking a full dinner just for myself will feel wrong. The town I live in does a dinner for people who are alone on the day, but honestly I feel it will be elderly folk who deserve it more so I won't even want to go. I have no-one else up here. No-one.

It just feels wrong in a way that my brother invited me up here, convinced me to move up, then when things go wrong he just ditches me for his ex. And that seemingly there was no mention of inviting me up as well.

I can't exactly go back home to spend it with my folks either. I work the day after so it'll be difficult. So ... I'm going to be alone. I dragged the Christmas decorations out to put up, but now they're just sitting there in boxes. What's the fucking point?

I have had therapy in the past, various types, but I noticed that a common factor for me getting better afterwards was the fact that something actually ""okay"" happened to me. It wasn't the therapy. 

Currently where I'm at, the likelihood of that happening again is next to nothing. You can tell me all day long that it might help, but I'm so far in the shit that unless my brain physically has the opportunity to prove it's own thought patterns wrong, I'll be stuck.

To start off, I been honestly feeling lonely for many years but I had work and school distracting me from feeling like that. Right now I finished this semester and work only gave me 2 days of work in these two weeks and I'm already feeling very lonely yesterday. I don't have people to talk to. I don't really have friends to talk and go out with. I only spoke to one person daily but it's been two days that they haven't texted me back and I know they are on the phone. Which leads to something else I feel, I feel that I annoy people. Every time I make a friend they'll leave me at some point. I feel like I'm this annoying kid who has nothing going for him and that I should just stop trying to make friends and accept that I'll always be alone. I feel like if I accept that I'll be lonely, I can be happy again. I don't want to be alone however. I also don't really have family connections to fill that void since when I came out it hasn't been the same. They talk behind my back which makes me feel more alone. Family doesn't accept me and the friends I had ended up leaving me already. I only have 2 friends but they are busy in the mornings when I'm the most free.

At the end of this summer I found a new friend. We immediately connected and started spending lots of time together. She told me, she was gay and I told her that as an asexual I rarely like someone and stuff and one night we got drunk she started kissing me. It felt great and for the first time in life I actually liked someone back. We continued hanging out together, sometimes kissing and stuff. Then she got a BOYFRIEND. A lesbian chose a guy over me. Lol. There's clearly gotta be something wrong with me when a literal lesbian choses a man haha. Anyhow, that's how I lost a friend, because now she doesn't even bother making plans with me.  

I always text people first. If I didn't I wouldn't see them ever, because they rarely text me. And I guess that's the thing when everyone around you gets into a relationship and now they're too busy to hang out with someone who is not their bf/gf. 

Last week I asked three of my friends from highschool to hang out, well one couldn't make it and one said that her boyfriend was coming to town, so now there's one person left and he has a boyfriend and usually makes time for his friends, but he didn't reply to my texts, so I guess I'm not hanging out with anybody again? 

Man, I'm just so tired of my ""friends"" telling me that they care about me and shit, but then they don't even try to make plans happen? I can't even talk to them about being lonely bc they'll pity me and tell me that I got them, but I clearly don't so what the fuck??

I'm always the second choice, well, I'm starting to think that I'm not even a choice and now I just want to feel nothing. I  can't even own a dog/cat bc I'm allergic to everything? Is this karma getting back at me for being a bitch when I was thirteen? xd I just bought a stuffed dino and every night I fall asleep cuddling it, wishing if was a real pet.

4369,Alternative_Tower_38,1638979106,2,"Hi everyone!

I'm a 19 year old guy in university in Poland at the moment, I started studying at university in october of this year and I have really shallow relationships with everyone there this likely because 90% of classes are online. Like I have a few friends (like 2) who have invited me to parties a couple of times but we barely ever talk and I really don't know much about them.

 The problem that's happening now is that people are clearly starting to form closed groups/circles which is exactly what happened in high school and I feel that I'm getting left out. As another example even when I did go out on saturday I met 8 new people but barely had any conversations with them and I don't even remember most of their names (because we spent like 5 hours dancing in the club and like 10 minutes talking) and the most socialising I did was with a girl who turned out to live 2 apartment buildings away from so we walked from the tram stop together so that comes to like 15 - 20 minutes of insightful conversation out of a 5/6 hour night out. This isn't an isolated example but of the like 3 or 4 parties I've been to its normal for people to dance and drink with me and then the next day they pretend they've never seen me.

Then there's my flat mates who have thrown parties like twice but I feel a significant disconnect between myself and them and their friends because they're around 3 years older than me. Normally, on a day to day basis our conversations are 10 minutes at most if any and our friend circles/groups don't overlap so when we do go out we go out seperately. Also, I will be moving to my own flat in january (yes I know I'm privelaged but my high school friend will be my flatmate).

Then there's my friend from high school who is also studying in the same city as me and we hang out on average like once a week and we were definately best friends in high school. However, our intrests don't exactly overlap (he doesn't drink which is his choice and that's ok) so if we are together we run or watch MMA or something and he has not introduced me to his friends from his university (from what he said he is not particularly fond of them). In general, tho he is very helpful like once we had to take a sink from the hardware store to the uber and then to my new apartment and he is always looking for one off weekend jobs through an agency.

As for what everyone else says, ""meet people through your hobbies"". Ok here are my hobbies.

So, currently I go to the gym like 2 - 3 times a week and the only interaction I've had was when a guy asked me to stand over him while he bench pressed.

Another hobby of mine is stock trading, but I haven't talked about it much to people in real life and the people who I've talked about it had no clue what they were doing.

I'm also, intrested in long distance hiking and I want to join my univeristy's hiking club in the spring.

Gaming is another hobby but this one is increadibly antisocial as I play single player games cities skylines/transport fever 2 and arguably they are extremely destructive as I can play until 3am or spend most of the weekend playing video games.

I guess tinder could be an option in the future (I am very shy around girls)???

The university does organise social events with no/less drinking like board games and quizes but I'm not really into that.

For those of you concerned about my liver and how many times I mention drinking, in case you don't know I live in Poland which especially in the autumn/winter is cold, grey and depressing. So if you live here and do not drink/smoke/do drugs I have no clue how you do it and HUGE respect to you.
 
This is way too long sorry.

TLDR; I want to find new friends I list my social problems and and why I need to find new friends in the top half and in the second half I list my hobbies because people always say ""meet people through your hobbies"".

4371,FAYTHEGAY,1638977112,31,"Ever since my best friend of 9 years ditched me for people that she ""cooler"" it’s been really hard to trust anyone. 

She was my best friend we would meet everyday it was so fun. I could tell her everything. Then she found new friends and slowly distanced herself to the point where she will leave me on read. 

We didn’t have a fight or anything, she just left. I still don’t know why. My only guess is that she hangs out with others now. 

To me the worst part is that she just lied the whole time. I texted her thinking it’ll pass, she’ll come back. I asked if I did something wrong, if she’s doing it intentionally or if she’s okay. She just said ""you did nothing wrong"". That’s it. 

On my birthday she showed up for the last time out of decency and said her present didn’t arrive yet. I don’t even care about a present. She lied. There is no present. She just said that cause he knew we’ll never talk again after that. 

And now everyone is just so fake. 
I got in a different class. It was my chance to find new friend cause I only had her. But the people there are all so fake. They talk behind my back and they leave me out. They’ll point out things I’m insecure about.

4372,Brisbae,1638976056,1,"I was just thinking about all the different mental illnesses, all the different conflicts and problems that we can experience as humans. Heartbreak, depression, grief, etc. All of these you can work through with a loved one. When my friend’s relationship recently ended, we got together and tried to cheer her up. When somebody dies, you have family to hug and comfort you. What’s so different about loneliness is that it’s when you literally have nobody, whether that means a lack of people you feel comfortable talking to OR just a lack of anyone at all. And so you have to struggle all on your own. You don’t have anybody to help you. I often fantasise about having somebody to talk to about my struggles with loneliness, which is paradoxical because if I had that person I wouldn’t be lonely. And so it seems like a vicious cycle. 

And I can see how it can spiral out of control (and I genuinely fear that will happen to me). And I read through these posts, and see suicidal loners desperately calling out for help one last time, and it truly shakes me, because although devastating, it seems… like a reasonable reaction. And I want to know these people. What made them so different? Where did it all go wrong? And I’m not saying that they’re wrong for it at all, that’s it’s their fault or that they deserve their fate. I think it’s a horrible fate. But I don’t want to go down that path; that is probably my biggest fear. Loneliness truly seems like a uniquely cold and evil affliction. 

I do blame myself. If I were just a little braver, I could solve my problem easily. And so I think I am a coward. But there’s some part of me that doesn’t want to. Consciously I recognise that this is unhealthy. But there’s no motivation to try to help myself. It reminds me of the study where they depleted a rat’s dopamine (or something), and they starved to death despite having food right next to them. I know that I will die if I don’t eat, but, viscerally, I just don’t want to eat. I can’t imagine eating to bring any pleasure, even though I know starving will be so painful.

These are just some of my late night thoughts. Loneliness seems inescapable some nights. And some times I give in to hopelessness. What do you think? Chuck down a comment. It can be anything.

  My 2nd best friend is extremely popular at school. Like i’m talking I can’t walk anywhere w/o other people going up to talk to her or multiple ppl saying hi to her. Sometimes I get really upset and jealous because i wish i had all that attention. A lot of people have crushes/interest for her and i get annoyed seeing it. Ik she has other friends other than me and it’s honestly not about that, i just would love people to say hi to me constantly and make it known that they care/know about me. 

I don’t really talk to anyone throughout the day in the majority of my classes, though some days are better than others sometimes. I’m not great at making friends either or talking so it’s not even an option anymore.  I think what adds on to this is that I don’t like the way I look and it’s hard to love myself and sometimes I just rlly want a hug from someone.  I end up thinking about finding an older guy to give me attention and what not but I always have to tell myself that it’s wrong (i turned off reddit dms b/c of that statement). I’ve tried to make myself throw up a few times so I wouldn’t have to go to school but it has not worked. It hurts so badly that no one looks at me the way everyone looks at my friend.

4419,toad648,1638939803,3,"Yeah lol. I realized more than ever today that I am more alone than I thought. I'm only a highschooler but nowadays everyones got everyone added on snapchat and instagram and I don't even use any of those at all. 

Everyone is so extroverted and talktative, they have many friends and hang out with them after school all the time. Even the introverts at my school have friends to hang out with after school. 

I have friends at school but they are weird people cause I don't know any of the normal  kids well enough to actually have their phone number or socials. Today I found one of the schools instagram accounts and it really dawned on me that I'm just left out on a lot of things and I'm not even aware of things or in the loop.

Everyone I know and see at school is present there and has added everyone I know (except me and the weird kids). 
I'm not even a weird kid and I try being social but somehow I was just left out on a lot of things. 

My friend groups changed over the years, and I never really had close friends before. I value any little friendship or interactions I have at school the most, as I don't get much more than that. I know that the kids I talk to in class are just people that talk with me and nothing more, and that they have their own real friend group. 

People who I thought were lonely actually have close friends which kinda makes me feel bad for myself. 

I guess what really hurts me is that I see people my age having the time of their lives and hanging out with people while I'm mostly alone with people I barely know, which kind of sucks because I feel like I'm missing out on a once in a lifetime experience, which I am in a sense. 

I think I make friends with the weirder kids a lot easier, because I tend to relate to them more, and it tends to be the reason why I gravitate towards them more.

I wish I was back in middle or elementary school when things were more simple back then. I wrote more on this post than I did for my essay due tomorrow.",lonely,Listening to sad music after realizing im more lonely than I thought,2021-12-08 16:03:23
4420,PizzaBoy2086,1638939623,1,"I recently came to the realization that I've always wanted to be a writer. It wasn't even so much realization as much as an acknowledgment that becoming an author is really what I always wanted to do with my life since I was 14. Problem is, I've been telling everyone for the past year that I'm going to be a history teacher and I'm finishing my first semester in my Secondary Education program. It's a bit of a conundrum but I'll try to explain.

Back at the end of 2020, my dad took me out to eat and asked what I was going to do now that I was graduating from community college with an Associate's in General Studies in a few months. I didn't have an answer for him, and sort of just said that I was gonna stay at community college and take a few more classes before transferring to a four-year school. He wasn't satisfied with that since I hadn't given him any real goals that I had, so he gave me an ultimatum that I had a month and a half to figure out what my plan for after graduation was gonna be. 

Needless to say, I was panicking to find something that would satisfy his ultimatum over the following weeks. All my previous career aspirations had vanished. In high school, I thought I might enlist in the Air Force, but my father advised me against signing away four to six years of my life to the military (which I later admitted was a wise decision). I also had a fascination for astronomy in high school and decided I might be able to pursue something related to that in college. I'd also been interested in meteorology and storm chasing for a long time and decided to pursue that as well. All these aspirations came crashing down when I barely passed Calculus 1 and Physics 1, both essential for any career path into meteorology or astronomy. I understood that if I barely scraped through those courses, there was no way I could make it through Calculus 2 and Physics 2 and 3 which were required for my program. In one year, my goals had been decimated. 

I wracked my brains for anything that I might be satisfied with doing for the next 40 years of my life, but I was 19. How should I know what I was going to do with the rest of my life when it had only just begun?

It so happened that I was talking to my sister while we were at our job sometime shortly before my dad would meet with me to discuss my future once again. I guess I was telling her about some battle in World War II and though she was clearly disinterested, I pressed forward with my rendition of the battle. She finally looked me dead in the eyes and said, ""You know what \[PizzaBoy\]? Why don't you just become a history teacher so you can get paid to lecture people about this stuff?"" She said it half-jokingly, but in my desperation to obtain some semblance of a goal to present to my dad, I took it to heart. When the time came I proudly told him that I would become a history teacher and that I was going to switch my major to Secondary Education. It satisfied him, and in my mind, it was justified. After all, if I liked history and knew all about it, surely I could teach it, right? 

(That's a little something I like to call foreshadowing.)

I was excited. Finally, something I could claim as a career! And it was a stable, noble, and *realistic* profession, to boot. ""Of course!"" I thought to myself. ""I've always envisioned becoming a teacher! Why didn't I think of it before?"" My sister would assist me in switching my major since she'd already been through that sort of stuff and was in the middle of completing her own grad program (she was always a big support for me in whatever I was doing). And so, in August of this year, 2021, I began my Secondary Education degree. At first, I was very optimistic. How hard can it be to become a history teacher, after all? And as a matter of fact, it wasn't very hard. To be sure, there was an enormous amount of work, but most of it was writing, which I'd always been good at *(hint, hint).* 

As I began to understand the scope of the educational system and all that it entailed, however, I also began to see the enormous responsibilities I would have as a teacher on the horizon. I've always been a very future-oriented person; I like having my life planned out, even if it's not entirely thought out. As such, I saw what was coming my way as a teacher, and I began to feel very uncertain if this was what I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life. Teaching requires a ton of commitment. That, I have no problem with. But my happiness and mental well-being are also very important to me as well. As the semester wore on, I began to question if this truly was a job I could do five days a week without consequence. I am introverted, and I do desire my alone time. Even at a part-time job like the one I and my sister have, it can be very taxing for me to work more than thirty hours a week there. And in a classroom, I'd be surrounded by 20-30 kids for almost eight hours a day, five days a week. I initially shrugged these feelings off, justifying it by telling myself that my part-time job wasn't something I loved doing, and teaching would be. 

But it began nagging at me that teaching might not be something I would love doing day in and day out. I do volunteer work for a youth program, but it's a small group of 5-10 kids and only meets once a week. I like working with the middle schoolers who come to our program, and most of the reason for that is because we actually get to know the kids who come, and although we do some teaching as part of the program, most of the time we do games or activities or trips with them--quite a contrast from what one might expect in a school classroom. I came to the conclusion that I couldn't compare my experience in the youth program with my expectations of teaching. 

After concluding this, my uncertainty bloomed to its fullest extent. I liked the *idea* of teaching, but the experience would likely be far different. I think the reason I began to think about these things so much was that my dad wasn't around the house for a month and a half--he'd contracted Covid and was in the hospital for several weeks before coming home around Thanksgiving. With him away, I was left alone to my thoughts for long periods of time. 

""Well, then,"" I thought, ""what now?"" It was a good question. But if I'm being honest with myself, the answer was staring me in the face. Since I was ten years old, I had an idea in my head. It was a story. And it was fantastic. It was full of the unabashedly bombastic imagination of a pre-teen, action-packed and dramatic. Oddly enough, I got the idea while building with Legos. After a year or two, I decided to make a graphic novel out of it. I think I wrote one chapter before I got tired and moved on to something else, but idea stuck in my head. Another year passed, and I finally decided I wanted to write the whole story out. It was riddled with plot holes and unsophisticated language, but it was something. And I'd written quite a lot. The story seemed to tell itself. By the time I was fourteen, I had begun typing it up and found that what I'd written came to over twenty pages. Not bad, considering the longest essay I'd ever written at that point was perhaps three pages long. By sophomore year of high school, the ""book"" was almost forty pages long and it had a title. When I graduated, I had about sixty-five pages to work with, most of which had been rewritten at least once during senior year. I was beginning to hone my skills. Throughout freshman year of college, I added another ten pages while rewriting the remaining sixty-five. I had gone through a third draft of the story by this point, and now I had a complete plotline to work with. I'd even begun fleshing out the plots of sequels to this first book, despite having less than a quarter of it written. My second year of college saw the least amount of written work done on it, but not a day could go by without me giving some thought to any aspect of the story. I envisioned scenes in my head, spoke out unwritten dialogue in the bathroom mirror. I think I became so obsessed with the book because I had very little time to sit down and just write, and so all my ideas were bottled up, bouncing around in my brain waiting to be translated into words on a screen. In the summer of 2020, I began writing again, finally having respite from my college classes. But tragedy struck six months later. I, like a fool, had kept the story on a USB drive. Lo and behold, I was cleaning out my room in January earlier this year and unknowingly threw the USB away. 

My six years of work was now gone.

About a month later, I did manage to find a backup USB that had an earlier draft of the story on it, but I'd lost about two years of work all the same. I initially gave a half-hearted attempt to start over, but I eventually set the story aside for several months, too depressed and busy to try and make up two years of lost progress. In late July, however, the book was given a new lease on life. Freshly inspired, I began a new draft of the story. It turned out to be for the best; I was able to undo many of the plotholes I'd written myself into in previous drafts, and the several months of reflection I'd had allowed me to observe and compare my writing to a wide range of storytellers. I also found some friends who were also writing stories of their own, which galvanized my imagination to present them with the best my story had to offer. New characters and better development, a more solidified plot, and the benefit of a few second-opinions had allowed my story to evolve beyond anything I thought it could. 

Then school started again, along with my Secondary Education program, taking me away from that joyful place. I think that this was the reason I'd become so unhappy in recent months, more so than I've ever been in my life. I was locked into a commitment I'd made on impulse, and I'd raised everyone's expectations by telling them about it. 

I should have mentioned this before, but I had always intended to publish my book eventually regardless of what career path I took. At the end of it, I would always be an author. But how would that work if I were a teacher? You see, I saw that I'd made almost no progress while I was taking classes. I'm sure that if I'd made the time, I *could* have worked on it. But I'd had so much going on in school and at my job that I was too tired most of the time to even bother considering working on it. Most of my days since August this year have just consisted of classes, go to work, relax for a bit, go to bed, and wake up and do it all over again the next day. I get to visit my friends maybe once a week for a couple hours, unlike over the summer where we'd hang out at least two or three days out of the week. My career as a teacher would be similar with the amount of work it would entail. I'd have the summers off, but was that going to be what kept me going in that job? Work most of the year, then spend my summer vacation writing my book? To me, it seemed horrible. I could see myself becoming one of those horrible teachers who's lost their zeal for teaching, only coming to work each day on the promise of a pension and eight weeks of summer vacation. What a dreary existence, I thought. 

So, I'm at an impasse. I have a perceived responsibility to live up to everyone's expectations, made worse by the fact that I'm a bit of a people-pleaser. But I'm torn by the aspiration I've had for half my life that I want to write stories. I know for a fact that if I were to wholly dedicate myself to my book, I could have a complete draft written in a year and a half, maybe less. But I also know that this sort of dedication is a gamble. If my book isn't successful, then I might not be able to support myself or my future family (y'know, if I ever get around to finding a girlfriend). But I suppose my real concern is whether or not I'll be happy with whatever decision I make. I'm staying to finish out my Associate's degree in Secondary Education, but I am not yet making a decision either way if I'm going to transfer to finish the program and get my bachelor's or master's in it. I've resolved to leave that decision till after this coming spring semester. My biggest problem will be how my dad reacts since he's been the hardest on me to get moving with my career. I'm pretty frickin nervous about that. All that to say that this is one of the biggest decisions I'm gonna have to make in my life, so, yeah. Not feeling too good about it.

4456,plus-size-dude,1638929163,1,"I have been feeling very lonely and depressed lately. My wife and I have not been doing very well for a long time. We have been together for 4 years, lived together for 3, been married for a year now, we do not have any kids.

When we first got together everything was good. It was your normal everyday dating and I was still living with my parents and she was with her mother an then her sister.

We had met each other back when we were in high school working our first couple of jobs and we worked as servers at a banquet hall for three or so years. We were also with different people back then. 

My wife is 24 and I am 23. 

After the first year and we moved in together, that's where everything went down hill. The honeymoon phase was gone and we started to notice each other's flaws and things that weren't issues before gradually became more irritating.

I had very bad communication and relationship skills in the beginning of our time living together, which did not help things. She would blame me, we would argue, I would blame her, the work.
, we fought, threw things eventually as months passed. We were still intimate over the next year and a half and had agreed to end up going to counseling to try to save our relationship. 

It always seemed like there was a new issue developing for me one after the other. She would never tell me when things were an issue. She acted fine for over a year and even was sexual with me and acted completely normal. She would not speak about what was wrong and would tell me she's doing great and smile.

I had gotten a second shift job and we were on polar opposite schedules but I needed to take it to pay bills. It slowly ate away at us since we couldn't bring up issues or anything. It slowly just built up more resentment to my wife from me.

My wife does not feel any attraction left to me.

I have tried everything I feel like I can to fix my marriage. She doesn't want to be intimate, hold hands, or anything.

I am not saying I am innocent, my wife and I have never laid a hand on each other but certainly were not handling situations the best we could for a long time.

Gradually we got better and dealing with them but my wife has no desire for me or to save our marriage.

I have tried to use a book connecting through yes, and I had thought it was working but she lied to me about it and admitted she was acting okay rather than being okay.

I have no idea how to trust my wife and I just feel so alone. My wife is the only person I have really talked to for a long time. I do not have any friends really that I consistently talk to. I haven't had relations with my wife in Almost 4 months and she has no desire to make anything better and refuses to work with me.

I'm at my wits end and am becoming severely depressed. My family also knows none of this is going on and my anxiety and stress and depression is so bad I can't tell them. I am doubtful they would honestly care and help me out with it. I feel like they would just offer me judgement. 

I had been suicidal a little while back and the only thing that has kept me alive and going really is two good coworkers I have and my sister who has been talking to me occasionally. And my two cats, one of which is my wives cat 

I ultimately have a desire to love my wife, understand my wife, be with my wife, and help her feel complete at the end of the day and feel fulfilled just like I desire to.

She does not let the past be the past either. I have just gotten to the point where I say I have done what I can to make amends, I can not endure punishment for it any longer and am more than happy to work on solutions with you on how I can help you feel more loved and understood. She does not accept and refuses it.

I long for my wife and I to turn our marriage around. I told her I can't force her to stay and live with me. It would devastate me to see her go but I long for her happiness and my happiness too. I want someone who wants me mentally as well as physically and works through thick and thin with me.

I want that person to be my wife. I am willing to do whatever it would take to make things better, but I can't make someone do something they do not want to do.",lonely,Feeling lonely,2021-12-08 13:06:03

4463,DomesticExpat,1638927467,6,"For background, I've had a crush on a coworker (yes, I know the implications of this) for some months now, which became stronger after she told me I was hot and we started talking more on the job. I'd been planning to ask her out, but couldn't build the courage up yet. I'd been flirting subtly with her but always felt mixed signals from her. Finally I decided to ask her tonight, and got told ""no"" and that she's straight (I'm a lesbian), though she didn't seem taken aback by it or anything.

I'm used to rejections, I've been through them many times, but this one is hitting me harder. She's exactly my type, and for once I thought this would be going somewhere.

I handled it amicably with her, there's no way I could've known without asking. Plus I didn't want things to be strained between us since we're coworkers after all (and I obviously don't hold anything against her). I guess it's just another example of me thinking someone is actually interested in me... when, yet again, it's not the case.

I feel like I'll always be chasing the feeling of being wanted by someone, loved by someone, but with it always ending in rejection. I wish things would go right for me. I'm so lonely, I want this loneliness to end. But why try when this is the outcome every single time? Of being told they're not interested, or that they're not gay, or them simply ghosting me? I keep telling myself every time this happens it makes me stronger, but deep down every single rejection hurts as much as the last, and I'm just utterly heartbroken.

I keep telling myself that there has to be someone out there for me, somewhere, and that I'll one day meet her. But it's getting harder for me to believe that. It's getting harder to go on.

4467,PokeballYEET,1638925402,1,"[24M]I'm not sure how to explain this but I'll try my best to do so. Currently I'm doing my best to get by in life, got a job, trying to get my bearings straight. Currently living at home due to odd circumstances involving parent and family. Other than that, life is alright. 
I've been taking better care of my health,  physically and mentally. I've got a great group of friends and a few members of family who are an absolutely amazing support. I'm not entirely content with myself but working towards it the best as I can and trying to shift my perspective see the silverlinging and the positives in as many situations as I can, instead of focussing on the negatives and even seeing a lot more beauty in the world around is and learning to see more in those around me, including myself. While I may not be where I want to be, I'm still more than content with myself and working my ass off to get where I want to be. 

So what's the problem ?
An empty feeling in my heart. 

I'm a super phsycial, expressive, and emotional person. While I can have a lot of moments like this and share with friends and family,  it's a much different feeling sharing those emotions and connections with someone you either have deeper feelings for or are outright dating. To have someone who you connect with and understand ina way they only can and vice a versa. 

The most obvious answers as to why would be is because it's human nature or because of underlying issues (emotional disconnect from parents from a young age for many reasons) and using it as a means to cover that, maybe even because a good amount of those around me are in relationships while I'm on my own. 

To give better context I deal with depression and currently having help with that, so I've worked through a lot of those pent up feelings and emotions and those ideas that's held me back. I've grown quite a bit after seeing a counselor for the oast few years, plus dowing my own personal growth. Finally being able to enjoy my own company and being able to work towards those emotions and no longer feeling that need for someone for me to be happy with myself, for that validation. 

So then if I already feel validated,  mostly, on my own then why do I even ask this ? (Rhetorical)
Because even though I've learned to be my own anchor and to truly appreciate my friends and family,  something still feels a loss to me. 

I know it's not healthy but I've been trying to hold back these feelings and shut them out. 

Reason being that I'm also trying to leave my country and going to an entirely different life style. So looking  for and suddenly finding someone to suddenly relay that information on them is very inconsiderate to both parties, for hurting yourself and putting them between a rock and a hard place with so much pressure in what could be a lose lose situation. 

As it stands I'm trying to hold back these feelings of loneliness and, obviously,  it isn't doing me any good. It's been emotionally very difficult and keeps slowly eating at me little by little. Making somedays harder than others. 

I'm at a loss at what to do or feel in this situation.

Everything started on Friday, my brother that lives 10 hours away, was given a free ticket to come to a birthday party for his aunt on the mother´s side and he will stay for the weekend and go back to work and then come again on the 20th, for holidays and new year.  


On Sunday, when we went to see my father´s side of the family for a lunch and hangout, so he told me, ""I am gonna do something that´s gonna piss some people off but it must be done"", so he grabbed the box of my fathers ashes, he passed away in January, and they were just sitting on his old room behind a lock door accumulating more dust, so my brother was like ""I dont want him to be enclosed in one room accumulating dust, I much prefer him being in his mother´s home with his mother and his side of the family"" And I was like, that´s great to hear, yeah.  


So incomes Monday, AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? Somebody was pissed off. The widow that may I add, already has a new boyfriend and its reportly marrying him, was like ""Where are his ashes? HE IS MY HUSBAND, THIS AND THAT, bla bla bla"" and I was the only one here enduring her madness. And something just clicked on her crazy head.  


She hasnt come to this house in months, his son was here and she was on an apartment, but now, we touched something, and she was like MY HOUSE. She even kicked her son to the apartment and she moved in with the the smallest sons, even uploaded a picture on Monday night of her in the bed with them saying ""I missed my bed"" and its like so weird. The other day she unplugged the fridge because it wasnt working properly and I was like ""Oh but I need it on for my food and Ice"" so I plugged it and the whole night it was broken so next morning no fresh water, the meat that was on the freezer for her son all rotten a mess.  


I dont know its a chaos and I am the one here having to endure all, and I have mental problems and tend to go off the rails If I get to ticked off and I got to be careful because everything could be used in court. So yeah, my weekend was interesting, now she feels like she is the queen of everything and I have to stand here alone until the 20th, all my family knows that if she goes 1 inch over the edge, I am letting the know and they are bringing the cops in, because she cant do shit in this house without letting the other people know, the house is of us three the, so she needs to say something to us first, but if she goes 1 inch over the edge, and just pushes it a little too far, SHIT IS GONNA HIT THE FAN.

Loneliness can really eat you alive if you let it. I feel like one day, it might consume all of me.. and I won’t be able to stop it.

Eventually the loneliness will win. I can feel it. I’ll just have to live my life.. with no friends or social life. Nothing. I’ll always be stuck..

There are situations that put me back into reality and let me know that it was just my destiny to be alone.

I get lied to constantly and fed these sweet compliments.. I hear “I love you” “I miss you” “You’re the only one who stayed with me” “you’re everything to me” and I allow her back into my life over and over because I have no one else. I like hearing that I mean something. But I feel like it’s all fake.. I’m holding onto a lie and false hope.

This is the straw that broke the camel’s back. This is what told me that I will always be alone. I will never be important. No matter how hard I try to make friends or engage.. nothing ever works for me. 

I planned on discussing this with my therapist tomorrow but because luck is on my side, I won’t be able to speak with her for a while, or ever again.

She was the only one I could talk to.

Now I’m back to no one.

I have nothing to look forward to in life. My job is a dead end. I don't have the ability to learn new skills or improve on existing ones so I can't get a better paying job, or go back to school, or whatever else people do to pivot to a new career.  

I still live with my parents. I have 2 siblings, one lives across the country, the other is younger and has a full social life and no time for their deadbeat brother. My dad treats me like I don't exist unless he needs me to do something for him. My mom is the only person in my life that I spend any length of time with, but without a ton of things in common, it's not a lot, and oftentimes she makes me feel more lonely, esp. with her opinions on global events recently.  

I don't have anyone else to hang out with IRL so I spend 95% of my free time in my room. Video games, movies, and TV are all slowly getting lower quality as time goes on. Or I'm just enjoying them less. Probably a bit of both. There's nothing that I'm looking forward to.  

I have no goals, ambitions, dreams, or desires. The only thing I've ever wanted was to be loved by someone. To have a partner. But because of who I am (unattractive, unintelligent, unmotivated/unambitious, lazy, narcissistic, and witless), that will never come to pass. Especially with the pandemic changing society to be less social. People around here have basically entirely stopped socializing with strangers. Restaurants, bars, pubs, clubs, and even places like libraries, gyms/classes, museums, and parks are filled with groups of people, but rarely people spending time alone. MeetUps are all online, most in-person social events are by reservation only and thus require groups of 4 or more, etc. etc. etc.  

Suffice to say, I feel more alone today than I ever have in the past. And I'm more at a loss than ever in regards to how to rectify this. I truly don't believe there IS a way to fix how I feel anymore. I'm 99% certain that I am doomed to be alone for the rest of my life.

you’d think it gets easier after a while. but it’s the opposite. each time someone leaves it hurts more because I cared about them even more. because despite how many people had proved otherwise I trusted them and they still left. 
I think I just get too much to deal with. habitual self harm, making myself throw up every other meal, and the occasional suicide attempt every few months. not that I can even get that right.
and I’m not mentioning it for fucking pity points. I’m mentioning it because they’re the big three things that always get too much for people. even when I purposely don’t ask them for help.
maybe they leave so they don’t have to see someone they care about destroy herself. I guess that makes sense. 
I don’t know. I’m overworked from life. tired. I haven’t slept in two nights because I can’t shut my eyes without fuck-awful nightmares and they’re really bad atm. and it’s been three years, six months 17 days since I last had a hug.

I've never had chatted with someone where they seem pretty interested in me and how I am or how I thing.

On top of it, my parents are constantly emotionally abusive and I'm overwhelmed by the pressure they're putting on me when it comes to my career. They keep pushing me into places and situations I don't want to be in.

I started talking to this guy a couple of days ago, and I thought we really hit it off. We flirted for a bit and had a good conversation with each other for the past two days, only for him to soft ghost me today. I was really hoping to go out with him and this just made me feel even sadder and lonelier.

4567,RickiestTinyRick,1638880447,3,"Always been told people enjoy talking to me, plenty of people have confided in me, asked my advice, I've helped with a lot but always felt no one ever noticed or cared about me. 

Point in case, I was a high functioning alcoholic for 8 years, currently 465 days sober. In that time when I was drinking though I had plenty of people say ""I just look at you and smile"" or ""Nothing seems to phase you, you're always happy"" etc etc, not realising I was drinking so heavily I ended up in hospital on more than one occasion. 

Yet despite being an alcoholic, no one ever asked how I was, I even tried telling a few people I thought were close friends but I either had no reply or was told ""I'm sure you'll be cracking jokes tomorrow."" I thought, surely someone must notice but, being sober made me realise they either noticed and didn't care or never cared enough to notice. 

I've spent the last year in a new job role, continiously helping others to the point where I've worked 70+ hours a week but only get paid for the 37 I'm contracted to, all so I can get my work done whilst helping a lot of other people. I've made a huge effort to remember significant things about them/their families to hold a conversation about them with them, got them gifts on birthdays and cards etc. 

Today is my birthday, I have the week off work to relax, so far the only messages I've received are from people asking me for work related help even though I'm off, one of them being from a person I've known/worked with/helped for 10 years. 

I feel I put so much effort into others &amp; though I know I'm not perfect, a lot of these people then just don't even reply to me if I message them. Or in work, I could spend an hour sat with them, helping them through systems/information/teaching them but then if I need some info from them to actually do my job, simple info too, it can take weeks/multiple reminders from me before they actually do it. 

I just feel I'm constantly taken advantage of and although I know I am to blame since I choose to help, it's usually because of the fact I was an alcoholic and how I wished someone would've just asked how I was, so I believe you never know what people may be going through so I like to help. But when it comes down to it, I know the second I'm no longer useful to these people/they don't need something from me, they don't talk, they stop being nice, stop actually treating me like a human. 

It would've just been nice if even one of them, especially those who have messaged asking for help, had even remembered or said ""happy birthday"" but the fact they haven't just makes me think, they don't even put effort in to remember that one thing about me, some didn't even know my full name despite knowing them for years. 

Just felt like a vent, would be nice to think a person actually thinks of me outside of just wondering what I can do for them",lonely,"Honestly, I don't know where I'm going wrong anymore",2021-12-07 23:34:07

I'm always the guy taking shifts for others at work, I ask people around me to give strangers the benefit of the doubt when that stranger makes them angry, and I take pride in being considerate of other's emotions and boundaries. I try to respect everyone and be kind.

But I feel so lonely because I do not like to be around most of them.

People my age especially are intolerable. They obsess over politics to defend their pride, valuing being correct over finding truth. They would rather spend their time jumping from quick satisfactions over cultivating fulfilling experiences such as travel or talents or careers. Their sense of humor is awful, laughing more at mocking caricatures of enemies instead of well-timed observations. 

The internet has created problems as well. Never before has there been such a variety of similar people. A multitude of niches exist but the members of these niches all crowd around the same objects of affection.  It makes many people horrifically mundane to talk to, with most of their insights and interests coming from the same sources. 

I feel terrible about all this because I feel my strong hypocrisy. I know I am a cliche nerd-boy into stupid nerd-boy things. I'm aware that I'm also stubborn and weak-willed. But I still can't bring myself to enjoy my time with others. It's always a painfully dull experience that brings disappointment. 

I have maybe 5 or 6 very close friends I adore and cherish. I have maybe 20-30 other friends that are chores, and all the other acquaintances that I don't enjoy spending time with.

I crave to be with others but feel alone, not because I'm not understood or that people don't like me, but that I specifically don't enjoy their company. It's not even about hate; I don't HATE any of these people. They are all incredibly reasonable individuals who I hold no grudges against.

I do anything they want, and try to keep any of my needs out of their sight. I don't have anyone in my life who I can ask for a hug and not feel as though it is a chore for them.

I’ve always struggled with bouts of depression and negative thoughts since I was a teenager, but the last 2 years or so have been the darkest so far. Along with depression I’ve also developed anxiety and started to have panic attacks pretty constantly, the pandemic has been especially rough as I lost 5 family members over the span of about a year, and didn’t get to say goodbye to any of them really. The place I live had strict regulations during the pandemic so funerals either didn’t happen, or were very brief. I also lost touch with many of my friends and developed an issue where I struggle to communicate with people, even if they reach out to me.

I know this isn't so much of a big issue, because at least I have someone to talk to. But its just bothering me so much because it just makes me feel so unwanted ,and not her priority at all.

I even gave her my number some time ago and told her we could chat there if we wanna get closer, but she didn't message my number.

A quick PS: First time posting and writting on the internet how I feel and in reddit so, my apologies if I did something wrong. 

Well since I'm going through depression(not sure if I could say that with medical help so it's ok, i'm fine)  writting this down can help me.  Well I've just lost two close friends to COVID((last week) and another one is leaving to Germany and I'm feeling kind of empty, left behind and lost. We used to speak in discord all the week, and play some games just to chill and when we could we hang out. So it was quite of a punch when I realized that we wouldn't do that anymore or see each other. It was quite a punch to handle, and maybe if all of this was not at the same time I could have handled better. Anyway I'm writting here to see if anyone wants to hangout or chat in discord, or even play something.

4630,rainbow_doom,1638850251,1," I need to get this out, and while talking to my cat is usually sufficient, I'm really feeling like I need an intelligent ear on the other end today. It's okay if no one interacts, I just don't have anywhere else to go. I tried to post in another group, but it got auto deleted. Probably because I'm so new to Reddit, but I can't talk about this stuff on my FB, and that's the only other socialization I have. 

For background:  
About ten years ago, I found out that the love of my life had started using hard drugs and I, for the sake of my health and my sanity, left. I have never been the same. I come from an incredibly broken place and loving anyone is difficult for me- opening up to others in a way that lets them love me back even more so. When I fell in love, I thought it as close to a miracle as I'd ever see in this world. When my heart shattered like a hot glass doused in ice water, I thought I would never put myself back together again, but there was almost a symmetry to it; I got to be perfectly exuberantly happy for a few years and if my broken heart was payment for it, I happily accepted because those few years were the best thing I have ever felt.  
We spoke a few times over the past ten years, but always in extreme case. I received condolences when my father died. When his mother was on her death bed, I heard he had no vehicle so I sent the offer for rides if desired so that he could be with her in her final days and still keep working. (He didn't take me up on it.) Those few text messages were all the interaction we had after I left him. We never saw each other in person again, or even spoke on the phone. Despite everything, I still love him. There are days when it hurts so bad to feel like the one chance I had at real happiness and family was destroyed. It wasn't my fault, but it was ashes, nonetheless.  
My father was a drug addict that left when I was young. My mother, a religious nut, has told me flat out that I won't be worth anything until I get married and have babies (although the requirement that I join and believe in her cult has been nixed from the list since I was a teen, so I guess she's compromising as best she can \**snort\**). The thing I learned the most from them was that I get to decide who gets a piece of me, and those that do should earn it, because my love is worth something. It's powerful, and it's good, and I can make people's lives better, but I'll be damned if I'm going to exhaust myself for people that don't give a shit about me no matter who thinks that I should. I know, and knew then, that to go back to him would be to defeat myself, to give up on and abandon a part of myself that losing would destroy me. Having allowed myself to be vulnerable enough to love someone, and then getting my teeth kicked in (metaphorically), I feel very convinced in my life that I will never have another great love. How could I possibly? As someone in their early 30s, the thought that my relationships will forever be unsatisfying is terrifying and depressing.

This summer, a few days before my birthday, I found out that he died. Violently, though likely at his own hand (it's impossible to really know in that town, and there was no investigation). The word that came down to me was that he was clean off the H, working, turning his life around and heading down the right path, saving up money to get out of the dead-end river valley that has chewed up so many others. Even though I knew that we could never again be the beautiful and pure thing that we had been, I had been happy to hear he was doing well- I really wanted him to find a measure of happiness and peace and to find someone else to have a life with. I wanted him to succeed. Today, it's been six months and I still feel absolutely gutted over it. There's a part of me that just can't believe he's not out there anymore. I hate him for what he did to us, but I still love him so much. I don't know how to move on.

Now, please don't make fun of me for this, but I'm starting to feel like I'm being haunted, and not just by my own thoughts.

A particular song, that makes me think of him (and that no one would ever guess is the song that brings him to mind) came on the radio today. I didn't turn it off, but I was feeling off about it. I know running from grief won't do anything to help, but I scolded myself a bit, because while I know logically that grief isn't something you can control, part of me hates that I still grieve for a pipe-dream future that stopped being a potential reality a decade ago. I was driving and thinking to myself that it was silly to still think of him in that way at all, when a vehicle suddenly pulled out in front of me and the drastically slowed down. I slammed on my breaks, cussin'. I'm about to lay on my horn, when the vehicle finds its accelerator and moves forward, revealing its custom license plate.

It was his last name.

I went from being annoyed with myself for being mushy to crying my freakin' eyes out. Luckily, I was close to my destination, so I didn't have to pull off on the side of the road- but come on! What are the odds?! A twenty-year-old song comes on the radio, and I get emotional; think I'm being silly because I feel like he's haunting my mind and then get the biggest sign that he might actually be haunting me.

I don't actually believe in ghosts, but today... I'm not saying I believe now, but it felt like something was there with me today. This was hours ago, and I'm still feeling rattled. I feel ridiculous. I don't believe in ghosts, but I believe in signs, and I can't fathom what the freakin' odds could be of all of that colliding like it did today.

So, yeah. I just needed to get that out. I don't know if I have a point at all, other than to reach out and feel a little like I shared this, because while I'm currently sitting still, I feel like I'm pacing at a thousand miles an hour. It would be very like him to say hey by having a vehicle pull out in front of me like that. XD Maybe I'm just crazy. I feel a little crazy right now.

Thanks for reading. If you've made it all the way through my rambling madness, best wishes on ya. If any of you can relate on the ""I don't believe, but you wouldn't believe the weird that happened to me..."" kinda thing, I'd love to hear your stories too.

4642,weeman2525,1638846200,1,"I turn 31 next week. I lost my virginity at 25. Before that I was never really lonely, sure I thought about sex and relationships, I had a college crush that didn't work out, and it hurt, but I got over it. It was still nothing that consumed me, like it does now. When I was 24, on a whim I signed up for Tinder and some of the other dating outlets. Really just to test the waters, not expecting much. I also started to explore my bi side and got on Grindr and some of the gay outlets. It was a full year before I met anyone. The first person being a guy actually, so I guess technically my first time was with a guy. It wasn't too much longer before I met a girl and had sex as well. Having a little bit of luck increased my confidence. I started working out and lost a bunch of weight and looked better than I ever have to this day. As I started to look and feel better, the more dates and sex I was able to find. I realized at some point I wasn't into guys romantically, just sexually. Still I was having fun keeping things casual and having regular sex for the first time in my life.

After a couple of years though I was ready for a relationship. Casual sex had lost its luster, and by this point hooking up with men wasn't even fun anymore, just a means of getting off. So I started to try and get a girlfriend, date the right way, hold off on sex, etc. I soon found out this got me nowhere. I was good enough sometimes to be given a shot, but ultimately things would go nowhere. This always confused me, because girls have always complimented me on how well I treat them and how comfortable I make them feel, and have thanked me for making the whole process easy. For whatever reason that didn't matter because ultimately they would ghost me or move on. I know my 5'3"" height and being average looking probably has a lot to do with that, but I don't want to completely put the blame on that, but at the same time I don't know what else to put the blame on? I've always tried to treat people like human beings, and usually they're receptive of that. So I just don't know why it hasn't happened for me yet? When I think about a couple of girls that I had potential of making the next step with, I rack my brain and try to think if there's anything I said or did that might have halted things, and I honestly can't come up with anything.

It has led to me becoming very depressed. I traded evening gym sessions for hitting the bottle. I put back on most of the weight that I lost. I became a borderline alcoholic. I have got that in check pretty good now days at least. I just feel so dead inside. I only experience fleeting moments of joy. I just want someone to share my life with so bad. Back to my original point though, I never felt like this in my early adulthood before I had romantic experiences. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I'm not a virgin, I'm glad I've experienced things, but at the same time I was so much more content before. All things considered, I probably don't let my loneliness get me down as much as I think it does.

I ended two soon to be relationships with two guys, first I told him i wasn’t ready despite me saying let’s be yk bfs. And well he got mad at me, ik it’s not my fault I even apologized made it as sincere and yk respectful as I could.

The other I told him I wasn’t ready and he told me yk, he respected my decision and we wished each other the best. 

I love being single, ok and ik this was my fault I’m sorry for hurting them in anyway and I told them I love them and cared about them, but chatting with them couldn’t happen bc I didn’t want to idk. 

Sure for something I lied, yk but was cuz I didn’t know how to tell the first guy he wasn’t my type and the second that our awkwardness was a major problem, so I did lie partly. Not completely, it’s not cuz I’m a bad person it cuz I’m not used to this. I’m not very honest when it’s painful.

I did this cuz I wasn’t ready and that’s my choice I thought I was but I’m not, I feel terrible cuz I hurt them unintentionally. And I wish them better health and a better person than me, I feel there pain and I wasn’t ready.  I’ve single for too long that I can’t live any other way.

Idc if u think its my fault, I hurt them ik I didn’t mean to and I was feeling horrible. But no ik how it feels and I regret talking to them cuz I would’ve never hurt them. But I truthfully believe it wasn’t my fault, it was unintentional I’m not a person who ignores others pain I feel it but i didn’t mean to hurt them to me it’s no ones fault.

I’m deeply sorry for hurting those two, I’m even more sorry for ever thinking a relationship would help, I’m sorry for everything and tho ik it can’t change anything I want everyone to know that I’m sorry. And also that I’m sorry for everyone hurt anyone I didnt mean for this to happen but it did and I’m sorry. I’m sorry I tried to end it in better way than most people would but ofc that didn’t happen. But I hurt them and whose fault doesn’t matter just I’m sorry I wish u all the best.

4678,DramaticShadow,1638833072,1,"Hey everyone. Been feeling really lonely recently, but I have quite a bit to say and I will do my utmost to keep it """"brief"""".

I live on a small island called the Isle of Man. There's around 80,000 people on the entire island. Keep this in mind as you read the post.

In high school, I was bullied. I was that kid that was last to be picked for sports teams, sat in the corner away from the ""cool kids"". I was called ugly, I became type 1 diabetic in 2015 which caused the ignorant children to bully my weight (Even though I am slightly UNDERweight). I fell to gaming as my escape from all of this as it was the only place I felt like I fit in. Things did not improve very much at college; I was in a class of around 14 other people, all boys, who felt like fake friends to me. I still felt exiled and separated from the group as I always felt.

In my darkest moments I completely and utterly neglected my diabetes because I never cared about myself. Last time I went into hospital, in 2019 with diabetic ketoacidosis, I was told I was a maximum of 9 hours from death or serious long-term damage.

Nobody cared. Even my mother was so blinded by frustration at my neglect that she accused me of doing it on purpose to ruin her weekend.

Fast forward to now, 2021. I'm 20 years old. My self esteem absolutely and utterly destroyed for almost 7 years going. Zero confidence in my habits, no talents, no friends. Type 1 diabetes is still an everyday part of my life and I deal with it well. I don't 100% behave but I am healthy. In between school and now, I played video games almost every single day. I was contempt with it, until a few months ago when I got my first job and started meeting people who I felt were genuinely friendly and wanted to be around me.

So I stopped.
I stopped gaming entirely.

I realised that socialising with people is what I want to do. I hate that I wasted so much of my life sat at my desk. I feel like I've left it too late but I've finally, at the bitter end, made the decision to change my life. However after making this decision, my feeling of loneliness has increased. I kind of expected it, after letting go of something I've done for most of my life so abruptly was obviously going to get me down a little. But my sense of loneliness isn't fixed anymore by video games. It exacerbates it.

My main problem is, I feel like half the people I talk to at work are talking to me because they have to. I've added them on a couple of socials and most seem to disinterested in talking to me, responding so unbelievably closed-endedly I am reminded of why I never went out to do this in the first place. I finally work up the courage to ask people for their social details, and I'm shown why I never had it in the first place. For the couple of people who DO want to talk to me, I've asked them to invite me to their next outing so I can hopefully open a window and meet new people that way. Diabetes makes it awkward, going out drinking and all that, and I'm fairly self conscious about injecting insulin still, but I'm desperately trying to change it.

I'm trying to feel more confident in myself. I don't think I'm ugly, but I am not as attractive as other men around me. I wish I could just show people my face and tell me I'm wrong, but I can't help how I feel. People have said (I'm not referring to the free compliments subreddit here, although it does slightly contribute to it) that I have a really cute face, yet despite my efforts, I cannot bring myself to believe them. Confidence is a massive block to me that I cannot seem to step over. I just need to open one window. But self doubt and a ruined self esteem is stopping me. Am I even worthy of meeting people with a face like this? With the past I had of being a lonely nerd?

This post is long now. I apologise. I just wish I made my decision to quit gaming earlier since I feel so behind the trends at the moment, and can't fit in with people near my age. Girls ARE talking to me a bit more, so there has been progress made. 

I'm just tired of staring at the ceiling. I want a friend, finally, to go out with, to enjoy life with. I'm happy I've let my bad habits go, but my self esteem issues are so deeply rooted I wonder if I will ever get past them.

My PMs are open for anybody. I'm a good conversationalist. And if you so happen to live where I do, I'd love to do something with you. Sorry for the long post, and if I read it all, you're the fucking best.",lonely,Bittersweet Feeling of Changing My Life,2021-12-07 10:24:32

I am someone who is extremely lonely, I am an atheist and i’ve become seemingly very isolated and alienated. I was brought up in extreme Religious indoctrination and I am not here to bash on religion but this was extremely harmful incarnation of it. Nearly destroyed my life, I don’t have much family I am from out of state originally and the family I have is not really worth having. I live in a very religious area where that is some thing that is considered a priori regarding any type of social interaction. I was once fairly prominent in religious circles but since I have abandon that eight years ago, I lost all the illusion of community. I have a core group of friends that I consider a surrogate family and are part of the only reason I continue to go on even though I’m about to have my bachelors degree in April. I have experienced a lot of personal loss over the past two years a lot of death and I already suffered from mental illness before then. I am on the autism spectrum and I have major depressive disorder with increasingly worse anxiety. I am also a chronic pain patient with several diagnoses. I have people in my life, but I don’t see them that often and I have zero community.  Covid has not helped in that regard, but even before that I was pretty much living as a voluntary pariah. I have no prospects of any romantic relationship, mostly because I am bad out of shape and because I don’t have any religious affiliation. I mostly stay at home and try to take care of my grandmother who I moved in with several years ago to take care of and I love her and she loves me and we’re very close, but we’re also extremely different people. My mother lives up the street, but again close but very different. The problem isn’t that I don’t have any people, it’s that I don’t know what community is anymore. It’s very difficult for me to get out because of my physical and mental issues, but when I do as it has been the experience over the past 10 years the more I moved away from religion the less people wanted anything to do with me.

I've only seen her ONCE this year which was over the summer. But that's only because I invited her out to eat for her birthday! and it was a week later because she was to busy for me and I called her out on it so she had no choice but to accept my invite. 

She knows what I'm going through but doesn't even care to come see me. My best friend literally came to see me when I had a mental break down about my herpes diagnosis and was there for me and took me out to eat (made me feel normal again) this was last week.

Well how do u think I'm doing!! ???



I haven't replied to her text. I honestly want to call her out for being a shitty person. The only thing she cares about is spending time with her boyfriend. I'm just tired of her half assing me.

Everyday i think of killing myself, i spent a lot of time thinking on how to do it, i was very close once, but the police came and ""scared"" me away.

I have been writing a bunch of letters, i'm not really sure what to same in them.. it's hard to get things worded..

Most of my life i had had few to zero friend, it get's really lonely.. trust me.. Most days i do not have anyting to look forward to, it can be tough but the world is a tough place. I think there can be a beauty in just that though, it makes you a appreciate the little things, a beautiful girl, a good song, maybe just a fun game you played.

I have never had a girlfriend, never even kissed a girl. I'm really sad about that.. I wanted someone i could give all my love to and get the same back.. ohh well, maybe i wasn't meant to have that.

4709,Mauspad454,1638819588,1,"As a teenager I never comprehended why people took their lives even in developed countries since most of the people are not enduring the same hurdles in life.

I didn't understood why some of my classmates where so tired and listless. I loved math and going to school. I loved playing football. 

-Primary School-
 
They made fun of me and my cloth. Fun of my shoes. Fun of my teath pointing out that they are yellow like my shoes which my mum got me from socond hand.
At the end we got all friends and respected each other. 

I had one friend Joe whose parents where divorced. He was the class clown bringing other people laughter while he was getting punished. 
Lis, my other friend whose father died at a young age was laughing most of the time for no reason. 

-Middle School-

I am at a new school with new people. 

Got bullied for doing my homework and beening good in class. But I didn't give a fuck since I wanted to go to a better school and be free of those people. Got respect by beating up the bullies and that's it.

I had a friend from whales. I didn't understood why he was so lifeless most of the time. 
And Nico wasn't  attending class and having a suppressed mood. 

Later I heard that Timothy's mum was divorced and could pay the rant barely and Nicos mum had cancer. 

My coach and mentor had also cancer. The time I visited him in the hospital we talked a lot about the future. While looking together a documentary about cars he suggested me to study mechanical engineering since I like tech stuff and according to the newspaper he read about 44.000 engineers where in demand. 
He died one year later. I stopped playing football and focusing on school. 


-High School-

Again new people never seen before. But this time I was struggling since I was working and didn't had the time. 
I missed a lot of school stuff cause I was into selling stuff and making money. 

The students where starting to avoid me since I was bad at school. 

Injustice, bias, racism, hidden racism

The teachers where bullying me for being bad at school all the time making fun of me, my heritage, my religion. Asking me weird racist questions about my roots and even sabotaging my grades. 

Investing, Hope

I decided to sell all stuff and invest in something to be free of work when I am studying. I bought silver and crypto currencies like 500.000 doge for 50$
at a premium price at that time 

Depression

At that time I started getting depressed on my own.
Griefing for my dead coach and missing the old times where everything was simple. 

I developed an bipolar disorder and started hearing noices in my head because of the constant bullying. 
For the next 4 years I never attended a doctor cause the disease is developing really slow. 

-Collage, manic and depressed-

Surprisingly I got accepted. I got manic at the same time. I started seeing everything in a good way. Colours where popping off like I am under drugs.

Moved far away from my hometown, found somewhere to stay, and started studying. 
I learned more in one semester than 3 years prior. 
My manic phase decline from week to week. 

People surround me where starting avoiding me again since I was not the same person as before. 

I got real depressed. Stopped eating and just laying, thinking what I was doing wrong all the time.

Why am I alone? Why do I feel like a foreigner in my own country? Why didnt my parents support me when I was broke even when they had money? Why I was that stupid and believed in religion? Why nobody helped me when I needed it the most before? Why I want to hang myself? Why I don't want to get help?
Why I am afraid of relationships? 

I am an open hearted person. I know all answers to my questions. Nevertheless I am greatfull for experiencing depression. Now I can understand and feel people better now. 

I changed from that energetic optimistic kid I was to a pessimistic person with so much hate inside.

I never understood why people would harm themselves, jumping from campus building, jumping in front of trains, but I do now.

I felt very lonely and left out thats why I think this friend decided to talk to me he seemed like my best friend at the time until we formed a group and now everyone seems to not like me, but they always come back and just when i get my hopes up that maybe it was all in my head they’d do something like ditch me at lunch and completely ghost me

That's generally the people say will help and make my situation better. But it doesn't really matter doesn't it? Think about it. No matter how much I like my self and how true it might be that my character is great, people generally don't care. For example, I'd like to have some intimacy in my live again, but I'm short (1. or 5.2 feet), not muscular or athletic, shy, obvious nervous around people, the opposite of confident etc. All things people see from the get go and obviously turn away from. Because you might don't care about hight, but maybe you don't like shy people, and so on. People like me have so many things that are not appealing, that at least one or two things will scare away people. So people don't even want to get to know me better, what in the end means, is that all things that might be good about me are worth shit, because no one will bother to get to know them. So what can I do, in a world where just the outside matter, how you look, if you behave ""normal""? I mean Internet kinda works to find people to talk to, but it doesn't really help for the basic need of human touch. I just feel helpless and have no hope to meet someone that genuinely likes me.

I hate myself everytime I think of people I ghosted because they must be so confused and possibly even upset because they might think they did something wrong when 99% of the time it's because I'm too afraid that I'll fuck shit up or that I'm too afraid to let them know that I won't be able to respond to them for whatever reason at the time.

As a bisexual, kinky dude who's into pup play and is a furry, it sounds like my kind of crowd. I've never really had a social life, and I'm hoping this'll an awesome opportunity to meet weirdos like me.

A tiny part of my anxiety is that's going to be a insanely new and different environment for me, which is also very exciting, but what I'm scared of and why I'm posting this here is the thought that it'll change nothing for me. Like, all my life I've always been the one to be totally ignored in any sort of social group, the one to try and add to the conversation but no one notices, the one that has to go up to people because no one goes up to him, and even then they don't really show interest in speaking to me. I'm just picturing me standing in the sideliness all night standing out about as much as a potted plant and leaving without having made a single friend or even having really spoken to anyone.

It's not important for me but I don't know why it hurts if my husband shows it's not important for him too.

To be fair, he picked me up from work and asked where I want to eat. I told him where but they were closed when I called. I called a couple more restaurants but no luck. I got frustrated because he didn't even take a few minutes to call ANY restaurant in advance to book a table for us. I was really sad, hungry, and pissed off.

I recently got out of a toxic and hard relationship that’s drowning me a lot with this because I relied on him a lot. I’ve been inside my house for the past two days not really doing anything and just absorbing being alone and I can’t handle it at all. I go to therapy but I still don’t feel helped. I was on medication but I don’t want to be on it anymore. I try to stay off social media because I see too many people having fun and happy and whatever so I stay off but then I’m just stuck inside with no one to talk to and nothing to do and I feel so empty and alone. I don’t have a drive to do anything like I used to and idk what I want in life anymore. I’m struggling to keep myself together but it’s hard when I just love someone and they completely trash me down and now I have nothing to work for bc that was the one thing I wanted.

I have been made fun of behind my back for opening up about my feelings of loneliness and hopelessness.

I laugh when people say they want men to be more vulnerable and open up more. All that's done for me is ruin relationships and made me realize just how alone I am in this world.

We met 3 months ago and he recently asked me to be his gf. 

I felt that he felt pressured to ask me to be in a relationship. But I turned a blind eye. I guess it’s because he felt that then I would talk to other people as as he said “I don’t want to run out of time”. This is someone who has somehow o a fear of commitment. 
He’s told me he loves and and I’m the greatest thing ever. But for the past few days … he isn’t as communicative with me. He tells me all the right words and is the sweetest but his actions dosnt really match up. 
 I notice that he never leaves his phone alone. He always takes it with him. Even to use the restroom. He’s always hanging out with his guy friends which it isn’t a problem.. until it becomes a problem because he hasn’t offered to even see me as of recent. 
He also hasn’t posted me on social media. No snap. No Facebook relationship status. No ig stories.but he is very active on social media.

I find there are many nights the soul-crushing isolation I feel 24/7 just creeps into my mind in really sharp focus, and it takes me hours to finally get to sleep. When I do sleep, I either wake up constantly throughout the night, or I've been having the worst nightmares I've ever had in my life, which have even led to episodes of sleep paralysis where I'll wake up and see some horrifying shadowy figure standing in my room.

Like, last night I went to bed feeling particularly down, and I had a dream where for some reason I was sleeping in this big Victorian mansion, and through the doorway of the bedroom, I kept seeing this tall, skinny entity racing in and out of the shadows of the hallway, which was dimly lit by moonlight. At one point it finally showed up in my room, and I ducked under the covers in the childlike belief that blankets were some sort of magic force field against the monster in the closet. Turns out the weren't, because whatever the thing was pulled the blankets right off of me, and I started feeling this intense pressure on me like someone had turned up the gravity by 100. The best I can describe the creature was kind of like the twisted humans from the managa The Horror of Amigara Fault by Junji Ito, the ""DRR DRR DRR"" things, only it was way worse somehow. I remember trying over and over to scream but no sound came out, and even in my dream I was thinking ""WAKE UP! WAKE UP!""

Finally, I did wake up, only for that dream demon to actually be standing over me, and I was feeling a pressure on my body, and I was trying to scream except it was more of a low closed-mouth humming sound. After about 5 seconds that felt like 5 minutes, it stopped, and instantly the first thoughts that flooded into my head, as it always does when things like this happen, was ""If I had a social life and I was happy this wouldn't be happening.""",lonely,"Does anyone else have insomnia, really bad stress dreams, and once in a while sleep paralysis due to loneliness?",2021-12-07 03:17:59

So I’ve made posts before looking for friends and ive spoken to some great people but I always have this one thought in the back of my mind. 

I always think that people make up this image/perception in their head of how you look based on the things you say to each other and I feel like once they see me they will be disgusted at who they’ve been talking to this whole time. I know im not “attractive” and theres lots if things about me that I would change. I genuinely become so anxious the longer a conversation goes on because I think that they will ask to see a picture of me. 

I wanna know do people think the same as I do? And also for the people on the other side, do you care how the person you are speaking to looks and would you stop talking to a person if you thought they were “ugly” even if you spoke for a long time and shared things with eachother. 

Also do you care if the person you are talking to is ugly, and would you use that as a reason to ghost them? Even if you spoke anonymously for a long time and the convo was great beforehand

4755,BrainFog-Warrior,1638804300,1,"Im gonna start this off by saying I've been using substances since I was around 12 years old. It started with drinking, me and my best friend would steal liquor from his grandparents. Then when I was 13 I smoked pot for the first time. By the time I was a freshman in high school I was beginning to have my first signs of depression. This led me to using substances even more. As a sophomore I was smoking weed daily and getting drunk whenever I could. Id even get into the liquor cabinet before school and go in with a nice buzz on and have a couple cigs before school. I reached out to my mom and told her that I've been looking into counseling and that I felt that something was wrong with me. She thought it was just a phase and she really didn't believe in counseling/therapy. By junior year I was addicted to nicotine and experimenting with dxm and dph. Then senior year I was a complete mess, I came into school fucked up daily. My friends grandmother passed and we found her medicine stash that his dad had gotten from her. We stole the codeine, oxy, sleeping pills, anything that would get us fucked up. I slept through my 18th birthday because I was so messed up on pills. Then my friends gf hopped in the car one morning (we would get high every morning before school) and she had a huge rock in a baggy. She said she lifted it from her uncle that was passed out in the recliner. We all said we wouldn't do anything with it until we figured out what it is. She took it to her mom and her mom said it was heroin and gave it back to her. So we had a $300-$400 rock of heroin and were all sitting around it one night figuring out who would try it first. So I finally took the first line. Then we all cut up another and did it just to make sure it kicked in. As soon as I stepped out of the car I felt a wave of euphoria hit me like a train. We ended up doing lines all night without much research on heroin (I usually read into any drug i was gonna use)and loved it. We did this for a few nights and had to have trash bags to puke into to. We'd puke up pure water. I knew this shit was bad because I really didn't give a fuck that I was puking constantly. I started to come to my senses and stopped doing that shit. I knew it was too good to be true and that it was my downfall. Mixed to well with me besides the puking. Were lucky it was very potent h because we were ripping lines like coke and could've killed ourselves.

I want to get back on track for a minute and talk about the reason for my depression. My parents split up when I was 2 and I still have memories of him banging on the car hood while we were backing out of the door yard. So I ended up being raised by a single mom who was very poor but was doing everything she could. Around 6 years old she started seeing a guy named Tim. My brothers issues started to surface and he started picking on me pretty bad. I forget what age exactly he started beating on me. I was pretty young though and feared him. My mom was too busy working or was out with friends or tim to really notice how bad he was harassing me. My sister has to protect me from him, sometimes they'd end up fighting as well. So I dealt with the absence of my mom and the beating from my brother for a while. I ended up pretty much living at my best friends grandparents. Id go there whenever I could. A few years later my friend ends up moving to New York so I end up back home. Back to my brother and now Tim was fully in the picture. Me and Tim have a very rocky relationship. He's an alcoholic and would be up at 5am mixing his first drink to go to work. He'd come home and pick on me just because of his own pain inside. It got worse as I got older, we started butting heads everyday. He'd say something to get under my skin and then I finally would freak the fuck out and he would act like it was my fault and my mom would believe him. My brother was nicer to me by then but now I have this fucking asshole in my life. My real dad would show up sometimes all skinny and fucked up from drugs that I didn't even recognize him anymore. All I know is that I look like this guy but I never felt any connection to him. He didn't come around much just at the worst times, seeing him like that never helped my mental state. For years and years me and tim have been going at it. I've given him chances and have tried to repair our relationship. I love tim but he has successfully made me feel the pain he carries. Pain from the army. Pain from the alcohol. All of that hate, shame, and pain that lingers. He has put all of it on me since i was a kid. He would pick on my sister and brother but with me it was more psychological. Im 22 now and im still struggling. I've battled myself with alcohol, I would drink way to much and go off the deep end. I've almost taken my life with the shotgun I got for Christmas. Id be drunk and drive myself to the hospital because I was having thoughts of driving into a mac truck or a tree. Just recently I got drunk at a college and got kicked out and decided I was gonna drive an hour to get home. I was all over the road and had a moment where I thought to myself ""what the fuck am I doing?"" I didn't know who to call, and I really needed to get myself shit together. I called the police and told them I was driving drunk and gave them my car model and where I was heading. Then I thought I could maybe get away with it and get home so instead of pulling over I kept driving until they found me and pulled me over. I had no shoes and was a complete mess so the cop kinda eased up on me after a while. We drove back to the jail and I ended up blowing a (.23) I spent the night in the drunk tank and got bailed out the next day. Im getting and OUI charge for sure but I dont really regret it because I've been sober for 3 months and nicotine free for a week now. Im finally starting to get myself together a little bit. I'm on meds, going to counseling, working a side job, and im signed up for a support group for my drinking. I went to my moms house on Thanksgiving and the first thing tim did was comment on something I was eating which was pecans out of a sandwich bag. He asked if they were good and I said yeah, then he said ""watermelon?"" Referring to a time last year when I showed up to the house high on lsd crying asking for help. (I had watermelon gummies that were dosed in a baggie on me) Nobody but me knew what he was talking about. He wanted me to feel that guilt and shame about that night. He wanted me to feel the way he does. He wanted me to cause a scene and make me look like the bad guy. Fuck him. I told my brother in law why he said that to me. We went out on a ride and talked, the he let me unload a clip of 9mm into a pumpkin we found on a backroad. I went back and was fine. Last night I went to my moms again for my brother's birthday party and was talking about being sober for this long and how I've kicked the nicotine habit. My mom gave me a high five and I told her thats not really an appropriate reward for what I just told her 🤣 like awesome great for you, high five! So she came over and gave me a hug and apologized. Then tim came over and tried to shake my hand and give me a hug but after all of these years of his emotional abuse I've grown cold to him. I purposely gave him a terrible handshake and stepped away when he tried to hug me. Now I want him to feel what I feel. What I've felt all these years. That coldness. My mom has always told to be the grown up of the situation when he's a 50 year old man picking on a kid. I've put a lot of time and effort into trying to build a relationship with tim. I've helped him out whenever he needed it despite all of the past hardships. I've went out and had a beer with him and let him tell me his pain from the army and the stuff he had done. But still at the end of the day he always treats me like garbage. Like im scum. He tells me that I remind him of himself, that doesn't help because he fucking hates himself. I've decided that im gonna break the chain of my families alcoholism. I dont want to be like these people anymore. Being that cold to tim last night has hurt my heart. I had a panic attack and my chest tightened up and my left armpit had a dull ache in it. I almost went to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. I finally told my mom I cant come over anymore. My heart can't take it.

It was such a good feeling to be reminded that I existed, that someone else remembered me and actively took steps to spend time with me or talk to me because they wanted to, and not because I started the conversation for the 100th time.

So often now do I find myself reaching out to people to do things or even just talk and they decline my invitations and don’t attempt to hold a conversation.

I just want to be wanted. Because… when no one tries to spend time with you or talk to you, it feels like they forgot about you. And my hopes and expectations are so low now that I just want my friends even remember to say hello these days.

I always try to keep my mind off the reality of things. Because of this I've created this alternate reality that I choose to believe about myself that I'm different, better, acceptable, lovable. It helps most of the time..

But there's often times like now when all of the fiction is swept away, leaving me naked to myself, so I can see who I really am and feel ashamed. The heater in my room isn't working for some reason, and it got cold quickly inside, and I felt my hands being so cold. This reminded me that they'll never feel the touch of another, who, in spite of all reasons not to be there, they're there. They're there for \*me\*. They're here to tell me that I don't actually know myself, that to them, I am good enough, I actually am lovable.. But that won't happen, because it's part of yet another hopeless dream of mine. Moments like these make my efforts to convince myself I don't need love futile. I get desperate again.

Why do I sometimes feel like I could love anyone, but after I'm shown the indifference of the whole world to me, I'm left to keep dreaming hopelessly?

So I am an 18 year old guy from Germany and lately I just feel incredibly lonely.   
To describe my situation, I graduated in July and started a FSJ (a social, voluntary year). I am pretty shy, have never had a girlfiriend and due to Covid things in general were pretty restricted these last few months. Now it is also winter so no one is really going out to do anything.   
On posts like these I often see people recommend you go to [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) or something, or join a club thats best suited for your interests, thing is, that doesnt really exist in my area.   
I go to the gym sometimes, but that isnt really a place to meet people, especially girls, I mean understandably you dont want to be interrupted by some random dude in the middle of your workout.   
So I have no clue what to do because I can already see myself just being alone for the next few months and I am handling it pretty badly already, hence this post lol.   
Also, yes there is still work and I am getting along pretty well with my my coworkers but that doesnt really extend beyond work hours, the events that happen in relation to my work are also online so that isnt the best way to meet people. I also get along with my family, but my sisters dont live at home anymore and just visit sometimes.   
So... any advice? Maybe there are even some germans in here who can relate, since I feel like this scarcity of available activities is pretty common here in Germany, I could be wrong though.",lonely,I have no idea how to make friends,2021-12-07 01:05:14

I'm very thankful to have a friend that I can talk to about all of this. Its better than keeping it all bottled up. However, when someone tells you ""just stop worrying about it, and it will all fall into place"" or ""it's perfectly normal,"" or ""I didn't have my first ____ until ____,"" does it only serve to drive you deeper like it does to me? That's great and all, but you're basically telling me I'm stupid for going through the effects of not EVER getting something most every human needs. 

""You need to learn how to be yourself."" 

""Love yourself first.""

""You won't have anything to give someone unless all your individual needs are met first""

What if one of my individual needs is emotional validation and intimacy? How do you give those things to yourself?
And which is it, do I stop worrying about it or do I worry about all my needs? How is you not having your first relationship until 18 supposed to make me feel better about having nothing by 22? 

Unsolicited advice is just that, unsolicited. I've heard it all before and I'll hear it all again. It's helped the same amount each time it's been said: zilch. I don't want to know how *you* think I should help myself, I want to know that how I feel is justified. I want to know I'm not wrong for wanting what I want. I want to know I'm worth it, because the world has told me my entire life that I'm not.

I feel he intentionally do this so I will always agree with him knowing that I am desperate to have a friend in real life. Not only that, I told him that I felt depressed and suicidal too which he also uses this to his benefit.
This a form of abuse right? What would you do?

I've always been a lonely person since I was young (talking to myself and having imaginary friends, the kid that doesn't have a friend in school, bullied, never hangout with people, etc). Not until in my uni years which I began to experience things like hanging out with my coursemates, and studying/doing assignments together eventhough I don't feel fit in. 

It's nearly end of my final year of uni and they will not talk to me anymore unless they have questions with uni stuff.

That uni experience made me crave for having actual friends that it really became a trigger for my depression and suicidal thoughts. I know I always felt down being alone since I was a kid but I never felt so bothered of not having actual friends before.

Spoke to a new person and i told them about this interaction and their response was “oh wow dam” and i jokingly said “oh woah don’t say tm words at once” and they didn’t reply and it was whatever. Then they came and said “i understand why that person said you made them uncomfortable”. I never tell anyone that their boring or trying too hard to be quirky or anything to target their personality or upset them. But of course these nobody assholes who have nothing else going for them have the need to make a person feel bad for essentially nothing.

4824,No-Refrigerator1232,1638772129,1,"About two months ago, I cut off ties in bad blood with my ex (we were on and off a lot yet still had deep feelings for each other). I think now I’m a lot more detached and can move on, but there are some days where it weighs me down like crazy. I don’t like admitting it, even to myself, because I know I have a deep hatred for how she left me. She cheated on me and couldn’t even apologize or own up to it; I tried everything to get around it and see good in her but when she forced me away, that’s when I realized it was completely over. She couldn’t even say goodbye. 

I know I dodged a bullet though, it just really sucks you know. She began to get hooked with people with bad habits, began doing drugs and drinking a lot (even did it while driving), and of course cheated on me. 

I’ll be honest we weren’t the best for each other. I was not a good person to her for a long time before. But when COVID hit, I had a lost my career opportunity and many close people to me passed away which made me appreciate the little I had left and grow up and mature after leaving high school. She even admitted I was a better person and was so happy to see it. 

However, she had left for college (4 hours away from me) and that’s when it all went downhill. I was (still am) having a hard time at my community college near home with people, but she had made a ton of friends while I could barely talk to anyone. 

I ended up in a really depressive state during this and I guess she couldn’t handle it anymore and couldn’t work with me like she always did before. 

I literally remember asking her if I could trust her; when it came to loving me, not cheating, not doing bad things, and more… but all she did was lie and get mad at me for it, when I just wanted to finally show her I can be a good person. 

I’d like to know what she thinks now, but at the same time, the best thing she ever did was cut me off because I realize my worth is far more than whatever she can say or do that’s related to me. I can’t believe I said I’d be there for her as a last message I had said if she needed anything, because when I think of it now, I don’t think I want to after realizing the pain she had left me in to deal with. I think the only reason I would help her is if something really bad happened and she owned up to everything, but even then, I don’t want to stay close to her afterwards. I’d help her because no person with a heart should be left in hurt or scared to be alone, not because I love her. 

I feel bad because I want to love really strong again, but it’s hard to because even for so much pain and time that’s passed by, there’s just this cloud of her that blocks me when i try. One side of me wants to be single because of how stupid relationships can be and the other wants to find love because I know better now.

It sucks because there’s this girl that I’ve talked to a lot these past months that has liked me for a long time. We even had sex a couple of times long after the shit with my ex, still hangout a lot, but I just feel like it’s too big of a rush for me to keep up. I tried to tell her I need things to slow down, but I don’t think she knows I mean that on an emotional level, not a physical one. 

Maybe this isn’t the right place to put this, but I put it in here because I do feel alone in the middle of it all. I just awful because I don’t know what I want and where to start? Yet at the same time, I know exactly what I do want. 

I want to feel loved strongly and feel secure from it. I want that because I know I’m mature now and learned from my past to go anew, yet, I feel like even when I take that small step, I get afraid or messed up from the past. 

I don’t know, I feel bad for the girl that likes me because I don’t know how I see her; I of course don’t see her as a body to just have sex with or anything, I actually appreciate the fact she genuinely does like hanging out with me, but I just don’t feel good enough to start so fast with her, or just in general. I tried to tell her by rounding the point, but never direct. 

I don’t know, just emotionally stuck i guess. This was all just a vent I’ve needed to let out.

I know she's out there, looking for me too, hoping to meet the one who really makes her feel special and worth something to someone.  I guess we all want that, to find a connection with someone and actually matter to them, to not just have flippant comments passed to us, but to find someone who actually gives a damn. But perhaps I'm just not meant to cross paths with the right person for me in this life.

Over the years I've reached out but always seem to come up empty handed, as if my grip isn't strong enough as I feel them slip through my fingers. A connection becomes a memory, a memory that fades into nothing but a long forgotten name of someone I used to know. Stumbling across an old picture that sparks the memory of a feeling of being content with my world, a fullness if you will.

I know that everything happens for a reason, it's something that I truly believe in. The heartbreak of a failed marriage, a child sobbing and begging me not to leave, but knowing that to stay would result in an environment a child should never have to endure. A relationship, albeit long distance, that meant so much only to have it torn away and feeling like I was kicked to the gutter. Countless encounters that ultimately end in hurt and pain. 

These are the lessons that life gives us to test our resolve, a journey of self discovery. A way of finding out just how much one can handle, while all along, others seem to sail through life. I'm sure they have their own battles, whether it be money, career, health, family... I read through the comments here and sometimes reach out, but I know I'm not alone.

But, I can't help but feel that at 46, time is running out for me, that perhaps I am destined to live out my days alone. If that's what my future holds, then I'm just about on the verge of acceptance. I'm tired of chasing what is seemingly becoming an impossible dream. Perhaps I'm looking for someone who truly doesn't exist, seeking too much.

People say that perhaps not trying at all would be the best way to move forward, and perhaps they're right. My longing to be with someone has consumed me to the point of despair, but perhaps it's time for me to leave things alone and let fate decide instead of trying to force something that may never happen.

Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I think that perhaps writing this down has been a kind of release for me, helped things seem a little more real.

Since he quit, he has asked me for money but I sent it once and told him I wouldn't send anymore because didn't want to feel like that is why he was talking to me, he was co.pketely fine with that.

I can't even sleep in my own house, it's that bad. After literal months with a non-stop tension headache due to sleep deprivation I started driving 30 mins a day to sleep in my grandpa's mobile home.   


I'm terribly lonely. To the point where I will spend literal hours obsessively bouncing between Discord, Reddit, and Twitter just praying for someone to acknowledge my existence. 1 single like from a Twitter mutual will make me happy. I go through phases of praising people and cutting them out all in one fell swoop. I talk to one person on Discord regularly and even I'm starting to feel like he's on his way out, 24 hour response times, no follow-up questions or comments, etc.  


We fight, we argue, we scream. About everything and nothing. There was some physical abuse and a lot of emotional neglect early on but now we're practically strangers. There are days where we don't make eye contact but the very presence of my mother specifically puts me in a terrible mental space. I feel weak, powerless, even emasculated in a way because I have no other choice than to clean up after a 40 year old and usually about 3-4 teenage girls. Daily.  


I feel as if I were on my own I could actually develop myself as a person. It's hard to explain what I mean but it's like I'm being forced to act in a childish way every day. I don't like bickering, I don't like insults, I don't want to be angry every hour of every day. I just want to focus on myself and smile once or twice.  


Worst part is even if I \*were\* 18, I would have to keep some level of contact. My mom owes me a few thousand dollars atm and what I have saved up is not enough to live alone for even a year. I've been desperate for peace for literally years at this point. Most of my childhood was spent trying to

They used this text to talk about me and several times vented to each other almost joking about things I’ve done or do that were bothering them. It was almost mocking me.

I have never been on a date, or even held hands with a girl. Why am I never even given a chance to date? Why am I automatically seen as lesser than?

Monday I go climbing with some people at my rock climbing gym. I know most of them through Church..

Tuesday I have been doing yoga classes with the same group. 

Thursday I often hang out with two guys I know from church and meet up with people after for trivia night. 

That's basically it besides Church on Sunday. I work from home so I don't interact with people. I do live with my brother, but we don't really chill together unless there is a show or movie we both want to watch. 

I honestly get real lonely. Even though I consider myself a  social introvert it gets hard to not have anyone to just chat with when you need/want it.

Of all of the people that I know and have known for basically my whole life I only have one friend that really cares about how I’m doing. A lot of people that I have known and tried to be friends with think that I am annoying and just ignore me. I have the driest phone known to man. The only people that text me is my mom and dad when they need something or classmates that need answers to homework. Even this girl who claims to be my friend can’t make time to hang out with me or text me out of the blue. The worst part about that is I feel like I am falling in love with this girl that treats me like barely exist. I told her that I liked her and then she rejected me and got with one of my friends. And seeing them together feeling like I am being sprayed by a fire hose. We were supposed to hang out to day but she cancelled last minutes claiming she had something to do.

I always think that people make up this image/perception in their head of how you look based on the things you say to each other and I feel like once they see me they will be disgusted at who they’ve been talking to this whole time. I know im not “attractive” and theres lots if things about me that I would change. I genuinely become so anxious the longer a conversation goes on because I think that they will ask to see a picture of me. 

I wanna know do people think the same as I do? And also for the people on the other side, do you care how the person you are speaking to looks and would you stop talking to a person if you thought they were “ugly” even if you spoke for a long time and shared things with eachother.

4891,MastaBat0r,1638746880,1,"Hello, Male 24 here. I am starting to notice a worrying trend in my life that has outright caused me to not want to meet new people anymore. I have been told I am quite a good looking man and all, I am also a great conversationalist I can talk about almost anything ranging from Physics, Science, Sports, Philosophical discussions, politics, whether or not your toilet or tooth brush has the worse job or the mystery of why 11 isn't called onety-one or the actual reason why 6 is afraid of 7. My point is anything that comes my way I can almost always talk about it but for some reason this isn't enough.

Every person I meet or know almost always starts to phase me out of their lives. It starts out small, they don't respond to my texts or calls for hours, and then days, weeks, months, and so on. I am quickly forgotten no matter how much I try to reach out to people. I do understand life gets to us it's the reason I always reach out periodically so as not to seem like a pest but then they never reach out back and they straight up don't even respond to me anymore. I am at a point where my sister and mum are the only people who constantly relate with me.

I am afraid to meet new people at this point because I fear it's going to go down the same road and I can't take it anymore. I am tired and I just can't. I feel like a total failure socially and sometimes it's a struggle to focus on other things because it eats at me.

My name is Juan and I currently live in Guadalajara, Mexico. I have a very average life, I work in sales at a Software company, have a beautiful daughter which I love with all of my heart and also been married for 4 years.

I learned English because I used to live in San Francisco and then Los Angeles.

Since I work from home and barely moved to this city, my social life is pretty much non existent :( Don't get me wrong! My wife is my best friend.. but sometimes having some extra friends would be really good for me.

I currently suffer from BPD, I am taking weekly therapy and also having medication, so I guess that helps me deal with this horrible condition.

I consider myself a good listener and someone that will put all the effort to be a sincere friend and always give the best advice possible!

So it doesn't matter where you live, race, gender.. please feel free to send me a message and I'll be more than happy to become friends! (:

I (24M) have never been in a real relationship before.

It has now been approx. 1.5 months ago I last had contact with a girl I had feelings for. We talked for a while, every single day, face time and regular text conversations. she has told me that she also has feelings for me. Suddenly one day I noticed that she took longer to answer me (during this period she had a lot of family problems and things like that). One day we talked, I sent her a message asking her about something (nothing special, was just something I was wondering about). since then she has not made any contact, I know she has seen my message as it says she has read it.

she has not blocked me or deleted me as a contact.

There are days when I just feel so alone and want to talk to someone. I try to distract myself with everything I can. I work full time, I train martial arts five times a week and have spent a lot of time looking at an apartment. this has helped me. Today I have been so close to contacting her again, just to talk to someone. I do not have many friends and those I call friends are not back where I live until a few weeks (school etc).

I do not quite know if I have feelings for her anymore. but for some reason, I want to contact her. I have just felt so damn lonely lately, and want some affection if that makes any sense. I want to hug someone.

4963,cinnamonrollwattson,1638717859,1,"Yesterday I was supposed to play Minecraft Java with a guy I sort of like like and he told me he’ll be back in a second so I said, “okay” I didn’t want to bother him so I just waited for a very, very…very long time which was 12 hours. I tried playing some different games in the meantime and I was hoping that he’d text me but I couldn’t stop checking my phone and when I kept checking it, there was nothing of him for those 12 hours. Then at 1am he sends me a goodnight message and didn’t even tell me about why he didn’t text me back for those 12 hours just…”Goodnight”

Am I in the wrong to feel upset and mad at the same time? I didn’t want to bother him at all so I just waited for a response from him and he didn’t even let me know and now I feel like I can’t text him without getting upset…I hate overthinking and feeling like this over a guy that doesn’t even like me in the first place.

My head is just swindling with so many thoughts still, I can’t stop overthinking. I can’t…I hate myself so much.",lonely,Am I in the wrong…?,2021-12-06 02:24:19
4964,FancyGuidance4343,1638717659,1,"For example female genitalia is more often seen as gross, taboo, not talked or jokdd about or drawn, not boasted about or focused on, under appreciated.

Oral sex is also not as commonly perfomed on them

And male genitalia is so appreciated that men who are attracted to women even like to see women who have male genitalia, in porn and so on. Or at least have the curiosity or bucketlist thing for them or atleast are more likely to have sex with them

People attracted to men however have no sexual curiosity nor interest in men who have female genitalia.

The only gender and sexuality with an interest in the genitalia of the gender they are not attracted to is hetero men.

Idk if being unemployed has something to do with it. I've been on a job hunt for months now and I try to keep busy. I guess I can manage on most days but when it finally hits, it hurts really fucking bad. I've also moved to another city two years ago and the closest thing I have to a friend is an ex colleague who's moved across the city and whom I'll never see again. I constantly feel like I'm in the background of a background if that makes sense. I have a couple of online friends but I don't want to impose myself as they're not always responsive given their busy schedule. I'm 26 and the notion of making friends or meeting new people sounds terrifying and almost impossible even. And the worst part is that I don't remember feeling this lost and afraid a few years ago even when things were less stable and unsure back then.

I know that a lot of you have it so much worse so I apology if I'm coming off as insensitive/selfish.

4973,gingerbreadtinsel,1638714507,1,"I have one friend and they’re amazing, I love them. However they’re very introverted and don’t like leaving the house. So I have no one to go out with and have fun. It can get very repetitive and mundane at home. I wish I had feminine friends so we could give each other makeovers and go partying or shopping or something. I also don’t have much of a relationship with my family, they’re toxic and abusive. 

So it’s just my one friend I have to talk to 99% of the time (which I am grateful for) but it feels very isolating. I have tried so hard to make other friends but they don’t want to stay around. I organise hangouts, invite people over/out, cook and cater food, I try to be as friendly as my anxiety allows me. It’s still never enough for people, they still choose other people over me and don’t reciprocate the friendship. For a short time it’ll seem like I might have a chance at maintaining a friendship with someone, and I get my hopes up, only for them to not stick around. I guess I’m just not an interesting or fun enough person to be friends with.

My friend can’t relate to a lot of my feelings because they’re asexual and not interested in dating, they don’t fully understand why I wish for a romantic partner. They are also content with not really having a social life, just chatting to me (we live together) is enough for them. They don’t drink and they hate bars so I have no one to go out with. They don’t like cuddling or being touched and I’m craving being able to be physically intimate with someone I guess so it’s sad for me. Online dating is hell. I watch a lot of cute couples on social media and daydream about finding love like that.

There are days or months, i feel so inspired. Everyone who knew me at work says good thing about me. But then, the depressive phase will come where I'll feel unmotivated, irritated and so tired of going to work. It was the same since I was college. I had nobody to tell.

Once, I had a fight my sister and told her I may have depression (that was during pandemic). But I was gaslighted. I have no one to talk to with my famiky member and I'm ashamed to tell my friends what I am going through. My friends looks up to me - respects me, asks for my advice.

4980,M2KKA,1638708886,1,"I've always been a loner so when I found mates to go out with I was pretty happy. We'd go out to the really cool hang out spots and nightclubs and at first it was great but then it became competitive as too who can get the most girls and what not. 

Now I have no experience within the dating/hooking up scene in which unfortunately makes me the butt of jokes with my mates. Side track: I don't really care about it, I'm 20 and I could get an escort that's easy and I might one day but not for those reasons (more personal).

Lately I realised I have been getting used. Usually I'd drive the guys up with my car, stay sober then drive back on my dime. Lately it's been via uber and guess who picks up the tab with the promise of getting paid back. This already pissed me off however that's not the end of it.

We went too the first club and it was incredibly busy but really cool. I then went and took a piss, washed my hands (I am hygienic) and walked out only too discover they left, I then waited 30 minutes and got a pint until they mentioned they went too a nightclub called ""Rapture"" (named the same as the deftones song) and that I should meet you with them.

Now after various reasons (like a rape accusation that nothing happened from, shit security and a ""Coward Punch"" death) I specifically told them that I do not want anything to do with this club and to not go near it. I then hesitated and went. I met them inside in which then they were doing there thing. (Chasing girls)

I lost them a couple times and I started too get angry. I said too myself maybe just one more drink and that's when I walked up too the bar and lined up. Fortunately (Or unfortunately how you look at it) a full fledged brawl happened with 3 people evolved at the bar and I was in the middle of it. I then turn around and all of a sudden people were chanting, screaming and yelling. I grab the bloke of the other bloke and then pushed the blokes away from each other while they were punching eathother (which unfortunately caused me too be attacked, 2 punches from my torso.) Then one of the guys friends thought it was a great idea too try and king hit me in which I had no involvement in other than de-escalating the situation, Fortunately he missed and everyone calmed down. 

After brushing my self off I then turned back to the bar waiting in line for a drink in which I then had an epiphany, I walked away from the bar and straight out of that God forsaken place that I as long as I'm alive will never enter again and procided to get an uber and go home by myself. 

I am incredibly sore but greatful that I made a stand and litteraly walked out last night, I am greatful that I am alive and realise my self worth alittle better. I texted them this morning that this is the last time I'm heading out with you guys and that I do not feel safe nor appreciated hanging out with you guys. I believe I look intimidating and therefore puts a target on my back for who can catch the biggest fish and that's not something I want too get involved with nor one day might be killed. My mother is dependent on me and I want her too know that I am ok. I told her about the event and promised her I will never step foot in a place like that again.

This is not really a happy ending story but more of a story of self worth. I struggle with self worth alot and it took various events too reallise that's not what I want. I am a bit more alone now than before so if anyone wants too have a chat or have a drink in Perth, let me know. Anyway take good care and look after yourselfs.

Did you find anything useful which has helped you to stay afloat? Share about that below, and maybe it can help some of the members of this sub.

Personally, I started with the videos of a youtube channel The School of Life a couple of years back, and that helped me to be a bit more accepting of my loneliness, and get going with my life. Then somewhere down the line, I came across Dr. Jordan Peterson's videos (he is a clinical psychologist if anyone doesn't know him). And his videos are super insightful. I usually prefer the shorter clips from his lectures where he talks about specific problems, but I have listened to a couple of his hour+ long lectures as well. It's with this journey and a few other things, that I am now actively trying to be more social, rather than staying silent in every social situation.

Some context:
I’ve always been a somewhat reserved person. In my first year of high school, I was struggling with some things (some depression, being overwhelmed with school, and intense pressure from my band director to audition for the honor band [which I really didn’t want to be in let alone try out for], just off the top of my head), so I begged my parents to just let me transfer to online school so I could get myself back in line. Just before I left the school, I pretended to be sick, stayed home for like 2 weeks, became very withdrawn and stopped talking to most of the people I knew (mostly to avoid questions about where I went and the explanation that comes with answering them). I wound up spending the rest of high school in an online school and not really connecting with anyone there in any way. I’m 22 now and I still haven’t reconnected with any of them except for 1 person (and that one person who is essentially my last friend, doesn’t really talk to me that much anymore). Because I was completely alone and isolated from the outside world all through my late teens, I feel like I completely threw away some of my most socially formative years. I think I’m coming to any and every social interaction still in the mind of a high school freshman. I don’t feel like I’ve really matured socially all that much, certainly not to the degree of people who spent all of hs around their peers and others their age. I don’t know how to talk to people anymore really, other than my immediate family and talking with them is always essentially water cooler chitchat, very surface level drivel. I never did have many friends even when I was in school and they weren’t ever very close anyways. Now I don’t know how to make new ones. I’ve never had any kind of romantic experiences(I’ve had crushes on a few girls over the years, but they’ve never reciprocated and nobody has ever mentioned that they liked me; never any gf or dates lol) either and at this point I feel like I’m quickly approaching the point where it’s almost unacceptable to be a complete noob at that. I feel completely nothing most days and I think I’m truly aimless in my everyday life. I also have a tough time entrusting any kind of personal stuff with anyone bc it’s been flipped against me in the past lmao. I’m not looking to write some sob story or looking for pity. I’ve had a drink or two tonight and I’m super tired, so apologies for the life story, for the wall of text, and for the rambling; this is on a throwaway account for a reason lmao

I have nobody to blame for all of this except myself really and I deeply regret leaving hs every day, wish I hadn’t been such a puss haha

I wouldn’t say I’m horribly ugly I’m 6’3 200lbs with some body fat. I’ve been told that I’m conventionally attractive but I call complete bullshit. I was a kiss less  virgin until the beginning of the school year then lost my virginity to a rlly awkward hookup. After that I went on couple dates with different ppl only to get friendzoned or ghosted. I was talking to a girl for the longest time in October we met up and went out ended up making out touching each other and cuddling the next day she tells me that “we’re better off as friends “ . I was pretty sad about that but you can’t rlly change what people feel about you. I just feel like after that I’m just a boring person cuz if they think I’m cute go out with me then say that we’re better off as friends it sucks. Then the same thing happened yesterday when I went out with this girl from tinder we basically hung out cuddled during the night and she told me that we are just better off as friends and next time we hang out we should do it as friends. Idk what’s wrong with me I feel like I’m a horrible person who is so boring to the point where I can’t pull anyone it just sucks honestly :( I’ve had no success and I think I’m gonna give up idk how to change who I am and I’m not going to change who I am but idk if there’s anyone out there who would accept me for me,lonely,I don’t think I’ll ever find someone,2021-12-05 14:39:25

5057,cam_the_king,1638670322,1,"TW for broken bones. Just in case.

This has been happening for a while now. Since college started this year. I made some really good friends that shared common interests and humor, so we got along super well. Its four other people in the group, and they all knew each other before I met them. I met them because I got super close to someone in the group. But things slowly started going downhill.

The first thing that happened is that they would not respond to my texts about meeting for dinner some nights. Oh well, college is hard, they could be doing homework. I ended up getting close to another person in the group and we would go get dinner together sometimes because we just had similar schedules.

The first thing that actually upset me is one time when we all agreed to meet for dinner. I live right next to the dining hall, so I usually sit outside and wait for them to meet me there. This time, I waited. And waited. And waited. After waiting for about thirty minutes after they said they were on their way, I texted them asking where they were. It should have taken 15 minutes max to walk there, but sometimes they get caught up in stuff, so I thought they were just being slow. Turns out, they were hanging out in one of their rooms that was closer to the dining hall and sent the text saying they were on their way when they were pretty much right outside, and I hadn’t even left my room yet. So when I was waiting for them to join me, they were inside already eating. I just walked in, got a soda, and sat down, and none of them thought about texting me apparently.

Some weeks pass, something happens, and I break my ankle. Ouchie. I stay home for a bit to heal, but I end up going back on campus so I can focus on my work better. I can’t go to the dining hall because I can’t hold a plate and use my crutches at the same time, and I was so tired I just made canned soup in my microwave. They offer to bring me soup and sweets, which made me happy. But i started to get lonely because I couldn’t leave my room. I would ask if anyone wanted to come over and hang for a bit, just to talk and so I wasn’t as lonely. I saw them once during the week I was there.

A week passes because of a break we had and I am now in a walking boot, but still using crutches to move because my ankle is super weak (I ended up breaking it in two places. Oops.) I was still feeling lonely because I couldn’t move a lot and stayed in my room. We did get dinner two times over the course of a week, but they met without me several other times. Ok. Whatever. I would struggle getting to those places, even if I used the bus. But this brings me to last night. 

We were hanging out after dinner and one of them mentions a Discord group chat. I was not part of said group chat. I asked to be added because they respond more often in the Discord, so I would be more up to date and in-the-loop about plans. One in particular said no because then the group chat would be “going off nonstop” and they “couldn’t mute it.” So they made a separate server, added me, and muted it so then they wouldn’t get notifications. And that hurt me, not gonna lie. And when heading back to our respective dorms, two of them were heading the same way as me. It was dark and I couldn’t maneuver very well. They left me.

Today I asked if we could hang out and one of them said no because they have tutoring tomorrow.

Thursday afternoon we got into a work-related argument, a situation involving him and another employee. He's the type to get really mad about something and I was trying to calm him down and explain the situation from another perspective. He left that day without saying a word, and I was worried that he was pretty upset at the other party involved. 

Friday morning I saw him clock in and asked if he was still upset, and he said ""About what?"" I took that to mean he was ok. Then he completely ignored me. I tried to reach out to him several times during the day, but he would only speak to me if I asked him a direct question.  He left again without saying a word to me.

Now I feel like I've lost access to a person/friendship that could have been one of the best I've had in my life.

When I was at home before going to uni I had the safety net of knowing my freinds liked me and being confident with them and when I arrived at uni I brought that confidence with me. So over the first few weeks I made lots of freinds and had fun however during this time I began smoking more and more weed because I noticed myself becoming more depressed and weed numbs this pain. Now im two months into uni and I’ve sunk back into my deepest depressions. I smoke weed all day never go to lectures and have gone from seeing freinds 5 6 times a week to once or twice. I feel so insecure with everyone here and I feel constantly worried that people don’t like me which makes me want to smoke more weed and makes me so much less confident talking to people. Like I used to be able to have a conversation with anyone and now I can barely maintain one with my closer freinds. All of this is crushing me the stress of being so behind on uni work and the stress of me fucking up my social life is awful. On top of this I keep missing doctor appointments so I can’t refill my prescription of anti depressants. Oh and I have a masssive crush on a girl who has a bf and I couldn’t be with anyway. The worst part is as well she is one of best freinds at uni so I hang out with her a lot (by my depressing standards) and it fucking hurts that she doesn’t want to be with me. Especially because I feel we would be better together than her current bf. I know I have obviously no right to think that or even have a opinion on my friends dating lives but still that’s how I feel.

Tldr I have a crush on a girl who has a bf I’m struggling with both the social and academic sides of uni. My depressed state of mind has made me socially inept all of a audden and I have a drug problem. So yeah that’s my self pitying rant.",lonely,Uni is hard man,2021-12-05 13:02:02

5089,jambear222,1638660960,1,So Ive been in a difficult relationship for almost 10 years now. Toward the beginning of my relationship I lost all of my old friends. I became friends with one of my brothers roommates while in a relationship with my boyfriend. His roommate's name is James. Due to my bf leaving me on several occasions along with other complicated stuff I ended up hooking up with this guy on a few occasions. James and I have become secret best friends ( without the sex) because i knew my bf wouldn't allow me to be best friends with a guy I hooked up with B4. We honestly just had a fun time chilling and talking. I never felt any feelings of romance toward him either. James moved back to Georgia from Michigan after almost 8 yrs of this secret friendship back to his family. I didn't have anyone to vent to about loosing my only friend outside of my relationship. To top it off James got into a relationship and never mentioned it to me. Now our contact is becoming less and less. I'm just sad that I lost my best friend and we will never be the same. We had alot of great memories and he's helped me through alot. I feel happy for him but it's just so much to process alone. I just had to put this somewhere.....,lonely,My secret best friend moved away,2021-12-05 10:36:00

I want to meet people who not only share a few surface level interests, but who I have true chemistry with. Who share my worldview, ideals, and perhaps even share a few important goals. Someone you can grow with and talk to on a deeper level. There's a time and place for small talk, but it's just not very nourishing on an emotional or spiritual level. 

After being alone/friendless for a certain amount of time, you just have a craving to speak to someone about something other than ""what's trending"", or swapping a basic list of ""things you do in your free time"".

I got diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety and my other brother got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 8 months later, I got diagnosed with cancer and underwent chemotherapy (the good news is that I am now in remission, but the bad news is that it’s treatable but not curable). Although my father has became better after all we’ve went through, he got in an anger rage a couple of months back, and beat really bad that it injured my ear and I can’t move out because it’s not really common where I live.

Personally, I think a relationship is the worst thing you could ever do when you’re lonely, as you will put a lot of pressure on your significant other and rely on them for any and all interaction.
Also, it feels kind of forced, finding someone to cure loneliness, and in my experience situations like that never end well. Shouldn’t meeting someone be natural and organic?

I mean, I’ve never been one for online dating. I’m pretty young too, it’s just never appealed to me. It just feels, unnatural, of course no offence to anyone who participates. Personally, I think a person who is lonely and depressed, like most of us here are, should work on expanding their social circles, and finding satisfaction and validation from within, instead of searching for it from external sources. Please believe me when I say that is a recipe for disaster. You should never let anyone have that kind of power over you, it can be even more alienating and not all people have good intentions.

I also think that in a lonely state, your much more vulnerable, and therefore more open to domestic abuse, toxicity and mistreatment in a relationship, as well as a higher chance of being manipulated or finessed, more so the guys than gals for the latter, but anything is possible.

I think that for people like us, sad and lonely, we need to learn to love and be with ourselves, before we can even consider letting someone else in our life. But, that’s just me. If you think a relationship would solve all your problems, why? I am genuinely curious, and if you think I’m wrong, please let me know, and tell me why. Just wanted to throw my thoughts out there in the hope I’ll help someone, and that someone can help me!

When I do actually interact with people and the world at large however; I'm so happy to be alone. They remind me why I hate all of them, they teach me to treasure my solitude beyond measure.

In my view and experience, the majority of people are vile and rotten. They have no morals, no sympathy or compassion; unless it is socially expected of and convenient for them. The only good they do is for their own praise. Their only care is for themselves, they are vain, selfish and self absorbed. Self control is non existent, humanity has become a beast who pursues nothing else than their lowest and most base desires. Yet they ask why they live without meaning?

They all morph into a single entity devoid of any character or individuality, each one the same as the other. They pursue fleeting emptiness and nothing more. They know the world yet never themselves. When they talk their words are meaningless, centred around the same emptiness they obssess over. They say nothing of value, nor do they wish to hear that which posseses any. They are all serpents not to be trusted too.

So I grow glad being the Happy Hermit. This World is deathly sick, as are most who inhabit it. I isolate myself from it lest I fall victim to the very same poison they spew and emit. I am not one for their world, so I shall remain within my own.

Ones who can hold a conversation as right now I'm extremely stressed out about what I found out about my teeth. Basically, I was abused as a child. Kept isolated from society. That means No friends, barely going outside, no education and no dental treatment or dental work. Not even a toothbrush.

This lead to my teeth getting..really bad over the years. Now that I've escaped that situation I'm still shackled by the damage done to my teeth. It's hard because I can't talk to people without feeling horribly embarrassed or mumbling and it sucks because well, I'm a friendly person. I want friends.

And 6 grand is a lot but what's worse is because I was denied an education I'm still working on my GED so my hourly rate at any job is basically..terrible. So when I do eventually get my GED and whatever I decide to do afterward it's going to cost even more because my teeth aren't going to stop decaying because I'm trying to better myself. The shame and the burden of treating it is going to get worse by the day.

5135,Imaginary-Problem866,1638642217,1,"why do i feel wildly uncomfortable when someone knows slightly too much about me? not even a secret literally like if they know what music i listen to, i might aswell get naked in front of them. I think i dont want to have an identity, i dont want to be perceived as having an identity because i wish i was nothing. i hate giving people prompts which push them to make further assumptions about me and jump to conclusions. so i prefer to shut up, so i can have full control over what they know about me and thus the way in which they perceive me. Once i give away a piece of information, lets take music as an example, they will either go down route A where they like my music taste and think i am tolerable or they go down route B where they fucking hate my music, think im a freak and no longer want to associate with me. Eitherway, their thought process can easily be masked behind a simple, ambiguous ""oh thats cool"". even if their statement has a direction of some sort, i have no way of knowing whether what they say is actually true or not. no certainty lies within their statement. instead of certainty i get insecurity and self doubt. Even if, by a miracle, their comment sounds convincing enough to show me that they genuinely do like my music taste, that is an even bigger problem. Now i have acquired a cool person whom i will, inevitably, begin to get attached to whether thats consciously or unconsciously. The issue here, is that i have now raised the bar for myself. From this point onwards, i must walk on eggshells to avoid disapproval, rejection, mocking. One wrong phrase leaving my lips could be mirrored through them leaving my life. There i am. Alone again.
Being a human being, naturally i have a coping mechanism for this. What is it? Isolation, not letting anyone in because if i never let anyone in, then nobody will ever leave. No risk. 
However, if i do for some reason let someone in, i have evolved to distance myself from them. I am good at keeping within my boundaries and being fully conscious of my actions at all times.

Being lonely because nobody wants to be around you is one thing. I’ve felt that down to my core. It feels like it’s one of the first things I ever learned.

My old friends and I grew apart, some backstabbed me and we dont talk anymore, my college is online and so i cant find new people in college. I have like 2 friends? I dont see them often. Those 2 have their own life, bunch of friends, work to do and here I am. Sometimes, my loneliness doesnt bother me much because I spend all day by myself. Exercising, watching movies etc. But when I’m bored? When I need some company? Or when I’m home alone? I got no one to call. 

Usually teens get happy when their parents leave their home for a while so they can call their girlfriends or boyfriends. I feel life is playing a joke on me at this point because my parents keep going out for work and it just reminds me I have to just spend time by myself as usual with no one to call. I go out for walks, for cycling (all by myself) to calm myself and get out of my bed and all I see are couples. Teen couples, couples in their 20s, adult couples. All sorts of friend groups. It makes me feel terribly inferior. I feel they would laugh at me if they come to know about my social life.

I am not a perfect person, i dont want to self term myself as a “nice” guy because nobody is as aware of my flaws as myself. But man, I am finding it really hard to deal with so much mess.

5174,throwra5296,1638617726,1,"Hey all.
I wanted to gauge how messed up I really am by telling my story for people;

I was raised in a regional area of Australia
I had a cousin whom I was very close to die from a rare form of leukaemia in his mid 20s when I was 13.
It was a very long and painful death for him and I was there to witness the worst of it.
It made my father's drinking even worse, and my mother left - and because of all this I dropped out of high school and went into home schooling until the mandatory year 10.

Because we lived in a lone house, in a paddock, well outside of town my social interactions were severely limited and it was pretty much just me and my father there until I was 18 and managed to get out on centrelink (the dole) as a full time student.

Those 5 years were very damaging I feel - and even now at 30 I can't seem to escape the grasp of what that time alone did to me.

I was in Melbourne during all the lockdowns (most locked down city in the world apparently - over 270 days) it brought back a lot of that emotional intensity in me and has left me feeling deeply alone and antisocial,  and just worn down (plus broke).
I have had the good grace of a wonderful therapist and the government subsidy, but most of that was just like a kind of emergency first aid to calm me weekly or fortnightly and I never got to make as much progress with it as I would have liked.

I have a deep deep hatred in me for my mother abandoning me and my father for a whole list of things (keeping me trapped for one thing) so my relationship is non-existent with dad, and my mother tries, but I just can't let her in (I've had the term ""ambivalent attachment "" used by my therapist on this)

I feel like I'm at the end of my tether and now the last of my youth is gone and I spent most of it just trying to survive with my overbearing mind so I see myself as woefully under accomplished compared to so many of my peers.
(I have friends and an ex gf from when I studied who have done some truly incredible things since my time knowing them)

I'm skipping a couple of other things in here but that's the meat of it essentially.

I just don't know.
Would love some thoughts from people on all of this.
Thank you.",lonely,Am I beyond recovering from this loneliness?,2021-12-04 22:35:26

5187,SpicciBobicci,1638607461,1,"for the past year, i wanted to try and ‘put myself out there’ for the first time.
i got social media, got dating apps, went out and explored, all the things that i never did before. 

it went well at first, people seemed to like me and i was making online friends, meeting people in person, i felt so great. 
the first person i met was a girl from a dating app, i thought she was going to be a nice, artsy, outgoing person that could introduce me to a bigger world. i made sure to tell her i was only looking for friends, and she told me she was ok with that. long story short, she raped me. i don’t want to dwell too much on that but that was the first bad thing.

after she got mad at me and started driving people away from me, i met another girl, and i was interested in her. we dated for 7 months, it was good, i cut it off though because she was too dependent on me, i tried to tell her that she was more capable than me (objectively she was) but she relied on me for too many things (money, places to stay, etc).

all the while the initial momentum of making friends was wearing off, it all stagnated. i started seeing that people didn’t truly care for me, i was always giving much more than i ever received in turn. i was being used. my naïveté caused me to be too servile to people. 

FF to now, a year later. i’m essentially where i begun. i do have some experience now, yes, but i feel like the same ‘doors’ that were open to me at this time last year are closed forever now. i have fewer options. 

i feel exhausted now, i’m much worse off and it feels like there is a brick wall between me and a normal fulfilling life.

Then somewhere down the road I lost all my friends. And then I lost my two best friends, my grandparents. I practically lived with them because my parents were always working. My grandma passed when I was 12 and I watched her die in the hospital it was very sudden. Then my grandpa died when I was 14 and I watched him die too. Very slow death. Same year my uncle died and my other uncle died a year before. I never noticed until now, but that is when my sadness began. My high school experience was terrible, and now I’m in university with zero friends because everything is online. I’ve never been in a relationship or had anyone like me.

In return I was harassed on how I looked and was told that it was gay. I'm a nice person and caring if people get to k ow me but even being a nice and decent person gets people liking the same idea apparently. So I've been cheated on and told that who I am and how I represent my self is something to be ashamed of.

5228,bluetortoisejabuka,1638592697,1,"I love this song. Just listening to it on repeat tonight. 

I hate life. It’s the worst thing that has ever happened in this universe, besides the universe existing. Like some eternal hell we’re all trapped in. Some lives are “good”, sure but at what cost? 99% of life that has ever existed and will exist has been absolutely miserable. Sleep, fuck, make more babies that never consented to life and get indoctrinated by their dna and parents, kill, eat, live in pain and spread pain, repeat until you die. 

If there’s a God then they are evil. If we are God itself living separate lives simultaneously then we are idiots. I suppose those two aren’t mutually exclusive. I always felt like all the religions got God wrong, but Lovecraft got God spot on: the mad, blind idiot god.

It’s all so stupid. 

And I’m so lonely. 

This world is so broken.

Yet it mirrors me along with its pain.

Yeah humans have great potential, but so do my dreams. In my dreams I am so happy. Life is great there. But that’s all it is, a potential. And remember what they always tell us? Ideas, potentials, and all that don’t matter. Results do. Well the results tell me that humans suck, the world sucks, this life sucks, and my life sucks. 

And it breaks me.

Shatters me into an infinite amount of pieces. 

The juxtaposition between the intense pain and intense joy I feel is something I don’t know how to deal with. I don’t think it’s deal-able either. 

As if I’ve been swallowed into a black hole. 

But then I question- haven’t I always been in this black hole then?

I don’t know. I don’t know what to feel, do, or think. As if my brain has contracted a malware that ceased all functions. I can’t open the start button, I can’t shut down the computer, and I can’t run the anti-malware program. Does it even exist?

What would I do... 

I feel like dying, but I already know I am, and I’ve thought about the fact that I may be dead already. Was I ever alive? What does that even mean? The difference between inanimate matter (non-living) and animate matter (living) is defined by the differences, but it seems like human ego has made that distinction rather than pure logic. Why are we not just complex inanimate matter rather than animate matter that behaves with complexity?

So the only thing left I can do is not procreate. But perhaps I never had the choice. So what would I do? Nothing. There was nothing I ever could do. 

I’m sad. 

Guess I’ll fall asleep to this song.  

I can feel my heart ache. Like it always has and will.

I wish I could express how lonely and sad I feel to them, but when I do I either get pitied or told that I need to ""focus on myself"". The latter response usually assumes I'm too desperate to be able to find someone. I know I'm not desperate because I would rather be alone than settle unhappily for companionship. But that doesn't make the loneliness any easier to bear. My friends in 10 year relationships complain about ""not getting laid"" because of temporary long-distance or covid quarantines and it's so hard to listen to at times when I'm in the position that I'm in. I don't even know the last time I got a hug, but they are throwing a fit over not having sex for a few weeks. I know their feelings are valid, but it's so hard to listen to it after many of the same complaints. It feels like there's really no one out there for me. Others tell me I just need to ""get out there"" and ""meet new people"" as if it was that easy especially in a pandemic. It feels unfair to be judged by people who can't and don't empathize with this type of prolonged loneliness. I'm trying dating apps but haven't had any luck and I feel like giving up.

I had bottled up a lot of emotions, I couldn’t open up to the person who made me feel loved, I blocked myself off sexually because I knew inside I don’t want to pass down whatever is wrong with me in my head to my children, I come from a not so good background, I had the whole gangbanging culture instilled in me at a young age which lead to the detriment of our relationship. Me and my little mermaid are still cordial and talk we both still very much care for eachother but I have distanced myself after she told me I have to get my shit together and focus on bettering myself before we even begin to want to go on and fix things. It hurt me but honestly she’s 100% correct. I had a tough life growing up, i fully embraced the streets, shit even on our first date I sold drugs to pay for it lol but for whatever reason I’ve always deep down inside knew that I was capable of doing so much more with myself but I’ve always chosen the path of least resistance and in my case it was the streets, it wasn’t until recently I’ve realized I was and continue to be the biggest obstacle I need to overcome. I had wanted to leave the streets behind just didn’t know I had it in me to do so, I struggle with addictions, and I’m impulsive, but what I am not is a failure, I still have time to make a change for MYSELF first and foremost and not for My Little Mermaid. I have realized my life has substance my life carries meaning, I just never assigned any meaning or substance to my life, what I want the most is to better myself. I yearn for my little mermaid more than anything but I know I can’t get her back if I’m going to continue to be the same person. I must evolve. 
This is for anyone who’s in a similar position. Don’t change just because you want to change to get them back, change because you want to be better than the person you were before you lost them, change because it’s for your well being not theirs. There may come a time where you’re doing good and you and your love realize that you’ve outgrown eachother, but that’s perfectly ok. You at least changed to better yourself and someone will benefit from your self improvement and will love you. You may change and realize that you don’t need them after you better yourself and that’s ok too.  Best case scenario you get the love of your life who’s soul forever lives in your heart back in your life and you fix things and make up for your past short comings.

I hope you have a great day so far. 

I'm pretty tired and it's already midnight here. 
After i was finished with my work and took a short nap i started to clean my apartment. It took me about 3-4 hours at least and now I'm really tired. As you see my day was pretty boring and nothing special going on. 

Tbh i could say that about the last 5-6 years.. lol
Even though i had some great times here and there my life isn't how i want it to be. Sure, we all have our dreams and wishes but I'm speaking about the daily stuff. Basic things, like a good relationship, good friends, hobbies, a healthy lifestyle and some sport. Idk. I just feel tired. I used to be a big optimist always. Nowadays i seem to be more a bitter person. 

After i got married i moved to another city loosing the contact to all of my friends and never being able to find genuine friends after leaving my hometown. It's not that I'm not able to speak up to people. It's more the circumstances around me that held me up. I found one good friend and we are doing things together from time to time. But he has depression since years and he doesn't want to spent time often. I had/have depression too. This year was really tuff in general and i was in a very deep hole for some time. With my new job i was able to find new strength. I want to do so many things. I want to enjoy life again and just live for the moment without thinking too much. I was under pressure for so long because of the people around me. And because of myself too. Anyway, before i just talk about my life situation maybe i should tell what I'm looking for 😂

I hope to find someone that i can share things of my life, joy, sadness or maybe more? It would be lovely too meet new people and i hope to find someone special here!

It's as if I'm always the back up or rebound or just the second choice. It's frustrating and destructive. It makes me question what I'm doing wrong or what is wrong with me.

The most recent situation happened today. We just hung out last night and they informed me they wanted nothing serious and I was okay with that. And they message me this morning saying someone asked them to be exclusive and they accepted. How do you cope with never being enough?

So anyways... i was born in 1991 in Bucharest,2 years after the fall of the communsim regime here so obviously my parents thought it was a good ideea to give birth to a child in that abject poverty because everyone makes children and bad decisions in life. I was born in a neighbourhood called Iancului on the 3rd of may lived in a flat that was so small so you can't even imagine. My mom worked at the socks factory and she was paid 200$ a month and my dad made 445$ as a engineer who was checkin different companies at the time for the records to be in order. My dad was a drunk for as long as remember i have many vivids memories from when i was very young and one of them was that he waddled a lot when he tried to heat the milk so i can eat i was eating warm milk and plain bread for breakfast for years so yes he was drunk at 7 in the morning when i was a small child. He never gave a crap about my or my mom so needless to say it was very hard - nothing good to eat most of the time,struggle a lot with money, i'd receive poor quality toys or nothing. I would go rarely to the park with my dad but he was always a loner a loser and anti-social guy he never made friends with other parents at the park or near where we lived so i used to play alone my mom was the same. This was life from 1991 to 1998

In 1998 we moved to another neighbourhood in an apartment that was as old as 1940 (and is still looks the same to this day no renovations were made because all the money went on booze and cigarettes) an apartment that would later turn out to be my prison. This area was called Berceni my parents said they were barely able to make up with the money to buy this place - a 3-room apartment but bare-bones very very poor conditions. First day i went outside i met this kid we has older and offered me a biscuit and my saw that as she's always been looking after me and overprotective so she called me to ,,drink'' some water because i was thirsty but i wasn't.. I went inside and she pulled me as soon as i entered the door and slapped me yelling ,,why did you eat that ???, what if it was poisoned ?? you don't know this kid!!'' that was just a small tiny bit of many incidents like that with my mom.

I stood most of the time at home until 2003 when i went outside for the first time like real time and managed to become friends with some of the kids that lived nearby i chalk this up to the fact that we were all kids and it was normal back in the day like that and no my mom or dad did nothing to help with that. I was a very naive child and thought that i lived a normal life by being with these kids until one faithful night - It was new years eve fireworks were blazing in the sky and i felt happy i went to get my dad to watch with him too, my mom went with me to get him and we was in the kitchen talking to his mistress telling her happy new years and that she loves her. My mom was and is a very shy woman so she never become violent she just ran crying a little in the other room. I didn't react verbally as well but from that day i hated his guts and wished he had died most of the days ever since that day and this was back in 2004.

Obviously my mom hated him as well after that day you could say that all cooperative actions were lost because she never treated him the same and we never did anything as a family. The divorce happened fairly quick but because they were co-owners they couldn't sell so my dad left and came back after his failed attempt with his mistress but we never believed him. My dad also had a daughter whom my mom thought that she was a bad influence on me so i was never allowed to see her.

Because the story is very long i'll shorten it from here. We never had enough money, I couldn't take showers, my dad almost died because of his addiction to alchohol he suffered a stroke and he retired very early very small pension - a failed washed up man. He suffered the stroke in 2010. From 2010 we were even poorer as my mom lost some jobs and eventually got other jobs but very low pay. in Highschool i was a ghost and bullied a lot so i got addicted to video games world of warcraft as well. I had no one no friends the pc was all i had.Because we couldn't shower i said fuck it i'm done showering and i used to shower from 2010 until 2014 like 4 times a years, wash my hair kind of the same and i would brush my teeth never i never brushed my teeth from 2010 to 2014. To escape my reality from those days i had to escape which i'm doing right now living in my head daydreaming games kept me alive. in 2014 i had surgery too bad i didn't die - apendectomy.

I was socially isolated you could say all my life until 2018 when i decided to try and it was an obvious mistake: i signed up for university which i had to drop out in 2019 because of heavy bullying, gym which i had to stop because my personal trainer bullied me as well. I was tricked by PUAs because i fell in ther trap and had to go to the police to get my money back because they refused to pay me back they had a money back policy, went to a psychologist who didn't help me at all... The only Good thing you could say that happened in 2018 was that i got my first job and it was low pay there as it is low pay today. Today i make 583$ a month which is shameless.... disgusting.And at work i got bullied actually what a surprise... i almost lost my job 3 months in because some guys hated my guts for no reason i never even made eye contact and my boss a crazy yelling woman but fotunately she life the company when i came back from vacation in 2019 and i managed to keep my job until today.

Because of the poverty of the past now i have chronic acnee all over my back,face,scalp,chest all over dematitis,foliculitis i also have cushings disease i do have that body shape and got checked out i have a high level of cortisol.

So no, romania is not a great place to be born in... my dad was romanian, my bullies, my coworkers, my gym trainer,etc.. full of drunks and losers and mentally ill people...

As a man and just a person on this earth, I have learned it is easy to be replaced. There will always be someone better. Having a kind gentle soul is seen as a weakness. In today's world nobody wants someone who is soft and kind because that is portrayed as being weak.

Nobody is going to be your ride or die. They will expect you to be there for them because they know you will help. You will answer. You will be there. They use that until it is no longer needed, then you get thrown away, tossed aside, put on the back burner because at that moment they were only there because it was convenient FOR THEM! 

Me I make time for everyone NO MATTER WHAT. Others only make time when it is convenient for them. I am only ""a friend"" on their terms, other than that I mean nothing. I AM NOTHING! 

The people in my life who were hugging me saying ""I'll always be there for you. I got your back"" were the one's sticking a knife in my back. The one's who said ""I will take a bullet for you"" were the ones who ended up behind the gun pulling the trigger.

Most of these conversations have left me feeling tired and still lonely.  
I'll open the conversation with a open ended question from their post or bio( and if they dont have one I try to find their interests) Then ideally I follow up on their response with my experience or a question about that response to learn more.  
Often I get very short abrupt sentences while they answer the question. They dont make it easy to keep the conversation going, they dont ask a question or even a how about you? This leaves me racking my brain trying to figure out ways to continue the conversation, without it turning into an interrigation. This problem is even worst when it's a one word reply.

But calling me a ""fat, ugly n-word"" isn't really necessary. Is it hard to say ""sorry I'm not interested"" And move on? The amount of times distasteful, rude, insulting and racist things have been said to me, just because they're not attracted to me is... innumerable.

I have so much to give someone. But unfortunately I'm invisible to women; romantically. I KNOW I'd be a great partner, lover and companion. Yet, no one gives me a chance. I'm never their type. which is fine. They're entitled to what they like. I just wish someone wanted me for me. But no one does, never have, never will.


I'm no longer going to be approaching women. I'm gonna do me. And stay away from that toxic behavior. I'm better off alone than trying to date..I'm done being belittled. Women make me feel worthless and I know I'm not... just worthless to them.

I'm always gonna be myself. I've never pretended to be anyone else but who I am. And maybe the consequences of that are that I never find a woman who vibes with me, but alright. I guess I'll end up alone, but at least I didn't pretend to be someone I'm not.

Screw all these women who call me ugly, laugh at me, reject me, etc.  I'm giving up on love, and they missed someone great. I know they only care about the outside appearance, but I'm more than that. So screw them all for making me feel less than, just because I'm not some perfect 10. Tearing me down just for fun. In the end, you missed out not me. There's no one else like me, and someone will be lucky to have me one day if I decide to be interested in looking for love again. For now I'm gonna focus on me, not these girls who don't know a good thing when it's right there in front of them. I'm good, I don't even want love anymore.

The one where the wife dies of cancer and the husband just turns suicidal and isn't able to put anything above his own grief, pain and suffering. But with due time he realises, on interaction with his colleagues, some friends and some strangers, that life isn't always about himself. He has had a good life with his love but it doesn't mean he can't be happy again. As a human, probably the most important thing which brings us happiness is making others happy, feel important, and do nice things.

Maybe.   
I feel like I'm a decent man, well more of a guy(19 M). Last few years of my life have been tough with occasional moments of brightness here and there and a prolonged sense of darkness which has always felt to be looming over my head. From a materialistic pov, maybe I don't have anything to complain about. I go to a great Uni in India, studying engineering. I come from a decent financial background. My first paper might just get published in a few months time but I have never felt content or happy.   
It was in second standard when I had my first instance of being left out. I'd never cried in school until that day when I was sitting in the last bench all by myself. I was 6 yo back then. I have had many instances of feeling terribly lonely in my life and especially in the last few years when my family was going through a rough patch. From seeing my mom breakdown, to seeing my father grieving over the death of my grandparents and my father being a dick to me and my mom, there have been quite a few rough patches. I have never had a girlfriend too. The constant fear of dying alone has had me crying myself to sleep on so many occasions, lol, I can't even count.   
I never had someone for sharing this stuff with in my school or Uni until I found myself right on the edge of suicide and opened up to one of my teachers at school. She knows a lot about me. She's like that grandmother I never had. She's probably one of the few persons I truly love in my life apart from my mom, and a few friends.   
There's always been this feeling that I would've never had anyone to talk to if I weren't getting those good grades or went to a good Uni which probably promised a good future. With zero friends to talk to in the last few months, I was, maybe still am, feeling used to some extent. Like I had no value and was a terrible human being. But then these few things which Ricky learned(in afterlife) helped me as well.   
I have always wanted to help people and make people laugh. Probably I can be happy while being all by myself and enjoy my own company at times as well. I don't really enjoy living right now but that doesn't mean that I gotta give up, right? I can still be hopeful of having a good life with good people around? Even if there's no one ever around, there'll always be me, right? Maybe that's the point of life. Trying to be happy while being nice to others and when you're not happy, you should just be nice to yourself and help yourself to hang in there? It's funny, isn't it?   
Thanks for reading though, if anyone did. I felt like removing a boulder from my heart. Thanks :)",lonely,Life is funny,2021-12-04 02:25:26

Not a single friend sent me a birthday message that was even a paragraph all I got were a couple happy birthday texts or snaps. Even on Twitter with my moots I didn’t get a single dm even tho I talked abt my bday. No video message. No voice memos. Nothing. From no one. In fact, some friends DIDNT say ANYTHING. No friend got me a present, but what hurt most was that no one sent me that paragraph where you talk about how special that person is and let them know you love them. 

With family I only had one present cuz I wasn’t there for the bday party which was for me and my mom (her bday is like two weeks after mine). She gave me her presents cuz she felt kinda bad. Literally only got some presents because they were my moms. Also my mom’s boss had a big flower bouquet in a vase sent to her. I’ve done those for many friends and had penpals. I’d hope to have gotten some little letter from one. In my mind I’ve always wanted someone to get me flowers. But the point of them is that they are supposed to be a surprise so it’s not something u ask for but, god I loved them. I Idk why I got cocky to think I’d receive anything.  I tried not to but idk, maybe it was hope that hurt me. 

I tried buying myself flowers, but I could only get to giant eagle. Wanted to buy myself a cupcake to put a candle in. Most flowers were gone or almost dead and there wasn’t a single regular sized cupcake and no balloons I could get at the time. But I wanted to try something. So I wasted over $40 on that shit. Wanted to do a re-do and take myself to eat too. but I don’t even have the money rn to spoil myself. I ended up in a 24-hour McDonald’s that night too btw. I just cut myself for the first time in years. I couldn’t even blow any candle. Or have a balloon. No party. HAVENT seen anyone in weeks. I felt ugly and worthless as usual. No one ever listens to me or cares about my shitty art. I don’t even have anything to live for. I doubt anyone or much people would even listen but if you read this I appreciate it.

5385,justa_pos3225,1638520189,1,"So I was born in Hawaii on Oahu to a pretty standard family. Dad had a good job so he told my mom she didn’t need a degree. Dad was abusive to me and mom, but he made all the money so we stayed for a few more years until she couldn’t take it anymore and when I was 3 we moved to an outer island to live with my grandma (my only family I know besides my mom, my auntie, and my uncle, I don’t have any cousins, the worst part is that my dads family is huge and what I’ve always wanted, but it’s my dads side and he don’t fw us so they don’t fw us) way out in the country, (literally an hour and a half to get to the nearest town) I stayed there until I was supposed to start first grade and we moved back to Oahu. I was homeschooled for kindergarten, but my dad, who still had full custody and control over me decided to hold me back a year simply because he could. As a result, I’ve been made fun of for being older my whole life and I’ve never healed from it. So I started at public school a little older, oh well, I can still make friends. So I did and things were pretty good until 5th grade when my mom quit her job (a very long unfair story where my mom gets hella screwed over by her job). So she goes job searching and luckily, she finds one instantly at a small private school. She always wanted me to go to a private school so I finish the year she enrolls me into the new school and I never get to see anyone from my old school again (cause nobody had a phone in 5th grade). I pretty much hated the school from the first day and I still do after graduation. I stayed from 6th to most of 12th grade at this school and besides my dad leaving, that was the worst thing to happen to me. Tldr, my school was very small and so I hardly made any friends, never went to a party, never went to a dance, never had a SO (or even like a hug), basically missed my entire hs experience, and my cumulative gpa is like 1.something because the school was hard as shit and now I can’t even move away for college (people who came in later in their hs career said the school was totally unlike anything they’ve experienced and they hated it and everyone whose left the school says it was the worst thing they’ve ever  experienced). At the very beginning of 10th grade I got really sick with mono and missed a lot of school, (like half a year) probably more school than I should’ve because after I was done with mono I had really bad depression and just stayed home, even when I went back I was still depressed and my attendance was shotty for the rest of the year. Somehow I didn’t have to repeat, but my GPA that year was terrible. I actually had a come back in 11th grade where my attendance was perfect and my grades were good and I was killin it on the basketball team, hitting the gym everyday, then covid hit and I found out that I can’t do distance learning with severe ADHD. So I basically just failed the rest of that year, and the next year I tried to stick it out and graduate from there, but I couldn’t stay and graduate without having to repeat a year so in the middle of 12th grade I changed to a public school and only took online classes and had my mom do some of the work while I worked a job for money (if I’m not enrolled in school/college my mom stops getting child support checks and she wouldn’t be able to pay rent) (also I never met a single person or even saw the campus to this new school), I’m now working a job I hate that is an hour and a half bus ride away (no car or license cause I don’t have anybody willing to teach me how to drive), everyone else I know goes on trips and has fun with their friends or confides in and loves their SO or has a normal relationship with at least one of their parents (my mom and I aren’t that close despite everything we’ve been through) or has cousins to have fun with, or at least one of the above, but nah I just got myself. I never even got to talk about my drug dealing and addiction that I got over, my music I’m hoping to blow up with one day, the pain of living somewhere so expensive and so family oriented without any money and/or family or the fact that I’m incapable of talking to girls the same way I talk to guys (flirting/small talk), I don’t know what I’m looking for in this post, I guess I just want someone to know I exist.",lonely,My lonely life,2021-12-03 19:29:49

I don't know where this feeling comes from. I want it to go away.

I see all my flaws and pathetic lifestyle choices and all my lowest moments and wonder if I feel ostracized because I SHOULD be ostracized. Maybe I'm just the anthropological ""runt"" of society meant to be cast away and ignored in favor of everyone's wellbeing. In a utilitarian perspective, maybe energy used on me is a waste to people with potential to interact with others who provide more value. In a sense, if people on society can be ""winners"" and find happiness within their communities, then the foundation of that joy is the silent suffering of those who stay away for their wellbeing.

5387,ZSilby,1638518608,1,"I just figured out in my most recent mental breakdown that I feel alone not because I'm on my own most of the day, but because nobody replies to my texts or even tries initiating conversation with me on their own effort.  


I'm perfectly fine riding solo, y'know? I'm alright with myself, I know I'm the only person that will have my back until my death. But I'm still a social animal, however introverted, so I still get sad when I never get texted randomly by 'friends' or even get a reply.   


Sometimes with some of my friends, they apologize for not replying, which I'm thankful for, but then never even reply to what I said that they missed. It's confusing and makes me feel ridiculously alone, because while yeah, I have acquaintances, nobody seems to be a true friend.  


I get that people can be busy, but goddamn, it starts getting suspicious when getting ignored or forgotten becomes a regularity. So yeah, I think I'm done initiating conversation for now. It might not be the most polite thing to just sit and wait to be hit up, but I think I've put in enough effort to warrant expecting a little effort in return.  


My little breakdown also helped me fall out of love with my crush without needing to go through the rejection. So now I can stay friends but stop giving a shit if she replies or invites me to do things. I'm done being lonely, just starting to have the mentality of *""fuck this I can be more""* and yeah, that may include isolating myself more, but at least it'll help figure out who the real ones are, separate them from the others who'd just let the friendship fizzle out into nothing.

Literally for the past 19 years I've been alive, nobody has been in my life but my family.  Still to this day, whenever I do something eventful, it's with my family or my young relatives.  And I love (most) of them, bless their hearts, but I just want to do these things with different people.  At a certain point, it gets exhausting being/living with the same people for, well, my entire life.  I've always had trouble with friends; I always feel left out of everything, everyone is talking to literally everybody except for me, throughout grade school I've never had more than one close friend at a time, and now the only friend I have lives over 500+ miles away because I had to escape my abusive custodial parents.  It's hard pretending I'm not some loser who only does things with their family members, it's hard to think about inviting someone over because I'm embarrassed I can't afford my only place, I'm mad at myself for not knowing what to do, I'm confused because I don't even know where to start, and I'm tired thinking about how it'll be like this for years to come bc I can't handle almost any job and know my family won't support me.  I deal with so much inner turmoil that I can literally tell no one about:  my family because they don't understand me and it'll turn into an argument, thus making me feel worse; my social media because I'm terrified my mutuals will unfollow me and not like me anymore; and my aforementioned one friend because I don't want to feel like a burden or an annoyance.  I started talking to a therapist too but I'm not a fan because her webpage says she doesn't deal with adults yet my dad set me up with her anyway just because he thinks I'm technically still a teen bc nineTEEN i guess idk.  the questions and topics are always so redundant and i can't ever see myself properly venting like this to her even though that's her job.  and i don't wanna tell my dad that it's not going well bc then he'll be mad that he wasted his money on the appointments.  I tried out Bumble a while ago, but I don't feel like I fit in at all and i have no idea what to put about myself.

I'm also currently without a car, so I can't even leave the fucking house for a while.

5394,frostedflakesfrog,1638515122,1,"TW: Sexual violence, emotional abuse, physical abuse

I'm 20F. Half of my life has been miserable and traumatizing ever since I was sexually abused by my older brother (26M) when I was 9 or 10 years old. I woke up in my bed one morning to him touching my breasts and screamed, and he ran out of my room laughing. A year later his friend assaulted me. I didn't tell my parents what happened because I didn't even understand what happened myself. I told them a few years later and my mom insisted it was a dream. Today, I live with both of my parents and brother at home. Every day in my house for years has been hell. There is constant screaming and fighting every single day. In the past, my brother has been physically and verbally abusive to my parents and damaged their property, and now they walk on eggshells around him so he doesn't blow up. He gets triggered by every little thing. My parents have forced me to go to therapy for a decade as well as shove a variety of antidepressants down my throat, and I still continue to suffer. I've also done ketamine infusion therapy and TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), but a decade later I am worse than ever and keep getting more health conditions. To get an idea of what my parents are like, my dad is an openly racist Trump supporter and my mom is a middle-aged socialite who cares more about going to bars with her 25 year old co-workers and having a good Instagram feed than spending time with her family. When I told my dad what happened, he told me to talk to my therapist about it. My mom said the same thing. I don't speak to my brother or go anywhere near him; every time I see him I am reminded of what happened to me, even though I have never confronted him about it. (Note: my brother, after mooching off of my parents for the last three years, is studying to be a teacher, which is awful, because he should not be working with children.) 

 As a result of what happened to me as a child, I became hypersexual in middle school and sought out male validation. I was also diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I became sexually active at only thirteen years old and therefore was bullied viciously by my peers, my nudes were sent around the school, and lost my virginity at 14. I was cyberbullied anonymously online and was terrified to leave my house because other teenagers I didn't  even know would shout my name on the street and call me a whore. Friends dropped me left and right, and I didn't know how else to feel better about myself except to hook up with cute boys, since they were the only ones who gave me positive attention and everyone else seemed to hate me. Everyone bullied me for my sex life, and no one knew that many of my sexual experiences were coerced, manipulated, or statutory rape. I have been with 115 people I don't know how many times. 

I didn't start to experience the symptoms of complex PTSD until October 2020 during Covid lockdown. I have always had mild dissociations during sex, but now I have panic attacks and/or completely zone like a zombie and that happens in my daily life too. 

I have 0 friends. I cut all my friends off because they decided to stay friends with the people who raped me or did other awful things. I barely leave my house; I have nowhere to go. I left college halfway through this semester because I wasn't eating, going to class, or leaving my apartment. 

I am so tired. I'm so drained. I lost so much weight from ignoring my hunger cues and trying to sleep my pain away, and never going to exercise. Now I'm so pale, boney, and weak, and every action drains me, and I already have health issues that cause fatigue. I don't smile anymore. I don't talk anymore, and when I do, it's very quietly. My voice is always monotone and my face is always sad. I'm terrified of people and avoid them at all costs. I've developed concentration issues, really bad brain fog, and a stutter because I'm so nervous, and now when I speak, you can barely understand what I'm saying and it's so embarrassing. So yeah basically my family sucks, I have no friends, I've gone through all the available treatments for depression for a decade, I'm done suffering. My life just seems to get worse and worse, and I'm tired of just having hope to hold onto. I'm not even living at this point I am rotting.

When people do come up to me, they always want  something from me. Now I don’t mind small favors and what not, but it’s disheartening to know that everyone you talk to just wants you for something other than you. In my time alone I’ve realized other things like everyone I look up to is dead. I’m in love with history and philosophy and I look up to a lot of people like Belisarus and Seneca. But I have no modern heros, it just seems like everyone is doing better than I am, and while I understand this is a factor of our society it pisses me off sometimes, and that they have no flaws whatsoever. I’m super introverted and nervous but I wish more people knew that their flaws make them beautiful. I’ve been reading Letters from a Stoic, and I think I’m becoming one.

The last time we talked we were on an instant messenger. I remember the words that I didn’t type, didn’t need to type, weren’t part of the conversation, but were so much at the same time. They are absolutely seered into my mind:

“What is the harm in believing someone actually wants to stay?”

I'm still bitter when I see couples come in to work, though. I don't think that'll ever change, but at least when I do see a girl out by herself I don't think to myself ""oh she's cute... Maybe she's single!""

But slowly I became quiet and developed a habit. I used to have alot of female friends that I just stopped talking to. I THINK it's because of the types of people I see daily. I witness how girls( in my case, it's usually girls) just act fake with one another. Like at school I heard one of my old friends ( who is female) say: ""she thinks I'm her friend"" and then just laugh hysterically. That planted a seed of fear within myself, but I'm not the victim here my old friends are. I'm pretty sure I've hurt them. In one particular scenario, I used to be really close friends with this one girl, then out of nowhere I realize that I like being around her alot. This realization led me to distance myself from her and just stop talking to her. One day she tried to be friends again by hugging me from behind and greeting me and I greeted her back, but it was a cold greeting. After that we never did anything friendly with each other again. I just want to know how I can overcome this fear of mine, the fear of being betrayed. I know I'm just being paranoid, and this paranoia is destroying my relationships with people, but I don't know how to get rid of it. I stop myself from forming bonds with people, because of the things that happened to other people. But now it's destroying my quality of life 😕 I miss the old me man, now I'm just an asshole.

She was such a lovely person and she had a enchanting smile there's so much to say about her but I don't think anybody wants me to write a whole essay about how wonderful my best friend was but yeah that's it I may delete this when I'm less upset because less upset me always regrets what I've said.,lonely,Tomorrow is the death anniversary of my best friend.,2021-12-03 11:18:22

I've been lonely for a while now. No. I wouldn't even describe it as lonely to be honest. 

I like time to myself more than the average person. Always have. I genuinely find a lot of entertainment in my own thoughts as long as I don't delve to deep into the bad ones and because of this I tend to be very inconsistent with my replies to people. 

Should also mention I suffer from agoraphobia and can count the amount of days I've been outside in 2021 on one hand.

I'd always read the messages (either via swiping on snap or reading messenger notification so it didn't look like I left them on read) to make sure they weren't urgently needing help and then I just wouldn't have the energy to send a reply, even just one word. Sometimes for weeks on end. 

I believe that eventually I'll have people in my life more accepting of my behaviour and Im all but certain that my agoraphobia is losing its grip on me so I'll be able to socialize with people in person more but I'm just having a really hard time reaching that point. 

Thank you if you read all that and even if you didn't I hope you all find people you can be yourself with and find genuine happiness ♥️",lonely,I guess it's my fault,2021-12-03 10:50:24

5485,Intelligent-Young580,1638478353,1,"I just have to get this out there, so thanks in advance:

Basically I had another mini existential crisis over lunch today and almost broke into tears over another sad Healthy Choice bowl at work. I'm 26M, gay, and I've never been in a relationship.

It's sad to say but at this point, a relationship is all I really want in life. I have great friends, a master's degree, I have hobbies (I sing and do ballet twice a week), and I'm pretty fun/funny, but all of that advice about ""pursue other passions and a someone will be interested in you"" clearly hasn't worked in this instance. Honestly, part of me would trade these things to have a solid relationship, because then at least the things I did wouldn't be meaningless.

I date a lot and it's becoming exhausting, but I feel like I can't stop dating because if I do, then that's extending my time to any potential relationship even further. Logically, I know that being 26 and not having had a relationship isn't a totally novel experience, but as much as I try to tell myself it's alright, it just seems like I've run out of time. It also doesn't help that 98% of my friends are in relationships, and a large percentage of those are engaged or married.

Lastly, while I understand the sentiment behind the advice that it's ""better to be alone than to settle for a bad relationship,"" I've actually never subscribed to that idea. It seems to come from people who aren't currently alone, or haven't be alone recently or for any extended period of time (let alone forever). I would take a body that didn't want to be next to me over my sad, empty bed, almost certainly. As far as verbal abuse goes, the sad reality is that for someone like me, I can be just as vile to myself when another date fails or I have to go home to my quiet apartment another day, so at least if I got it from another person, there might be good moments even a small percentage of the time.

Sorry for the stream-of-consciousness writing style, I just don't necessarily know how to continue on in life knowing that I have no one to care about me.

Dearest Gisselle,

I wish to send you only love during this time. One of the things I loved about you was the way you made me feel. You made me feel not alone. You made me feel understood. When I told you my pain it lessened. My heart aches so deeply for you. Every tear I cry for the rest of my life will be for you and still it will only be a raindrop in the ocean of sorrow that I feel. I told you about my dreams all the time. When I decided to change my life in Tucson I wrote down my top five life goals. My number one goal was to have a family. I never told you this. I pushed myself through hard times, with much of my motivation coming from the dream that one day I would have a family to share love with to make it all worth it. I got healthy, mentally and physically. I spent hours everyday learning about crypto to make enough money to give those I loved in the future anything they wanted. Ever since we dated during the summer of 2017 you had always been in the back of my mind. I never felt a physical sensation as heartwarming as the touch of your skin on my own. I have never kissed someone who kisses as passionately as you do. That weekend we reconnected earlier this year. You stayed at my house. My heart was so full. It was like it always was with you. Even if I hadn’t seen you in months, the connection I had with you was more vibrant than any other person in the world. I felt so excited. When you slept over that was the first time I had held you in so long. When I first embraced you my heart was beating out of my chest. You told me I can feel your heart beating. I hope you know it was beating for you. I am wearing your baggy shirt you used to sleep in that you left here that weekend as I type this. When you left I was so sad. I wanted to be with you all the time. I didn’t know what to do. I thought to myself what would I do if I could do anything in the world. You always said we can do anything you want. If I could do anything in the world it would be to travel it with you. So I asked you. You said yes. I felt like all my hard work had paid off. All those days I got out of bed when I didn’t feel like it and did what I had to do were worth it. I thought you were my person. I told you this on our last phone call. I will always remember that phone call. It was a perfect example of our connection. I felt free to fully express myself. There was crying, laughter, yelling, caring, pain, honesty. Oh how deeply I love you Gisselle. I have never felt more connected to any person in this world and connection is what means most to me. I want to hold you. I want to run my fingers through your hair. I want to feel your warm breath on me as we drift off to sleep. I want to rub your back in little circles. I think you know touch is my love language. I want to hear your laugh. The world's greatest composition fails in comparison to what music your laugh is to my ears. I want to kiss your forehead. The last time we hung out a week before pulled at my heart so much. In the morning when I woke up we weren’t cuddling anymore. I wrapped my arms around you and pulled you on top of me. We lied there entangled in each other for about two hours. I had one of my hands in your hair and the other on your soft tummy. I felt such warmness inside my chest. It was the physical manifestation of love. No one has ever made me feel that like you have. I want to hear you talk. I loved to listen to you. You talked without second guessing yourself. You let your being pour out of yourself, it was beautiful. It made me so happy just to listen to you. I would have done anything for you Gisselle. I told you I just wanted to love you. I wanted to help you grow like a gardener waters a flower and expects nothing in return. I said I love all of you, I love the bad and the good. I told you I would meet you wherever you were at. I didn’t care how low you were, I would meet you there. I told you that I wanted to grow with you and that we could do anything. I said I wanted to be with you until we get old and die and meet in the next life. I was ranting to you. I told you I wanted to go into the forest and chop down the woods to build a house for you. I told you I called you because I had just gotten out of a K hole. I shouldn’t have been doing ketamine that night. I had just gotten it for a rave and I guess I was feeling down about you so I did it to feel better. I had a very intense K hole. I told you I forgot about the physical world and melded with the universe. During this I was saying to myself “I love myself, I love myself, and I love you guys”. Whenever I get lost whatever the situation is I try to remind myself of that. I had lost the concept of the physical world and then I thought I love Gisselle and I need to love Gisselle. That’s why I called you. When I didn’t know what was going on or what the real world was, I knew I loved you. I'm glad I told you that. You said how you loved me too. I’m glad we told this to each other countless times. You were my best friend. You told me countless times I was yours. I felt so honored every time I heard you say that. I kept much of our relationship private. I didn’t want people to see that I was in love with you but not with you. I didn’t want you to think I wasn’t respecting our privacy or that I told people intimate details of our relationship. What I really wanted was to be with you and tell the whole world you were the girl I loved. I would have been proud to call myself your boyfriend. Now that you're gone it makes me feel so lonely. It feels like no one knows the connection we had. I don’t want to be seen as trying to act like we were closer than we were for attention or something. You know how important being authentic is to me. Even if I’m judged I want the world to know what you meant to me. I want everyone to know who you were. I told everyone many of my favorite things about you. I tried to make it about you and the impact you had on those around you, not about me. You know you got the letter. I will always keep anything I want or I believe you would have wanted private, private. I sadly deleted our text conversations that morning. You know I also blocked you on instagram and snapchat. I am sad I cannot look at your profile and our tagged photos do not show up on each other's instagrams anymore. I still have our saved snap chat messages. So many beautiful, intimate, vulnerable, flirty, funny, caring conversations just between you and I. I cropped out our hickeys in one of the photos I posted lol. You said you can’t be in a relationship right now, that you couldn’t love me properly because you could hardly love yourself. I wish I wasn’t so self centered. I wish I truly understood what you were saying. I told you I wished I could feel your pain for you so you wouldn’t have to. I remember when I broke my elbow. I yelled out in pain, you dropped your skateboard and spirited over. You lied on the ground with me. Our bodies touching each other side by side made the pain so much more bearable. You held your arm as I did mine. You were there for me. We lied there. You told me I was glowing magenta. I said if everyone had one time in their life they could go back in time that I would use it then to go back and not break my elbow. We laughed, you said “I love you, you're so funny”. If we each had one chance to go back in time I would use it now to go back to you. I would go back to the summer of 2017 and I would never leave your side until we grew old together. When I cut you off that morning in the back of my mind I thought this was what we needed. I told you on the phone I’m going to live my dream life with or without you. You said I know. This is not what I meant. You always said you would take a bullet for me, how can you do that now? I thought you needed to see that I didn’t need you maybe. I love you so much it hurt me to not be able to love you fully. I wanted that pain to stop so I said I want you to be my girlfriend or I want to move on. But even in moving on I thought we would come back to each other. I knew we would talk again one day and the connection would still be there like it always has been and we would know. I believe now that that phone call was the closure that you needed or the closure you thought I would need. When you texted me that morning to say you don’t think it’d be fair to me to hang out that night because you can’t be in a relationship and don’t want to lead me on, I think you already planned to do it. When I said alright and blocked you I think you knew that was going to happen. You said I know you will probably have to cut me off and that you were still trying to wrap your head around it. I will be trying to wrap my head around this for the rest of my life. I have never known true pain until I lost you. The only thing I have ever felt that matches the intensity of this feeling is my love for you. You have always been my dream girl and now I will only ever be with you in my dreams. I wake up in the morning not to hear birds singing but to hear them crying for you. One day I will see the world again as brightly as I did when I was with you. I told you I would live my dreams. You know I mean what I say. You said you knew. I will. I will not become jaded. I will love. You said that was always the answer. I miss you Gisselle. I will always miss you. I love you to the deepest depths of my soul.

Love, Drake.

That was my personal letter I wanted to share anonymously. If you would like to her more about her this is the letter I shared publicly. I wanted this one to be about her and the impact she had on those around her, not about me. Also so that people who didn't know her could know some about her. Also I would love to read any comments. I love to talk about her.

Dear, Gisselle

One of my favorite things about you was your ability to connect with people. I always admired that about you. You made friends everywhere you went, you loved people. Your energy attracted everyone. People could feel your love when they were around you. You were funny. You were clever and had a quick mind. You were able to laugh at jokes even when times were tough. You had a good sense of humor, you got it. You were kind, genuine, authentic. A note you wrote in a book says “The answer is always love”. You were a very empathetic person. You felt deeply. You had the ability to put yourself in others' shoes and feel what it was like for them. You had the ability to live in others' realities with them and feel their emotions as your own. To be able to do that like you did is something very profound. Even if someone's situation was unique, if they were going through it with you they weren’t going through it alone. You really listened when people talked. You really wanted to understand. You would repeat phrases back to me that I had said before when trying to express something to you about any topic I often talked about. You made people feel heard. You made others feel seen for who they really were. You accepted people for who they were and gave them space to be themselves. You were very adventurous. You weren’t afraid to take risks. You were brave. Whether it was learning to kite, skate, fight, or anything else you weren’t afraid to try. You were an athlete. Even if you got hurt you kept on, full send. If anyone was down to take a trip or go do something new it was you. You believed that you could do anything. So many times I’ve hear you shout “we can do anything!!” You were passionate. You had big ideas and big dreams. You inspired and motivated those around you. You were a hard worker. You supported yourself all through college. You worked your ass off full time while going to school full time. You still made time for your friends and adventures. You never wasted a minute. You were always doing something. You were really smart, emotionally and intellectually. You always got really good grades. You were a good friend. People could tell you about their accomplishments and you would celebrate with them. You would be just as happy as they were for their own accomplishment. People could tell you their dreams and you would cheer them on. You made people believe in themselves. You were creative. You were an artist. To create something is one of the most beautiful things a human can do. You were talented, you had skill. You could capture a moment in a perfect photograph. You could create a masterpiece from your own mind and put it on a canvas. You were always creating, whether it was abstract art in the sand, or a new sketch in your sketchbook while enjoying the outdoors. When you were with people you were really with them. You were in the moment. Never on your phone and you would make others forget they had one. When I was with you I forgot about the rest of the world outside of that moment. I felt recharged by you, you raised my vibration. I felt relief when I was with you. Time went by fast with you. You were really there. You had character. You stood up for what you believed in. You were the kind of person that helped people grow. You weren’t afraid to call people out. You weren’t afraid to love. You always told people that you loved them. You said that that was important. I loved your voice, it could be soft or powerful. You gave really good hugs. You squeezed tight. You made people feel good, like they were the only person in the world. Your energy expressed how happy you were running into a friend. You could feel it because it was authentic, it was real. You were real. You were confident. You were passionate. You were expressive. You were beautiful. You were outgoing. You were thoughtful. You were a magnificent human being. You were one of a kind. You loved dogs. You loved the outdoors. You liked to cook for your loved ones. You loved. Your favorite color was magenta. The impact you had on those around you is immeasurable. Words cannot express the utmost gratitude I feel for being lucky enough to have known you. You have helped me grow more than you will ever know. Thank you for all you have taught me. You were my favorite person. I love you, Gisselle.

I never felt anything what i felt for her and and fell hard but fortunately unfortunately we were stuck in online world also LDR. 

We had good thing going for about 3 months when it all went down hill i actually dk what was tye reason we broke up its been 8 months and still can't get her out of my brain my heart. We're still friends tho gonna ve meet soon as uni opens up. Idk what to feel exactly i love her but i don't want her back but also cry out everytime i think of her being with someone else. I've been practicing moving on but i can't help it i relapse.

The thing is after all that i just feel that someone can just leave me just like am nothing to them. 2022 coming soon my only wish is that i could just be with someone or atleast be lucky enough to have my first kiss even holding hands kinda intimacy.

5528,veilblue,1638465812,1,"About 7 years ago I slowly lost all my friends one by one and I am painfully alone. I just don’t know how much more isolation I can take. I am almost 20, and I've never been in a relationship, never been kissed, never even held a guy's hand. So many people my age are in relationships and most of them started dating in high school, I feel like such an outlier. They say it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all, and it's 100% true. I don't even know if it's even possible for someone to love me because I've never experienced it. Even if you start a relationship and it doesn't work out, at least you can leave that relationship knowing that you're capable of finding someone else. You already managed to get one guy to like you, if you could do it once then you're definitely more than capable of doing it again. I blame my parents for the fact that I've never been in a relationship. They're so overbearing and always in my business, they won't let me live my life and be an adult. I feel like I’m wasting my life. All the other people my age are out having fun and living their best lives and I’m sitting in my bedroom and watching my youth pass me by. I’m supposed to be having the best time of my life. I feel like a flower in a dark closet, slowly withering away. I hate myself and I feel disgusting. Dating is almost impossible when you live at home with your parents. 
Being single is a condition that I do not enjoy. If I was in a relationship I would be an all around happier person. My mental health would be better, my physical health would be better. I would be happier and more motivated. I would be less depressed. It has become very clear to me that I do not thrive as a single person. I cannot thrive unless I am in a relationship. Whenever I confide in my mother about my relationship status and express to her that I am upset about being single, she will often laugh and she doesn’t seem to understand why being in a relationship is so important to me. Sometimes I wonder if she is even straight, I feel like she might be asexual. From what she has told me, it appears to me that in her youth she was very disinterested in having relationships with men, unlike me, she thrived being single. I have also realised over the years that my mom is very innocent when it comes to matters of sex and relationships. When she got married at the age of 26 she was still a virgin. She did not engage in any dating prior to meeting my dad, however at the age of 20 she was forced into an arranged marriage that only lasted about about 48 hrs because the man she was forced to marry was actually gay and he was only marrying her because he wanted the dowry money. Considering the fact that most people in Generation X first became sexually active in their late teenage years, she is certainly an anomaly. When my mother was growing up the term asexual probably didn’t exist, but that doesn’t mean that asexual people only started existing 20 years ago. I’m sure that they’ve always existed, and for most of human history asexual people might have gone their whole lives not even knowing that they where asexual. I think she got married mainly because women in her culture were encouraged to marry. Where she grew up there was a stigma against being unmarried as a woman in your mid to late 20’s. At the time arranged marriage was still a common practice and so to still be single as a woman in your mid to late 20’s was regarded as unusual. I am single but I am in no way happy about it. Being single causes me great sadness. The only thing I can do to cope with my singleness, is just to avoid thinking about it. I have never enjoyed being single and I cannot fathom why anyone would want to be single. As a child I always believed that I would have my first relationship while in highschool. I never imagined that I would still be single by now. My mother doesn’t feel the same way about being single as I do. When she was single she was a very happy person. For me being single is agonizing, the loneliness and emptiness its quiet literally suffocating. The idea of being single for the rest of my life is an absolute nightmare. Being single causes me to feel empty and depressed. I feel incomplete, like a part of me is missing, a longing for my other half. I don’t think my mother ever felt incomplete when she was single. I often hear older people say stuff like, “You need to find happiness within yourself.” I think that this is a very arrogant and insensitive thing to say, I am not capable of finding happiness within myself. I am literally in therapy for anxiety and depression, and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist in February. If finding happiness was that simple then nobody would ever be depressed. I rely on external validation to maintain my self esteem. I cannot believe anything about myself unless there is evidence in my life to substantiate it. For example I cannot believe I am smart unless I get good grades. I cannot believe I am pretty unless I receive compliments regarding my beauty etc. I need to feel as though I am desired by another person to have any sort of value. I can’t help it, this is just how I am. The compliments that I get from relatives are meaningless to me, I know my family is biased and will never really be honest with me. A compliment is only valuable to me if I believe that the person giving me the compliment is unbiased and has no ulterior motives when he or she decides to compliment me. For these reasons my self esteem is contingent upon what strangers think of me. Since I have never been in a relationship, I have never received any validation at all from a man who is not my relative. I obviously have horrible self esteem and  basically zero confidence. The only benefit to having remained single for this long is that I have had the chance to learn from the mistakes that I have witnessed other women make. I cannot simply just date any guy of course. I have heard many stories of women who gave their hearts and bodies to men who didn’t love them, only to be used and discarded. I never wanted that to be me. I am a very sensitive and emotionally fragile person, a hopeless and romantic. I don’t do the whole hookup thing, I have always found casual sex to be barbaric and animalistic. I am a very sentimental person when it comes to love, if I where to be used and discarded in the manner that I have seen happen to others, I would probably be traumatized for the rest of my life, maybe even jump off a bridge. All I really want and have ever wanted is to just meet my soulmate and live happily with them forever, but it seems in this day and age gentlemen are a lost breed.",lonely,"I have been alone for 7 years and counting, I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",2021-12-03 04:23:32

Even if you start a relationship and it doesn't work out, at least you can leave that relationship knowing that you're capable of finding someone else. You already managed to get one guy to like you, if you could do it once then you're definitely more than capable of doing it again. I blame my parents for the fact that I've never been in a relationship. They're so overbearing and always in my business, they won't let me live my life and be an adult. I feel like I’m wasting my life. All the other people my age are out having fun and living their best lives and I’m sitting in my bedroom and watching my youth pass me by. I’m supposed to be having the best time of my life. I feel like a flower in a dark closet, slowly withering away. I hate myself and I feel disgusting. Dating is almost impossible when you live at home with your parents. 
Being single is a condition that I do not enjoy. If I was in a relationship I would be an all around happier person. My mental health would be better, my physical health would be better. I would be happier and more motivated. I would be less depressed. It has become very clear to me that I do not thrive as a single person. I cannot thrive unless I am in a relationship. Whenever I confide in my mother about my relationship status and express to her that I am upset about being single, she will often laugh and she doesn’t seem to understand why being in a relationship is so important to me. Sometimes I wonder if she is even straight, I feel like she might be asexual. From what she has told me, it appears to me that in her youth she was very disinterested in having relationships with men, unlike me, she thrived being single. I have also realised over the years that my mom is very innocent when it comes to matters of sex and relationships. When she got married at the age of 26 she was still a virgin. She did not engage in any dating prior to meeting my dad, however at the age of 20 she was forced into an arranged marriage that only lasted about about 48 hrs because the man she was forced to marry was actually gay and he was only marrying her because he wanted the dowry money. Considering the fact that most people in Generation X first became sexually active in their late teenage years, she is certainly an anomaly. When my mother was growing up the term asexual probably didn’t exist, but that doesn’t mean that asexual people only started existing 20 years ago. I’m sure that they’ve always existed, and for most of human history asexual people might have gone their whole lives not even knowing that they where asexual. I think she got married mainly because women in her culture were encouraged to marry. Where she grew up there was a stigma against being unmarried as a woman in your mid to late 20’s. At the time arranged marriage was still a common practice and so to still be single as a woman in your mid to late 20’s was regarded as unusual. I am single but I am in no way happy about it. Being single causes me great sadness. The only thing I can do to cope with my singleness, is just to avoid thinking about it. I have never enjoyed being single and I cannot fathom why anyone would want to be single. As a child I always believed that I would have my first relationship while in highschool. I never imagined that I would still be single by now. My mother doesn’t feel the same way about being single as I do. When she was single she was a very happy person. For me being single is agonizing, the loneliness and emptiness its quiet literally suffocating. The idea of being single for the rest of my life is an absolute nightmare. Being single causes me to feel empty and depressed. I feel incomplete, like a part of me is missing, a longing for my other half. I don’t think my mother ever felt incomplete when she was single. I often hear older people say stuff like, “You need to find happiness within yourself.” I think that this is a very arrogant and insensitive thing to say, I am not capable of finding happiness within myself. I am literally in therapy for anxiety and depression, and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist in February. If finding happiness was that simple then nobody would ever be depressed. I rely on external validation to maintain my self esteem. I cannot believe anything about myself unless there is evidence in my life to substantiate it. For example I cannot believe I am smart unless I get good grades. I cannot believe I am pretty unless I receive compliments regarding my beauty etc. I need to feel as though I am desired by another person to have any sort of value. I can’t help it, this is just how I am. The compliments that I get from relatives are meaningless to me, I know my family is biased and will never really be honest with me. A compliment is only valuable to me if I believe that the person giving me the compliment is unbiased and has no ulterior motives when he or she decides to compliment me. For these reasons my self esteem is contingent upon what strangers think of me. Since I have never been in a relationship, I have never received any validation at all from a man who is not my relative. I obviously have horrible self esteem and  basically zero confidence. The only benefit to having remained single for this long is that I have had the chance to learn from the mistakes that I have witnessed other women make. I cannot simply just date any guy of course. I have heard many stories of women who gave their hearts and bodies to men who didn’t love them, only to be used and discarded. I never wanted that to be me. I am a very sensitive and emotionally fragile person, a hopeless and romantic. I don’t do the whole hookup thing, I have always found casual sex to be barbaric and animalistic. I am a very sentimental person when it comes to love, if I where to be used and discarded in the manner that I have seen happen to others, I would probably be traumatized for the rest of my life, maybe even jump off a bridge. All I really want and have ever wanted is to just meet my soulmate and live happily with them forever, but it seems in this day and age gentlemen are a lost breed.",lonely,"I have been alone for 7 years and counting, I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",2021-12-03 04:22:12

I want to die. I want to swallow all 10 bottles of Hydroxyzine, 1 bottle of Xanax, 1 bottle of Valium and 1 bottle of Librium. Pretty confident that will do it. See the issue I’m having is that I’m getting a divorce……again…..and I’m a childless 33 year old woman who keeps fucking waking up. Like every single day. I’ve never wanted to be alive for as long as I can remember. I’ve scoured heaven and earth for someone to save me. Someone that loves me so much I want to stay. But they don’t exist. I thought maybe my purpose was to become a shrink to help others but 8 years of college has fried my brain. So I lay here at 3am trying to think of reasons not to kill myself. And I can’t think of a single reason. “Think of the people who love you and what that would do to them”. Um where the fuck are they? “The Bible says you’ll go to hell if you take your own life”. My life is hell. I already live in hell. I slit my wrists once and my boyfriend (soon to be ex husband) just got mad via text, my best friend threatened to commit me to a mental institution but didn’t bother to come over to my apartment and my mother asked me if I did it for attention. That same mother now claims she never knew I slit my wrists. I couldn’t even kill myself properly. Maybe I’ll become a star in the bewitching night sky. All stars eventually burn out into nothingness. Because I’m not equipped to spend another 33 years here being let down by every soul that crosses my path. I hope my death saves someone. I hope that as I draw my last breath someone in the world takes a deep breath in and I can take their place. There are people on this earth so breathtaking that to lose them would be catastrophic. I am but a simple girl. A girl with so much intensity that I could have been someone’s everything. That someone never showed up and there is no one who can save me. If someone reads this……get the girl. Tell her you were out of your mind to let her go. Tell her you will spend forever making sure she knows she’s your only girl and that you love her with the fire of a thousand suns. I promise you won’t regret it.

Basically there are 4 of them that I met in support groups for a shared disability last year. I've never met any of them, but they became people I chatted with daily as we all struggled with our health.

For one reason or another, I am worn out with all of them. They subtract from my life instead of adding to it. One of them I fell for and was rejected and am not really interested in friendship while she dates other guys, one of them is threatening suicide basically weekly and dumping on me constantly looking for free therapy, another two the conversations were very dry and boring. They're as exciting as 80's TV reruns and they chat to me almost daily.

3/4 are not taking the hint so far. My crush is still initiating conversation despite me cutting contact 80-90% this week, the woman in really bad shape has actually paid money to text me via SMS (we're in different countries and I deleted her off Signal).

My entire life I just never felt like I fit in and it's always been hard communicating with people. 

The past year I went through a divorce and not a single friend was there for me. in the end they told me my depression was too much and they were ""tired of hearing about it"". I never saw my friends often and living alone without a support system it would slip out when I saw them every few months about how hard everything was. 

I didn't trauma dump I was just really lonely and they made me feel like my loneliness was annoying so I just cut all those terrible people off but now I'm alone. I have a partner and he's great but I can't hang out with his friends.

But what use is it when my innate loneliness instead focuses on some other deficiency in lifestyle? As if nothing had changed. I'm always some way or another lead back to this point, then abandon my friends like a moron as if it were justified by the previous thought. I've only just managed to form the mere semblance of friendship but am so preoccupied by the intangible notion of having a gf, that it has completely enveloped my life at the moment. I've spent the last couple days at home drawing myself gf material because I literally can't think of anything else. If this is how I lose my friends then I most certainly deserve this insufferable loneliness because it's all just too ridiculous and pathetic.

Yesterday, I went out alone and spent money I don't have the luxury of spending, so as to get extremely drunk and somehow chance upon my cliche preconception of a one night stand, obviously it didn't happen. I just wanted to experience something intimate, no matter how brief. Although perhaps I was just being shallow and wanted sex: I'm not sure, and don't really care enough to make the distinction anyway. Back to my anecdote; went to 8 bars, spoke to no one except the bartender, made an ass of myself everywhere I went, got too drunk and nearly passed out on an isolated beach, which I went to because I was getting sick of seeing people enjoying a social night out. This is an improvement! Things used to be much worse. I was going to call one of these two friends and break down crying about how lonely I felt, but decided against it as it would likely have had the adverse effect, though, this said, I regret not doing it as it could've actually deepened that newly found connection. I suspect that's completely wrong, but how am I to convince myself of that as someone of so little life-experience.

I'm typing all this as an attempt to distract my mind from the onslaught of hypothetical girlfriends. I guess I'm also hoping someone can impart some insight on how to better retain friendships, or I just hate myself so much that I'm willing to share my embarrassing daily existence to humiliate myself even further.

but all the guys I end up meeting either lie to me, hurt my feelings or just try to use me for sex. I’ve been in a constant chain of mind games, lies and just general emotional pain. I can already feel my trust issues getting worse after every encounter and it makes me want to close off my heart and become a bitter, mean person. 

I’m really fucking tired of it and I don’t really know what else to do. No one else in my circle would really be able to relate to what I’m going through. 

I try to be as genuine and kind as I possibly can but it seems as if no one actually wants someone like me. Am I doing something wrong? I just don’t know why it’s so hard to find a boyfriend….

I am 29M and am very lonely.

I have not been in a relationship in a very long time. Every now and then I will go on dating apps like bumble, tinder and even recently signed up for eharmony (its a waste of money btw). I really don't think I am that unattractive. I am quite athletic, have a good job and some fun hobbies etc, but literally get no attention on there. For example, I have messaged 6 girls on eharmony, no replies at all. On bumble, only 1 girl matched with me. She said 'Hello', I responded, complimented her and asked her a question, no reply. Later that day I was notified by bumble that that girl no longer wanted to chat. Tinder is not much better.

Basically what I am getting at is that a regular guy tries to find a relationship and literally gets nothing.  You can't help but feel shit about yourself and lonely after experiences like that. It's similar on this subreddit. Girls post they are lonely and get lots of messages and guys post and get nothing.",lonely,Is it harder to be a lonely boy than a lonely girl?,2021-12-02 21:31:38

I feel comfortable with this person even though I dont see them constantly or know them really but since the first time we met I felt like we clicked and we had great sexual tension as well as good conversations. After we hook up he would always lead me on and say how I was perfect for him and he wanted us to be more serious. I was always hesitant but eventually I would give in. Well its been like this for the past 3-4 years. We talk for a couple weeks and then he ghosts me. 6 months ago he hit me up to see each other and he told me that he had stopped talking to me because he experienced some hardships and he felt like he missed his chance however I told him we could only be friends and he agreed but he would lead and lead me on until we hooked up again. He kept talking to me even though I ghosted him from time to time. I wanted to feel wanted. Anyways I would give in and talk to him because I craved the intimacy. However he ended up ghosting me and I just feel so worthless and like a pos. I let my guard down and he played me again. Its sad to say but I crave that even though it was temporary I liked feeling wanted. I liked feeling that warmth from someone. I just wish I was able to meet new people Nd feel worthy.

I'm kind of an artsy guy, and out here it's mostly a few farmers and rednecks. Not that there's anything wrong with being those things, but it's not really my crowd. 

I've traveled. I spent a few years in a AmeriCorps and worked for the feds in emergency management for a brief bit of time, travelling the country. I made some friends, even had a relationship here and there, but I always seem to end up back here on my parent's farm. 

There's nothing out here. It's a blessing and a curse. The quiet is nice sometimes, but there's nobody to hang out with, nowhere to go. I've been stuck out here before a time or two. The longest stretch was nearly a year of talking to virtually nobody but my parents on occasion. Human beings aren't meant to live like this. It does terrible things to your mind. 

I'm taking a class at a nearby community college (it's a long commute), and God willing next semester I'll be able to take up a full time schedule and live on campus, but in the meantime it can be hard to cope with the loneliness.

I have my regular corporate work where it was announced that there is going to be a company vacation at the end of the year. That itself is a relief from the burnout/imposter syndrome I have been feeling this year.

On top of that, I have started freelance on the side with minimal time commitment per month - it is expected to take a while. 

The company vacation + the rest of my vacation days means that I will probably be able to finish it by the end of the year - resulting in a huge influx of money bringing me closer to actually getting a mortgage for my own flat.

5619,Fakeos,1638414528,1,"(long post, tldr bottom)

Over the years, I kept going with this emptiness in my heart we all call loneliness. 

Some days it was easy, lt felt like bad medicine in the night and I would just go to sleep and forget about it. Sometimes it hit hard at an inappropriate time and I was having a hard time maintaining appearance. 

Every once in while I just walk back and forth in my room coming up with ""solutions"" to fix my loneliness. On paper the solution is simpel, get a wife. Have children. Start your long desired family.

In practice, y'all know it feels fucking impossible. 

So why am I talking about pride in the title? What does that have to do with the search for the one?

Because I literally squeezed out every ounce of pride out of me to achieve my goal. I never encountered someone who was willing to start a family with me. Not in highschool, not in Uni, not at work.

In Uni there was like 2 girls for 158 men, good luck with the competition. They weren't suitable for me anyway and at work same deal. 2 girls, a bazillion men. Not suitable anyway.

So I asked everyone I knew to find me someone suitable for me. Mom, friends, colleagues, stranger's. 

This shit. Was fucking. EMBARRASSING. How big of a loser do you have to be to do that shit. After that I don't even remember how pride feels like. I don't have any left.

But at the time I didn't care, I was desperate bro, desperate to escape this pain that I know too well and for far too long.

I mean what the fuck was I supposed to do? Watch myself die alone? Fuck no. I mean at this point it just feels like I'm surviving on a day to day basis, and I know nobody understands what I go through, except maybe this sub.

It did work a little bit though, I got some potentials, but all of them were either too picky, not interested or attracted to me, or they were trying to change me too much.

I tried everything. For real. School, work, parents, family, friends, meeting people at the gym, dating apps. Everything man.

Now I'm just tired, tired of searching for a nice girl who might like me even just a little bit.

Maybe dying alone is not so bad, maybe it's my destiny. But as God is my witness I will fight this destiny with everything that I have left.

And when my last day on this selfish world come and I still end up dying alone.

I will say with pride, without lying to myself:

""There wasn't a single thing I could have done more, and I genuinely tried."" 

To me, loneliness feels like you live in a warzone. You wake up everyday, trying to survive and you just wonder when is it going to end? When can I finally be at peace? Will I stay alone and sad forever?

Tl;dr: When I noticed dying sad and alone was becoming a reality I asked everyone I knew that I wanted a wife and if they could hook me up with someone. It felt so sad and pathetic that I feel no ounce of pride in me anymore. But I am still trying to not die alone. The odds are against me though.",lonely,Pride is a luxury,2021-12-02 14:08:48

5622,Migloopis,1638413796,1,"I'm not exactly sure where to start with this, but I just wanted to get this out there. Somewhere. 

I've spent countless days in the past years of my life, losing my mind and my values. I lost my father when I was 13 going on 14 years old. He had always been the ""motivation"" in my life. Or in other words, the reason I would get up on time, eat breakfast and make sure to do my homework, at least that's all it seemed to be when I was younger. He always made sure I understood how important it was. To keep a routine, to understand who and what's important, and what's worth worrying about. At the time, all it seemed to me was overprotective parenting. I wouldn't even be able to walk more than 100 meters up the street by myself, without him panicking, and we lived in a very rural area. We lived in our grandparents basement most of our lives. After I was born, my father had went to prison for a few years and my mother started working at a daycare to make ends meet. She also took care of my grandparents throughout the years. She never got the recognition she deserved for it, unfortunately.

While my dad was in prison, he wrote stories for me every day. Most of which, I still have in letters, but am too scared to read. My mother used to read them to me before bed, but I don't remember most of them, nor did I understand why my father wasn't home. 

Fast forward a few years, I was 10. My father was back home with me and would do all he could to spend time with me. Whether it be buy or ride a bike with me, play on my N64 with me or walk me home from school everyday.  I always felt like he was trying to make up for the years he was gone. Most of which I didn't remember anyways. I was just happy he was around. He used to always talk about himself as if he was my ""annoying old man"" in my life, but I always looked up to him. There wasn't anyone else that taught me as much as he did. 

After a few years, we finally moved out of my grandparents basement. We still lived off geared to income housing, but it was, sadly, better than being under the roof of close family. We were finally on our own and I was able to go into a public school. I was about 12 at the time. I had a hard time making friends, but it wasn't anything new, so I just kept to myself. I was introduced to bullying for the first time, but that was just dust in the wind. 

By the time I was 13, I had a girlfriend, if you could call it that. I was young at the time, so it was kinda weird and without substance, obviously. But, as time when by, October came around in 8th grade and my father had hung himself. My ""girlfriend"" kept telling me that it was her fault, for some reason. She kept saying it was ""her manifestation"" in order to give us more time to be together or some shit, but I was 14, so like, who cares what dumb shit she said. ANYWAY.

It never really bothered me. Somehow, it was always in the back of my mind, but, it really felt like nothing had changed. It made me want to feel like something HAD to change. By the time I was 15, it was the first time it truly started affecting me. I gave up. I realized I had no one rooting for me anymore. No reason to continue. The effort and patience I gave was for nothing. Had it all been for nothing, each time before as well? What outcome would happen if I simply, gave up? I had stopped showing up to class, but my grades stayed the same. My principal eventually got upset with me and told me to get my shit together before he sent me to another school. I didn't really care by that point. I just kept doing what I was doing, and somehow passing just as well as any other student, which made me realize how negligent the teachers were towards legitimate success towards students, as well as their disabilities. 

Eventually, by sophomore year, they had their way. I was kicked out. Sent to, what I viewed at the time, was a ""Burnout school"" filled with troubled teens who mostly resorted to drug abuse. At first I was frustrated to believe they would think so little of me. As I took classes there, I realized it was easier, more laid back, and less stress. Aimed towards student with a lesser education. It frustrated me at the time. I was no longer able to take university level classes in most subjects. I became horrifically depressed, there was no reason to care about my education anymore. I gave up. I no longer cared about my well being. So may depressants and uppers abused, I didn't want to live like this anymore. I was now 20 years old. I hardly remember the past 3 years of my life. Most of my memories are drug related nowadays. 

I had been put onto a lot of medication. Most antidepressants didn't work out, so I ended up being put on sleeping medication in order to benefit my sleep issues over anything. It ended up becoming the source of my drug abuse, mixed with alcohol and cannabis.

As I grew up, I only thought of myself as a failure. I don't have much going for me. I can't drive, I can hardly cook, I barely know how to take care of myself. I feel so lost. I'm trying so hard to better myself, to lose weight, to stop abusing drugs, to stop being scared. Its so horrifying. To go out and talk to people. I can't even go to the store without being scared of bothering the employee ffs. I've been living in fear for so long. I don't want to do this anymore. I just hope that one day things make sense. I just hope that I can, at least for once, understand why I live in this fear.",lonely,I don't know what I've been doing,2021-12-02 13:56:36

I tried to just forget she exists but somehow that’s really hard to do, so I feel the only option is to at least TRY to tell her how I see her, and hopefully we can get to know each other.
PS… I know it might sound like I’m romanticizing the situation, and that’s because I am. It’s a bad habit but a hard one to kick. But if anybody has advice to me to tell her how she’s lights up a room… that would be amazing 💛",lonely,I want to ask her for her number. Advice?,2021-12-02 13:15:46

Then, by end of October, that person took their life. And now I am utterly alone. Grieving. And feeling like the person I could see myself growing into and growing with has left me floating in space and isolated.

Not many people in their mid 20s, nor even older, have experienced a romantic loss like this. Breakups… sure. Divorce… okay. Death… no. It is so isolating. Especially for someone who already felt caught in a time and in a world where I am destined to feel misunderstood. 

My best friend lives across the country. My ex has been there for me, but I’ve never felt like he truly understood me and I know it pains him to watch me grieve someone else. I know people love me, but I don’t know how to receive it. I have strained relationships with my family from years of physical and emotional/verbal abuse. I am angry and devastated.

I don’t know where to live. I don’t know what I want to do in life. I’m unemployed (I was working for his mother, but his death has complicated that relationship). I am in intense mourning and everyone is busy living their own lives. I don’t blame them, life continues on. But the days are painful and slow. A day feels like a week.

I miss him so much. The person who I made smile and made me smile. The person I shared a bed with all those nights, laughing and touching and loving. The person who felt like my true equal. Gone.

My life, well, I wouldn’t call it *bad*, I think a more appropriate term would be *boring*. But it is boring to the point that it’s driving me insane. I’m currently 15, yet I have never gone to a party, or kissed a girl or gotten drunk while everyone around me is, and believe, it is not because I don’t want. I’ve just never been invited by anyone. I have very few friends and when we hang out we are never more than six, and we never go with girls. It’s so tiring to be playing on your computer a Saturday night while everyone else is out partying, when you can literally hear them yelling and singing from your bedroom.

I can’t take this shit, I feel like I’m not actively disliked by anyone, but nobody has ever really bothered to reach out to me, to tell me to go to a party or something. I am an absolute social outcast. Maybe there are people that are less liked, like weebs and that sort of stuff, but they at least have each other, I, at times feel like I am all alone in the world or like my friends are all stuck in the same place I am.

What is it that I’m doing wrong? I’ve always been kinda shy and I must admit that for years I was unable to defeat that shyness. But know I have, yet I feel like I’ve had to become a parody of myself to achieve that, and I still haven’t managed to get to *live*. What is wrong with me? Is it my sense of humor? Am I really just weird and don’t wanna assume it? Is it my old reputation, which I cannot escape? Why is there always something big happening just behind me and nobody wants to tell me, yet they all act nice and smile?

Am I overthinking? Perhaps, but I cannot stand this situation anymore. I have envy, yes, I’m jealous of everybody, I’m jealous of the world because they are having fun while I’m bored, not only bored, isolated, tired, but desperate. What is wrong with me?

5676,indiileg,1638401605,1,"(First of all, english is not my first language so I wan't to apologize if there are any errors throughout the text.)

I cannot remember the last time i was happy, the last time someone loved, or cared even the slightest for me. This is the feeling I have carried for most of my life and throughout all this years, I believe it has gotten worse. From getting beaten up by school bullies for years to getting publicly stripped infront of all of my peers. This is without including all the social as well as romantic rejections.
Despite all of this, when i moved to a new school, I decided to make a few friends. And luckily enough I was able to accomplish this goal. However, after a year the group of friends I had made, stopped talking to eachother. The reason behind this, or so I was told, was because my depressive state was too much for them.
After all of this experiences had taken place, I felt more lonelier than ever. No one to talk or listen to. Luckily, I was really into drawing so I started to spend all of my time drawing. But that only had a positive impact at the beginning on the long run, I started to feel so much pain that I was not able to handle it.
All this feelings became even worst when I got into Fine Arts Univeristy where I lost all my passion to drawing. And when I realized I had lost my passion for the only thing that was important in my life all this thoughts that had lived on my head for years came to the surface (being so lonely takes all the strengthand energy i have inside of me, I hate seeing other people giving and receiving love ¿Why can't I be happy like them?, ¿Do I deserve to be happy?, no one would ever love me, I am going to die alone, I just want someone to touch me and love me ¿Is that too muchto ask?...). Despite so many thoughts, the one that standed out amongst the crowd was ""I will never be happy will alive"". 
From then omwards, i couldn't stop feeling like shit and thinking about suicide and one day, everything was too much for me. But, before killing myself, for some reason, I made the decision to call a suicide prevention line however there was no one ablelable. The irony of that moment made me cry uncontrollaby for what felt like hours. I was so alone and sad at that moment that i was unable to do anything but cry on my bed.

I still feel extremely lonely everyday luckily, to deal with this feeling, I got a bunch of plushies to hug at night and I imagine they are a friend, a boyfriend or a girlfriend (it works, or atleast it makes me forget me loneliness for some time).

5677,Bd-cat,1638401361,1,"Well, first post here, but I’m glad I found this subreddit.

Before covid, and while I was still at uni, I had an amazing social life, a huge circle of friends, and I had a busy day to day that kept me out every day and interacting with people. However, even my closest friends would acknowledge that while they can open up to me, I was always keeping them at an arms length.

I grew up in a very abusive household. I don’t want to say what happened, but in my childhood and teenage years I became extremely self isolated. I was terrified of being spoken to, I wouldn’t let people physically touch me, I was severely depressed and for as long as I can remember, my highest fantasy has been being alone. I dreamt of moving far away from my family and being safe in my own space. Trusting anyone, being intimate and or close to people, was extremely difficult for me. This took years of work, with professionals, and I still struggle with distrust, discomfort, and apprehension when dealing with any kind of close relationship.

When I got to university, my mentality started to change and I have tried working on these behaviors. I flourish socially, and it helped me a lot, but I’m still struggling with the same thoughts and feelings. I understand where they stem from, but I still pursue that objective of being alone. I’m hundreds of miles away from any family now, and that has given me a lot of peace, but I long for a support circle. 

I have close friends I’ve kept for years, but still, I feel like I can’t be close to anyone. I don’t feel confident or comfortable enough to open up to them, and I guess that’s shown even more in romantic relationships. I alienate myself from any sort of intimate situation, it just seems like I switch off, but I’m desperate for that kind of relationship. I want to feel accompanied, I want to share things with another person. I’m great at listening, I’m loyal and trustworthy, and I help people I care about as much as I can but to me it’s still inconvencible that these things would be reciprocated so I don’t expect them or even ask them if others, again, adding to the impression that I’m very distant. I’ve been told by many people that I’m unconditionally there for them, and they’re grateful for it, but I can’t imagine me having someone I can count on in the same way.

I’m getting older now, and now I’m just starting to feel immensely lonely. I want to feel close to others, but it’s like there’s this wall that I can’t climb. It’s wearing me out, always expecting that I’ll end up alone, that no one will be there for me. And at the same time, being alone is a safety net I cling to. I don’t have anyone I can rely on in case of an emergency, for example, I have two friends in this town despite being here for almost two years. 

I feel like I’m wasting away, I feel like I have so much to offer to others, but what else can I do?

I am currently living back home with my parents with my boyfriend because of unfortunate events. It doesn’t help that my house is really small and don’t have any privacy or space. I know I probably sound entitled or mean but sometimes I wish my parents tried a little harder to better their quality of life. When I try to tell them this kindly they gaslight me and say mean things to me. I pay for half the rent at the house and it seems like that’s not enough for them. My mom is a hoarder she keeps a bunch of stuff everywhere and my dad does everything my mom says. Every day I wake up to start my day I can’t even start it off right because there’s a mess everywhere. It’s clear there’s some mental health issues going on in this house and no one seems to care. It sucks because I can’t even express myself in this house or voice a boundary because all of a sudden I’m ungrateful for all that they have done for me. Like yes mom and dad thank you for doing the bare minim as a kid and providing me with food and shelter. I typically tend to just stay in my little living area which is the living room with some curtains I try and come out and engage in conversation with them but every time I do it’s like they say something wrong with me or I’m doing something wrong. I constantly hear them judging my way of life. Idk I just feel worthless even though I know I’m not.

I have friends but like no close friends. I tell my friends everything but I really don’t feel the connection. Maybe I want a girlfriend?

I am also very tired which I think makes it worse. I work 80 hour weeks so that kinda hurts my ability to go out and have fun and meet people.

I guess that I get that I'm supposed to be some sort of loner that stands out from the crowd and makes cool art and has a different types of connections with people.

5733,ScienceOfLiving,1638379584,1,"Today I want to reflect on the relavency of the phrase ""always the bridesmaid, never the bride"" as it pertains to my personal brand of social isolation. I (25M) suffer from a chronic fear of abandonment which only seems to be getting worse as I get older. Because of this I tend to hyperfixate and make other people the center of my universe, while not actually being the center of theirs. My undying and borderline desperate loyalty often leads me to be considered one of their best and most trusted friends...but never to the same level as I revere them. My current best friend and roommate is in a relationship, his partner is over frequently and nothing I have tried has been successful in freeing this empty pit in my heart that tells me he would always pick his partner over me. I will forever be second to this random person who hasn't even known him as long as I have. I surpress the rage this develops and it almost always festers into blaming myself. Why can't I be someone's number one for once in my fucking life? It must be my fault. 

This is where this phrase comes in. I am eternally pressed to the sidelines of the lives of everyone I know when all I really want is one person to love me enough to make me a priority sometimes. But I fear that day will never come. I am alone, even with friends I am alone because I know I would take a bullet for any of them but none would pick me over a goddamned klondike bar. I feel more isolated now than when I lived alone, and the constant reminder that I am not enough only serves to dash any hope I have at finding peace. The desire to cut myself off from everyone else and isolate entirely grows every day because at the very least then the loneliness would be my choice.

I've always been described as cheerful and sunny in the past. But for the last year I am the drizzle that never stops. I wish I was the tempest, with rage and fury and fire in my heart. But no. It is just a constant drizzle of sadness. Sometimes through this sadness I even feel I am close to making some form of philosophical breakthrough. 

I was fine being alone before meeting my ex-gf. I had moments of sadness but it was usually fine. But after having a LDR with my ex, I've grown to enjoy more intimate human relationships. She used to be my best friend, someone I could talk to, someone who was there for me. But her heart changed for another local man. 

Ever since then I began to realize how lonely I was. My friends from college live 12 hours away. Meeting people in grad school has been hard so far. Everyone has their families/group now. Even worse I am an international student. No family for me to visit. 

I tried reaching out to people, but everyone is on guard. No one trusts anyone. In every social situation, there seems to be people trying to exclude other, and forming their own clique. I am rarely the ones excluded from the beginning but I despise such behavior. 

I tried dating apps. Almost everyone on there is laden with baggage and emotionally unavailable. The women fear asshole men so they treat every man as an asshole. The men fight for whatever scrape of attention they can get and force dates/physical relations before getting to know each other. Everyone is ""talking"" to x other people yet none of it can be taken seriously. 

I recently forgot projecting a shield. I thought I met the perfect girl. We had so much in common and talked and talked until one of us fell asleep and discussed our first date. I thought I had finally found the one. I thought I broke the cycle. She was not without her issues and I am not without mine, but there seemed to be a real possibility we could grow together. She asked for my patience, for me to build trust with her.... and I did all of that. Then poof, in an instant (in my language, the word ""an instant"" is borrowed from Sanskrit ""क्षण""), she was gone and the void fills my heart once more. I am alone again. It feels worse than never knowing her. I did not deserve that. And who knows why she did what she did. Reddit advises me to force dates with her even though she explicitly asked to build trust first. The lesson for me here is probably to never take strangers seriously again. But that would make me just like them. That would me I will make others feel lonely.

It makes me wonder, who is this first asshole that spread this misery to everyone. It makes me wonder if we can ever return to innocence. I know this innocence existed decades earlier, when our grandparents were our age.",lonely,This society enforces loneliness.,2021-12-01 21:20:47

I'm essentially trying to remove all traces of myself online (I guess the privacy benefits are also there as well). The only accounts I really use nowadays are my Spotify, Reddit, Amazon, two main Gmails, and Lichess (I've been playing a lot of chess recently). 

I've rejected calls and messages from toxic people that wanted to reconnect, because I've finally come to the realization that interacting with these people only causes me great harm and stress. I try too hard to be a people pleaser, not because I want to, but because it comes naturally.

I want food. I want to talk about Gundams and Magic and One Piece. I don't want to work for others my entire life. I wish I could finish JUST ONE writing project. I wish someone would read my writing. I wish I wasn't nervous about people taking my (eternally incomplete) work. I'm tired of existing without feeling. But I obviously have feelings, right? Like, why else would I be so upset? Or not upset.. More like apathetic? Although thats not the right word either. Maybe just annoyed with my lack of lofe accomplishments? But Im accomplished... Right? Married, one daughter. Hmm, but I am stuck in my parents house... Making payments on a car I don't want.. Drowning in bills. Damn, I gotta drive 18 hours to return keys of a house I couldnt afford. Boy... This is getting tragic. Considered death a few times, but who's going to take of my family then? Maybe my parents? Nah, they cant even take care of their kids. I feel bad for them.. They spent 20+ years trying to get their kids in a decent position just for 3 of 4 to come back home after failure. Maybe thats the root of my feelings. Imma failure. That is a fact. Wow... Hits different once you fully realize it. Hmm, traded my friends for love. Not like I didn't love my friends, but apparently love can't be shared? I gotta stop talking about that. Maybe I'll talk about how I ruined my friendships talking about how I don't have friends? Isn't that a bit childish for someone my age? I gotta grow up. Stop griping. Do my taxes. (Actually, Ive done that for 6 years straight) Really and truly, I need to give up. O feel so bad saying that, but whats the point? If I were meant to find my purpose, I wouldve by now. Unless Im just missing it. Although, that can't be right. Im not happy doing amything but reading manga and writing incomplete stories. I need to finisb something for once in my life. Jeez, I remember my suicidal thoughts and I couldn't even finish that. (Thats meant as a joke because I can't even finish my life... That was kinda funny) Its 3:15 now. I gotta wake up in 2.5 hours. Maybe I'll crash at work. Why did my life come to this? Trick question. It's because I'm indecisive and let my Que Sera Sera attitude carry me into a life that is no bueno. Oof, I gotta do something about this, but I'm getting too old to change. I'm too deep to swim out.

Well I started to talk to her again because I wanted to apologize for acting the way I did when the fight happened. We met and then later made up, then had sex. Well, after the deed we were just talking and agreed that we could cuddle since it was getting cold at the time. We fell asleep with each other and that was the biggest mistake. 
This happened another few times. 
I cut it off because I knew this wasn’t a good thing to do because it’s not what I wanted and didn’t want to deal with emotions that may arise.

I thought love was unconditional, not like that mother to her baby because that's different. But caring for someone so much that you can't live without them, but I don't think that's real. 

Like I thought looking at someone or going through pictures is supposed to give that spark, but I never felt that.

But maybe that's not true, maybe it's just settling for someone whose okay but not actually being in love, maybe more of a friendship with extra steps. I don't really know. 

I never been in love, but so far I don't think I have my special someone that waiting for me because it's not a romantic movie. Even if I'm active in trying to find someone, it just never happens 

I've been alone forever, and maybe it'll end that way, but it sucks because I'm a warm hearted, caring, loyal, I thought I would have someone by now. I never dated in highschool because I just didn't feel anything, now I feel like I've missed out on soo much that I'm unwanted and it's too late.

Guys, how do you know what to follow? How do you know if your goal is right or wrong, and who decides it?

But I have another question: are you WILLING to put your LIFE into it? And you care of what do others think?

Currently I have to admit that I'm feeling pretty sad and been almost 7 months that I can't sleep at night, but that's another story. When you haven't got a close friend, or even better, a parent who believes in you/guides you for good/can understand your goals and dreams, where do you find the willpower?

I've read some posts here. I feel all of you guys. But being alone is something magical. It does hurt but you are given the privilege to see the world from your inner self. Hang on, we will get what we deserve.

So what changed? 
Oh yeah, I immigrated to America as a child.

I'm not sure if this is the only reason why I have social anxiety, I believe it's a combination of this and other things, like moving from one city to another and having to rebuild my friend circle over and over again from the beginning. It just becomes exhausting at some point you know? 
I just wish to change and have stable, healthy friendships one day.

5828,Several-Effect-3732,1638328444,1,"Specifically, I am an art school student. I have been here since my freshman year of college. 

I attend a college in a different state, so no one here is anyone I’ve known since Highschool nor did I come here with anyone I’ve known. When I was a freshman in college I had some really toxic roommates, who were really rude, made fun of me, yell at me about things, and only talk to me just to tell me what was wrong with my art during critiques. They also didn’t like me because I wasn’t like them, because I was “nerdy”/“dorky” and not stereotypically feminine, or didn’t smoke/vape, drink, have any dating or sexual experience. I’m convinced one of them was a complete narcissist and she really manipulated the other and would even bully her, but she was too insecure and even a bit stupid to see how terrible of a friend she was.

I had no friends at all then. I eventually had been moved out of that dorm because of how bad the abuse had gotten. I was then moved into another dorm that next semester. With a roommate and suitemates I had gotten along with pretty well. Then the corona pandemic hit and we all pretty much moved out of the dorm building that spring break. Unfortunately I never had any way of contacting them, no phone numbers, no social media, nothing. One of them actually had been following my Instagram for awhile, but she eventually unfollowed me because my content didn’t appeal to her (I’m an art blog and meme account on Instagram). We were never close or anything, but I guess it kinda made sense for her to unfollow me. Now being in the present, I do see them in the halls and such. I say hi and try to be friendly, but I worry they forgot about me. (That is the roommate and suitemate that didn’t unfollow me on Instagram)

My last school year was obviously all online, so I didn’t get to interact with anyone and I never did turn on my web cam all that much for people to recognize me. Except what would be the point anyway? I don’t have any friends and I doubt anyone would try to get to know me if they saw me in person. I had a roommate that school year who was generally pretty friendly and did try to get to know me, but she was always visiting her boyfriend every weekend, so we never got to form a proper friendship, yet she seemed to have ties to other classmates and good at making friends. That next semester she decided to stay home, because she thought it was silly we were living in dorms when not going to physical classes. I occasionally see her in the hallways, and she says hello in all. But we’re not in any classes or anything.

With now college being in person again, I am reminded just how lonely I am and how I barely have any friends. It’s like literally everyone in all my classes know someone in there and manage to have a conversation with everyone. Even the people who don’t talk for shit or even try. How? They even get invited to do stuff and make plans after class and for weekends and get invited to eachothers dorms. 

Occasionally we get put into groups, and luckily enough there’s sometimes someone in that group that wants to have a conversation. Except there’s been occasions where I get 3rd wheeled in those. Because 2 people in those groups really begin to hit it off. I would share my social medias, except unfortunately they’ve become a place for me to vent and I’m someone who doesn’t share my Instagram with people I barely know. Because I can’t explain the hellhole it’s become and I don’t want people to know of the petty asshole I usually come off as (venting that is).

It’s even a little infuriating too. The roommate I have this school year is very socially awkward and a little weird and barely ever talks to me. She claimed to have no college friends, but apparently she has conversations with classmates in classes, gets invited to do stuff, and sometimes invites people to our dorm. Like motherfucker, yes you do. 

I even fear my Highschool friends (my only friend group) are losing interest in me. I feel like they don’t care about my interests, new things I’ve discovered or watched and things I’m writing. I had recently gotten invited to hangout with friends over this Thanksgiving break and I felt a little 3rd wheeled a bit there. I don’t know or think I’ll be losing them as friends. But I don’t know what to do. 

I was pretty lonely in Highschool too, I literally went into Highschool alone and with no friends. It wasn’t until 2nd semester of sophomore year I actually started to have a friend group. 

It’s just why does everyone else to get to function normally and not me? 

I feel like I’ll go all of college not having any college friends. Please don’t suggest for me to join clubs or anything, they never work and I’ve tried and it never works.",lonely,I’m a college junior and I have no college friends,2021-12-01 14:14:04

And when he overdosed on drugs, that hit me hard. My only father figure who actually cared about me. And yet somehow he hated me. I want women to notice me, but I can't. I can't blame them. How can I? Everytime I see myself I feel sick. I feel as though I want people to notice me, but they won't, and every adult I go to gives me the same bullshit response. Stand up for yourself.

5852,SnooPets8804,1638316363,1,"hey, so I had a really bad mental breakdown a few months ago. It was the first one I’ve ever had to the point of psychosis and it was very unexpected coming from me as someone who was generally put together. I suddenly was manic and felt like accomplishing and conquering the world and saw messages all over the internet. It felt like everything was a sign. Some things felt like they were threats and I genuinely feared for my life. I felt like people were out to get me and my family. I had roommates who were moving my things around this part was confirmed and that was driving my theories further. I had lashed out on the internet cussing people out. And from what I understand it’s hard to want anything to do with that kind of person. My therapist said she wouldn’t diagnose me with anything because I’ve never experienced anything like that before. I got hospitalized but discharged 7 days later and they didn’t diagnose me. People are saying I was a shitty friend without giving me the time of day and just writing me off. These were people I went to hell and back for. Now it’s just me and my family and while I’m grateful for them, I cannot imagine advancing in life without questioning how I’m ever going to make genuine relationships. I’m scared people will always see me as some cr*zy person because I acted very off the rails. I don’t want to be that problematic person who people see as someone who can’t keep relationships/ horrible person but all I do is look at their subtweets (tweets about me that don’t say my name but are very obvious), and I can’t help but imagine I have ruined myself. I have been doing very well in terms of my financial and educational aspects but I have no one to talk to. Not a single person. This is coming from someone who had 1000 friends just a few months ago. Yeah. I had another friend unfollow me while tweeting about me and it feels like the straw that broke the camels back. I haven’t had suicidal ideation this bad before.

But all those things don't really make me happy. I haven't been happy for real since 2017. Years ago I used to have a girl who I thought was my soulmate. I loved her above all else, even life itself. She was my best friend and the only person to truly understand me. I let her get away and now she's somebody elses soulmate. Since then I have isolated myself when I'm not at work.. lost all my friends save for one. So I just work instead. When I don't work I drink. I'm sick of both.

I'm not a people person. I can't wrap my head around the dating game. Dating is like being a used car salesman only you're the car. And I'm a beat up old rusty car that rarely starts. At least in my head. I don't believe in myself for a second. I'm like Midas only everything I touch turns into shit. 

I'm so fucking scared of never feeling the same way about a person like I did. Of getting too old to start a family. Of never being loved the same way back. Of never being understood the same way. Of never having a happy soul again. But I'm also too scared of opening up, scared to be left again when they see me for who I am. It's a catch 22 of crap.

Outside of work I've got nothing to live for. Sometimes I fantasize about swerving off the road on my way home from work, make it look like an accident. I got really drunk once on a friday and overdosed on sleeping pills. Woke up sunday night.

5877,dontcarefornowpls,1638304388,1,"Hello, first of all i am only posting this on Reddit so that I don't get judged nor i want people that actually know me to know about my situation.

I'm \[\] and I'm a Computer science student or should I say  IT engineer idk my english is bad. Growing up and until my last year in highschool, I was always top of my grades, always considered the smartest girl in my school. I had the best marks without any effort and if i work hard enough i got best results in the whole city, was the person who people wanted to sit beside her in test so that they can copy her answers. Teachers, family, friends used to tell my parents that I am kinda of a precocious kid and that I will probably end up being someone important and the fact that my parents are wealthy i can go study abroad with no difficulties(not to brag because I really think I'm not in a position to.) I was the kid that all my friends' parents desired. I also didn't have any difficulties to get new friends, true I was socially awkward and had some troubles sometimes talking to people tnx bullying but i was able to talk to at least few people a day, and being the smart, funny kid made me popular in school I went to. I used to love studying a lot since it was a way for me to not think about suicide or any other depressing idea and also a way to escape sleep since i had a lot of nightmares or sleepless nights which make me feel shitty for not being able to even sleep as everyone does, I also liked the whole school ambiance and i used to cry and hit myself, even self harm if i get a bad mark which is 17/20 or less, which now looking back at it isn't really a bad mark rather an excelent one, also not gonna lie my parents were strict about my studies since they always tell me that if I don't study I won't be able to afford food, home... since I am homelss and that everything they own is theirs not mine and also a part of me studied and worked hard from such a young age to study aboard specifically in Japan, I don't really have a pratical reason besides that i always loved that country, I also was confident in my answers not the I AM NVER WRONG but i at least if i found in a math test an answer i at least have a confidence in it, I used to always participate in class and wasn't ashamed to ask questions or asked them to repeat sth i couldn't understood, or when I get sth wrong, never skipped school even when I was sick and cried if my parents won't let me go because i was ill.

Ngl, I was never happy, never really felt overjoyed, I just studied worked hard, and in vaccation I either wrote poems or drew stuff and watch anime and read manga or sth.

''Surprinsingly'', I got too much confident the last year of high school. I did not study at all, just was there depressed, but somehow I was hoping to be the national to 5 graduates. I didn't study until one last month before my exam(to explain in where I live we have a test/exam in the end of your last year of highschool it's like the korean tests, so it obvi tell u if u can join a good college or not)and somehow I got a good mark it was a good average but I still did not reach my full potential, my whole surrounding was shocked, my parents were disapointed, I went in a mental breakdown, depression...even tho I've acted like I handled it. I already lost passion not only in studying but even in watching anime that was one of the reasons why I was alive.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I got ig lucky and joined the best college in my country where only smart and genius people go there, no one I know went there,so was alone, didn't make any friends because I just felt like I didn't belong there, I didn't seem to fit there, and also I didn't really have no desire to make friends, it's been two months that I've joined this college and my grades are still failling and the worst part is me not caring and wanting to die or become a rock.

I now became the one who wanted to sit with the smart kids to copy their answers, I no longer I'm the one who find the solutions but the one who still try to understand the solution in front of her, no longer preparing the lessons before we do it in class, I became the student that is clueless and doesn't know what we are doing, I am OUT, I don't even have enough confidence now, I last time got sth correct for some reason someone told me I am wrong and changed my answer right away, people no longer ask for my help in exercises and they don't even take me seriously when I ask them, I no longer particpate in class, no longer ask questions, I feel ashamed, I don't talk in class at all, I only observe those Geniuses, smart kids who are gonna became sth big one day, I really am not kidding when I say everyone is smart here, I am the dumbest in this school, I come at home and do nothing but surf here or read some mangas, or watch some uselles stuff while everyone is studying and working hard, I never attempted or thought about Suicide this much like these last few years. And of corse with me not studying it made my relationship with my parents got worse, where all you can hear is mom or dad or both of them screaming/yelling at me and me crying and telling them to leave me alone, mom always calls her mom and tell her that i am no longer studying, i really becae useless, I really tried to study but just can't focus, I really can no longer focus either in school or anywhere the only thing I am doing is thinking about suicide or leaving this country but I don't think that Japan will accept a loser scum of society like me, My exams are next week and I am gonna fail them since I don't even know what we are doing, Idk maybe I might try to study just for the shake of maybe this fucked up life will lead me or send me to Japan, either way I am gonna kill myself by thrwing myself in the Ocean hoping i will die in peace since it never worked, hung myself didn't work, overdosing on sleeping pills didn't work, cutting my wrists didn't work, trying to jump didn't work since some got involved, I tried everything but never worked, lol can't even end my life how much useless can I be?

I am gonna kill myself 09/09/2022 since I have to finish some stuff, I am set on killing myself, this isn't a cry for help but just me venting out in deffrent subreddit, I really am feeling nothing but emptiness, not gona blame anyone since I am the stupid bitch here, and honestly posting this here hoping that someone will see it so that somehow I will never be forgotten, I know this is stupid but I always wanted to change the world or invent/create a program or sth that will help/change the world and I now feel ashamed because I was too young to realize that at the end of the day I am dumb, stupid and useless.

Sometimes I watch videos of me as a child and him playing with me, but I just feel lonely when the only thing that I'd like is feeling nostalgic. Nostalgic of something that I did experience and remember. Plus sometimes I think that if it hadn't happen, if he hadn't died, things would have turned out differently.

I’m glad I have my dad to ask cause there’s no good advice whatsoever. I swear most of these people just assume I’m some basement dwelling neckbeard who has no life. Yes I have hobbies , yes I can get along with people , yes I can chat with women. That’s essentially all the advice people offer it’s as if I’m just destined to die alone and people flat out want me too. I’ve seen people just magically meet their partner and had to place 0 effort it just happened. One guy was originally friends with his partner and one guy literally met his partner on fortnight. I’m not trying to sound bitter and pessimistic but I’m so confused. I have to ask every person in a 5 mile radius yet somehow at the same time not be desperate and even then it’s just a date.

I'm pretty sure my boyfriend has forgotten. He hasn't said anything and I know I'm not getting a gift because he said he's just going to get me a bigger Christmas gift. Which is fine I guess. I'm not trying to seem like I expect everyone to drop what they're doing and worship me today.

But I put a good bit of effort into his birthday dinner and gifts. All I want is a ""happy birthday baby"" and a hug. 

I don't want gifts but maybe acknowledgment that's actually personal like a message or a phone call. I'd be happy with even a card or a ""🍰"" emoji.

I dunno. It makes me feel so selfish and conceited to feel this way. But I can't really help it. I try to make my family and friends feel special on their birthdays.
