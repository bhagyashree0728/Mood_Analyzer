I've spoken with friends for maybe an hour in that time. I want to talk with them more, but unlike me they actually have lives that need living. They're working for Moderna and the navy, and my autistic ass has been working 8 hour max weeks at a Marshalls for the past two months.

I wish someone actually wanted me around. I legitimately can't remember the last time I was invited to do anything, hell, I can't remember the last time someone simply messaged me for conversation and not just to ask a quick question. Growing up I didn't have any real friends, just people who weren't mean to me and tolerated my presence. I was so happy when I finally had real friends in high school, but that was almost ten years ago, and now like I said earlier, everyone but me is busy with life.

I want to try and meet new people, make new friends, maybe actually have someone want to maybe go on a date with me, but where I live there's pretty much nothing for my age group or my hobbies. There's a barcade, but I don't make enough money to go there very often. I've tried multiple apps to meet people: meetup, tinder, bumble, PoF, hiki, but no one within like 100 miles so much as wants to chat or be friends, let alone anything more.

25,Revolver-Knight,1646034639,1,"I’ve honestly had a shitty week emotionally like every day I wake up and by the time I eat breakfast or am up for at least 10 minutes I just just hit with a wave of feeling shitty, worrying about my future, regretting the past, feeling alone, listening to music imagining scenerios with a fictitious lover.

I don’t feel happy bout myself I’ve felt like a Cynical Ass

The funk (as I call it) lasts usually till about 10 o clock on the days I work early. It mostly goes away cause well I get paid to stock produce and cut fruit not to wallow in sadness. 


The days I work late are a lil worse cause on those days it’s not constant down parts of the day feel slow if there is nothing to do that moment, and some days are fast paced.


Then when I get home I just get hit with drowsiness and sleepy feelings which I feel werid about cause I don’t work as long as like my mom or dad does. Like yesterday I get home from work at 3:40-3:50

I let the dog out lay on the couch my dad texts me not even 30 mins later about how’s he’s got food for dinner go to his house

Then as I’m summoning the will to get up he’s like also can you grab me abc x y and Zed. And also bring the dog. 

So after a nice dinner and time with my dad I go home it’s about like 8-9 o clock 

The minute I sit down it’s like I ran a marathon or something my eyes feel so heavy I pass out on the recliner which something I’ve never done before 

My mom came home around like 10:30  and I woke up dead ass from my sleep and it’s all so disoriented I’m like just slowly shuffling over to my room, and like  just like slurring my words and yawning like crazy  and coughing.


I remember the other day I woke up ans everything felt heavy like it wasn’t sleep paralysis I could move and breath fine but like lifting my arms and body it was like a weight was on my body like I forced myself to sit up and it was like my body just collapsed back into my bed.

I tried checking my phone and nearly locked myself out of my phone cause I could coordinate my hands correctly.


But like other big life events include my Mema being put into a Rehab facility so my family has a lot of drama about that it’s all chaos and a big fiasco 

Also like my fish have just been dropping dead left and right and like I’ve been working on it trying to fix it but it’s just sad but like I know there fish and they don’t have like the emotional capacity of like a dog but like I really like my fish it’s so cool and I feel a bit guilty there dying, and  it feels like no matter the money I put into it it’s not working (or working fast enough) to reverse the damage.


One positive is that I got my first match on tinder. She hasn’t responded but progress! I got a like

26,979-stein,1646034297,1,"A few years ago, life was just about perfect. Married to my high school crush, 2.5 kids, a dog. All that. Not only that, I had just gotten my dream job in a rewarding field. I smiled and talked like Ted Lasso. 

One night we were out at a fancy hotel bar and…BOOM…lights went out. My first seizure caused a pretty wicked traumatic brain injury. The next thing I remembered were the bright lights in the trauma unit. Then I went back to sleep. 

When I woke up everything was different. One of the side effects of going Humpty Dumpty with my skull is called pseudobulbar affect syndrome. The way perceive and express emotion is dysregulated, so my brain tends to overreact and cry uncontrollably at slight triggers. Because of the way I used to be, no one knows how to handle me when I show real emotion instead of bullshit, always positive facade. I was always the one to lift everyone’s spirits. No one does that for me. So now I just isolate because it is not any one’s job to make me happy. 

I’m addition, now I work from home. I am alone all day, and whenever everyone is home I just keep to myself. My wife and I talk about tasks like roommates. As a chronic insomniac as well, I stay awake until 4-5 am by myself. Cycle, rinse, repeat. That is the current state of my life. 

I need deep emotional connection with people. As an introvert, I hate small talk as I would rather dive into something really interesting. I always kept a small circle of friends to whom I was very loyal. But since my injury, my friend list is at zero. 

Am I asking for too much? Really. I sometimes feel like if I have to ask for something like friendship or attention or affection, I just don’t deserve it.",lonely,Boredom and lack of a real connection is slowly draining the life from me.,2022-02-28 18:44:57

29,alone3674,1646033466,1,"I (29M) had the joy of watching one of my closest friends get married, and it was honestly a beautiful and wonderful celebration! I was in her bridal party, as was my ex (she became her best friend while we dated), who I still consider one of my best friends, and our breakup was totally amicable. I hadn't seen my ex since the breakup (5 months ago) because we live in different countries, and it was amazing to see her and catch up, but we both got pretty emotional at the end of the night when we shared how we've been since we separated (she dumped me fyi). 

We both want nothing but happiness for the other person, and have no ill will, it really is as healthy as a breakup can be. That being said it was still really, really hard to see her again. Old wounds opened up, emotions came flooding back, we both ended up crying in each other's arms a few times... We hung out almost every day I was in town, but it didn't hurt until we opened up emotionally again. She's casually dating a guy now, which I fully support, but I'm a little too busy and not at a point in my life where dating interests me. It was just hard going through the wedding with her by my side (I was planning on proposing before the break), then celebrating love, and seeing so many loving couples, and how happy they are. I miss that feeling of love, and being loved. I don't necessarily miss it with her, but I don't know that love from anyone else. 

I don't even really know what I'm saying. I know I don't have the capacity to be with someone again, and I'd need to find them first. I've been so busy with school, life, and work that I've forgotten just how lonely I sometimes feel, and this week really knocked me on my ass. It sucks.

40,ravynkish,1646027407,1,"I'm married (4 years in Oct) with a 2 year old. My family sucks. They're unreliable (the ones that are still alive) and my spouses family is small, old, out of state or all the above. It's me and my husband white knuckling life. My sister (I love her but a never ending Shakespearean tragedy) and my mother (same here, too) are my only 2 options outside of a stranger or facility- can't really afford and don't really want to anyway d\t COVID, etc. I have 2 dogs, rescues, and one is so fucking nutty and incessant (a coonhound) with severe food aggression and a really huge set of balls. (We have to lock food away or carry with us if we walk away because he's sneaky, quick and annoyingly smart.) With every possible precaution - we hang our garbage bag in the freaking air- he still manages to steal food multiple times a day...incessant. 
My mom is ALWAYS watching my niece so my sister can go out and do wtfe and then there's no one available to give me a break. (I should also mention, I am STILL BREASTFEEDING MY TODDLER ON DEMAND AT 2.5 YEARS OLD. She's great! I see the benefits of breastfeeding, she's smart and kind and sweet and beautiful. But I feel absolutely 100% alone. I have arthritis and a birth defect in my spine that leaves me in chronic pain. At 28 years old. My abs ripped apart from my pregnancy (diastasis recti) and so my core is not really adding much help for my back pain at all. 
My mother and husb are chronic interrupters. No matter how many times I bring it up and feel we get some headway, it happens again and again and again. 
So I just keep it all inside and bottle it up. Grow resentments like a flower bed and harvest anger (which I present to everyone, especially myself- not helping my pain either, I'm sure). I'm so depressed. 
My husband is forward thinking and a self proclaimed feminist, and I have seen improvements in some aspects. (he struggles with OCDPD) but the hypocrisy of the things he tells me that I do\dont do or the things he asks of me for him (affection, love, compassion) are rarely reciprocated. 
I don't know what the FUck to do. We're moving soon. I'm in therapy, I'm taking medication for depression and a low dose stimulant for my ADHD (I did GENESIGHT testing and found out that my body doesn't metabolize *any* antidepressant well enough for it to be beneficial and that stimulants are the only thing that I really do metabolize). 
I wake up every morning with a text from someone who is asking me for something. Can I do this, can I help with that.
I cannot rely on anyone else to fucking handle it so I can do some self care. I have not been able to develop a routine because I'm like a 9. 1. One service to everyone I know. 
The thing that hurts me about my husband is that he can be so understanding and compassionate in theory, but when I express any specific thing, my feelings are minimized and he becomes defensive. It then becomes about him, and I feel guilty for fucking saying anything or God forbid being a fucking burden to anyone who I so freely give myself to... That I just bury it and move on. My patience ever-thinning and my anger ever-growing. 
I don't want to be like this.i don't want to feel like this. I do not see any end in sight. I'm perpetually exhausted from existing as a npc in everyone else's life, I can't be the main character in my own. I'm too tired to explain to people why I'm too tired to explain to them why I'm not explaining it to them.

I can’t entirely explain how I’m feeling, but now I’m questioning what the whole point is. Why do I try to be nice to people?? Why am I still by myself without someone to lean on?? Of course this brought up more emotions that I’ve been trying to keep down…

Long story short, I’m feeling like I’m incapable of being loved by someone who isn’t family or a friend. I’ve never had a significant other. I’m 28. Now I’ve finally started talking to a guy who is completely different from duds in the past, a kind of guy I’ve been waiting a long time for, and yet I feel like I scared him off. This always happens to me. I try to be brave and initiate conversation, try to be direct about asking them to go out. I try to communicate appropriately but I feel like I’m annoying them. I don’t need to be told that he’s wasting my time, I need to move on, or that he’s lost interest. For once in my life, I don’t want that to be the case. Of course, I’ve told him that I’m interested. He’s told me that he’s not the kind of person to disappear. But I just want to feel wanted without the voice in the back of my head telling me that I’m not good enough. That I messed up before being given a chance. I want someone to experience life with. But every single time ends in disappointment. I don’t understand. People are always shocked when I tell them that I’m not in a relationship. They say that I’m a catch. That I’m open-minded, friendly, supportive, sociable, kind-hearted…but why do I always feel like a failure? What am I doing wrong? When will it be my turn to finally feel that the hole in my heart can be filled? I could really use some support right now 😞",lonely,I don’t know what to do anymore.,2022-02-28 15:48:23

I never really go on facebook. I have it mostly deactivated. I don't have anything to put in there anyway. My life is boring. Anyway so I decided to log in.. I wondered what my closest buddies back in highschool are up to nowadays? So yea I did stalk their profiles. I have not seen nor talked to these guys in over a decade so I got really curious. I was 18 the last time we got together. It's kinda awesome how everyone has changed. Some of these dudes went through a glow up phase. One dude used to be like over 200lbs and is now slimmer than me. The dude looksmaxxed tf up. One guy came out as gay and has a man (I mean I always sensed that he was gay even back then. good for him.) Some of these dudes who I judged to be less good-looking than me and struggled to get girls back in highschool now got freaking gorgeous girlfriends man what a 180 in life. Some already got a family, married with kids. I am happy for them. A lot of these dudes look like they are doing well career-wise and financially too. Like they got stuff and shit. They even got pictures of their vacations in other countries.. like Thailand beaches, Singapore, etc,. I am not going to lie I felt happy and really hurt at the same time. Happy cause these guys are doing well for themselves. Hurt because it reminded me of where I am in life. My life stagnated. Suffering from depression and anxiety. Im stuck working the same shitty low paying job for years. Saving the chump change after the bills are paid. I never get to go anywhere or see places. Still struggling to find a romantic partner at this age. Couldn't form any close friendships as an adult. I only got small talk type of friends. I want to off myself after seeing how much I've been left behind but I'm a little bitch anyway so I'll continue on living. But.. there was this one dude. I had a bit of an exchange with him. He made me not feel alone. Told me he was working the same dead end job that he hates for years too. Making very little money. Struggling in dating too. I took comfort in the fact that I was not alone in feeling this way. He told me that when I go back to our hometown this summer he wants to meet up, and hangout. Catch up with what's going on with our lives. It's like I got stories to tell. Nothing has been going on with me. He told me that it's just gonna be me, him, and a few of our closest bros back in highschool. He told me that they are still the same people I knew. I don't want to go!

I swear my kryptonite is a good head massage. I had a girl come over to our house at uni to watch a movie and hang out. I was definitely crushing hard on her. She was a knockout blonde with blue eyes and my long curly hair at the time I guess worked in my favour. She asked if she could plait/brush my hair or whatever it was (definitely felt like a massage!) and of course I said sure why not ;). As soon as I felt her fingers flowing through my hair and heard her soft, sweet voice coming from behind me (I was sat cross legged in front of her on the floor) I swear I melted instantly. Could've fallen asleep right there 😴. To humour her, in return, my housemate and I did a face mask with her which was a good laugh tbf. This was around two years ago but I still remember that evening like it was yesterday. 

We hit it off quite well after that. A bit later, I had an accident on my motorcycle and fractured my ankle so was out of normal action for about 6 weeks. She spent a couple weeks with me while I was healing, we cuddled and slept together twice (no deed was done) but it was just a really soothing, happy time. I was frustrated that I couldn't go out and ride the bike but then here was this 'angel' that was giving me the time of day which was unusual for me.  I sorely miss the physical touch and just having someone to lie with. I know this is soppy and all but just wanted to share it with someone since I've never done so.

I don't think I'll ever have the same thing again, at least not in the near future. And regarding the girl, I still haven't met anyone close to what she was (spiritually) and personality-wise unfortunately.

“You need to reach out”

“The world doesn’t revolve around you”

The strange thing is that I'm lonely, but I've grown numb to it. Loneliness pervades every aspect of my existence, yet it no longer is as painful and has become more of a status quo. I no longer feel emotional. 

I'm not sure whether this is for the better or worse. I guess if I'm destined to be on my own, I might as well get used to it. The only time I even feel a spark of my old self is when I'm alone or with someone I have a deep, loving connection to, something that is hard to come by nowadays.

I know my friends don’t have much time to hang out this semester and the ones before, but right now I feel like my friends don’t even miss me. It feels like they dont even want to write, call or hang out with me. Doesn’t matter that I’m either only 10 minutes away by subway (for most of them) or that we haven’t talked since 3 months or more or sth like that. 
I just think that they just forgot me. Idk why, but that hurts rn. It hurts asking how they really are and not getting any response for 3-4 four weeks, if not even months. (Sometimes I even ask myself if it is even worth it or if I should tell them that I don’t want this (friendship) anymore)

And the thing is they are busy (and yes they really are, I know that), but then they do stuff with other people several times per week or I get answers from other friends like “Oh yes, xyz is sick, but they do stuff with abc”. 
Why the fuck does it have to be like this. I mean, is it so hard to ask how I’m feeling or not to forget me? Or if I’m not forgotten why tf does nobody of them call/text me?
I think I don’t even matter for those people I like.

met in my life that I am beautiful. Some, even the most beautiful they have ever seen.

I told my 50-year-old female same sex teacher I liked her when I was 16. She was divorced, and she had two kids whose ages were very near to my age. She wanted nothing to do with me after that, and ignored me as if I were dead.

When she was rejecting me, she told me
things about my personality but nothing about my physical appearance. She told me that I was nice and smart but never 
told me that I was beautiful. She said, ""You are very smart and nice but you are young... VERY YOUNG. I was never attracted to a student. I know someone would be very lucky to have you.""

It was as civil as I've ever heard a breakup being but I feel torn to shreds. Didn't even see it coming as early as this morning, although the reason wasn't a surprise. Nothing to do with loss of feelings and everything to do with an incompatibility issue. 

I'm a bit older than is the norm for a first relationship serious or otherwise. I've craved it for years quietly and ardently. I forced nothing. So when it finally came I was just getting used to the idea that I'm not some freakish cretin unfit for love or something gearing up to love at the very least. Nothing he's ever said reinforced those more negative internalizations and in fact I'm sure having this confirmation bias of at least one relationship under my belt will stave off those feelings for a little while, but they *will* come back and may even be worse than before.

A quick background to my situation:

I’ve felt pretty lonely over the last few years. I met someone over a year ago who I have a deep connection with, a connection I’ve never really had with anyone else. It started out as talking maybe once a day or so, but it has developed into us being best friends, and we can barely go a few hours without texting/talking to each other on the phone. We didn’t talk for a day or so recently as we were both really busy but I was miserable the entire time without them. I realised that I didn’t want to go another day without us talking, and that I’ve fallen madly in love with them. 

The problem: I’m straight and they are not, so unfortunately there will never be a romantic relationship between us. Every time they talk about a potential romantic interest or going on dates, it feels like someone is ripping my heart out. 

I’m having trouble sleeping, eating and concentrating at work because of this. I’ve never felt this way about someone else. It’s almost making me feel even more lonely having this person in my life. But I don’t want to lose their friendship.

128,UnderlyingMind,1645988597,1,"In the mornings of days that I don’t have work, I browse stuff on my phone—Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, random content to wake up. I opened instagram, and foolishly opened my crush’s story who I’m somewhat still I contact with. I saw that last night, she got married to her boyfriend of a few years. To premise, I am diagnosed with depression and have dealt with confidence and anxiety issues for years, and my major vulnerability is my difficulty with romantic relationships. It’s a major point of self-loathing, which kind of propagates itself when I’m in situations where someone is possibly interested in me. I’ve seen a therapist for a long while, though, and have practiced mindfulness and redirecting my mind when useless self-hating thoughts start rising. But this? Seeing her getting married and being happy while I’m just sitting alone in my bed on a Sunday morning, struggling to just get up? It rips a hole inside me. I feel worthless, empty, like it’s useless to go outside or try new things like I’m ‘supposed’ to. I would say there’s nothing redeemable in me, but that’s the worst part, because there IS. If I get real, I’m pretty smart, I’m pretty funny, I like to be creative with writing or worldbuilding, and I’m very sensitive to others’ feelings and my own. I’ve been told these things. But that’s what makes it all the worse, because then this must mean the reason I am alone is because I am ME. The “me” in me must just be…wrong. Undeserving. Repulsive. Just not enough. It’s really…just unbelievably painful. I remember when my crush visited me as a friend a few years ago from where she was living after moving, and she talked about this guy, thinking that it may grow into something, and I remember feeling that deep hateful jealousy inside, but said nothing. I had already told her I liked her, she already told me she didn’t have feelings for me. I guess I wasn’t enough. I guess I’m just not enough. I keep telling myself that you’ll find someone, you have before but it just didn’t work out because of circumstances (I’m not totally inexperienced, I’ve had budding relationships and interests now and then), but every month it becomes harder to believe…A childish part of me wishes and wants a magic cure, something I can do that’ll just make the pain go away so I can enjoy my life, alone or not, but I know that’s not real. So I get stuck in these cycles of immediate self-gratification: video games, junk food, porn, all of which I hide from people in my life so no one really realizes how bad it is. I can feel my health declining, my heart hurting, and even when I go to the gym I still feel the emptiness.      

Am I just not enough?

130,anonylaw2,1645988177,1,Especially here. This is a board for lonely people. Many of them are depressed or extremely depressed and unable to connect with anyone. You got people who sometimes reach out but then really hurt or upset that you do not living in a world of positivity. Like no shit. Hard to be positive when everything in your life is shit and you see no way out of it. So why do people reach out fully knowing this and expect differently it just doesn't make any sense. All it ends up doing is punishing the people who are already suffering because they abandon them they make them feel bad for being alone and depressed. It is not cool at all. If people can't handle that stuff that is perfectly fine I get it but they should also not be the ones reaching out because they cause nothing but suffering.,lonely,Why do people do this crap,2022-02-28 05:56:17

145,Sarah6893,1645978995,1,"Im just really here to vent, so here I go. I guess that now I’m in high school things have changed. Though it was only for the worse. All the other people I knew in my life changed for the better, they got more friends, more popular and all that stuff. While now I just stand alone and observe everything. I became the one thing I feared my whole life. To be lonely and have no one. 
I remember from elementary school I had quite a bit of friends. I never Ed had too many though as the years went by, I had more and more. By the time I was fourth grade, I had my first ever friend group. As time went by and I went in middle school, we were still in that friend group (I went to a k-8 school). Even more people came into our friend group and all things were good. One of those people, that were with me since 4th grade, we’ll call Abby. We were pretty close, not like BFFs but close. Though I guess things stated to change. We were all close until COVID happened. Just like that, we were in quarantine. During that time, I texted her a bit, not too much since I never really texted many people. Though when we went back to school (we were now in 8th grade) we kinda split. I don’t really know why but we just did. I started hanging around these other two people and we became really close, like we were all just three BFFs. While Abby kinda went with some other people. I guess I could see it coming though it still hurt to just see her change like that and not really want to be with me anymore. Thoughts that’s not the end of it. Once I got high school, everything changed. I remember standing there in the cafeteria, wondering were to sit on that first day. I saw Abby hanging with these two other people from my old school and some people I didn’t know. I went up to them, trying to sit with them and they declined. So I alone next to the wall, which was right next to them. I tried to but in some of there conversation but they just ignored me. It became that for the first few days. I sat next to wall trying to talk to them while they just ignored me. I eventually gave up and faced the wall. I was still okay because I had hope, though now I completely give up since now moths have passed by and I still have nobody. I went from everything to nothing. And it’s not like Abby started some completely new path in her life because she still hanged out with all the other kids from my old school. Even the ones she wasn’t even friends with. Though one person who was in your friend group, you just completely ignored. You knew I was alone, you saw me alone even single day. And yet you did nothing. You left me there alone with nobody so you could have the time of your life. 
Know from feeling this, my life has been getting really hard. I gave up on everything and I’m even kinda suicidal.

160,pressed_dates,1645972471,1,"I know this sounds corny and against everything that is masculine (34M) but I'm starting to cry more and more these days. I don't know if it's proper to say that I'm living with heartbreak because nobody has broken my heart. However, I think the feeling is similar because mine is so lonely. It's a heavy feeling that is pressing against my chest and this pressure increases when I become depressed and sad. The absence of love can perhaps be similar to a broken heart. I really wish to be involved in someone's life other than my own.

The loneliness has engulfed my entire being and I'm now starting to weep while I drive. I cry myself to sleep and I'm sad everytime I wake up. I sometimes wish that I would never wake up. I cry in the shower, I hold back tears at work and it's hard to not fall in love with any random girl who simply looks at me. I see younger guys with girls, and it just reminds me of how insignificant I am in this world because I'm over 30 and never had a gf. How in the world do relationships even start? How does this materialize when it truly feels to be an impossible thing for me to accomplish? What kind of magic do I need to concoct in order to be found desirable? It seems like everyone intentionally chooses not to know me, or at least befriend me.

My depression has spiked even higher from already being chronic and it's really hard to laugh and smile. It feels like my life is over. I feel like it's now hopeless when all I've ever yearned for is a girl to talk with. Sex is not a priority, I just want my existence to be acknowledged by a girl. I've only had one hug from a girl and I thought this was phenomenal. I instantly fell for her but it never got past the ""crush"" stage. All of my guy friends are long gone and I've never had any family. It's been a decade since I did anything with anyone. I'm trying to hold back tears as I type this and I'm starting to believe that my life was a mistake. I thought humans were inherently sociable creatures.

I am no contact with my family as they were mentally, emotionally, physically and financially abusive/manipulative. I don’t tell people the whole story until we’re in a relationship. But I do tell people that I’m estranged from my family in the beginning (3-4 dates in). I do believe in being open and transparent. But I don’t like talking about all the details early on. 


I keep running into people telling me I’m not compatible with them long term because I have a bad/unhealthy relationship with my family. They have no problem making the relationship physical but no one wants to connect with me emotionally or build something long term. 


I don’t understand why my family situation discounts me from being a serious partner to potential partners. I am a good person. I am caring. Responsible. It just feels like no matter what I do I cannot get people to want to build a life together with me. 


Are there people out there who don’t have an issue with my situation? Where do I find them? I am tempted to just put in my profile that I am no contact with my family but that feels so weird.

After leaving college I moved back home, and now that I've started a new job as of January and beginning to make enough to buy a home, I'm left with a work life that doesn't allow for anything else during the weekdays, and not many friends to hang out with on the weekend. Hell, as today showed even the few people that I know back here at home will bail on me, on my only day off every week where I don't work or have to go to sleep early for work the next day, I get bailed on. 

We had the entire day planned out, and I didn't even have to ask or plan anything like I usually always have to! The 3 of us go to a bar we like at noon and eat lunch, hang for a few hours, then go over to the friend's house, who offered this idea by the way, to grill out and chill with them and their respective wives. But no, I look forward to this my entire week, finally hanging out and relaxing after weeks of work stress and social isolation, and I get canceled on the night before. Do you know what's worse? I then helped family move things from my grandmother's estate (I lost both sides of my family grandmothers in January, no more grandparents) and at 10:15 he messages me to say they're going to the bar, that's 30 minutes from my house, and closes at 11, and only when 11 rolls around he messages me and says they don't close at 11 anymore and, jokingly I assume, says I'm a bitch for not coming.

Loneliness has been an issue for me since elementary school and as such I've tried my entire life to be as interesting and educated as possible to attract people. I have plenty of hobbies I can't do except on weekends now, my coworkers and ""friends"" tell me they're jealous of my public speaking ability, and that they think I'm hilarious, I'm financially sound, so what gives? I've looked inside and tried to fix what I think is unattractive and I became stronger in my Faith and try to be more compassionate, I don't know what to fix anymore, because even when I ask people if they see something I could change they just tell me they think I'm fine as is. Am I a crazy person or am I missing something? 

I can't do this anymore, I really can't do it. My work stress piled on top of trying to find property, losing family members, and being socially and romantically alone is making the stress unbearable now and I don't know what to do to fix it, or fix myself considering I don't have people to talk to on this level, and a therapist is something I can't have due to social and cultural stigmas that would ruin my career and future ambitions, if anyone sees this who is also a young professional then please tell me how you manage.",lonely,Professional needing advice/insight,2022-02-27 22:13:59

Or any other dark thing. I just can't end them with a positive ending. I just don't feel valid. Why would someone ever be friends with me? Why would someone ever love me?

I’m 30F, I work full time, I have a great group of friends and people who do care about me but at the end of the day they all have their people. I don’t. And it  just makes me so sad. 

I’ve been single for 5 years now, 4 of those years I had absolutely no contact with men at all and it didn’t really bother me for the most part, I wasn’t interested and didn’t open myself up to be approachable. 

In the last couple of years my friends, who I was pretty inseparable with all partnered up and settled down, they don’t have the same time for me anymore and I fully understand that, but it really sucks now having to schedule in advance if I want to spend time with them because their schedules are so full with their partners and when we do see eachother it’s just not the same anymore. They’ve changed. 

Anyway, the last 12 months I tried dating again. It’s been a disaster. If I went into how badly I’ve been treated I’d be typing all night. After a string of awful interactions I finally met someone who I really thought was going to be “my person” and it felt so comforting, I thought I was fine all those years alone but once I got a taste of that again I realised how badly I missed intimacy and how nice it was to have that again. 

Long story short, that didn’t work out either. I guess I got too excited and I overwhelmed him. He said he “wasn’t ready” he was, he found someone else pretty quickly, he just didn’t like me. 

Since losing him I just can’t get over this feeling of hopelessness and loneliness. I feel so damaged now and I know that I couldn’t possibly go through this again no matter how badly I want it.

I so badly want someone who cares and wants to share their life with me. Someone that is on my side and I can come home to everyday and talk to about everything. I’m so disconnected from literally everybody but so desperately crave a deep connection. 

I can’t do it all over again. It’s brutal and I truly feel like there isn’t anyone out there for me anymore. But I’m really struggling to accept it.

But also, none of those are late 90s early 2000s babies.

I won't provide sex, and I don't have the paper claiming I'm safe to be around. That's essentially what society is after.

I also come with relationship anxiety and trust issues for free of charge because of people. All I ever wished for was a connection, someone to trust with no regrets. Got close 3 times, got hurt like 10  times. No attachment means no pain, but it also means I'm lonely on an emotional level.

I really didn't mean to, but at the time we started talking more than usual, my personal life blew up. My grandmother died in my house unexpectedly and my terrible uncle had to move in with me.

223,Italktothewind197,1645941958,1,"People:

It seems that everyone is perfect besides myself. Most people, at least. They seem to dress nicely, follow aspirations and accomplish them, and are happy while being surrounded by people. I do not know why or how they are like this. I don't have the ability to associate with them and I don't know how to make friends. Dating and relationships are completely impossible for me. I don't have the emotional ability to do this, if I were near someone that I had those feelings for I would feel as if I had to flee. I also feel like I can't communicate to someone if they flirt with me or express those sort of feelings with myself. I can't form friends. I don't have the personality for this. I feel like a computer at the moment. I see the world for what it is and therefore I suffer immensely because I am aware of why I am suffering. It is like I am the only sentient person in a world of robots. I sometimes feel like object, this is because I do the same thing everyday and I seem to be aware that it sucks. Others don't.

  
Family:

I will never use words like 'Love' - I can't feel this emotion. I am completely convinced I lack the ability to do so. My childhood and life experiences would only support my conclusion. I feel like I don't care about my family. I have known my siblings my whole life and yet I am a stranger to them. My sister has complained about this and my brother doesn't care. I don't care either. My parents seem to care about me but I get the impression that I don't reciprocate these feelings. I have met people and they seem to hang out with their family as if they are friends. My family are more so a group of a people loosely associated for the benefit of those associated with the family unit. There is emotional support from the parents but they aren't involved that much. Lots of arguing growing up - mostly my fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

Society:

People have never been so interconnected yet so alone. In the era of computers and phones, people still find a way to alienate themselves from one another. Technology has a tendency to obscure humanity from each other and hide what it means to be human. The bigger picture to be understood is that there is no bigger picture. There not a smaller picture. there is no point or 'picture' to existence and the suffering and loneliness and society is proof of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Myself:

Me, myself, and I. I know more about myself than other people, I believe. I fear that they may know more about me than I do myself - meaning that I lack an objective sense of self. I might not be able to fit in because I am insane. I always have a tendency to believe in something and not believe in it minutes later. I will schedule an appointment with the therapists on my college campus and then cancel it because I don't believe in my problems anymore. I really do feel horrible, sometimes I honestly wish someone would murder me, but I just cannot speak about how I feel. the purposelessness is the worst part of my life. I am lonely - I have no friends and don't think I am capable of dating. I haven't a conversation with someone in two weeks. I don't 'feel' lonely though. I just feel without purpose. I associate my loneliness with purposelessness but people do not satiate my need for purpose. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even when I speak to others about how I feel, they could not begin to understand how I feel. There is nothing to look forward to in my life. There is nothing to miss in my life. I wish I were never alive. To live is to suffer and hide from the meaninglessness of life through movies, books, drugs, and whatever else you find enjoyable. When these activities end or become meaningless, you cannot escape the feeling no matter where you go. I don't feel equal to other people. I will probably delete this later on, I don't like discussing how I feel. I have never mentioned any of these with anyone in person which leads me to doubt whether I feel it at all. How do I know that I am not lying to myself if no one else seems to think that I am suffering? 

&amp;#x200B;

My childhood was alright but less than ideal. For the most part, I grew up in poverty. Eventually my family started earning more money. I never wore clothing like other people. I remember I had only one pair of pants for high school one year. I had only a couple of shirts and button down shirts as well as a single jacket. I practically wore the same clothes all the time - I washed them though. I am hygienic. I've always wanted that 'aspect' other people have when they wear clothes. They wear it with a purpose and it has meaning. I wear mainly blue jeans and a gray sweatshirt. I look like an NPC from a factory. There is no individuality to myself. As a child, I had a traumatic event. I discussed it with someone and they thought it was terrible but I did not. I don't care about it all. Therefore, I conclude that it is not traumatic. I sometimes wonder if it had affected my personality but I do not like to malinger.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason I do not schedule appointments with a therapist is because I fear that I may be lying to myself and malingering. I have never malingered before - I simply am completely out of touch with how I feel in every situation. 

  
Emotions that I feel: Neutrality, Anxiety, stress, anger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will sometimes imagine myself in arguments with people who have angered me in the past and even in my imagination they never agree with me or put an end to things. Constantly, they pander my even in my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Emotion:

I don't experience it like other people, I think. I said earlier that I feel out of touch with my emotions. Perhaps it would be correct to say that I don't experience emotion that much. I don't feel love for people. I have no one involved in my life. I have nothing to look forward to. I have nothing I genuinely enjoy doing. I don't care about anyone at all. This is why I feel like an object. I feel closer to my parents cat than to my parents. I like to pet my cat and I like it when it sleeps near me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read online that journaling will help you improve yourself so I did it and refused to do it ever again. There is nothing to write and improvement results in longer suffering. 

&amp;#x200B;

Purpose:

There is no purpose to life. When you see a rock, you don't wonder about like you do your own existence or your reality. The fact is that the rock does not really matter nor do you. Nothing matters. Emotions are a biproduct of conscious existence which is a double edged sword of happiness and sadness, as well as a benefit to the species which acquires this ability. Work or school work, eat, sleep, drink, repeat. This is all we will really amount to in our pathetic lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

People can't find purpose to their lives, only distractions. Religion, Ideology, entertainment, drugs, people, and so on are proof of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was put here for a great purpose. I wish that I had something to do. I feel like Icarus who flew to close to the sun. Unlike him, I survived and saw what it means to live. It really doesn't matter, not just in the end but in the beginning and the middle - there is no purpose to any of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other People:

They are out to get in my way and do things to me that I do not want to happen. They want me to follow their cults. I know someone involved with a radical political organization (a cultish organization which I was a part of for some time) who constantly seems to try and recruit me into following him and the organization. I feel like I am a pawn to him to be used. I feel also like he lacks individuality due to the organization not allowing this. It controls the political opinions of its followers like puppets on a string. Others want to get me involved with their beliefs in one way or another. I do not believe in radical politics anymore due to the fact that falsifiability is necessary for a premise to be scientific - if you understand this philosophical critique, you know which radical group I belonged to. i do not belong to them anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand friendship. I don't understand romance and it makes me uncomfortable. I don't feel in tune with the people around me. No one cares about me and neither do I, them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Relationships:

Non-existent. I don't expect it at all. I would make a great monk. I don't communicate with people if I feel sexually attracted with them. Romance is alien. I am alien. I am, again, an object in a world of conscious beings.

We know each other since kindergarten but we weren't friends until about the end of middle school and we became a lot closer friends in the beginning of High School. We took the bus to and from school together every day,hung out after,and when we weren't with each other we would talk on the phone or play video games almost every day. We are in the same friend group but neither of us hang out with our other friends as much as we did each other. In the last year or two we've been hanging out less and less. My friend has had the same on and off girlfriend for about 5 years(and I don't think she likes me) and she is constantly pulling him away from friend activities. Even when I'm with him he will be on the phone with her nearly the entire time we are hanging out over something very small and petty that she is mad about. I don't want to sound like the jealous friend. Even when they weren't together I've felt like an after thought to him. In recent years we went from talking almost everyday to not hearing from him for weeks at the most 1 month. I've tried a couple of times to plan hangouts but the majority of the time he flakes on me. Recently we hung out and I wanted to see him but it was on his schedule and convenient for him and not very convient for me.

So the other day I saw this girl called ""trista"" I met her in one of my classes because I had to do a project with her and since then we greeted each other in the halls but never exchanged words.

Being betrayed by the person I loved…finding out that our whole relationship had been based on lies...lies from before we met and lies during our time together.…has destroyed me. That was four months ago. I've been a self-destructive mess since then. Despite meeting someone new and having some good changes happen in my life since then…I'm not okay. I've been broken. I'm changed. I can't think clearly. It feels awful… 

The first time I've ever been in love. The first time I've ever had [what I thought was] a healthy relationship. The first time I've ever found someone who I felt understood me. I found the person I was willing to do anything for and I did do anything for him and he was just taking advantage of it the whole time. He never loved me. He played me. He's a sociopathic fraud and I gave him my heart and all of my trust. Ever since certain things happened when I was sixteen, I've had major trust issues and sexual trauma. I shared all of this with him and he told me time &amp; time again that he would never hurt me or betray my trust… He exploited my desire to be loved… Just lying to me the whole fucking time we knew eachother. At the time, all I knew was that he was someone who was lonely &amp; fucked up like me and we understood eachother and loved eachother unconditionally and belonged together. He was so good to me… Based on what I knew about him  I believed every word he said. But it turned out I knew nothing about him. His entire life as told to me was just a giant heap of lies. I can't get over this. I don't think I'll ever be the same. I wasn't trusting of people before this and then he turned all that around. I thought I had finally found someone trustworthy. Now…now I'm left ever worse off than before. If someone can look you right on the eyes and profess their love &amp; fidelity to you…and it's not real…then idk. How can the lovelight be faked? I saw it in his eyes. How can someone fake that? I'm afraid of everyone now even more than I was before. Before I had only ever experienced people being blatantly shitty to me… But he led me to believe I was loved and valued and accepted and cared for. 

I loved him so much. I don't love him anymore but this still hurts me. Every fucking day. I still get hit with the physical pain and nausea when I have thoughts having to do with him. 

I can't even go to anyone to talk about it because no one could ever understand the depth of our relationship…what I believed we had…I've never felt it before. There's nothing I can do except stew in it by myself. I can't express anything about it to anyone. I've never been able to verbally articulate my thoughts well but now I'm finding it hard to even write them out. I can only sit isolated in my emotions, feeling miserable. Maybe it's all the drinking &amp; smoking I've done in the past four months. Maybe it's the state of depression I'm in... My psychiatrist told me each episode of depression causes brain shrinkage...and the longer it goes on without intervention the more it continues to shrink...

Me being a commuter student doesn’t help either, as I just show up to class and go home.

I still find myself purposely entering random situations, exposing myself to varied books and wanting to consume various substances in order to coerce new unknown and never before seen reactions from myself, as if I want to discover new things from myself. 

At a lack of people to interact with, I turn inwards for new, and it is now that I have been reading authors like Byung-Chul Han, Lipovetsky and the such that I understand what I'm doing and why I do it, that I want otherness but find the thought of an other with alien goals deeply offensive, so much that I look for said otherness from within myself, thus my past obsession with Jungian thought.

311,peaches483,1645904597,1,"I had a pretty decent social life in high school. It dropped slightly my first year of college, but met some one in one of my labs and she introduced me to her other friend and we became a trio. I was working retail at that point and had some pretty good friends from that job too. Met my boyfriend at that job and we now currently live together, but this is not the point of this post. 

The friend I made in college started dating someone that I did not really care for and she complains about him a lot. This made me not hang around her as much as they are engaged and it is tiring to hear negativity in any conversation you have. Only one friend from my retail job has stuck around, but because of busy lives, work, and his own relationship we maybe see them every couple of months but my boyfriend is there because we hang out as a couple. 

Of the two groups of friends in high school, (1) one group every person has basically moved away to states 10+ hour drive making it unrealistic to visit as per normal. Others from that group I was not close to so those relationships fell off. The (2) other group all live in the same relative area, but we have gotten to the point where we hang out once every 6 or so months. The second group had a friend having a wedding shower and I verbally invited them to come see my apartment. They said shouldn’t be a problem send it in the group text, but then no one ever responded and had an entire week to do so. This was the first time I tried to initiate a gathering so this hurt, especially since over a year ago they were excited for someone else in the group. 

I guess what I am saying is that I feel lonely because unless it is with my boyfriend or family I have no social life.

It’s really hard to get advice from people from school, I’ve talked about my thoughts to my guitar teacher and I he told me that he is the same way cause he lost his job cause of covid (playing at cruise ships) and he went back to Mexico (I’m also Mexican), He’s 30 something so he’s more experienced than me. I vert rarely get texts from friends from Mexico asking how I’m doing, I think I got like 2 this school year, I’ve called some of them, I texted a girl that I dated, from Mexico, so that maybe I can go out with her and just be friends. I just want it to be spring break so I can get out of this repetitive life routine. I would like to go on an interesting trip this spring break, maybe go to cancún and party something.

331,utjgkldfkesp,1645892947,1," It was a few years ago when I was studying. I had taken a likening to someone in one of my classes.

I forgot why, just as any other fleeting thing I only seemed to feel. only an object to what I was feeling at the time? maybe. back then, I was still motivated. I had come from a months-long period of depression after getting left out and hurt by my friends a year before that. Either way, it was very strong, a strong desire to get closer.

It was weird. there was this immediate compulsion to fix my life. To get right with how people see me. To be kind. And so I did, for about two weeks. I hadn't really done it yet at the time. but some students in the class eventually noticed the changes in me. they said I got kinder, looked happier, and I seemed to put in a bit more effort in my classes. And then I did become happy because of that. At least for while.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually she took notice. A few weeks come by and we started talking to each other for some school event. we hung out, and it turned out that she liked me too because of that. it was my first real chance to be intimate with someone. I think this was the first time I ever felt I was doing something right for myself, even if it wasn't really that.

It was going well for a while, but suddenly, another period of depression had hit me. it was unusual, because I think I'm smart about it and there is usually a trigger. but I didn't know what it was. there should have been no reason for it.

My focus slowly started to wane as the week followed. I slept in my classes, and my grades fell. more importantly, I wasn't living to her expectation of me anymore. I had suddenly lost all motivation to be better.

We hung out less as the weeks followed, and eventually she ignored me completely, even if we attended classes together. I also noticed that my friends had started to avoid me more. I didn't know why. I wanted to know why. For some reason I couldn't tell them why, like they wouldn't understand if I told them. I even tried praying to God why I was like this on why I couldn't be better, even if I didn't really follow him.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, a day came where I just couldn't take it. I didn't attend classes for about a week, disillusioned about all of this. *Why?*

I realized after that week that I was doing all this to feel good about myself. Even though I don't what I should be feeling good about.

I realized after that I had lived inside of my head for so long that all I see is me, and all I feel for is the good of it. In all these stupid ideas of the ideal life, relationship, and routine I saw other people embody, it all became so far to me.

In the manifestation of that everything - so hungry and addicted to that grandiose sense of expectation - I see and feel for nothing. Maybe I just wanted to imagine, but not really live. Maybe, I realized that I don't want to know what I should be good for.

Maybe wanting to get close to her was my way of trying to get close to myself. But I had subconsciously realized that it just wasn't possible. When I realized that it wasn't finally about the relationship and what you feel from it, but for who she is as real, I was... disappointed.

I became disgusted myself after that, and I closed myself off of everyone. Things have been like this for a while, and I still only live inside of me.

339,Elaurin34,1645888654,1,"Hi there,

I always hear that people need to be able to have fun on their own and when they always drown themselves in company by others they are too dependent on other people. Well it's not like I always seek company but I never do stuff on my own because I always think it's no fun when I do it alone. And even if I try it usually feels boring. I also never met anyone new to create possibilities for making new friends. So I am usually just like ""well if it's boring and doesn't help me with what I am trying to achieve I can save money and feel bored at home as well"". So I mostly sit home alone not knowing what to do with my life. It's not like I'm not interested in anything but mostly my interests just come and go every week or two and change all the time. And then there are times when I can't enjoy anything... I always feel like I'd had to do something more productive even after a whole week of work. I started working out every two days now but I can't get rid of this feeling. Especially on rest days I feel completely useless and uneasy.
I don't understand how other people manage to be busy all of the time or at least they act like they never sit at home doing nothing.

I told her as long as she wasn't sick we could be around each other and she just said ""nice"" and moved on. A bit later she just stopped responding to my messages.

I’ll see strangers walk by, a familiar face in the elevator, or make small eye contact, and in all of those brief moments I think “maybe this is it. Maybe now my life can truly begin”. For some reason (probably the social construct surrounding love) I have associated any internal merit with the capability of being loved. I’ve always thought, conscious or not, that the best part of my life would start when someone fell in love with me, and I with them. And I’ve always craved an epic love story: love at first sight, second chances, childhood friends to something more. Ive searched for the beginning of those stories everyday in my life because I know that in the monotony that is my day to day, and the more than likely similar future, the only epic part of my life are my feelings in it. And no feeling can be greater than love, I hope. So, for brief seconds during my day, I fall in love with strangers. I see picket fences, and white gowns. I picture Christmas lights and warm beds. Then I blink. And it was all a daydream. I’ve never been in love, and I know my perspective is askew, but I just hope that one day I will be. That one day I could be consumed by something as powerful, and beautiful, and masochistically blissful as love. But instead those strangers keep walking, elevator doors close, and eyes divert.

372,Haimish1224,1645860761,1,"Sitting here drinking whiskey on a Friday night by myself. 

Feels like every girl I have every truly liked and tried to pursue has always ended up leaving me or absolutely wrecking me in the end. Every time it feels like the same effect, months of feeling like I have no energy, neglecting my friends to the point I stop getting invited to things, not enjoying my hobbies as much anymore. I've noticed in recent years I find myself getting a lot more pessimistic about my relationship failures and I just don't know what to do. Things get worse and worse each time and the last attempt at a relationship I had was bout a year and a half ago and I am still not out of the rut it put me in.

Its always been a shitty pattern of mine, getting too invested into relationships and romanticizing things only to get hurt in the end. But yeah I am pretty fucked up now. I sustained an injury and had to be hospitalized during this past ""relationship"", had to withdraw from my last semester of school and was basically unable to work out for several months, or keep a job, and couldn't even really play video games either it was hell. She left me for another guy who she told me was her friend when we first met but he lived in another country, she left me while I was in the hospital as soon as he got home from the airport. 

Before all of this I pretty much just had petty heartbreaks, but they always felt so real and shitty, I guess I am just sensitive as much as I hate to admit it. Or maybe I am just a weird hopeless romantic. Like I said I have noticed the trend for a while, I guess this last chick leaving me just really put the nail in the coffin when it comes to me really accepting I am just doing shit wrong one way or another. With girls that I really felt like I loved I always knew it was because I was doing too much, I have been kind of obsessive in the past and I cringe when I think about certain things I've done in those regards. It just seems like I can keep a girls attention for 3 messages/conversations, or I end up getting completely played and used for 3 months, no in-between. 

I feel like I am stuck in a cycle of getting so wrapped up and invested in whatever girl I meet that even remotely catches my eye because I am always recovering from being hurt by someone else. Its been this way since I was like 16 when I first got cheated on. It is to the point where now it is affecting me even when I meet a new girl, whether it is organically or through some dating app/social media. I find myself having shorter and shorter interactions with these girls because I just don't have the energy anymore I guess? I almost can feel that something is off with me and even though the conversations go well I usually end up getting ghosted. 

I'm (M/24), about 6'4"", played sports in school growing up and still maintain a relatively athletic lifestyle although I do not have near enough energy to workout and stay ripped like I used to. Even though my self-esteem is completely shitbagged and wrecked, I know I am pretty good looking cause it seems like every girl I pursue or flirt with has to tell me a million times. Literally a girl that ghosted me a couple weeks ago would not stop telling me how sexy I was when she was drunk it was almost annoying. Id give myself about a 8/10 and if I could just fucking get over myself and work out/eat consistently I think I could damn near be a dime. 

I haven't ever really been the player type, granted I had a phase or two during college where I hooked up with people. But I have never had an issue attracting women, it's always just been the problem of getting them to stay. In the past few months I have bagged two of the most fine girls I have probably ever talked to, both of them ghosted me. Now in the past, my primal male brain probably would have at least gotten a hookup out of one of these girls or something to at least numb the pain right? Not this time, not in a while actually, I have no energy, no effort, no drive, just feeling dead inside. Its not like if had I gotten laid it would have made it better anyway, just prob would have made it worse, but yeah that's a double-edged sword of insecurity and regret right there, it would have been shitty either way and I think that is the sad state of my mental health ATM lol.

I feel like so much stuff about me is off-putting, especially to women around my part of the country. I am from the south where I grew up with a good family and went to private school but played competitive basketball in the inner-city. I am country as hell and grew up riding fourwheelers and driving big trucks but also grew up smoking pot and blasting street music with my teammates. I was a ""jock"" athlete in highschool that was being recruited for college and although I partied a decent amount and had social interaction, although a lot of my best time was spent staying at home playing video games with my ""nerdier"" friends (which few people knew about). Most girls think i would drive a truck, sit around all day and sports bet, go hunting, etc., and most of my knowledge would consist of college basketball. You would not believe the amount of girls I have met that have acted like it was the most surprising/cool thing that a guy like me was into the same kind of art/podcast/anime/etc as them only to see them talking to someone else a few months later who is holding a catfish in their pfp. 

Idk I feel like I used to take pride in myself and have confidence. I used to like that some aspects about my character and my interests might seem conflicting to people. I used to think that someone might appreciate it one day. But ever since all these girls have come around to make me feel all special for it n' shit just to end up leaving me in the end, has me doubting myself like never before and has me completely drained of all my energy to do anything. Like I said it has gone beyond having the energy to pursue a relationship, I don't have the energy to even talk new girls that show interest in me, I don't even have the energy to stay healthy. I feel so fucking weird I just don't know what to do. I feel like especially girls now think that I must be weird too since I am a tall good looking guy that has hardly ever had a relationship and is obviously broken and beaten down from past failures.

I could really use a therapist (couldn't we all?) but therapy is expensive and, besides, it's not a professional psychologist that I need, necessarily. It's just someone to air everything out with. Someone I can be honest with and share the darkest corners of my psyche with. I'm not saying I need someone to tell about the bodies in my basement, just someone I can *really* tell things to. It doesn't matter who (because let's be honest with ourselves here, just having the chance to talk like that is enough of an opportunity for revelations to start spilling out by themselves), what matters is just having someone.  


But the problem is, of course, that such a deep connection has to be formed naturally, I can't just force someone to bear my psychological baggage, and, from my experience, it doesn't happen very often. I've never really had it. Maybe the potential was there in some of the connections I've made but just having the right kind of soil isn't enough to cause a seed to become a tree; it requires sunlight, water, the right weather conditions, and, most importantly, time.

This caused me to develop severe depression and anxiety amongst other issues. It made it EXTREMELY difficult to talk with others and develop any type of connection. I don't interact with my family much because they can be quite aggravating and the conversation is far from stimulating, so it made me crave for a connection outside of my house. I've had no issues connecting with people on Tinder/Instagram other social medias, however it's not enough for me anymore. When the time comes to meet with others I feel this weight of dread and fear that my mother has instilled in me for so long. Ultimately my ""connections"" die off because I never meet anyone face to face. I really want to... I just can't. 

Unfortunately the times that I did push through and have met with ""friends"" or those interested in me, it has ended with me being \*ssaulted. It has made my loneliness so much worse that it's mindnumbingly painful. So I am stuck in this cycle where I put my best effort in finding new people to talk to, talk to them for a while, then never meet and stay stuck in the same 4 walls of my bedroom.  


If anyone needs to talk, my dms are open.",lonely,it's rough out here 22f,2022-02-26 16:12:19

I remember being in the third grade sitting in class and imagine the principal opening the door, telling me my uncle was there to pick me up. I imagined myself packing up my stuff and going with him. The car ride, everything.

I remember taking a shower when I was 11 and pretending Harry, Ron and Hermione where behind the wall, talking to me.

I remember imagining Drake Bell (from Drake and Josh) ringing my door and telling my parents he was my biological brother, that I had to go with him. I remember thinking this as him ""saving me"".

I remember imagining James Franco (as Harry from Spiderman) being my best friend. I remember picturing us in class, joking around. I remember us getting a PS1.

I still do this. But it's only recently I realized I've been doing it for as long as I can remember. I think I started doing it as a kid to scape the real world. Every scenario was me going somewhere else, with different people.

I think this was my way of coping as a kid about having no friends. I remember the central point of my daydreams being about having friends. I also never grew out of it because I still do this.",lonely,Daydreaming,2022-02-26 15:13:54

409,No-thingLeft,1645847508,1,"So... It's the mental stories about ""myself"" that seem to cover this love and the sense of wellness. The ""me"" that the mental stories refer to is a mental appearance, an image, an idea. And what we actually are, what this love is, is not an idea or an image. It has to do with the silent ever present open awareness that is aware and open to all stories and feelings. At the same time there is the understanding that none of the stories have to do with this source of wellness that is ""prior"" to all stories, feelings, images that appear.

The feeling of this love is like being in love with the best of friends, even though no separate body is being seen. In a way this is your own self but not the boring old self that you've confused yourself as. This is freshness, unknowable (or something more than merely ""knowable""), most intimate and loyal friend that there can be in a way. When this doesn't seem to be there it doesn't mean that it is not present. The experience of loneliness is due to turning the gaze away from the Beloved into imaginings. Into thoughts and mental images. And taking yourself to be a mentally made sense of separatation that in reality you are not. The Beloved has not gone anywhere.

For this to be apparent, seeing the imagination and thought-activity for what it is and refusing to go with it is required. Staying still in the face of the apparent mind-movement and mental noise and images that seemingly tries to look like ""me"" and ""mine"". Just witnessing from absolute stillness is enough. but it requires absolute stopping/withdrawal from the so-called mind-stream. And just witnessing it without linking into any kind of a self-definition. Witnessing the forming of self-definitions.

If the post made any sense and if there is any interest in hearing more of these kinds of pointers to what is true and what is not, there are people/friends on youtube (for example) that talk about these things.

One is constantly passive-aggressive towards me, and I towards them — we just argue constantly and I couldn't even tell you why anymore. The other found other, better friends and treats us all as an afterthought. The third I'm dating, but our relationship feels so lacking even as nice as she is — I don't feel a connection anymore on any fronts, even as just friends. Conversations are awkward and suddenly I don't feel comfortable being myself, even when she's just as out there as I am.

But those are the only friendships I have, even if they don't feel like it anymore. Disappearing only ends in me coming back as soon as I can't stand the quiet anymore — even if it feels cheap, it's all I have going for me. It's so miserable, especially when I think about how it USED to be.

I miss feeling connected with people, having friends that shared my interests and opened me up to new things, having people that acted genuinely happy with my presence instead of us just kinda awkwardly existing in the same space. I miss when we could be honest with each other about the good and bad, when you could be listened to and also have someone that wanted you to listen to them.

I don't even know what's holding our little group together anymore, everything feels so superficial.

And it just feels so rough on my end. Because these are the only people I have. They have other people. I don't. I'm not even really sure how to make friends anymore. Everyone I meet is so different from me that I feel obligated to hide a lot of aspects about myself for fear of judgement — and that just sucks the fun out of spending time with anyone, y'know?

It's just so frustrating how hard it is to connect with people these days, or just find people with similar, dorky interests.

It was extremely abusive (it had the 2nd highest suicide rate in any educational institution in that country) and I suffered through it from K fill 8th grade. The took joy in humiliating us as kids, made us cry intentionally and yelled at us. They tried every form of abuse except for physical (because the government would intervene). I told her that I'm afraid of people who are in power, more specifically girls (most of the teachers were girls). She instantly started apologizing and I practically killed the room.

I'm a 16 year old boy about to turn 17 next week and i do school online I did homeschool for like 5 years but i used to go a like charter school type thing were i would go to a class once a week and I had friends there but it stopped in 2019. I still see a couple of my friends from there but we don't really have a lot in common. I've found a few other friends on an Instagram account I made there is this one girl Mary who used to go to that class with me she now goes to a public school but I really remembered her because she actually talked to me and she was really cool and she's really pretty. So i found her on Instagram and started talking to her but i guess I creeped her out because I wouldn't ever end a conversation i just kept wanting to text her but she had a boyfriend so she eventually blocked me but i kept trying to talk to her and she didn't want to talk to me. I told her i was sorry for being texting so much i explained that i was homeschooled and didn't have friends or know how to talk to people and she forgave me and i sometimes talk to her I'm really lonely but i don't think she'll let me follow her. I told her i liked her and wanted to talk to her but she told me she didn't remember me so that sucks. There's another girl I used to go to public school with named Claire and I found her account because someone i follow follows her so i talked to her and it she actually started talking to me and said she had an old year book and found me in it and told me she had a crush on me and i used to have a crush on her and again I remembered her name since we went to school and we texted each other for a few days until I made it weird and kept telling her how lonely I felt and kept texting her when she was busy and when she didn't respond I sent her a long text that sounded very desperate and she responded with something like woah dude and an emoji so i don't think I'm gonna make her want to talk to me again which sucks because i really wanted to talk to her but i always makes things awkward and uncomfortable i have high functioning autism so that might have something to do with it because i don't know. She still follows me and i still follow her she hasn't blocked me or anything but she's not responding to me i know i sound like a creep or something but i just don't have any friends to talk to because everyone is busy and I'm never busy i just want to feel normal. There's a few other girls that are also homeschooled I found on reddit that said they would talk to me but when I sent them a text i got no response.  A lot of times when i feel lonely I'll usually watch movies or play music but a lot of times when i get really lonely I'll watch porn or masterbait to celebrity women and stuff like that I don't like talking about this but I keep doing this and i always feel terrible after and i feel like a loser. I hate that i ever found porn because it makes me feel even more depressed and i wish i can have a more innocent brain that doesn't think about porn at all. I also watch YouTube pretty much all day and I  know that's also not healthy but I do it because I'm too lazy to do stuff I want to do that's productive like read. I used to read everyday for a few months and now I've stopped. Every time i try to my brain just thinks of a million other things and i can't focus on what im reading. Yesterday i read a book using an audiobook and that helped a lot actually so I'll probably start doing that. I also have been going to sleep very late at night usually at like 2 or 3 I'll be on my phone all night and wake up at 10 and don't want to wake up. I sometimes bang my headnon the wall when  i get mad or sad I do it really hard sometimes and don't know why i keep doing it. People tell to just do something about it like just put down the phone or try to get a job or go outside and makes some friends or tell my parents i want to go to school but it's not that easy it's hard to tell my parents anything because they think I'm doing fine and my mom even told me that I don't need friends and family is all that i need. I haven't talked much about my family so I'll just say I'm starting to hate my mom even tho i know she does a lot and I'm not saying she doesn't but she's not a very good person because she always takes my problems and tells me that she's gone through worse and that I'm just feeling sorry for myself. I've told them that I've feeling lonely and they don't really know what to do so I don't know anymore. I said I'm almost 17 in a week but it does not feel like that at all i still feel like I'm 14 there's kids that my little sister talks to that are younger than me that who are smarter than me. I'm not very smart as you can tell by my spelling that's why my parents don't want to put me in public school because they think online is easier which if probably is but I just want to feel normal and see people and make friends. I hate to say this but I almost went to school last year but i got scared because i was going to a summer school and i didn't want to do that so my mum just didn't put me in now I wish i did but i just got so used to being inside all day. Again i feel like such a loser because I can't do anything without somebody telling me what to do I'm so dumb. I don't know what I'm supposed to do i want to talk to some sort of therapist but my mom just ignores when i tell her that. Honestly all i want right now is a girl my age to talk to and hug . I know this sounds really weird but lately I've been fantasizing about like another timeline where I go to school and meet this pretty girl who likes the same stuff as me and we talk about movies and music we like and she's like my imaginary girlfriend who i bring to my house and we hang out all the time and she even helps with school work and helps me focus on reading and i won't go into more detail than that but yeah. I want to one day write or direct movies but I don't think I'll ever do that as soon as i want.

453,zzyzzyva,1645830822,1,"I spent the majority of my younger years as a sad little lad.

It wasn't until I hit my early twenties that I came to the decided to do something. Up to that point, I carried on with the mentality that my struggles were superficial compared to others. I reasoned that because of my fortunate circumstance, I had no acceptable reason to feel how I did. But man I was sad. No amount of repressed expression could change that fact.

Dont get me wrong, I had it good. I had a complete family around me, we never worried for food, and although we weren't rich, we lived comfortably above our means. But loneliness has no prejudice when it comes circumstance. I was born my mother's bastard, and despite not knowing for decades, I never felt my home was with my family.

In my own experience, I've found loneliness in the company of others to be among the worst. To watch as those around you freely wield a love that they subsequently deny you is taxing to the soul. You often hear how history is integral in shaping ones future, but seldom do we realize it as it is happening to us. 

I chose to cope with my sadness by denying it's existence entirely, and it took years until I could truly see how the repercussions of that choice seeped into my life. My relationships in school often embodied the loneliness I felt at home. I gave to those interested in taking, and closed myself from having meaningful connections. It was as though my mind sought comfort in the familiar feelings of sadness, leaving me doomed to repeat a vicious cycle. 

Coming through the other end of that, I am ultimately better for the pain. It taught me how to improve, it taught me how to live when other options seemed inviting, and above all else, it left me with a unique ability to connect with the similarly scarred. I certainly have a share of damage, but through the hell, I gained appreciation for heaven. I was never keen to the phrase ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"". Instead I would say, ""what doesn't kill you shows that you can survive"". So I say survive until you thrive, and fuck anyone who doesn't support your strive.

454,Leather_Hedgehog5142,1645830566,1,"I’ve (23F) always felt pretty lonely, but it seems like every year it gets worse. I used to have a ton of friends in college and slowly I’ve just grown apart from all of them. Any of the friends I do have live roughly 2 hours away and are spread apart. The ones I have in the city never want to do anything, or go anywhere. They bail on me last minute, and even when friends from college do invite me to come out there’s a disconnect. I don’t even really connect with the current roommates I have anymore. I think I’m a fun person, I’ve had my issues and problems that have fucked me up but I think I’ve improved on them, and I’m always watching and working on myself, which I’ve had to do alone because I feel like nobody really cares. 

I’m the friend you call to vent, the friend you call to get advice, or a favour. I’ll always try my best to do it because I care. Once in awhile I reach out to friends to vent, but only when I don’t know what to do with myself because I’m so upset (which is very rare nowadays) I tend to just keep to myself now. I’m scared of making new friends, I’ve had friends that I’ve grown up with stab me in the back (which still hurts to this day). 

There’s one friend I hangout with a lot, I think of him as a brother and he just asked me out on a date which makes me feel even lonelier if by chance he only hangs out with me for the occasion I say yes.

And when it comes to romantic relationships I am just terminally single, every guy I’ve ever tried to be serious with pretty much love bombs me. And it hurts, I’m lonely. It just gets worse, and I need to vent, I don’t want anyone to feel like this but I also hope I’m not alone. It’s also hard because of Covid, but at this point it’s hardly an excuse because I see my friends in the city doing stuff without me all the time.

I’ve tried bumble bff, I’ve tried all kinds of dating apps, I’ve tried going to parties and meeting people, nothing has worked. I think I’m a smart, funny, talented, and attractive woman with a heart of gold. I’m constantly let down and when I cut people off I’m too afraid to try again.

459,Revolver-Knight,1645828632,1,"A thought occurred to me between last night at work and today what do people think when they see me.



It all started last night at work I was called to floral to blow balloons because I was the closer for produce and the only one there.

The customers were these pair of girls and they were my age 18/19  either seniors in highschool or just graduated.

I graduated way back in June of 2021 

Anyway as an a associate and as I’d like to think a decent person I said hey how are you doing.

They just handed me over the balloons they wanted and then I heard one of them say sarcastically “oh wow he just said heeeey.” Then they just laughed 

And it clicked to me who these people where they had popular girl syndrome like it’s this weird thing I noticed when I was in school where the popular girls though the people who weren’t on there social ranking were just under them and any other guy that like they didn’t deem mediocre was just some how automatically liked them them.


Which is fucking stupid and like not to body shame but a lot of time these types of girls are like just skinny to the bone and look so just Barbie doll artificial 

Like there so skinny they look like they are malnourished Chihuahuas you see in animal cruelty commercials.

Like not my type at all but it’s like my main issue is they got a dog shit personally 



These people ushally will go up to the quiet kid or the special Ed kid and be like “this is my best friend! Hehe” like these people are there preforming monkeys 

It used to piss me off a lot like I had a guy I chilled out with at lunch nice guy he had what I think was cerebral palsy or some other developmental disorder and like these (excuse my language) little bitches would just come up to him make fun of him to his face and be like you wanna go on a date and just toy with him

I remember one day I asked why do you do that? And they were like “why do you care?
I pretty much told them to go fuck themselves 

And I’m not the incel ish type I wanna make that clear like if your a person that blames all your problems on all men or all woman or something to that caliber your fucking stupid 


But I dunno I ushally let shit just slide but for whatever reason that interact just reopened a bunch of memories for me

Then like I got home took a shower looked im the mirror and I thought am I just ugly.

I usually don’t like mirrors or photos of myself in general 

But like the last let’s say between last night and as of this post my sense of self worth and self love is just horrible.



Like I genuinely want to know if I have any physical redeeming qualities at all am I just fuck ugly or something 


It’s like I dunno like I’m not gonna get a straight answer in my family my dad always says I’m lookin sharp 

My mom and Mema think I’m handsome


It’s like my ex used to call me her sweet prince a lot and it really meant a lot to me .

It made me feel less like a fuck ugly mess.

Like I look at other men both normal and valued

Like I looked at old photos of this singer Michael McDonald and I’m like I want that hair 

It’s like why don’t I ever feel handsome or beautiful 

And like when my family tells me oh  lookin sharp or hey my handsome son it’s like I appreciate that but I almost expect you to say that.


Or maybe not handsome or beautiful but like let me feel AT LEAST FEEL MEH!

Can I look into the mirror and feel neutral about my self feel meh instead of wanting to run away into my bed and lock myself away from the world.

473,DatHistoryLad,1645824231,1,"Alright, this will be a long one...

These 5 people are by no means ""bad"", I wish the best for them actually, but it still stung like a bitch.

I am at my second year of college, I grew up and still reside in a large village/ small town. We have a kindergarten, elementary, middle school and high school and I went to all of them before going to the aforementioned college in a nearby city.

Consequently, I knew all or the majority of my classmates from elementary onwards, and they knew me. Nevertheless, growing up I was always a shut in, a homebody, who suffered from high-anxiety even from a toddler age. I was terrible in having conversations or socializing, still am to a certain extent. Regardless, I was, more or less, happy up until 2014, or as I've been calling it ""the last year I was truly happy"". Teenage years kicked through the door and destroyed everything, and slowly, I lost everyone that I thought to be friends (which weren't many) from drifting away. I lacked the courage to properly socialize with any of my classmates (something I deeply regret and will for the rest of my life probably), and I lagged behind. They took titanic steps forward, while I sprinted towards the opposite direction like a blind fool. Towards the conclusion of high school, i started to learn some things regarding socialization but it was already too late, you can't make up 5 years of degradation in just 1.

This leads me to college. I had, more or less, come to realize my predicament and somehow became an extrovert in college for a short period, during which I met very wonderful people. I failed to properly interact with them beyond campus, as I lived 30 to 1 hour away (either by car or bus). I always maintained friendly relations but I was held back by this, although whenever I got an invitation (which was almost never, as I was almost always the one asking), I went no matter what (in contrast to the past, where i had received many for birthdays, but never, ever went, a decision that breaks my heart every time I think that). In time we formed a sort of loose group, and I was a part of it, although I wasn't actively messaging them or talking to them via social media, I didn't do that all that much mostly because it was something foreign to me, and I had social anxiety.

Which leads me to today, I sent a photo and a  message to one of those friends (hell, the first one i made, the most energetic and positive person who always laughs at my jokes), meant to be kinda comedic about me having to partake in 30 minute ""driving homework"" (I'm trying to take the license). Hours later, while having forced myself to go downstairs to keep my grandfather company because he's alone most of the time and I feel guilty for him, I was bored and looked in Instagram where I saw a story made by another friend of the group. I was annoyed it'd be some story about the war, I saw allot about that from the self-shaming Russians from my school. I only saw it for one second due to the terrible internet, but it was enough for it to instantly drop my heart to the deepest and most darkest of caverns and allow for those past feelings of regret, self-loathing, and loneliness to come pouring out. We always somewhat gathered following our classes at the cafeteria, and as of late I've been returning home early because I have to do ""driving homework"", as such never got the chance to meet up with all of them at once all throughout the week. But I did meet them individually, or just 4 of them, because we share two classes together in Tuesdays and Thursdays, but never did they bring up the meetup or ask me. I suppose they thought about it today after class, but they should have at least asked me, hell, I even told the guy, who laughs at my jokes, that I wouldn't mind at all joining them whenever they want to meet up the week before. I suppose I'm the fool for not taking more risks.

What haven't I done to try to make friends, I took so many risks, suffered and tolerated so many awkward moments... I guess it's pointless in the end....

I’ve been wanting to go for the past 3 years but I haven’t gone because I’ve never had/ still don’t have friends to go with. Last year I came very close to suicide over being friendless (wrote the note, chose the method, picked a date) but I had an epiphany literally on the day. My happiness doesn’t have to be dependent on anyone. I only have one life and instead of moping over having no one to spend it with, I should be thankful that I’m here and spend every moment doing what I love whether it’s on my own or not. I went to the cinema, restaurants, Buckingham palace, the park, shopping malls all on my own and had a great time enjoying my own company. I even went to the club 3 times on my own.

So now that Wireless (the concert) is happening, I want to buy tickets and see Nicki, Cardi, Sza et. But my Mum got really pissed saying that I should go with someone and that it’s embarrassing to go alone. This shattered me because of anyone knows that, it’s me. But I’ve wanted this for the longest time and I’m tired of letting others dictate my happiness. I know that concerts can be dangerous. But I’m 19 F, I only drink socially and I don’t do drugs.

488,arancinao,1645816830,1,"I’ve known this friend  i’ll call L since the first year of high school. Since we’ve met we have always been best friends, closer to each other than everybody else. We were kind of nerds, both bullied and alone during middle school, so we both know what being left out feels like. For the first time we found in each other someone with the same weird interests you could be yourself with. We had so much chemistry that L even confessed her romantic feelings to me during the summer of the second year of HS. I rejected her but spent many nights awake thinking about if I felt the same way or not ( I’m really out of touch with my emotions plus my family’s views were very discouraging). Sometimes thinking back I regret it. That however didn’t distance us at all and at the start of the third year we were already laughing about it together. 

Around this time I started becoming arrogant. I had better social skills than L at that time and that lead me to make more friends outside of us two. Superficial friends with whom I didn’t share even an ounce of the genuine deep connection i had with L, but it was nice to feel like I was such a likable person, so “popular” for the first time. (Middle school turned me into a traumatized people pleaser, terrified of social rejection). Knowing L liked me and that I was her closest friend I started taking our friendship for granted, spending more time with other people. I became part of a group of girls that had interests I didn’t actually care about. L didn’t like the girls in the group and told me she didn’t want to be part of it, so I chose them over her. There wasn’t a big fight or anything, just us slowly distancing ourselves until I was 24/7 with my new group and she was 24/7 by herself. This lasted 1 year and a half. Soon my group broke up, and for some reason L did not hate my guts, so we became friends again. 

It was different this time. In that one year and a half L had gone through so much that her personality had completely bloomed: Her social anxiety became much better and she became really extroverted, charming and fun. (She always had been, but now people knew). Everyone in class started always being around her, and it was no longer just the two of us. 

I was the opposite: my social anxiety has since become unbearable,I can no longer even speak to people properly without stuttering. My mind goes blank with panic and I never have anything to say, if not something painfully awkward. I don’t speak to anyone anymore except maybe L and two people

L told me she forgave me, but she doesn’t call me her best friend anymore. Now our interactions only happen when she feels pity seeing me alone and leaves her new group of friends for a minute to talk to me. 
Every time she comes I feel a great feeling of happiness, followed by bittersweet and a wave of unbearable guilt for the superficial piece of shit I had become. I catch myself sometimes replying coldly to her when she approaches me, partly because her pity hurts my pride and also because i don’t want to disappoint her again. I care so much about her opinion of me. I’ve also never seen her so happy and social, I don’t want to be a burden. Sometimes I wish she could be more of an asshole and leave me behind. 

What I’m most ashamed of is that deep down I feel resentment and jealousy towards her for leaving me,  moving on and becoming so happy.",lonely,I’m a hypocrite and I ruined my only true friendship.,2022-02-26 06:20:30

At first I felt it was great: I had a lot more time to do things since I did not have to commute, so I took up reading again after many years, bought a playstation, etc. Despite living in a country with strong lockdown rules (curfew, etc), it actually seemed like it made people more social in a way (for example since I couldn't leave my city I bonded a lot with my friends who lived nearby).

Now that everything is more or less back to normal, I am still working from home. I went to the office a couple of times but the two hours commute is awful.

However I'm starting to dislike the fact that my daily interactions with people are mainly via text or maybe some work calls where we don't even turn on the webcam.

those friends were my only friends, and it hurts to see them always hanging out with their other friends and never initiating anything with me. it sucks not even being a choice LOL. 

what spurred me to write this was the fact that one of my friends (lets call her friend A), whom i thought would always remember me etc, totally forgot about me + my birthday. just today, friend B posted on her spam account (most ppl call it burner accounts i think) a video of some alcohol cocktail and captioned ""cant wait to try this when im legal!"". (we are technically 17 this year, since our birthdays havent passed) and i saw friend A comment ""yeah wait 2 more days and we'll try this together!!"". why did this hurt me? because all 3 of our birthdays are two days apart: mine is on the 11th, B's is on the 13th, and A's is on the 15th. if our birthdays are that close to each other, how can she forget about mine? this is pretty trivial, but it hurts a lot.

I prefer blaming myself, but I feel like I'm losing control, because despite being physically fit, decently good-looking, other good life skills and getting along with people at work I just can't talk to people in a non-professional setting.

My job is also consuming my life. I've had to work 70+ hours every week for the last few years, and there's no end in sight, so I feel so unmotivated to go out and meet people. When I tried, the pandemic hit, so I didn't go anywhere. I've wanted to try going to some conventions for things I like but I never get the time (and I never will because every vacation I get I either use to see my parents, or recover from brutal work). My boss also intruded on my personal life and found out that I've never been in a relationship, and because I have a leadership job, he told me that nobody trusts leaders who aren't married or haven't had relationships, so I'm worried that my personal life will affect my job.

It’s not just some phase or crush that I had for a moment. It’s been 5 years now and my heart grows stronger for her every day. I just feel like there’s nothing I can do because I can’t just force her to like me in that kind of way. 

I am just left heartbroken and sad and alone. No matter how much I pray or how much I hang out with other people, I always feel that part of me missing. I feel a hungry emptiness in my heart that eats away at me from the inside. I feel my motivation and enthusiasm and energy and happiness fading quickly. The only thing keeping me together is putting my trust in God, for I know that He has a plan for me - but I also feel like God gave me her and I ruined my chance.

Someone is having the best moment in their life, people that just chillin , smoking , tired, and excited. 

Like think about it all emotion is being distributed , everyone is just exchange expression, emotion and experience. Some in a different place but in a same situation while some with same place but different emotion. 

This has been on my mind for i while but its so fascinating to think about it.

Someone could be making the biggest regret they will make. This is the past already. Every second , every word , every sentence, i make seconds gone by and all of it will be left in my memories and put in the past . The future is here and the past is here its all blending together.

I’m lying down here, writing these thoughts on this subreddit. 

I have no one honest and sensible person to talk about the things that get me scared and worried, or things that keep me interested to live.

All I can say is, I’m not happy anymore.
I thought I’m getting used to live nowadays, but the truth is, I’m just living out here for the sake of being alive. I only exist just to get things done. I’m just a person who lives to exercise the art of getting by. 

I feel so numb and empty. 

I feel weird to even just thinking about these things. 

I just want to sleep, but even my vivid dreams are weird and sad.

I don’t know.

I’m trying to do what’s best for me.

I’m trying to stay positive and keep myself motivated.

But there’s going to be hard times like today


today is the day that would make me realised, 

uncertainties would kill me
intrusive thoughts would kill me
sad thoughts would kill me

I killed off myself too many times before


but life stood still,

And I’m still alive but I feel like a ghost wandering, trying to fill in the void

the void that’s yet not filled

or maybe I’m just existing to see that there’s something worthwhile is heading to me.

Saying ‘maybes’ and ‘Oks’ killed off my high hopes 

I just want to stop saying these things
because it’s getting exhausted

I just want silence but silence is too loud in my head

Everything between us was lovey until me moving here. I've now transitioned into being their roommate while I work up to moving out on my own here.   


But it feels so defeating, everything has been feeling like this lately. I took on this opportunity to join this relationship and move out because every one back at my home town was terrible. I took one last chance on a guy who claimed he was into me only to have a few good dates, fun time hanging out then get ghosted. Not once, but twice because he came back wanting another chance.   


Why does it seem like I can only get men/women interested in me who live clear across the united states or in a different country? Am I just running into lonely people such as myself online?  Am I as great as all my online buddies/love interests make me out to be? Or am I simply just undesirable?   


I haven't had one stable love connection in my entire life. I didn't seriously start dating until I was 18. but every relationship, physical or online has went down the drain. I've gotten cheated on or ab\*sed.

These last year have been hard. Like two years ago I was living a happy life, I was going to the school, having great moments with my friends. I played for my school team and became kinda ""known"" in my small town. But after we graduate (and COVID got here) I lost contact with almost everyone. I always sucked on digital interaction so that really screwed me up. 
My best friend got a job and a GF so we barely see each other now.
Since I've always been the ""expendable"" guy in the group nobody really cares if I'm in the party or not and I was OK with that, after all, I was never alone and had at least one person to talk. But not anymore. Now I can expend weeks without a single text and no one would notice. I feel like everyone is avoiding me and I have no idea why (I like to think I'm not a bad person). 

I know it's not the end of the world, but it's really hard and has impacted my life in a negative way. I can't even cry because my house is pretty small and my family would notice and get worry (or laugh at me). I stopped doing exercise because I felt so sad and went from an athletic guy to a chubby one (nothing wrong with being chubby btw). So I'm venting here now because my last text was received 4 days ago.

604,Dr4fl,1645746331,1,"I don't know if it's really a good idea to post this here, but I honestly can't take it anymore.

All my life I've been very lonely, it's hard for me to make friends because everyone thinks I'm weird. It got to a point where my social life was completely ruined and every day at school was complete hell. Everyone left me aside and did their best to avoid me and make me look ridiculous.

At a certain point I couldn't take it anymore and told my parents to move me to another school. They did.

When I got to this new school, I thought that everything would get better and that I could have a better social life. I was so wrong.

In the first year (2020) almost no one spoke to me, and if they did, it was only to ask me for a favor. At a certain point I became friends with two people. The first one is a guy who is kind of weird and sometimes acts like a 5 year old, but he is TOO smart and astute. The second is a guy who likes anime a lot and didn't have many friends either.

Then came the pandemic and the online classes and although we kept talking, we slowly distanced ourselves from each other. 

This year I went back to school again and the guy who liked anime was in a different room while I was in the same room as the weird but smart guy.

We became too distant, the guy who liked anime got new friends and left me out, while the other smart guy all he does every break is go to the library and do randoms google searches and has hardly ever talked to me except to ask me for the time.

I tried to socialize a bit with other people and became ""friends"" with about three people. Although I like them, a lot of the time they just leave me out and it makes me feel terrible.

I thought that wasn't so bad until a few days ago, I found out that they have a chat group and even a minecraft server that they hadn't told me about. 

When I asked them about all this, they just said ""oh, it's nothing important"". 

This made me feel even worse and I decided to distance myself from them. 

At this point I literally have no one. I feel so lonely, I wish so much I had someone to talk to, someone to laugh with and trust.

I can't trust my parents much either, since many times if I try to tell them something they will only use it against me later.

605,GlassesRPorn,1645746081,1,"I see this everywhere. 

Manipulated by our parents to love them unconditionally. 

By friends into being people we simply aren't. 

By our SOs to be who they want us to be.

By our jobs to be milked. 

By our schools to think we need them to be happy. 

By our churches into following a hollow faith.

By social media into believing a plethora of delusions. 

There is so little loyalty to the self, and it kills.

Changing this starts with the question, 'How does this make me feel'? The end goal being avoiding draining forces like a disease. Because that's what they are. A mind contagion to control you with fear, guilt, and apathy.

Reaching mental freedom is a journey of many miles that starts with the one step, 'does this leech from me?'.

To reach the light at the end of the tunnel is to be a god amongst men. The liberated are few, free, powerful, and often still lonely.

606,throwaways4dness,1645745793,1,"**Looking for advice.**  
 So I posted on here yesterday and deleted the post, but for context: I'm chronically online, most of my friends are online. We mainly talk through text/vc.

 A close friend of mine has recently gone on a break from social media/online, so we aren't really going to talk much during that. I was able to talk to them today abit more honestly, and they admitted they were used to dealing with any emotional issues themselves. They wish they were more open about their issues, but they also prefer to avoid talking about their feelings. I've assured them I'll always be there if they ever need it and that it's fine to feel down, but now I'm worried about how genuine they've been with me over the years. I've always prided myself on being able to pick up subtle hints when somethings wrong-- and I did notice they were tired before they went on break, but I never knew they'd have to step back because of it. I'm just worried for them. I feel awful because I don't know how to help. They tell me it's fine and not to worry, but I'm a very anxious person. (They know this.) I know I can't force them to open up to me at all, especially if they're not comfortable talking about it, but now I'm just left doubting what I do next. They've admitted that even when they feel bad they've continued on in conversations and games as if nothings wrong..

Anywhere.  The experience is what I want to translate. It's like constantly screaming into a vacuum, or being a flickering bulb travelling the night sky; it's not to say anything but ""are you experiencing this? I want you to remember it especially, that's why it is the way it is. This is what it is, and understanding that is existence, to me."" Others only seem to understand after the fact, if they're so lucky ... or sentimental, is what they call it now.

So it was really hard for me to get over him. 2 days ago I found out that he likes a girl and that they became really close. Therefore, I deleted him on all my socials. So that I could not reach out to him anymore. But after that I immediately entered a new relationship as a kind of self protection from the pain. We are both aware that we don't love each other and are only in a relationship to give each other attention.

670,petit_anxiety,1645702436,1,"Two years ago when I visited a small village near a jungle in Thailand I felt the most ""at home"" I've ever felt. I found this perculiar as I'd never met these people, we wasn't able to conversate properly apart from smiles and laughter, they didnt have a toilet, bed, windows, a door, nor food, and lived in severe poverty whilst I lived in middle-class, but I felt the most at home I'd ever felt.

I was seventeen at the time and it was a really interesting experience seeing a whole village act like a family. When I arrived, the home-owners threw a ""Welcome foreigner"" party. The whole village gathered as a family and drank homebrewed alcohol, played card games, and laughed. They were very silly people and knew how to make people laugh and wasn't afraid to take their space. Okay, not the whole village gathered but quite a few people came and left, all of which was strangers.

I and my dad sat in our sun chairs a bit to the side and I asked him ""Dad, do these people even know each other?"" so he went and asked his wife who asked her family, and they said ""No, but everyone is welcome here"". Least to say I was saddened when we had to leave as it felt I had to leave my home for an indefinite future. I had to leave my newfound family that I was comfortable with after just two days. This may sound extremely clingy and unhealthy, but this may be because I've never had a home.

It's had me thinking when I arrived back home to our western civilisation. What is home? I recently watched [Joe Rogan's episode on Loneliness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dscDPIf0GJI) where they discussed why people may actually feel lonely, and what home is. The story of an egyptian woman and her saddening clash with suicide was told. Long story short, she was being evicted and for many of us westerners it doesn't seem like a big deal, she could just get a new home. Well, for her, home wasn't the four walls that kept her warm, *it was the people she was with*. She said that if she were forced to leave home that she'd suicide and so, with effort and help from others, she was able to stay.

\- “*Home is people. Not a place. If you go back there after the people are gone, then all you can see is what is not there any more.”*

I was always raised to be independent, and so along with the bullying I taught myself that I don't need people. I only need myself, my money, and my residence. I don't need anyone or anything else. I became a leech all my childhood just sitting in my room infront of the computer, not studying nor socializing, only being. Never accepting help, favours, or gifts.

Therefore, I've never had a home I don't think. I live in a very pretty house with a very comfortable bed with my beloved pet and my mom. I've gone to the nearby schools but never been quite happy there as I endured my days of bullying and learning. I didn't have many friends growing up either and as I quit highschool I've parted from the few I had. I haven't really talked much to my neighbours at all as after over a decade of living her with them, I couldn't name any of them or describe their appearance.

If I don't know the people around me, and people wouldn't notice if I went away, is it really home? Isn't home a place where your disapearance would be noticed? Where your stay is cherished by those around you?

I don't know whether this is actually the root to some of my issues or if it delves deeper, but this realization brings me some sort of calm along with depression. It also brings me some sort of hopelessness in the fact that I've never experienced what *home* is, only what *a home* is. If I don't know what home is, how am I supposed to find it? I'm only nineteen and I feel as if these are questions I shouldn't have to ask myself yet.

well I don't even know what I'm writing cause it's so messed up in here, please take a minute to understand whatever it is, if something about this post looks familiar to you.

(Also my English skills are bad so...)

I'm weird, I can have this belief here, but I can also put faith in good things about something completely opposite, this is something I've never seen in anyone. And same goes for my hobbies and things I just like to do. I can be extremely passionate and sensitive, and then I can be really rational too...

And about the problems I face? not necessarily something big and pathetic, but people don't generally relate... For example, I was giving sad vibes recently, so a friend offered help, ""you can talk to me if something is wrong"". This courage came from somewhere and I started telling whatever it was. The reaction was, ""what are you talking about 👀""... it wasn't a great problem, but... it was a problem and I had been too disturbed because of it. And... I'm afraid of people now.

I've seen many people being like, ""I'm totally alone, no one is like me, no one wants to listen to me"". Well, I listen to these people, and I relate at times. If not, I just put myself in their shoes. And their big-small problems are still problems in my opinion. It's like, I'm similar to everyone, but none of them is similar to me? If it makes sense. I feel for everyone who matters to me, but they can't, as if I'm in charge of accepting everyone as they are, but they can't bear to see my unpleasant and hopeless side.

I feel like there's no safe place for me.

And it doesn't feel great.

719,TransportationScary7,1645679318,1,"Well the fact that I'm a com major and at the age of 26 before graduating uni is just one thing. Despite the fact that I got a talent and did studies, I think my negative traits brings down more than what I'm capable of. I'm full time student that doesnt work, which adds a bit more of uselessness on top

I constantly feel lonely even if I made friend, and people think I'm fishing for attention but really, I'm searching for people that I match with but it just doesn't work. 

I often self-sabotage to change, but I've been trying to get rid of the temptation to act based on my impulse. Hence people calls me childish even if I'm at age of 26, didn't grow and I am still not in my best self. 

But, typically speaking, I believe everyone at my age are mature some way or the other. On the other hand, I am really nothing compared to them. 

Reflecting from what my life has been, I have been running away, break things, and making myself hopeless because I wanted attention, but I don't entirely believe this is 100% true either. I had passion for choosing my major, I simply wasn't ready for friends, and deep down I really thought I don't deserve good people. Part of the reason why I did all that is because it was too much, but that really doesn't give an excuse that I'm trash human being. 

Which in fact it means I have imposter syndrome; But it has gotten to the point where I doubt if I'm the person who I want to be, and if I am doing good. But even if I am being a good person, is it for sake of others or sake of myself? 

I am starting to think that this is also useless and just attention seeking to even post, but on the other hand I'm trying to get things off the chest.

So yeah, I'm lonely, but seeing how trash of person I am I think no one would want to be my friend or even associate with me. I don't know what to do; I don't know where to even start. I just feel I'm absolute trash for being nothing, and coward. I try to love myself but it's just too difficult. It's too late to be anything or to do anything.

But they are all just so 2-dimensional, there is no substance to them that I can see beneath who they are on the surface. I can't seem to make any deep connections. My parents say their closest friends were the ones made at college but I can't see these people being anything more than acquaintances, and it really makes me sad. We do not share the same hobbies or interests or same ideas on things, and it has made me feel so lonely. I often spend hours in my room alone because being with these people often feels more lonely than being alone. I miss my friends from home so much, I don't know if  I will ever get as close with anyone else as I am with my hometown friends. I just can't wait for summer, I can't wait to see them. I don't know what to do besides type out this post in hopes someone understands or is going through/has gone through something similar.",lonely,Lonely at college,2022-02-24 12:26:38

You have no one and you realise you can never make it.

Ahem. Anyway. 

Yeah I just want to vent a bit. I know it's common to feel like you're annoying and logically I know I'm probably not but there's no logic in emotions lol. 

My only friends for the past 4 years have been a group online. I know this might be cheesy but I met them through roleplay and I dedicated so much to them.
It was an RPG to be more specific. I did official art, I became the first and for a time, the only second GM. I helped with concepts and ideas and happily so. I didn't expect to be paid and looking back, I still don't care about it. It was our fun, our project together. 

I had the strongest character, I helped with others characters and so on- point is, I had been around for a while.

After all this though I didn't get much out of it. We grew apart because of time zones and no matter how much I tried, I couldn't really get close to the main group. Atleast not as close as I'd like. 
They would play games outside the RPG, have voice chats and their own private groups and they would draw pictures of each other and their characters. I never got anything. 

I know I sound really jealous and maybe I am a hint envious but I'd have really appreciated the gesture. I'd have really appreciated being able to play with them. I was like the third wheel. A simp, basically and I hate myself for it. 

I hate myself more now because after leaving, I've returned and they gave me a hello and then continued doing their thing. No catching up, nothing. 

I've been participating in the chats again (but haven't re-joined the RPG) but I feel like I'm annoying them all and I feel very alone.

It's not their fault. Some people just don't click but I don't know why I keep trying. Believe me when I say I've tried joining other communities and groups. Discord after discord, community after community but it's not the same.

I'm angry at them for no reason and it's wrong but I'm angry at myself more. I'm so tired of feeling angry.

778,Zestyclose_Visit_569,1645643423,1,"Guys, I think the reason why people are lonely because they don't believe in themselves. Sometimes, we just need to be confidence and believe in ourselves. Know that you have something to tell. Be funny, be yourself. Take risks, and be vulnerable. The only way you can have a relationship is by being vulnerable. Think for yourself: what and how much you are willing to tell someone about yourself so you can make them like you and connect to you. 

Sometimes, to be able to solve one problem, you just need to get more knowledge about that subject. Maybe we just need to read more books about how to make a friend? How do you make some to like you? How can you impress someone?

When you have more knowledge, you are more confident. Start to read a lot of books about how to socialize. 

There are a lot of books out there. Don't be afraid to make errors. Just be yourself, and you will attract people who like your kind. 

And we need to learn to take advantage of every opportunity we get to socialize. Go to places where you can get in touch with people and look for someone to talk to. There is always someone open to talk to you. Learn how to read people. Learn with who you can talk and who won't reject you.

Even if you are rejected, don't give up. Keep trying. 

Be courage. I am lonely sometimes but not all the time. Because when I get my chance to speak with someone that will be for hours for sure. Because I like to talk and I have a lot to tell. And I know what to ask so the conversation can keep going. 

In a conversation, someone needs to be open so the other will be open to open up.

Please start to read to improve yourself. Search on amazon for books that will help you to make friends.

Maybe you don't need friends; you just need to learn to take advantage of every opportunity you get. Opportunity to speak with people at parties, church, meetings, school and so on.

Be optimistic that you will get someone to share your life with. 

I hope that someone will understand what I mean.",lonely,Tips to start to eliminate loneliness.,2022-02-24 06:10:23
779,monoman12,1645643107,1,"I have very few friends and i am basicly bound to them if i want to socialize with some human beings. They are my only options but i am not theirs. Today i wanted to go out so bad but since i hate going out alone, i always invite my friend who lives very close to me. He made a new friend last year and he hangouts with him at least 1-2 times a week. Today was one of them and he said he have to meet his other friend so he couldn't come. I invited my other friend but he also said he has to meet with his friendgroup and he couldn't came also. I went out alone to walk and saw all the people with their friends and that made me sad as hell.

I have known her for about 5 years now, and we’ve been good friends, however I have confessed that I love her - and when I say that I love her, I really mean it. It’s not just some phase or crush that I had for a moment. It’s been 5 years now and my heart grows stronger for her every day. I just feel like there’s nothing I can do because I can’t just force her to like me in that kind of way. 

I am just left heartbroken and sad and alone. No matter how much I pray or how much I hang out with other people, I always feel that part of me missing. I feel a hungry emptiness in my heart that eats away at me from the inside. I feel my motivation and enthusiasm and energy and happiness fading quickly. The only thing keeping me together is putting my trust in God, for I know that He has a plan for me - but I also feel like God gave me her and I ruined my chance.

As i'm writing this, tears are dipping down my cheeks but that's alright

Most of my life i have walked the lonely road with few to none friends. Most days i do not have anyting to look forward to, it can be tough but the world is a tough place. I think there can be a beauty in just that though, it makes you a appreciate the little things, a beautiful girl on the train, a good song you just found, a fun game you played.

My mood is very up and down, i have bad periods and i have better periods. I have had problems with self harm for 5 years, though it's been on/off.

I remember playing the game ""Metro Exodus"", it's a game that's set in a harsh world and that's what makes that story so beautiful. It's a violent game, but it's not about killing, it's about being willing to take a bullet for your friends, being in such a harsh world and still finding love. After all i think dying for someone you love is the most beautiful act in the world. That's what the story is about.

I never had a girlfriend. It's something that i really wanted but i know i would never get. No girl would ever want me. At this point it hurts just to look at girls.. because no one will never like me. I wanted someone i could give all my love to, cuddle with, hold her tight and run the tip of my nose on hers.

I don't like holidays, it can make you feel very lonely to see everyone else out having fun. But then again, i'm glad they are having fun just wish i could have fun as well.

I always had my own views on things, i stand by that but accept that you might not agree. I lived my life doing what i believe in, you might not agree with it but i didn't hurt anyone. I never liked to do just what people told me anyway, if everyone went left i would often be the one who went right.

I have made my mistakes, had my ups and downs, had my scars. I'm not perfect, i'm just human and that's okay. I'm not a bad guy though, if you are my friend i would die for you. Still there are things that i regret, but i guess that's how life is.

When i'm dead i want to be burned and have my ashes spread in the ocean. Since the ocean is so big maybe i wouldn't be so lonely there. Then i wanna hear a last song but don't know which one..

There is a lot of things i won't get to see, i don't wanna think too much about it but i'm mostly okay with it. Life wasn't fun anyway, so why should i stay? it's not for me, it's just not my place. I hope to find my place

This is not anyones fault, and it can't be, because no one was ever there. No one should be sad because this is the best for me and everyone eles. I have piece now, goodbye &lt;3",lonely,My last words,2022-02-24 05:46:06

785,R00K_1,1645640580,1,"As i type this post down its abit hard for me coz my thought on wut to write on here is all over the place bcoz theres alot on my mind, so I’ll go with one of them.
Im known to easily like a girl (apparently its more like infatuation). And given my sentimental mentality, i just remember all the good times being with such people.
but then idk when this started, i guess its when i was trying to learn to move on, i try to remember and be retrospective about memories with crushes, during tht i cry abit, adding on, another reason is how im abit distant with friends these days and feel lonely, and given how im soft spoken and feel awkward when talking or interacting in conversations id says those r why.  Its like self imploding so i can pick up my pieces, it’s unhealthy im aware, but im stuck in a cycle, lack of motivation, discouraging results from my planned actions, repeating, others factors like singleness, fasing friendships etc

Ik its messy but I guess its a vent, just overwhelmed and thought this would be a good way of fuming out emotions with no harm.

I also feel very single, i had a phase where id hate seeing couples around me coz they’re always so happy, but it’s clearly bcoz i was jealous.

I sometimes wish i can express thoughts better, be a great conversationalist, be less awkward, honestly still don’t understand how to stop tht, but in the root of all tht, im just being nice, and trying to not be awkward or wutvr

Emotionally sensitive to sad romantic music too, its like a mild vietnam flashback, its an expression but it’s similar lol

But yea, I just wish to meet someone who’ll be there to stop me crying when im on an emotional hour coz a random memory be popping in.

I am an 18 yo guy who has finished highschool and will be starting college in a month.I have lost all the will to live. I dont have much friends and of the few i have dont give shit about me. Theres this one friend i talk daily with , maybe i can say he is my best friend. He basically sees me as a support system. He daily talk about his problems and i try to help him in all the way i can.

I have never had a gf in highschool ( couldn't go to school in senior year due to the pandemic ) . I see most people around me being in relationshipa and it just kills me. I could be the kindest person these people would actually and no one gives a shit about me. My neighbour friends rarely talk with me now. They don't usually include me whenever they hangout. I have pure ocd which literally put me through hell during the pandemic. I had no one to talk to for months and my parents wouldn't even accept that i have this issue. I am crying while writing this and i have no idea why i am carrying on like this. Ik my family will suffer like anything if i kill myself. I have zero hopes for the future.

I actually wanted to write some more but i just can't even sense what i am thinking at the moment.

I have violent hobbies like Bjj and boxe, but also academic ones like reading and studying. Also, I am trying to change my life, and having always been an outcast, I thought that I could try with online friends.

I don't really mind your age, gender or nationality, but I like using humor to cope with life. It would be nice to just find someone long term, cause it's annoying when people are just flaking on you. Since people here are lonely, why not try to get some friends? :)

What I offer:

- no ghosting. If we don't get along, we can just say it directly to each other
-
 - a sincere friend that is there when you ask for help

- support for the things you try to accomplish (always grounded in reality)

- dark humor: it's one characteristic of mine, if you are extremely sensitive to this..then have a good day!

- ability to take jokes and not getting offended 

And voice chat if you ever want to talk :)

----- You don't need to read the whole thing


I'll be 30 in a few years. I heard it gets harder when you're older but it's not possible now and no one's ever liked me not even when I was a kid. I'd be fine with dying alone if I was toxic or a bad person or did something to deserve it but even those type of people have friends but I don't. I decided to put all my worth in work because my boss is nice and praises me and tells me good job when I do lots of work and finish in a little amount of time. I'd let her praise carry me forever but work only lasts so long and there's not always something to do.

It's not even a question of being worthy at this point it seems my family and I are cursed to die alone and my family doesn't even acknowledge I exist. The media has destroyed my generation socially. It's either conform or die alone and I can't conform to everything my generation does. I don't smoke, drink, club, use drugs, absorb myself in texting and social media, sleep around just because I'm with someone and have needs and I'm not into memes that seem to define my generation.  I wish whoever says being different is good would stop lying because I've been lied to my entire life. I've heard it all ""you're funny"" ""you're sweet"" ""you're interesting"" ""you're entertaining"" ""you're adorable"" just lies, just stop it. Just more stuff to destroy me after I try to the pieces back together after being dropped and left by myself again after trying so hard to be good. 


If I had the money I'd just hire someone to stay with me and be nice because that's all I really want. I just can't anymore. I'm not suicidal but at least if I died it'd be a release.",lonely,How to cope with loneliness after giving up hope of someone staying with you?,2022-02-23 20:13:59

836,ABitingShrew,1645606049,1,"Reading through wikipedia on public figures that have chosen to end their journey in this life has brought me back to a phrase that I thought was very harsh and unfeeling at the time.

When I was a younger man, about 15/16, I confided in my mother that I was depressed and considering s*suicide. She was obviously concerned and scheduled me for therapy but it was my father's reaction that has stuck with me for a variety of reasons. This man thought that the best thing to do was to angrily tell me that ""su*cide is the most selfish thing anyone can do."" 

I thought this was BS as a teen and young adult but as the start of this post alludes to I get it now. Doing the thing is the easy way out of suffering for sure but it makes everything harder for the people that are left behind. That is to say I dont begrudge anyone for making that decision at all. But I do know that the fallout afterwards has made life that much more terrible for the people that care.

And I know for a fact people care. It is easy when in the depths of depression to think that no one cares, believe me, I've been there. Everyone has people that care about them. Its easy to ignore when you're feeling down, again I know, I've been there.

It seems as though literally everyone shows up in groups and I’m just like the only singular entity there, which, as you can imagine, makes socializing even more difficult, especially with my intense social anxiety 😣 

Anyways, I’ve just been feeling pretty down about being so alone and if anyone relates to this sense of trying and trying but never feeling completely a part of a community or group or having to deal with the intense awkwardness of going up to people and trying to talk to them without revealing how much you’re freaking out on the inside, I just want you to know that I relate to you and I hope everyone reading this finds some space where they do feel that care and acceptance we all deserve :) sending love to you all!",lonely,Attempting to reintegrate into a community is so difficult,2022-02-23 16:21:31

857,Ok_Structure6331,1645592676,1,"()Through highschool I have lost every friend I made, my personality changed so much I'm almost a different person but that also costed losing everyone I would hangout with. I have trouble talking to new people so making new friends is something that might never happen for me. I have 2 friends as of now that I ever hangout with outside of school, and that is rare (probably only one time a month being generous) the thing that frustrates me is how my sister is treated by my family, she has a car with paid gas, paid insurance, and the car was given to her. She constantly hangouts with friends and has never went over a month with no boyfriend. She is also treated way better in general by them and she never faces the things like how my parents scream at me, or guilt trip me, or get in my face to intimidate me. It happens so often and my sister never gets this treatment. I haven't had a girlfriend in 2 years and that only lasted a month with me getting cheated on and I got harassed by her friends at school for almost a year after. I don't get how my sister, someone with so many friends and luck romantically and socially can claim to have depression or social anxiety. And not to mention how she constantly insults me and calls me names multiple times a day, she spreads rumors I am racist because a few years ago in middle school I said insensitive things, I have apologized and stopped saying them for years but she brings it up constantly. She also tells people I abuse her which is a complete lie and the opposite way around. I'm not sure myself if I have depression but even if I do I don't want to say that because self diagnosising is bad. I wish someone would love me, everyone in my life may say they do, but they definitely do not as time has shown by how I am being treated by everyone around me. I cannot talk to people or make new friends, talking to new people is very hard unless they are the ones carrying the conversation, but if i have to talk to new people it feels like every word is being puked out slowly and cutting my throat on the way out, it's horrible. I've felt like this every since the end of freshman year of high school, I've always had social anxiety but never as bad as it is now.

No need to dig deeper.” Just because I’m not solitary doesn’t mean I don’t have layers, secrets or parts of myself I keep intimate but want to share with close, trusted friends.

I want to travel and share experiences with friends. And everyone I’ve thought I could travel with has let me down. My boyfriend… I wanted to be with him specifically because he seemed to have a passion to travel but all he seems to want to do is stay home and play video games. My best friend said she wanted to travel a lot when we first met but after she got married, she suddenly no longer cared about going anywhere further than a 20 mile radius from her home. I had another friend but he showed his petty, true colors and turned on me in the fall when I confronted him for inviting someone to a Friendsgiving event I was hosting at my home without asking me first. I confronted HIM but HE got offended and cut ties. I just cut ties with my newest friend after they made plans with me two months ago to go on a trip to NYC to see a show on Broadway, took an impromptu trip on a cruise because her rich father offered to pay for it last-minute and then tried to change the trip from 4 days to 1 1/2 because she realized that she was suddenly out of PTO because of it. She left me on “read” for a week and a half while she was on the cruise, then cancelled the trip and tried to sell the Broadway tickets to me (which her father ALSO paid for) but I declined because I was offended by the whole thing.
And now I just had another friend cancel on me who invited me on a trip to Disney because their friend who they’re traveling with is uncomfortable sharing a hotel room with someone out of state. She’ll go to an airport, fly on a plane, stay in a hotel and walk around 4 theme parks with hundreds of strangers but won’t share a room with a vaccinated/boosted work-from-home hermit.

I get it. We’re in a pandemic. But I’m so lonely and sick of staying in my apartment all of the time. I’m disappointed, sad and lonely and I feel like there’s literally nothing I can do to feel better or fix it.

874,the_meowing_cow,1645588059,1,"I am a 22 year old women, and I genuinely don't have a 'best friend'; or any real friends for that matter. I am not close with anyone, and sometimes the loneliness really gets to me.

There are probably about 5 or 6 people I would consider my ""friend"", but none of them ever reach out to me. I used to message them every once in awhile and see how they have been doing, but I realized they never check in on me so why would I continue to bother? I just end up feeling stupid to be honest. Heck, they don't even interact with the stuff I post on Facebook. And yes I know likes don't matter, but its not the number of likes I get. It's the fact that I like their posts and see them commenting on each other's posts and I just can't understand why I'm left out. Sometimes if I simply comment on one of their posts, they don't even like my comment. I don't even share things on Facebook anymore because it just feels like I'm sharing it to nobody anyways... like what's the point?

I have tried making new friends at school and work, but at this age, its like everyone already has their circles established and so they aren't that enthusiastic about making more friends. It is also kind of intimidating trying to fit in with a group of people who have known each other for years before. I wish so badly that I could say that I have friends who I grew up with. I feel like when you grow up with someone, it creates a different kind of bond, and I feel like I really missed out on the opportunity to have kind of friendship.

It doesn't matter if I'm in the company of people I know, or complete strangers. I am always the odd one out. The lack of social solidarity within my life has been really weighing on me and I have been finding myself more and more depressed. Am I just destined to go through life friendless? Just existing on the periphery of everyone's life? My depression is getting so bad that I'm starting to lose interest in school and just life in general.
I mean, what's the point in accomplishing anything if you have no one to share your success and happiness with? To me that sounds incredibly unfulfilling.

I really don't think there is anything wrong with me that would make people want to avoid me. I would consider myself to be a friendly and caring person. I am someone who genuinely wants to be there for, and support the ones I care about. I have a lot of different interests. I have a decent sense of humor and I love to laugh. I appreciate conversations with depth. And I take good care of my hygiene. I do however, have pretty bad social anxiety, and sometimes it may make me come off as really shy and even a bit awkward... but I really don't think its bad enough to be totally off-putting (or at least I certainly hope not). 

I cant be THAT terrible considering I did somehow managed to get a boyfriend! We met online and have been together for a year now. 

He has lots of friends and is really close with his best friend that hes knonw since they were kids. And I feel awful for saying this,  but sometimes it actually makes me feel really bad about myself. First of all, having no friends (especially when he has lots) just kind of makes me feel like a loser. And second of all, it's like a reminder that I'm nobody's favorite. Lots of people love him and regard him as a friend and a great guy (which he is), but nobody ever thinks that way about me and it sucks.

I'm never the person anyone goes to first when something good or bad happens. Likewise, I don't have anyone I can really go to either. I really truly believe that if I died tomorrow, my ""friends"" wouldn't even be that upset about it and I'd be quickly forgotten. Why am I so forgettable?

I don't know where I'm going with this rant... I just wish my friends cared about me as much as I care about them. And I wish I knew what it's like to be someone's favorite or to have a best friend. I'm really starting to lose hope. Why are true friends so hard to come by? Is there actually something wrong with me? Why am I not good enough to have friends? I'm so sick of feeling lonely, it actually really hurts.

Had people who wanted to be my friend coz I; to be honest I’m very likeable. It’s one of them things that I can say now coz I know it and you don’t actually know who I am so there isn’t really much benefit of lying or not mentioning. Anyways, 18 months ago I was an apprentice with more time less responsibilities more uni students around me and stuff so I socialised with them. I was always the funny one. Not only that I was successful with girls, so even more lads wanted to befriend me. Every friend I had I always kept it 💯 with them. I wasn’t the most innocent then but to drive this point home even them thugs I was around told me you kept it real before and after the money came. Let’s be real thst not easy in that particular lifestyle.So even when we all started getting big bucks in. And almost everyone in the circle eventually wronging another(not like not call them back but like stealing, constant slander or just like big things) I was the last one left with a clean sheet. For contact I don’t do what I used to do anymore so Yh. None the less here we are 18 months later and everyone still likes me…. Not what you expected to read? I don’t know how to describe my relationship with these people. It’s like we can have a deep convo but just not about me. I can go out alll night with them and not tell them I’m currently the most stressed I’ve ever been. They can bring up a problem they have. And I could be be going through the same thing but I’d just give them some sincere advice and move on. I still get stared down by females, still people wanna work with me coz I’m “the most entertaining engineer” in the company. But guess what…. I got no friends. No one knows anything about me. Not even my close family. I have so so so so so many secrets that no one knows. I wish that was the problem…or is it a problem. Haven’t figured that out yet but it’s that I don’t actually have anyone to share them with even if I did want to. its changed my character. i just cant bring myself to ask anyone for anything. Let me give you an example. I don’t have a key To my apartment block. I’d rather walk all the way around the building to get to the open door no matter what the weather is or what I’m carrying. I’d take the longer way so I don’t have to call up to my mum and “ask her to open it”. I searched for a workwear supplier for 45 minutes, bought what I needed with my own money, then claimed it back from my company just so I don’t have to email my manager to ask if he can order it for me….. coz he had the supplier and a company credit card 🙂. im so careless about replying to people that are not right infront of me. I used to hate people that don’t Reply in a timely manner. Now I’m the worst.  I love my life when it’s good and I look forward to the future. You know when your young you have like them visions of the future like little clips that play in your mind. I have them a lot but none have anyone in them but me. But I love having intellectual conversations I love socialising more than not socialising but I chose not to socialise 
But I choose to not socialise coz it’s more comfortable than constantly thinking how to actually become a friend not just everything that comes with a friend expect that actually friends part. You know what I mean? I feel so close to these people yet I’m soooo far away from them. They know how Like some character what I do for work if I like football or basketball better but you don’t know me. Have they made an effort that I’m blocking out? I have to be the problem coz these guys/girls share secrets with me!? I don’t know. None of this makes sense I know but it’s going through my head. Maybe someone can relate to something I’m it.

I didn’t think it was that bad, but I’ve blown like 2/3 of my savings (they weren’t astronomical to begin with, but still) . It was the only thing I really had that made me feel happy, a new game, a new book, a weird knickknack in the checkout aisle, high quality food. Now I can’t pay for my next semester of college out of pocket like I had planned. I’m gonna *have* to get a job earlier than I had planned (I had planned to get one anyways to test the waters, but now I can’t afford to quit it if it’s too much) . And I’m gonna have to live on my own for the first time soon too because my sister and her husband are moving. I can’t even ducking drive. I don’t know what I’m gonna do.

The instability is one thing, and it sucks, sure. But the worst part is I don’t even really have a *home* , I do t have someone to come back to and cuddle and who’ll tell me it’ll be ok and they love me and they’ll be with me. My reward for putting up with all this shit is a day spent dissatisfied at best or panicked at worst, and an empty bed and a self-hating mind at night.

Why tf do I have to live like this? Why does anyone have to live like this? This isn’t fair. This isn’t right. This isn’t how life should be. Everybody acts like they love it so much, so fucking much that they’ll bring another kid into existence just so they can experience it too. Why tf can’t I enjoy myself like them?

And because my grandma was there I did not want to risk her life by meeting/ hanging out with other people, possibly catching covid and giving it to her. 

Fast forward to today, I work for the State Dept. but it's still all remote. I live in Arlington. I don't know anyone. I literally have zero friends. I left my undergrad friends behind in AZ when I moved to FL for grad school. And didn't really make friends in grad school. 

I just don't know what to do. I expected things to be so different. I didn't expect to be working from home still. I expected to meet people after college. I joined a crossfit gym and that's helped some but it's different. I wish I would have stayed in AZ with my friends there. We've lost touch so we aren't really friends anymore.

But when I am lonely, fuck is so much harder than when I was younger.

I know more about myself now, and that has helped a ton.

Boredom spurs my loneliness. I have to stay busy. And it's by doing the work I love and connecting with the people who also love this work that the darkness recedes. I learned this by spending lots of time very active, then having a week or two of nothing to reflect. Trial and error. Perpetually.

College dam near killed me. For me, it was incredibly hollow. There is absolutely no point to it for me. It was always eating at the back of my mind that I was paying a crap ton of money to overload myself with work I hated for a useless piece of paper. The people I met in college who liked it were just as hollow. 

I'm not particularly smart nor attractive nor charming. My one saving grace is i dont feel embarrassment. Anxiety is a mystery to me, and that's leg up I seem to have on everyone else here. Talking to people is easy because I don't care. It turns out so does no one else. 

After I left college, I explored the world alot. Ended up in very strange corners in strange company. Most of this company I have hated and felt cripplingly alone. I also met two or three individuals and made a connection. It's the only thing that keeps me going.

Often, I wouldn't even reply to all the replies I get. I guess, the feeling of realising there are people to talk to was enough to satiate my ego...

I changed. 

Now, when I'm lonely, I let myself feel loneliness. When I'm lonely, I sit and think of what am I, and what to do. 
It's a recent change, and I'm still at it. It's very difficult, especially since it is so easy to reach out to people just with your finger tips. 

But the more accessible people are, the more inaccessible you are to yourself. There where two questions which prompted me, to do this. 

-What in the world am I doing with my life. 
(Involved some important people getting hurt, and them choosing to leave, which forced myself to introspect and retrospect)

-If I'm not happy with Myself, how can I wish someone else to be happy with me? 
(again, rooted in the recent breakup) 

My mind until recently was like a string of a bass guitarist. Heavy and beating constantly. I had to change that, I had to put myself to peace even if everyone else chose to leave me. At the end, you're all alone. 
You can make a Mirage of people around you, but relationships comes with an expiry date. 

I'm not there yet, but I can see the progress. I have to be happy, with or without people.

When I talk to most people in real life, they just don't get it. They would say you are normal and you will find someone. But it's just so damn hard. Here is a list of stupid reasons I end up staying single so far.

1. I was born in a conservative family. Having friends of the opposite sex is frowned upon by my parents. And my sister was a snitch (she was in the same class as me). So I had 0 interactions with girls growing up. So I am very shy when it comes to girl. Until few years ago, I couldn't even look at them and make eye-contact while talking. I remember one time I talked to a girl in high school and my she told my sister and my sister told my parents. They embarrassed me so much. My father also literally beat me and took away internet access from me for like a month.

2. My parents were also over-protective, and I was not allowed to spend a lot of time outside home esp in evening hours. So I don't really spend much time outdoors growing up or even hanging out in the evening. I used to play indoor games with my friend, so I didn't developed my personality and social skills. I am not very good at small talk or talking to strangers or in groups.

3. Kind of related to the first two, I was never in grooming much. I am not unhygienic but I am not much in dressing stylish. At this point, I try to but I have problems figuring out what works for me.

4. I was a quiet and introverted boy since I was a kid. It's just natural.

5. I have mental health issues. Like mild depression, lot of SOCIAL ANXIETY. It's not in my control at all.

6. I worked hard so much and I finally made to the Europe. India didn't had dating culture, so I thought living here will fix some of my problems. It was very hard for me here because people are so social and active here but I am just very quiet person. Anyway for the first time, it helped me in opening up as I talked to different peoples and developed some social skills. But my parents kept pushing me to move back to India because they were missing me and wanted me to live close to them. Eventually I gave up because there were literally getting sick because they missed me so much. Now I am back to square one.

7. Also I tried dating sites. As I said, I was much into grooming and styling. So I was average guy. But average = very poor if you use dating sites. So here it is.

8. I don't want to say big words here but there are researches actually which says Indian men and black women have the worst luck on dating sites. So this is just nice. It's hard and being Indian makes it even harder even though I am very open-minded person.

If you meet me in real life, you would see an average guy. I am not disabled or ugly per-se. So most people don't understand. I can't meet people online because of the dating site issue. I can't meet people in real life because of mental health issues.

I know I have to keep trying. I still do. I work on my style, photos, and even social skills. It's hard. My family is still actively ruining my life which doesn't help either. They are very loving parents but they are so selfish and only think about what they want.",lonely,I've seen single forever (27M) and not for the reasons you would imagine.,2022-02-23 03:43:51

I have some friends from before and I have a somewhat caring family, but at college I have noone. At first I tried not caring that much and thought I'd find my people in time. I tried socializing and being open to meeting new people, but I just failed. It's starting to get to me.

I won't lie I do kind of wish I could just take it pretend everything's okay so I can have a friend again they were not a good person and I treated me poorly but they made me feel alone even when I was with them and I feel like that's the worse any one can do two you..

I wish I was already gone and moved in with my online friends so I could feel less alone and maybe be able to move on from this all but I do feel like there's a little hole in my heart that won't go away it was 14 years of friendship just disappeared and I know it's affected on how I open up to people and maybe I'm a little scared about putting myself back out there to make more friends and the state I'm in I know it will get better I have to believe it will get better I hope until then I just have to work on myself and make sure I have everything in order that's the only thing I can control

970,Freedom_Laughter,1645529337,1,"I’m 25 and I ended my last relationship more than 3 years ago after 3 years together, the reason being me having mental health issues and her being interested someone else. I’ve worked a lot on my mental health through the years and I’m feeling a lot better now. Lately I’ve been focusing a lot, if not only on my job which is going really good and working a lot (I mean A LOT, 3 jobs, 7 days a week with not much time to eat or sleep as well) had helped me keeping my mind busy. But. A couple of days ago a colleague came up to me and said: “You know, sometimes it’s good to just slow down, take a break and take some time for yourself”. That broke me. Myself. Myself? It was in that moment I realised that all I’ve been doing lately has been just therapy and work and by doing those things only it’s like I’ve been identifying with my position of patient, co-worker, freelancer and so on and that was everything I felt like I was and I was fine with it. But that sentence made me rethink everything. In the midst of that came a text from one of my exes. She just needed some of her things we left in our old house back. After all this time and while I was dealing with those questions I started thinking back on my past relationships and the girls I once loved and how I feel like it was always my fault we broke up. I made 2+2 and I came to the conclusion the reason while I feel this way is that I have nothing except my work right now, not much time to spend on my interests, not many friends to spend time with and most of all nobody on my side to share life with.

I sat near this guy in my bio class in the first semester of the last school year and we'd have brief conversations or just exchange looks with eachother and there was some kind of a connection, a ""gaydar"" moment I guess. he ends up coming up to me at the end of class one day and asking if I want to go out after school sometime, I say yes and we end up going to a cafe near the school. 

as he's about to leave, he asks if I wanna walk him back to his house, I say yeah and text my mom not to worry about picking me up yet. we get back to his house and he invites me in, we go to the basement and put on a movie. he asks if I want a drink, I tell him no, I don't drink. after watching the movie for a bit he starts coming onto me and we end up making out. 

it doesn't take long for him to suddenly pull away and start full on crying and just saying over and over that he's not gay, that he has a girlfriend. I'm sitting there incredibly confused while he's crying when all of a sudden he looks at me and I can tell in his eyes that sometime just snapped in that moment. he starts coming towards me and grabbing at me, trying to pull my pants down. I'm starting to cry, I'm begging him to stop and he wouldn't stop.

Two months ago, my bf broke up with me, and ever since, it’s been hell for me.
He was all I had. He made me so happy. And I miss him so so so much, it physically hurts me. It’s unbearable.

His touch, his smile, his scent, his voice… I can’t stand the fact that I’ll never see him again.

But him, he already forgot everything about me. He erased all of our memories, and erased me like I meant nothing. And it hurts me so much. He’s happy without me, while I cry every day, and it’s killing me.
This is not fair. All of this, it’s not fair…

I tried to send him a message, but he didn’t respond.

It’s been two months and it does not get better. The pain is still the same. I’m not able to stand up again.

It’s not fair, I don’t deserve to go through that pain again, through that loneliness,… I have suffer enough for a lifetime already, I just want to be happy.

As a kid i wasnt really allowed out of the house, had an abusive father and the only if my mom was home and said yes for me to go over to their house. We moved 45 minutes away when I was 10/11 I lost all of my friends. My parents divorced and it was only me my 2 siblings and my mom. I instantly fell into the wrong group of people. (Sexual Assault warning coming up) I was abused the entire 6th grade year and abused the entire 8th grade year while i was also sexually abused/raped for the entire year (2 different people). I lost every single one of my friends. I had one left and i went into isolation and only saw him every now and then. Ive always suffered with mental health problems suicidal thoughts/ideation depression anxiety possible ptsd and possibly other things in my family. In 9th grade-10th grade i was also completely alone. I dont know how to make friends or how to talk to people. Ive gone so long without talking to people ive completely lost all skills with it.

I feel awful my little sister has to make her big sister happy. She asked my mom today why is she the only happy one in this house.

995,an_empty_future,1645510775,1,"I (31m) just ended a friendship with the only person (26f) that I had in my life. Before the pandemic, I moved to a new city for better career opportunities and met this woman who I really liked hanging out with.

Once covid hit, I tried as hard as I could to keep this friendship going, but she ended up ghosting me for about 4 months. She later reached out and apologized, saying that she was going through a really hard time and had some personal issues. I forgave her because I know what that's like. She promised never to do that again and said it was important to her that I always be a part of her life. But then, a few months later, she ghosted me again. This time for 8 months. She finally reached out and apologized, but said this time it was because she was seeing someone. She could have just told me, I wouldn't have been jealous or anything. I would've appreciated the honesty.

I almost told her to leave me alone, but I really needed a friend. I have no family and no other friends. I've been working from home for 2 years straight and have been in almost total social isolation. I feel like I'm going insane. I was miserable when she reached out, and I needed someone so I forgave her. We hung out a few times over the next 2 months and I really appreciated each time because it was the only social contact I had. But I was always wondering if she would disappear again. 

She later admitted that the first time she cut me out was also because she was seeing someone, not because she was going through a hard time. She only reached out to me when that relationship didn't work out. That really hurt me. I feel like I'm only important to her when she's not dating someone, and I'm only there for when she's single and wants attention. As soon as she finds someone else, she just ghosts me again. 

I didn't care about being in the friend zone with her. There were no feelings involved, and she knew that. Right now my desire for friendship far outweighs my desire for a relationship. But I realized that I just can't trust her. I can't put effort into this friendship just to be ghosted again once she finds another guy she likes. So I told her that it's best if we go our separate ways. I just gave up the only friendship I had and I feel awful.

1007,LetsDiagreeToAgree,1645504015,1,"I've been in r/lonely a while and feel like dropping my story here amongst the rest. I use female rather than girl / lady / woman because its all gotten so complicated I'd rather just be scientific :)

Me:
I'm 31M I sleep in a car in the woods. I've ran my own business with 4 or 5 employees depending on needs. I don't need money, I could get an apartment with a snap of my fingers. Credit score tickles the high 700's should be 800 soon. I don't need much, I have a small storage unit that I keep things I was told would matter to me one day, I never go to the storage unit to look at them. 

I'm naturally attractive also I go the gym everyday and maintain highly fit / decent muscle on me for my body type. I'm a virgin, I was raised with the understanding that if a male wants sex with a female then he is an awful person, justified by the claim that females don't actually enjoy sex. Lots of abuse because the person who raised me did not think females could mistreat males just the other way around. This lead to a life where I didn't know when I was being abused and when I wasn't because I was used to it. I was raised by one parent(F) who took me away from the other(M) for trivial matters, not a joke: the last straw was that he finished a bag of potato chips. 

Eventually I did lots of drugs and it was a blessing to lose every friend I had, because they were also abusive and took advantage of me trying to prove that I was a good boy. I met drug friends and stayed around through more abuse and abuse in altered states of consciousness. I got clean off drugs but having a new understanding of the world I didn't seek friends yet. I went back to family and spent another 8 years trying to figure out how I was supposed to be in the world. I was blessed by finally understanding that no family was better than the only family I could go to. I was never hugged, never kissed on the cheek, I was physically abused but I was lucky enough to not suffer any sexual abuse as a child. 

I finally have a group of people I do gigs with that after 5 weeks I finally consider friends, though my definition of friends has changed considerably. I talk to people at the gym I can hold pleasant conversations I never push for anything I want. I never hang out with anyone if it's not at a gig. 

I've been single since middle school, so my whole life basically right? I've dated 2 people in the last 10 years one for a month, one for two weeks. I can talk to females quite naturally, and can get to a relaxed conversation rather quickly. I am virgin, I can never bring myself to bring up having any sexual desire with females despite feeling in my gut that it would be well received. I fear that my whole world will crumble and I will be labeled as I don't even know what but something terrible beyond my wildest imagination. 

I suspect females expect me to know how to approach the topic of sex because I'm 31 and appear to have my shit together. I live in the woods yes, but everyone is surprised to hear it, I'm showered and well groomed with clean clothes everyday and a car that's less than 10 years old. I can only speculate though because no females have ever brought up any romantic interest in me. In a world where I'm mostly expected to make the first move I have never seen it done right. I was taught never to look down a females dress never look at their ass, and be interested in something other than sex. I feel guilty and like I have done a disservice to females when occasionally I do appreciate their bodys regardless of whether I get caught or not. I have asked out girls in the past and have always been met with rejection. I can only guess at why. I hear that females don't want to seem easy so they play hard to get, which I understand. There are imbalances in how society looks at females who get a healthy amount of sex vs males. I was also told to listen so I only ask once and so I don't push it because I hear all the trash talking of the guys who do. 

It feels so strange to try so hard to be accepting and encouraging of everyone and to have lived an entire life without a significant other(SO). I walk around and hear couples argue and fight about trivial things. I see guys be abusive to their partners, or just be a douchebag because they're more interested in something on their phone than their date or SO. I really think I could be great for a female. Loneliness has really honed my understanding of it and that I think I just want to be loving and affectionate to someone far more than receiving it. I've had girls kick me in the nuts so hard I collapsed, I've been slapped so hard I was knocked off balance, I've stood silent and still, being yelled at by females who knew I'd never lay a hand on them. I believe these occurances happened because I was giving them the benefit of the doubt they weren't interested in me and that it was my lack of action that provoked the situation. Again I don't know. 

Anyway, there's a slice of my life I don't know how to think of it other than a strange amusement and an acute sense of loneliness. I tried to kill myself when I was 11 years old, so there's nothing to worry about I know I'm more interested in where life takes me next than calling it quits. I can achieve a lot and reach high with my own devices in numerous different areas and fields but just not friends and romantic partners.

1012,shycadelic,1645502103,1,"So currently I live in a studio apartment, alone of course. I have 2 friends, one is my neighbor and the other one lives a floor below me. These two friends are starting to ghost me lately. One got a girlfriend, and once that happens with this particular friend, that’s all he cares about and wants to do. The other one, my neighbor, will respond to some of my texts but it’s starting to get less and less. And we’re supposed to be getting a place together but I’ve a gut feeling something is gonna happen to where it’s not going to happen (he’s always late on rent, has no car or license because he got a DUI a couple months ago, and now this decline in even just talking to me over the phone, text and calls). 

I was told this would happen at some point in life but I didn’t think it’d happen this quick (I’m 23). I’ve been thinking a lot about what my next steps in life are and the other day while on LSD I boiled it down to two things; move back in with my parents and go back to college, or keep doing what I’m doing now which will definitely set me back to how I was a couple years ago (extremely depressed and anxious, abusing drugs, and suicidal (attempted 7 times and am still alive somehow but I’m glad I didn’t die, I don’t want to devastate my parents as I’m their one and only child)). 

This really sucks. I work from home too so I’m literally by myself in my apartment 24/7, it’s really taking a toll on me. I picked up a new hobby (playing guitar) and I very much enjoy that but have no one to jam with or show besides my parents. Noticed I get like an acute withdrawal whenever I go over to my parents house (the only two people who are always happy to see me and feel love from). I’ll come back home and feel even more lonely and sad. 

I’d go out to bars if I didn’t hate alcohol and the culture surrounding it and dealing with annoying drunk people that say things that they don’t really mean when they sober up. I used to go to coffee shops but I’d just still sit alone, try talking to people but they clearly don’t want to talk to me.

I hate how I can’t be the one you want to hear every night. I hate not being put in the same throne you did back when I first met you. You treated me amazing, you were full of life and curious for us to continue. 

I set the boundaries however, these boundaries were weaved and even then you choose to stay in. Where you afraid of me? Can you not just do the same as you did with her? 

I hate how I’m jealous. Jealous how you talked of your past her so much and spoke nothing but everything you did to try to keep past her and make it last. When I feel like I’m worth it. Yes I made a mistake but I would never make you suffer as I am now for it. You are human, but how can a mere human put me in such hell like this. I’m so jealous that this past girl isn’t me. 

The girl you drove miles to see, the girl you want to make an effort so you do. The girl you went to get ice cream with. The girl you try to impress. Why can’t I be her again? I’m jealous of her because she did everything but yet even then it wasn’t enough. 

Nothing in the world would’ve made you devote yourself to her like how she did with you and how she is willing to still today. The agreement to yourself is still apparent but the agreement to cherish her vanish. She now drowns in her own tears and regret all for one stupid phone call that she does not need to beg for. She does not need to beg for the simple decency of BASIC human needs. It just goes to show she is nothing more but a ghost. Still there but transparent, you don’t think they are there nor do you acknowledge it. You just avoid it, so she is just nothing more but the avoidable. 

She loves you, with every part of her being she loves you. The way you slick your hair back from when you furrow your brow. To simple phrases that make up your cogitation and body language. The presence of you in every setting is emphasized by the way you talk. Smoothly like honey and the flow of spells you intoxicate into my mind like a trance. But only those lips who speak such magic would only touch my skin. With his hands he uses me as his voodoo doll to bend me at his will, but I would do so for him anyway. For the script is carved in my mind and soul. Everything you do she is fascinated and the willingness to provide you everything and more is the only desire she contents. 

Please she just wants to be the same girl as before.  And a better one for our future

1021,throwaway984692,1645500341,1,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm 25 and I can't stop stalking old friends. I've always had a really hard time making friends. Right now, I have one really good one... but that's it. Not to knock them, but I don't understand how to connect with other people. It takes me such a long time to warm up, and I can never get past being acquaintances.

I'm finding myself practicing unhealthy habits like social media stalking old friends that I miss, but would probably want nothing to do with me. I don't have social media, but I have accounts that I use to look people up. One of my big falling outs was about 9 years ago when I was still in high school. I'd consider them some of the best friends I've ever had. It took me a while to realize I wasn't wanted anymore and it really sucked to lose them. They dated for 2 years and I've never heard anything about them since they broke up. I know they never wanted to reconnect, but I still look them up to make sure they're doing okay. They're doing amazing. I'm happy about it. I just wish I was  part of it.

The last friend that was hard to lose was more recent although not really. Maybe 2 years ago now? She was insanely jealous and I just never expected her not to trust me. We tried to rekindle sort of, but those efforts when right out the window when she decided to befriend someone that SA me..... It got complicated, and I can't really see how she's doing because her accounts are private. I don't really care anymore after her betrayal.

Now I'm down to one friend. I don't stalk them. I just let them be.

I'm a fucking loser for stalking online. I know this. How the fuck do I stop looking specific people up? How do I just enjoy my life? Does anyone else do this or am I just the unhealthy asshole?",lonely,"I miss my old friends, but I can never connect with them again.",2022-02-22 14:25:41

1031,scaredgurlthrowaway,1645495432,1,"I said really shitty things about my bf’s ex and I think it’s going to destroy my reputation and continue to follow me.

I’m 19f and I was with my boyfriend (same age) for 3.5 years, most of high school. We became good friends at 14 and started dating at 15. We were EXTREMELY close to each other and even with each other’s families. For the sake of this post I’ll call him Michael. By the time covid came around we basically lived together because we often stayed at each other’s houses. We loved each other more than anything and I don’t think either of us would have seen us ever breaking up.

He was about to move into my house within the next couple months and we were going to go to community college together. As in love and obsessed we were with each other, we definitely had our ups and downs. We both have a lot of mental health problems. And I’m also autistic, and there have been a lot of times where I’ve had really bad meltdowns with him that would involve crying, shaking, hyperventilating, saying nonsense, etc. He has also had outbursts, but I know it’s my fault for him having to deal with me and pushing him to that point because of how emotional and anxious I always was.

Obviously, since we started dating so young, we didn’t really have much previous dating experience besides middle school relationships. His only other serious girlfriend he had was a girl he dated for a few months in middle school, I’ll call her Emily.

Michael had sometimes kept in contact with Emily over the years, which I was kind of skeptical of at first, but he assured that it was nothing more than a friendly relationship…until one time about a year or two ago when his instagram dm’s were open and I saw him quickly delete their conversation when I looked. After a lot of questioning about it, he admitted that she had been telling him that she misses their relationship and wants to run away with him (mind you, she’s also in a relationship), and that he briefly considered it but he would never want to leave me.

And I know that throughout this story I sound like the biggest idiot, but I can’t emphasize enough how close we were and how we did nearly everything together for so long, I just couldn’t picture a life without him. It was messy but eventually we settled it. Untilll a few months later when he went outside to get a package and, while his phone was facing up right next to me on the couch, she facetimed him. I didn’t answer it, but I looked at their messages (I know, it’s shitty of me) and saw a lot of pretttyyyy flirty stuff. Including him sending her a shirtless pic (which I thought he took just for me lol), her saying she wishes he was at her house, continuously calling him “luvbug”, etc. I know there was more but he snatched the phone out of my hand so fast when he came back in.

At first I told him if he wants me to stay he has to call her and tell her to fuck off and block her, but she didn’t answer. So, I told him to write a text to her basically saying how she needs to leave him alone because he has a girlfriend. But he just sat there and kept saying that he didn’t know what to write, so HE gave me the phone and TOLD me to write it myself. And I said something along those lines and blocked her number.

Very shortly after, she posted it on her instagram story (crossing out the name) and said “imagine being so insecure in your relationship you have to take your boyfriends phone” or something like that. I’ll admit, I probably didn’t word the message the best and it probably did look like it came from me. This all sounds so petty as I’m typing it out lol, but this situation actually is very scary for me.

Anyways, the whole situation just fucked me up emotionally more than I already was. And, I know it’s no excuse, but being so young and mentally unstable, I said all kinds of crazy shit about how I hated her, I wanted to kill her, I wanted to find her and jump her, etc. Deep down I knew I could never do any of these things, but in the moment when I was breaking down I just hated her so much for what she did and I couldn’t express it enough (just to my bf of course). I also looked at her instagram page all the time because I was always worried about her posting about me again.

When I was in 8th grade, I had just moved to a new state and I somehow had drama with this one girl who everyone knew pretty well. If I recall correctly, it started because of lunch tables. But one day on snapchat she ended up posting a picture of her bloody wrist that said “i’m going to kill myself because of (my full name)”. I freaked out like I had never freaked out before, my dad called the police, and they found her completely fine, but she went to a mental facility for 6 months. I was being threatened and harassed by a lot of people from school on snapchat and instagram, some who I didn’t even know.

So, I never went to that school again after that night. At first, the school was having my parents pick up my schoolwork so I could do it at home since we felt unsafe with me going there. After a few weeks, I got into an online school and I finished the last 6 months of middle school that way, completely isolating myself in my room the whole time other than to see my therapist, because I was scared of getting attacked if people saw me. A few months after the girl got out of the residential facility, she got pregnant and improved her mental health and wrote a heartfelt apology, which I gladly accepted and we wished each other well. The point of me saying all of that is I have really bad trauma when it comes to drama and “exposing” posts online and it’s a massive trigger for me and I just can’t mentally handle it.

Fast forward to the end of november, both me and Michael are in tough place trying to figure out our lives, being right out of high school and still lost. We had a yelling argument over the phone one day, and I don’t even remember what it was originally about tbh, but it ended up saying that he wasn’t happy in our relationship anymore, and then he ignored me for over 24 hours. I tried calling him a million times, but he eventually just sent me a text saying that he wants to break up and he doesn’t want to hear my voice or see me in person, he just wants to not be together anymore. I, of course, was having a full on meltdown and trying to tell him that he can’t just leave me like this and I can’t live without him. In retrospect, I know those are really bad things to say and I shouldn’t say things like that, but it’s how I felt at the time.

That night, I almost killed myself and I was IVC’d (involuntary custody) to the mental hospital for over a week. I tried calling Michael several times to reconcile and get him back, but I was unsuccessful. And, I know reading this it probably sounds like bullshit and like Im looking for pity, but Im being honest. Shortly after I got out of the hospital, I spent my 19th birthday alone, and then my dog unexpectedly died of kidney failure. My dad lost his job because his company let a bunch of people go, and we went into a lot of debt between my hospital bills and my dog’s hospital bills. My parents almost separated, which was a huge shock because they’ve been together for MANY years and they rarely fight, but everything took a toll on them. Luckily, their in counseling now and everything is good, my dad is still interviewing at places. So, even though I haven’t emotionally been in the best state these past few months, I’ve matured a lot and I think I’m a much better person than I was before because I’ve been trying to work on my mental health more.

The day I got out of the hospital, I turned on my phone to an instagram dm from Emily. It was actually something nice, along the lines of “I hope you’re doing alright, feel free to reach out if you want to talk or clear the air”. There was no public indication that we had broken up yet, so I knew that he had contacted her right after he had broken up with me. I didn’t want to be rude to her, but I also didn’t want to immediately act like her best friend because I rightfully wasn’t sure if I could trust her. I thanked her for her kind words and taking the time to reach out with me, and I asked about her contact with Michael if she didn’t mind sharing. She ignored the message, but I still followed her and viewed her stories and stuff because I didn’t want to seem rude if she had just simply not seen the message or something. and a couple weeks later she makes a post saying (i’m gonna change the words slightly for privacy reasons, but this is like how she typed it)

“i’m not gonna follow/write u back anyway, no fake b words 🤡 i will not lock up my friends crazy ex gf ✍🏻📝”

Followed with…

“you’re clearly a fan of me, babe !! you know it &lt;3 keep stalking me, i’m in your head rent free girl ;) &lt;333”

And the posts received nothing but support. Another thing to note is that one of her best friends was also friends with Michael, and they unfollowed each other when all of the shit happened with Emily, but re-followed each other shortly after the breakup. So they probably also started talking again. I’ll call them Jessie. A few days after those posts, on Michael’s birthday, Jessie makes a post saying like “i found out a lot of shit today, and i’m not dumb enough to forget about it”.

Now, both Emily and Jessie are the type of people who post all of their drama on their “spam” accounts which are still basically public accounts with hundreds of followers, even small things. Me and Michael have been extremely close since we were 14, we have an infinite amount of shit on each other. Like edgy fucked up stuff we said freshman year, etc. And I’m just terrified that they’re going to take whatever Michael has said to them and label me as toxic, manipulative, and even emotionally abusive. And she even vaguely threatened to put me in jail. I know I’m not those things, but I also don’t know what Michael has said to them and how much they might blow it up since they both hate me. And even though they’re from a different school, they still know a lot of the same people.

What makes this more terrifying is that I have a decent number of followers on social media (about 25k), so I really would have a lot to lose from something like this happening and I feel like it makes it more dangerous. I’ve been absent from my account for the past 2.5 months since everything happened, and I want to come back so I can communicate with people and do what I like again, but I’m scared that they’ll come after me the moment I do.

I wrote out a whole message to send to Michael addressing all of this and say how I just want to be friendly and keep the peace and not continue to have a feud, because it’s better for both of us to just improve ourselves independently. But I don’t know if he would react well to it or if he would screenshot it and send it to Emily, who would cause more public drama.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve barely been able to get out of bed or take care of myself at all. I’m not healthy. I feel disgusting. I know I sound like a dumb teenage girl complaining about drama. But I can’t express how scary and potentially harmful this is to me. I don’t want to be labeled as a manipulator or abuser, but I know it’s something that these people would do. It would be one thing if I was just accused of it, but I feel like I’m in a weird spot where I’m just anticipating it happening. And I can’t focus on anything, not even enough to take a shower or apply for a job. And before anyone says it, no “turning off the phone” isn’t an option, because I still know it’s potentially happening and I have to watch out for my safety. I’m sorry if I sound stupid, I’m just scared. I feel like I can’t do anything anymore. My boyfriend is gone. My dog is gone. Everything is gone and I still have this fear and guilt lingering over me.

TLDR; I said really mean things about someone out of anger and now I think she knows and might publicly attack me",lonely,I ruined my fucking life,2022-02-22 13:03:52

1033,billy_ruben897,1645495160,1,"I'm a 36M and, growing up, I always avoided other men. I was either bullied by other guys in school or I had to experience the men in my family with their attitude of ""man up"", be stoic mentality. I ended up just feeling more comfortable around women. I always spent time with my mom and, to this day, my only friends are women (even though I only have one). 

But, now that I'm older, I find it harder to connect with people at all. I just don't get most guys, even though I am one and consider myself reasonably masculine or whatever. Women tend to think I want more than friendship at this age too. Aside from that, I have really odd interests and find it hard to talk casually about anything. I also deal with severe mental illness and I can't work or drive because of it, so I can't exactly go out and meet people and nobody want to be burdened by their friend. 

I am in a relationship, but I still feel lonely because she's not physically or verbally affectionate. I know she loves me, but I'm so touch starved that it hurts. We also don't have a ton in common, but it's not really a bad relationship I guess. I'm more afraid of being alone forever though. 

So how can I make friends? And not just acquaintances. I have plenty of those in games that I play online. I really crave a deep, meaningful friendship with someone I really connect with.

Tried reaching old friends but it was completly one sided, tried reaching people my age that have simillar intrests, one sided, ghosted many times. Got tinder. Mostly I did not recieve any replies even though I always tried to be more creative than i simple hi. With ones that replied I managed to have a quick convo and then all of them suddenly ghosted me in the middle of conversation idk even. At one point I got so fucking paranoid, like why It just always stop. In the middle of normal talk. I feel cursed even though I dont belive stuff like that.

Instead I get to watch all these people and be reminded of all the things I’ve missed out on and will probably never get to experience. Even if I started doing everything I could to meet people and make friends right now (which I have been doing for the past few months), it would probably take more time than is left in the semester to actually make any real connections, and it wouldn’t make up for all the time and experiences I’ve missed out on. 

After I graduate it will be even harder to make any friends because I won’t be constantly surrounded by people my age, not that it’s helping right now anyway. College is the one time where almost everyone is old enough to have the freedom to do crazy fun stuff whenever they want, but young enough to not have too many responsibilities or burdens holding them back. 

Anywhere I go are people sitting with their friends, talking about their weekends and all the fun stuff they did, making plans for this week, this weekend, spring break, summer vacation, even after they graduate. I have no plans. I have no friends, no activities, nothing to look forward to, and very little to look back on and be grateful for.",lonely,Today was prospective student day at my college,2022-02-22 10:00:38

I enjoyed being around people, socializing, and, as my grandma used to say, never meeting a stranger. I liked it so much that I embarked on a career as a cosmetologist and eventually owned my own salon. Friends and family alike knew my door was always open if they felt like visiting, no call ahead needed. Parties, cookouts, my childrens' sleepovers, and the holidays were my joy. Then in a span of 6 months between 2017 and 2018, my father was diagnosed and succumbed to cancer, my oldest child attempted suicide twice and spent the better part of 3 months in 3 different facilities for treatment, my business partner suffered a stroke, ending her career behind the chair, and I ended up having to close the salon. Then 3 weeks to the day after my dad passed, I had to undergo a complete hysterectomy due to an aggressively growing tumor in my uterus. The loss of my ovaries sent me into immediate menopause. There were other situations and upheavals in there as well, but those were the major stressors. Slowly I lost myself along the way. My marriage wasn't strong enough to withstand all of this, instead of helping me find my way, he became petulant and bitter because my attention was no longer focused so strongly on him. Looking at it now, I'm not even angry anymore, I'm just glad I got to see that he was not someone I can depend on for the long haul. 

And now it's 2022, my children have spread their wings and are no longer living at home. I live on the opposite side of the house from my now ex-husband, and all except 2 of the friends and the majority of our families have moved on to the next happy hostesses. There hasn't been a holiday celebration in my home in 3 years. What has been most surprising to me though is that I no longer care. I have grown to prefer being alone to the extent that after a short amount of time in the company of others I get antsy and start looking for an excuse to get back to my space. I go to visit my children in their homes, go out to eat, go shopping, and even visited friends out of town, I'm not agoraphobic, I simply don't have the desire to be in anyone's company for an extended length of time.

In the years following this experience, my view of the world got really dark. It was hard to see anything beyond tomorrow. I wasn't productive, and tried my best to not think about life. I was suicidal, without really acknowledging it.

Something tragic happened recently, and all of my family was upset and crying. It hit me after some thought. I can't feel it, the sadness, loss, I feel nothing. Nothing except for anger. I feel like who I show is how I think the world wants to see.

1084,Low-Ad-3912,1645478059,1,"I would say I have been blessed with my parents as they have never done anything wrong intentionally. Im going to visit my parents in april, im already crying thinking about it. I feel bad for feeling lonely in such a warming home, but I just cant connect with them properly. It may because they did neglect me a little bit I would dare to say for instance they didnt care when my grades were very bad, I never liked physical touch but especially my dad would get mad for me not wanting to hug him (I think he got hurt) (Note: I used neglect since I dont know any less ""dramatic"" words in english) But that is nothing compared to what others have experienced, and I dont have any rights to complain about my upbringing. In addion, I spend most of my days in middle school on the internet not being with friends, not haning out with anyone. And in 9th grade, I went to a therapist since I stopped talking for a year, but I dont remember why since I have blocked it out from my memory.  But in high school I was more social when I were in shcool, but not on my freetime. On the internet, I watched a lot of gore and different skin diseases. I still find it facinating, but I dont watch it anymore. 

I have two sisters who are very close, and I never felt like I got the same attention as my sisters got, but they were more ""active"" than I were in my childhood. Though I dont think I would like my sisters people if they werent my sisters, if that makes sense. All of my family members are very sensitive, I am too but I can control my feelings better. 

I remember my parents calling about regarding the declining health of my grandparents, but for some reason I didnt feel anything, not a single emotion. Even though I would say Im a sensitive person, this is a mystery to me.  But I like helping people. 

Notably, I find it difficult to connect to other people in daily life as well. All my relationship are on a superficial level I would say. When I talk to people, it feels like it is this glass infront of me. I can still ""experience"" other people, but Im always on the other side of the glass. I feel like im looking at them from a different room, not being able to come in to their room, if that makes sense. 

Im in first year of college, and I have never been more social than before. This is my first year of hanging out with friends in my freetime on an almost weekly basis. So you could also say that im still learning how to connect with other people, as im not used to it.  (Since I have spent a lot of time alone). For reference, Im 20 years old male in college. 

Im sure im not alone feeling this, so it would be nice to hear how you cope with it. I have it fine most of the time, but when I reflect on how to see other people I get sad and start crying as am now.

1090,DGW7601,1645474827,1,"This is my first post after a long time lurking - so that's my excuse for any poor grammar/spelling, I haven't done much writing recently.

I am 21/M, I've never had a significant other or been anywhere remotly close to it. I attribute this to my severe social anxiety and low self esteem. For the past 2 years or so, I have been kind of reluctantly resigned to the idea that I will never have anyone, because it just feels so unnattainable for someone like me.

I have a female friend who I first met at an old job back in December 2019. She is quite a bit older than me, however whilst working together we found that we got along really well and had a lot in common and I had an easier time interacting with her than with just about anyone else I knew. Naturally I grew attracted to her and started fantasizing about her as a romantic partner because I am lonely and crave attention and affection.

Last November, me and her hung out at her house for a few hours and had a long, intimate conversation. It was the closest I've ever felt to someone else. It seemed to me that night that she provided the kind of connection that I long for.

I didn't work up the nerve that night to express my interest to her, however I felt I may be getting close to it. A few weeks later I contacted her again asking if she'd like to meet up and talk and... she politely declined. Not a big deal. I asked her again about a week later and again she politely declined.

I decided after that that she might need some space, so I waited a few weeks before reaching out again asking if she'd like to meet up and talk and she left me on read.

At this point I was already feeling pretty shitty, however I held out some hope that perhaps she was just overwhelmed with work (she works a lot of hours) and didn't have time or energy to devote to socializing.

Unfortunately, last night I was walking home from work and I saw her walking about a block ahead of me. We made eye contact, and as soon as we did she turned and crossed the street. The second she saw me she ran the other way.

I just don't understand what happened between November and now that prompted her to avoid me this way. It is upsetting because with her I felt such a connection, and yet apparently the feeling isn't mutual.

I respect her right to associate with whoever she wants, but I feel like it would just be polite to at least tell me what's wrong rather than just start avoiding me. Last time we talked I discussed how I've had ""friends"" just ditch me for no apparent reason and it hurt really bad, so I would think she'd know how much it hurts me when she just avoids me with no explanation.

Part of me is tempted to just say fuck it, I don't want to associate with someone who acts this way towards me, but I have literally no one else in my life, she was the only person I felt any kind of strong connection with, so I'm just not sure what to do. Such is my life. Perhaps I should just re resign myself to the idea of never having anyone.

1119,Crepedeole,1645461554,1,"

I’m not a pastors kid. I’m the pastors one and only grandkid. I think something feels wrong whenever I step into that church. Like I literally feel like shit. I’ve been in that church ever since birth and lately I’ve been going to a different church during pandemic.

It’s so lonely in that church. No one in my age with all the adults 30+. All the kids of those people are now having their own lives except ME. I hate it. It’s like I have to set the standard of a model kid in that church.

I hate how I’m excluded just because I’m related to the pastor so I’m treated as “special”. Meaning that I’m almost always called out to do the prayers or do a role but do not let other kids in church do it. No wonder, these kids and young adults are leaving the church.

Today I had to drive my grandpa to church today since my mom had to work. There was no choice so I had to do it. And then the church members praise me for helping my grandpa out like “NO I didn’t do that from my heart!” They act as if I was willing to be his caregiver but NO!

I had to be a caregiver without choice since I was in high school. I had to give him shots and bring him to dialysis from time to time. And the church members with their big ass families are like “Wow, I’m so proud of you for being a good caregiver.”

I want to respond to them and say “You want to help me here?? We can switch places” /s

I’m so tired and exhausted. I want to break free from this model/ideal child. I want to be nice with a kind heart. But I feel like I made so much sacrifices in my life for my age already. I’ve been used as a doormat so many times. I get too shy and nervous to speak out my thoughts It feels strange to feel like this as if I’m abnormal or something.

It's been so long since I've hung out with anyone. But then when the restrictions were lifted and I did go to school... it was even worse!! I felt even more left out and wanted to hide in a corner.

When things get like this I begin to think what's the point in it all. The only thing that kept me going is my old friend group, but we've started to lose connection. All I can fantasize is about suicide but I know I'm too much of a coward to even pull that off.

A friend isn't a person that just talks to you for a few minutes every couple of days, or only during a group project. i just don't feel anything that's personal coming from anyone. It's strictly business; and i only talk to the people at school just because they happen to be in the same school as me.

I have become introverted throughout the years. Stuff I would do a few years ago like attending hangouts or any social event felt effortless, but now i stress over them till it's over. I used to do reading, drawing and interact with my introverted side as well, but nowadays that's my whole personality. I am scared of working with others, I would rather walk in my lonely shell and go through the motions, craving any sort of emotional connection but be too scared to find any. 

I am going to college in a year (grade skipper) and this problem will be even worse. There would be thousands of people in college, and to keep track or to socialise with anyone there would be a pain.

1129,Jibu_LaLaRoo,1645457507,1,"Yesterday I really needed to cry because work was stressing me out making me question why did I fucking bother coming to this field.

Come lunchtime I smashed a whole pepperoni pizza with garlic butter just to quell any emotion I had. I wish I had a more secluded of a place to have eaten my meal because I would’ve been crying my eyes out thinking about how lonely I am. Nobody to come home to. Nobody to make this worth it. Living for myself has never been an option.

It frustrates me even to see people in my life get along in life with nothing but sheer luck and attitude when they are perhaps one of the most insufferable people to talk to and how can they be the person to always piss off someone yet somehow come out on top?

“The grass is always greener they say.”

Look, fuck you. I haven’t had someone kiss, hug, or hold me or me hold someone in years. I want a reason to live. I don’t have a purpose and I certainly am not living for myself. My ambition is squat. I want to live FOR someone. Through them. I want to support them. I want to be there. I want affection. I want to feel like belong. 

I want to feel like I actually was made properly for this world. Im nobody’s option. 

They say nobody wants to be around someone who is depressed all the time. I crack jokes. I genuinely enjoy my time and myself. I do feel a sense of hating myself but that only stems from the fact that for as long as I’ve lived nobody has ever loved me. Loved on me. Held me. I want some kind of affection. 

I’m so alone it hurts. 

I’m so scared of even trying dating again for a multitude of reasons. 

I always feel like I’ll just be one of the many people cheated on. Thinking about of all the possible reasons someone would probably cheat on me for. 

Maybe I’m boring. Maybe I’m annoying because I talk too much. Maybe I’m too forgetful. Maybe I’ll do something I don’t realize is an issue until it’s brought up. 

I feel so dejected by life and by women. I just want to fill this void that feels like a black hole gradually eating me from the inside out at times telling me to just end it all because you are not worth a damn. The proof being nobody acknowledges me. I’m just a background character despite how goofy I try to be just to get people to laugh. 

Not like being with someone would solve all my problems. It would just give me something other than myself to live for. Because doing what I do is not worth it. It’s a meaningless existence.

Relationships have their issues. They take work. It isn’t a fantasy. I know all of this. I want to come home to something to make life seem worth it. There is nothing for me and I want it so much so bad. I’m willing to put myself last and compromise so much even though I’m that’s not healthy because I don’t feel like even if I did find any modicum of love that I will question if I even deserve it.",lonely,Nothing to come home to,2022-02-22 02:31:47

In other words, fueling their ego through a cheap and easy method, more instant gratification. Whenever they are confronted with the way they live, they will react with hostility and denial. 
Something interesting I have noticed is that virtues are meant to both make life better for those in your surroundings and for yourself however what value do virtues have when rarely anyone cares to develop and preserve them? If you are the only one in your community who does, rarely anyone, most likely no one at all will care to listen or follow your example. Nobody cares. I think people's nature is corruptible and shallow enough to make even virtues lose their value. What value do virtues have if they cant change others for the better and only benefit me?

1152,Solipsist_Unhinged,1645437134,1,"We broke up around 8 months ago I think - my life has kinda fallen apart so I don’t keep track of time too well anymore. 

I’ve had flings and am even in a “relationship” right now, but it’s more of a ‘we’re both lonely’  thing than a grand, life altering romance. I can’t really talk to her about anything because it seems like she fundamentally does not understand me as a person, though obviously I wish that were not so. I wish I could connect with her in a meaningful way, but everytime I try opening up it doesn’t work. I make attempts to talk about music/art/literature with her but we intrinsically do not connect in any way in those subjects and I’m not sure we ever will. I feel very horrible about it. 

I very often catch myself thinking of my ex-girlfriend and how we used to discuss music. How I could show her something and she’d have something to say or show me in return. How she’d hold me, or how I’d put my head in her lap and look up at her. Things like that… don’t happen to me anymore; even if they did it wouldn’t feel the same. When you’re truly in love with someone there’s this insane spark that goes through you during those moments. I can’t even begin to describe it, but those who know will understand what I’m saying and how clear it is when you don’t have that connection with someone else. 

I have these moments where I think I’m okay and over her, but I know I’m not. It always comes back. There’s this ache in my head and heart that makes me want to try talking to her again, but I know that’s a horrible idea. In my worst moments I imagine us reconnecting and talking once more, maybe even falling in love again. It’s probably some equivalent to self harm. 

I’ve really fucked my life up in many ways: socially, financially, romantically. I know I’m wholly representative of the dregs of humanity at this point. I am some type of scum to many people in many different ways. I wish I could have done so much differently… and I wish whatever war my own brain is waging on me would stop.",lonely,I miss my ex-girlfriend to the extent that it physically hurts.,2022-02-21 20:52:14

Considering I’ve been alone for so long it’s very hard for me to talk to anyone or open up. I feel like I want someone in my life but at the same time I want to be left alone. I’m fully content at the moment in being alone and working my day to day job but I still feel very lonely not talking to anyone besides my mother that I live with.

1162,SweetSunshine53,1645433339,1,"I wish more people would believe in forgiveness. I have lost almost everyone after just messing up one time but I always forgived and moved on with them without remembering how much they hurted me... If I'm being honest then they too have said things in anger but I knew they didn't meant it and so I forgived them but if I say anything in anger, they're done with me ( I just said ""I hate you"" and ""how can you backstab me?"" and it was in anger, I didn't meant it ).... And after that they said ""I forgive you"" and I also said ""I forgived you"" and after that they behaved like I don't matter anymore... I had to ask for their attention everytime and after that they would act nice and will text as dry as they could.... It's like now I'm just a valueless person to them, If I text they wouldn't talk to me even online and will answer me at the end of the day like I'm a garbage waiting to get rid of at the end of the day. 
Days passed, Months passed and even a year passed, they didn't even wished me on my Birthday... But when their birthday came, I wished them best wishes no matter what because I cared, I'm a person who like to be in loyal friendship. I'm not a fair weather friend to come and go around. I admit I'm kinda possesive and care a lot, I don't know if it's my best quality or worst quality. It's just me who makes efforts and there is no effort on the other side.
A day before yesterday I asked the one I considered friend for so many years that why are you treating me like this? What wrong I have done? I'm sorry for anything that may have hurted you... ( Before that I told her that why don't you talk to me and as usual instead of fixing it, first she wanted to prove that she is always right even after admitting she's wrong )
About the above message, you know what she said?
She told me that ""Why would I care for a person who once said that 'I hate you' and 'you're a backstabber'?... Why would I care for a person who hates me?....
I didn't know people hold grudges even after saying ""I forgive you"", While I never did that. 

I asked her ""Does my presence matter to you?"" And she said ""If you wanna leave, it's okay and if you wanna stay it's okay""... In other words she said ""I don't care"" right?

This types of things just keeps happening with me again and again... It's like I'm stuck in a loop where people leave me for just one mistake even after forgiving me... What's the point of forgiveness if you just wanna fake it and won't even believe in it? What's the point if you're still holding grudges in your heart and to yourself without that person's knowledge? What's the point of forgiveness if you just wanna keep judging others from the grudges that you keep hidden inside your chest?

I currently have no friends... Just people who would do the formality of speaking if I demand their attention... 
If I have to ask for their attention again and again without getting anything in return then it's just like acting nice to stranger.

A couple of years ago, I met someone. At the time, we weren't the greatest of friends, but that slowly changed in recent years. She always made me laugh and make my day. Even if it was a shit one. She seemed to shine every day. We talked every day, even on snap. There were days when we just talked on the phone for hours. At the time, the doubt had already crept in. ""Why was she, my friend?""I don't provide anything in the friendship."" Or ""does she pity me for being alone all the time?"" Almost every time I was with her, I had those thoughts. Eventually, I thought maybe I should ""free her,"" but I never could muster the strength. Then, she changed schools. I thought she would just drop me, finally able to leave me behind. To my surprise, she didn't. Why? Again, I never added to the friendship. It's just my usual quiet self. We kept talking but slowly drifted. We still talk, but not like we used to. Now I miss her. I've never felt this way; I've never wanted to see someone again like this. But I don't like her like that, do I? To this day, I still don't know. Am I in love? Or just in denial? Is this loneliness? Wanting someone who you can't have? Not being with them?

Being ugly isn't just getting no compliments. It's people being cruel to you in ways that make you feel isolated. Making sure you always know you're not good enough to talk to them. It's your siblings &amp; parents pointing out your every flaw so it's cemented in your brain that you must change who you are.  That feeling of needing to change never goes away.

I genuinely loved them both, to the point where I'd willingly give my life for either of them. I am not exaggerating, they were my world, and to lose both of them, for no reason other than they genuinely could not be around me anymore, is the greatest pain I've ever felt. I would do anything to have them back. Do anything to prove how much they meant to me. I don't care about romance or anything else, I just want my friends back in my life.

Currently working part-time online from home. I'm looking for people who resonate with me. I like to be cautious with down-to-earth people. Once we really get to know each other, I'm open to online relationships and even meet in real life.

I like traveling, camping, swimming. I have many hobbies, so I only gave a few.

I apologize for possible English grammar mistakes as it is not my primary language

I hope you are a mature and stable person. To be honest, I don't like people younger than me and don't want to waste each other's time. I never ask for too much from this special person. All I'm after is a kind, gentle, kind person.

A decent person, with the same understanding and caring, can debate civilly and politely, respect each other, and compromise equally.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not bothered by race, religion, background, weight, height, etc.

I don't know where to start doing these things. I do think the connection should be established first. The only way is through frank dialogue between the two parties. Maybe it turned into something more, or maybe it turned into a beautiful friendship

I don't know anyone in the town I live in and they say you're supposed to just ""put yourself out there"" but this is something I literally can't do. Even if it weren't socially unacceptable to try to make friends as an adult, people are put off by my muted and awkward demeanor. They see someone sitting alone who can barely form coherent sentences if addressed and think there's a good reason that I'm alone. My interests are extremely niche and I do not fit in anywhere I go. I'm not allowed to express these thoughts to anyone I know, least of all the ones who insist that men should be free to express their emotions, who stopped talking to me after I expressed too many of the wrong emotions.

It's been 6 years since I've been touched by a woman in a romantic context. I've never had sex. I would also not be accepted if I tried to enter the """"""""""""dating scene."""""""""""" I'm not the kind who would even want to kiss on a first date, much less have sex. I'd be seen as boring and uninteresting because I want to know a woman before I get physically intimate, and the number of people (man or woman) who share this outlook now is extremely low. Even if I were to try and manage to get a woman's attention for more than a couple seconds, I would know she is probably talking to several other guys, with whom I am competing in real time. The idea that anyone would \*want\* to talk to several prospective romantic partners at once is absolutely foreign to me, but it is the norm, and thinking this way makes me weird and offputting. I've tried several online dating apps several times and gotten exactly one match in about four years. I am unremarkable and vaguely repugnant.

I'm also incapable of meeting women for the aforementioned ""can't talk"" reasons. I live in a duplex and my neighbor is an attractive woman. I thought I'd try talking to her, as it would allow me to be a good neighbor and practice getting over my fear of talking to women. I mustered the courage to say hi to her in passing exactly once and I was shaking for 10 minutes afterward. I recently tried saying hi to her again after a series of isolated awkward nonverbal pseudo-interactions, and she looked at me and ignored me.

And the way she still talks about him is unbelievable, he truly was the greatest person to ever life for her. Even though he was kind of goofy looking and she could have ""done better"" she still loved him for who he was. Why? Because he was a musician, he had that artist soul.

1253,chocaholicsanonymous,1645398049,1,"So my best friend I have discussed going on a trip to Disneyland Paris together for years. Every time I try to plan something and send prices and stuff for vacation packages (as cheap as I can find) her response has always been ‘ooh, that sounds good’ and she never gets back to me about it.

A few weeks ago, I had an idea to book a short trip to Disneyland straight after a concert to see a musician that we both mutually enjoy (I bought the tickets months ago) so I messaged her to ask her travel plans for the next few months in case she wanted to come with me. 

She responded, ‘oh, Im going to France in a couple of weeks’. So I kinda just left it at that, since I figured she wouldn’t want to go a second time in such a short space of time.

So today, I’m scrolling through my a Instagram feed, and the first thing that comes up are photos of her at Disneyland Paris, with a friend of mine who I was very close to in high school who now lives in France. I felt sick to my stomach.

Am I being unreasonable for being really upset and annoyed that she went there without telling me or asking if I wanted to come with her? She knows how much I wanted to go on a trip with her there and how close this friend is to me. Would it have been too much to ask me if I wanted to tag along, especially when I’ve tried to plan something for ages and she never took it seriously? It’s not the first time she’s left me out of stuff and I find it so upsetting. She’s pretty much the only friend I have around here and I just feel so alone.

Lately, I've felt empty. I never really had deep feelings. I'm quite antisocial, yet I do my best to keep others smiling. I do my best for others, yet it doesn't change anything. I feel burdened by my life and feel stuck. 
Back to feeling empty, I recently have been feeling emotions like never before, and it, well, hurts inside. My heart thumps harder when feeling this way. I have no one to connect to or talk to. That's probably  my part, though I don't show my feelings because guys aren't supposed to. And I don't mind that; I hate showing my feelings because I feel vulnerable. But all the things that comfort me like music haven't helped fill this hole. There's things I want to do and say, but I can't. 

I just needed to get some of this nonsense off my chest.😅 Thank you for reading this. There's no need to comment or anything; I just needed to say something to someone or people, I guess.

I realised in the end but this was multiple groups of people who did this and now all my friends at uni never make the effort to text me or if I text them first they just don’t make the effort and will just stop talking to me. The thing is, is that I know it’s just me they don’t talk to, they don’t do the same thing to my best friend.

People touch their hair and talk about how hot they are, and no ones ever even so much as batted an eyelash at me. It makes me feel so lame and alone.

I just want to feel like I'm good enough but I know that won't ever happen. I envy attractive people so much because how easily they can get validation or kind words because of their genetics. I bet it feels great knowing you can be a complete ass and still get people liking you because you have a good face. Yet I try and be a good person and I get crapped on for it, there is no winning. I'll be 50 one day and completely alone and it scares me, nothing could like or love this face so I don't see the point to life anymore. What's worse is my brother's took all the good genes, they are out there with their families while I struggle. They have good faces so no-one makes fun of them but I still get made fun of at 23 for being born a freak.

They blame me for stuff that won't happen or stuff they think will happen out of nowhere. I put up with this and stopped talking if they ask anything about that kinda stuff, I just told myself ""yeah, hopefully I won't hurt them anymore after I get signed up for therapy and hopefully I won't do this anymore"" its gotten to a point where I came up with the frase ""way to fucking go Reaper"" for anything that I believe is my fault.

1282,chinanumba1throwaway,1645389911,1,"I always stayed away from instagram and other such websites because I have always had either no friends or very few friends, so I would've felt embarrassed to have almost no followers if I ever made an account. When I look at the profiles of people I used to go to school with, they all have a minimum of 150 followers and their photos always get at least 100 likes. I only have 1 friend who I speak to a few times a month, so if I ever made an account, I would literally have one follower, which would be embarrassing. Now that I don't have an account, people can't really tell how non-existent my social life is, but if I ever made one, it would be like an open confession of being a total loner. 

I never really wanted to get into social media before because as I said, I was ugly for the vast majority of my life. I believe that this was because my facial features are  unusually effeminate for a guy, but I still tried to present myself in a super manly way by having a short, masculine haircut, wearing overly manly clothes and trying to get buff at the gym. The end result just looked really awkward and I always wanted to puke every time I looked in the mirror. About two years ago I started experimenting with my style more and changing the way I present myself. Femboys became a popular fad at the time and it inspired me to try a more feminine look. I started wearing women's sweaters and skinny jeans, grew my hair out into a longer style, learned to style my hair with an iron, purposefully became even more skinny than I already was and stopped going to the gym, got really into skincare and got rid of my acne and even started using some foundation and BB-cream. After this change in style I looked like a completely different person and to my complete and utter disbelief, I all of a sudden really liked how I looked. I never thought I'd say this but bowadays I don't want to throw up when I look in the mirror anymore. People I used to know don't even recognize me anymore until I tell them my name.

Now that I no longer hate how I look, instagram actually seems quite fun. I just feel sad that I missed out on it while I still had the chance. High school was the time when people were getting to know each other but I fucked that up by never speaking to anyone because I was severely depressed throughout that entire time to the point where I was seriously considering ending it. I'm now 19 and everyone has already formed their social circles. Once everyone else already knows each other it's very hard to join a group and make friends. It hurts seeing everyone else have fun together when you know you'll never get to experience anything similar. It hurts seeing everyone else post cool pictures and have friends who like them, knowing you'll never get another chance to do it yourself. I just wish I could've been a part of it too. I sometimes spend up to 1.5 hours doing my hair and makeup in the morning only to never leave my room for  the entire day. What is the point of doing that when not a single soul even sees me? I feel like I just do it because being so ugly in the past made me obsessed with my looks and I'm afraid of going back to being ugly now. I apologize for sounding so superficial. I know looks don't matter nearly as much as personality and have nothing to do with a person's value. I don't judge other people by their looks. I'm just obsessed with my own looks because I've been very insecure about it for all my life.

The thought that the average person has such a vivid social life just totally baffles me. As someone who's almost always had no friends, I just can't comprehend how these people know so many people. I'd be able to understand it if they had like 50 followers at max but the average person seems to have 150-200. How can anyone even meet that many people let alone get to know them?  I just can't wrap my head around how different the life of the average person is compared to my life. I'm happy for them and I'm glad they don't have to deal with what I deal with but still... *how do they do it*????",lonely,Does anyone else feel bad because they missed out on social media like instagram and now it's too late to start because you have no friends and everyone else has already had time to form their social circles and build their accounts on these sites?,2022-02-21 07:45:11

How can you describe yourselves these positive traits when you have no one to..confirm that? I think people will suspect you don't have these qualities when you have a history of loneliness. “If you're all of these good qualities, where are your friends?” 


Or maybe I'm thinking this too deeply and it's just a mind trick for your brain to say nice things to it long enough you'll believe it.

1292,PlayfulBeyond9699,1645385153,1,"I made the mistake today of looking at an ex friends instagram. She was a horrible person, I hope she's gotten better but who knows. She dumped me for her new set of friends a few years back, made it very obvious and prior to that was racist to me. It stings because I still miss her, when you're as lonely as I have been and continue to be the few friends you do make you admire even when they've treated you like shit.

When I looked at her instagram I saw how she was in an amazing relationship, and was close friends with my old 'best' friend. They cut me out of the loop because of my poor mental health, but still remained best buds. I am bitter and furious about it. Why does she get access to such a good life while I have been working myself to the bone and got nothing to show for it. I want to say things will get better for me but it's been 6 solid years now of being alone, by myself day in day out and things haven't improved. I've done everything to try and form a connection with others nothing sticks.

Reflecting on a bigger scale, all the worst people from my school did the best in life. As is the case in life. No one wants to be around someone that even suffers slightly from mental health issues unless you keep it bottled up. Of course all the most horrid people prosper because they have some sort of privilege that helps them along the way whereas I have nothing.

Well what would you think if I say to you that everybody's thinking about suicide but people who are actually suicidal people are marginalized cuz everybody's afraid of them just because they are afraid of they own thoughts about that ?

From when I started university I began to lock myself up inside, become more antisocial and avoid people. Throughout the years I lost all my contacts I had and I've got left all alone. What comes to parents, they really struggle and don't know how to support me mentally, sometimes doing the opposite, but they really try to support me financially whilst living alone to get through university. My biggest problem I have now is creating new contacts and dating.   Somehow the state of being always alone really affected my communication abilities because of what I feel like I don't know how to talk to a person in order to make friends or to a girl to show interest. I really don't mind that much being alone, concentrating on work and projects I do but of course, I feel that I lack a close person. All of my motivation, sanity and well being mostly depends on me, what I keep to myself. I just feel that I am in need of love, affection, support and someone to talk out to. Various dating apps or subreddits from my own experience are kind of disappointing as it feels like people are just seeking attention there and can't care much about the conversation they're having with the person. Even though I still have some kind of hope that somewhere I would find a similar person as I'm sure that I am not the only person who's having this kind of struggle. I don't have anything bad with physical appearance, mostly I gues I lack the communication skills I used to have.

I don't know how to describe the sense of my post/vent. I believe it's a cry for help directed a person of similar struggles to reach out.

 1. I have no friends really. I was best friends with 2 sisters and our friendship ended a year ago because of petty stuff, and it ended pretty badly. They were really my only close friends.        

2. I’m 24 and never been in a relationship. Dating had never been easy or casual for me. I didn’t go on my first date until I was 21 and that was with the person that gave me my first kiss. He ended up ghosting me. I was recently talking to this guy for a few weeks and he was courting me properly. We really liked each other and I was starting to think he’d soon be my boyfriend. Then yesterday he told me he’s legally married bc he had to marry for immigration papers. He says that he and the girl barely talk and that they don’t even like each other. But I’m honestly not comfortable dating someone who is legally married regardless of the nature of the relationship.

3. My only friends are my Mom and cousins. I’m super grateful for them however they have their own friends and significant others . 
4. I’m jealous of my cousins. They’ve been dating since high school. If they breakup with their boyfriends, I guarantee not even a year later they already had a new one. And they also have friends. They have social lives. 
 I’m ambitious. I’m studying to get into law school, and trying to build my portfolio because I want to be a model. But that’s all I look forward too. But those things are materialistic to me. I want to be loved romantically and have girls to hang with 😔. That would truly make me happy.

Also I’m on Bumble BFF and have met with one girl so far.

TLDR; guy often gets ghosted and doesn’t know why. Just wants someone to talk to. 

I was recently talking to this girl who seemed to have shared a mutual crush. We were on FaceTime the other night and we both pretty nervous since it was our first FaceTime call but I made her laugh a lot and we flirted a bunch too. It’s been 2 days since it happened and I’m very confused but not dwelling on it because after all she is still a stranger. She is usually late on texting but I cant help to think if it was because of me even when I know it never is. I’m a really cool, kind and funny person. Every person I talk to or try to get to know to build a friendship or have a casual type of relationship, I’m always getting ghosted. I’ve gotten used to it now but why does it happen so often? I do get nervous and shy and not speak a lot but texting seems better for me to really share who I am rather than on FaceTime because idk I just get nervous with it and I do try super hard to engage in conversation. I’m also the type of person to wish you a good day if we were talking. Idk I guess this is just me venting, but I would also like to meet someone or a woman that I can talk to everyday and see where it goes. My birthday is in May and being able to have more than my close circle of friends to talk to or hang out with would be super nice.

1318,chumphr415,1645371712,1,"Hey,

This is out of character for me to make a posting about my personal life, but lately I feel like I need to share. Lately I’ve been dealing with serious issues with loneliness and more specifically a lack of intimacy/sexual frustration. This is a long one so get comfy. 

I’m a 28 year old guy, and I’m from the US but I’ve been living in France for the past 7 months. For the last two weeks, I’ve been on vacation and I’ve spent most of that time alone. I feel like I’ve almost been too introverted and I’ve come to realize how completely isolated I feel and how I lack any meaningful connections here, or even more generally, I lack any real excitement/sense of adventure in my life. It’s like as soon as I don’t have to work, and I’m left on my own, I’m reminded how empty my personal and romantic life are. 

I should say I’m not just some lonely dude on Reddit with no hobbies. Music is a big part of lifestyle, and that takes a lot of my attention and focus. I write my own work, but I’m also a jazz musicien and I’m preparing to apply for a masters program, so it requires a lot of practicing. But when I was in college, I do feel like it became an escape of sorts. Most of my friends had graduated by my senior year, and my friend group was fairly small for a while, so I devoted so much time to practicing. I would often spend weekend nights practicing alone for hours straight. Sometimes I would spend an entire weekend in the practice room. I look back and I’m proud for how much I worked during that point of my life, but I also realize that I have a tendency to use work/productivity as an excuse to avoid being social, and at a certain point it becomes narcissistic. I don’t practice as hard now, but I’m more self aware of my tendency to focus too much on work/my own goals. 

It don’t feel like I have social anxiety (any more), since I’m usually a fairly relaxed person when talking to others, and I have several close, longterm friends back in the states. At the same time, I don’t usually go out of my way to meet new people. I’m fairly critical and have a big ego, so I like to keep my space and it does take me a while to warm up to others. I have a few friends here in France, but they are Spanish/Latina, and every time we hang out, I’m more and more aware how I’m obviously not from a Latin culture, and I don’t feel a genuine sense of connection with them. We get drinks together on the weekends, but because of the language barrier, and just differences in lifestyle, and I don’t feel like they really see me. 

What I’m most confused about is why my life always seems to be like this. I’m still relatively young, people tell me I’m good looking, I run often and I’m in good shape, I’m passionate about music and art and I can play several instruments, and in general I feel like my life has been interesting. But I’ve lived in 5 different cities over my life, and I always feel like I’m repeating the same pattern: I move to new place, I feel this sense of enthusiasm towards life, the real life kicks in and I’m reminded how hard it is for me to meet people I like, and then I start spending more and more time by myself and I wonder why I always feel alone. 

I had several girlfriends when I was in high school, and I think I have an average sexual history, but I’ve always been a little shy around women. I’ve never had a serious, intimate relationship that’s been longterm, and even the short-term ones I’ve had recently have felt so completely unhealthy. This is one mystery in my life which I can never seem to figure out. I think I’m decent looking, I’m funny, and I have lived a lot of different places, but my parents and my friends always ask me why I’m not dating, and I can never exactly find an answer for them. In college, I would often hook-up with a girl once or twice, lose interest, and then stop seeing them. Someone times I just didn’t feel comfortable with a one night stand or I would just get shy and awkward, and I would reject hooking up when given the opportunity. I think I’ve always preferred sex to be with someone I feel an emotional attachement for, and even though I think I’m a sexual person, I used to be sort of a prude. 

As an adult, I’ve used apps like Tinder and Hinge which has been something close to a nightmare. Normally I meet girls I’m not remotely attracted to or find interesting, but sleep with them anyways just for the sake of having an adventure, until someone loses interest and the entire event feels cyclical and hollow. Or more often, I would go on one or two dates with a girl, then she would tell me she’s not interested. I’m not using dating apps currently, and in general I’ve realized how much I dislike meeting people in that way. 

And really in general, Romance feels like something that’s still a complete mystery for me, that I really don’t understand at all. Whenever I’ve with friends who have been in longterm relationships, I often wonder to myself how they do it, how they spend so much time together, since I can barely ever seem to make it to a 3rd date, let alone find someone I actually want to spend time with. And I’ve been single for so long, and I’m so used to spending time on my own, that imagining having someone else around for a long period of time feels incredibly strange for me. Whenever I watch a self-help video about something related to this, and they mention relationships with our « partner, » I feel so confused, since I can’t figure out how people even get to that point. 

I’ve read a lot by Jung, Ram Dass, The School of Life, Jordan Peterson, Attachement Styles, etc, you name it. I’ve always been looking for an answer the questions I have, but I don’t think any of that makes up for actually living in a relationship, with having a shared experience with someone else.

In general, I feel like I’ve become so cynical towards romance and relationships in general, since I never been able to find someone I genuinely would want to see again. Or in the cases I have met someone, they usually don’t share the same interest towards me. The girls that I have been with casually and short-term have always seemed insecure and boring, and the relationship always dissolves into something tedious, I feel like Romance is something I would like to experience, but I’m also so skeptical of, while at the same time, I have the same desire everyone else does: to be seen and to see someone else. The majority of the time though, I don’t feel like I know where to start. I’m comfortable being alone and I’m confident, but I feel like I’m always alone, and I don’t know how to balance that with space for another. 

I believe that the most important relationship you have is the one you have with yourself, and I think I’m an almost aggressively independent person, but at the same time, I feel like there’s a huge void within me because of a lack of intimacy, with lack of curiosity towards someone else, and even just a lack of pleasure. I feel weird telling people that I’m 28 and I’ve never had someone I would consider to be my « girlfriend » (at least in my adult life) and I can tell other people think it’s strange too.

I’m not exactly sure what I’m looking for by posting this, but I hope some of this made sense. If anyone has any advice/similar experience, I’m all ears. No platitudes please.",lonely,Loneliness/Intimacy,2022-02-21 02:41:52

In college, I would often hook-up with a girl once or twice, lose interest, and then stop seeing them. Someone times I just didn’t feel comfortable with a one night stand or I would just get shy and awkward, and I would reject hooking up when given the opportunity. I think I’ve always preferred sex to be with someone I feel an emotional attachement for, and even though I think I’m a sexual person, I used to be sort of a prude. 

As an adult, I’ve used apps like Tinder and Hinge which has been something close to a nightmare. Normally I meet girls I’m not remotely attracted to or find interesting, but sleep with them anyways just for the sake of having an adventure, until someone loses interest and the entire event feels cyclical and hollow. Or more often, I would go on one or two dates with a girl, then she would tell me she’s not interested. I’m not using dating apps currently, and in general I’ve realized how much I dislike meeting people in that way. 

And really in general, Romance feels like something that’s still a complete mystery for me, that I really don’t understand at all. Whenever I’ve with friends who have been in longterm relationships, I often wonder to myself how they do it, how they spend so much time together, since I can barely ever seem to make it to a 3rd date, let alone find someone I actually want to spend time with. And I’ve been single for so long, and I’m so used to spending time on my own, that imagining having someone else around for a long period of time feels incredibly strange for me. Whenever I watch a self-help video about something related to this, and they mention relationships with our « partner, » I feel so confused, since I can’t figure out how people even get to that point. 

I’ve read a lot by Jung, Ram Dass, The School of Life, Jordan Peterson, Attachement Styles, etc, you name it. I’ve always been looking for an answer the questions I have, but I don’t think any of that makes up for actually living in a relationship, with having a shared experience with someone else.

In general, I feel like I’ve become so cynical towards romance and relationships in general, since I never been able to find someone I genuinely would want to see again. Or in the cases I have met someone, they usually don’t share the same interest towards me. The girls that I have been with casually and short-term have always seemed insecure and boring, and the relationship always dissolves into something tedious, I feel like Romance is something I would like to experience, but I’m also so skeptical of, while at the same time, I have the same desire everyone else does: to be seen and to see someone else. The majority of the time though, I don’t feel like I know where to start. I’m comfortable being alone and I’m confident, but I feel like I’m always alone, and I don’t know how to balance that with space for another. 

I believe that the most important relationship you have is the one you have with yourself, and I think I’m an almost aggressively independent person, but at the same time, I feel like there’s a huge void within me because of a lack of intimacy, with lack of curiosity towards someone else, and even just a lack of pleasure. I feel weird telling people that I’m 28 and I’ve never had someone I would consider to be my « girlfriend » (at least in my adult life) and I can tell other people think it’s strange too.

I’m not exactly sure what I’m looking for by posting this, but I hope some of this made sense. If anyone has any advice/similar experience, I’m all ears. No platitudes please.",lonely,Loneliness/Intimacy,2022-02-21 02:07:56

I dropped out of my previous high school in the middle of my sophomore year and am about to graduate at a different fully virtual school in a couple months. Having no in-person interaction with anyone at my current school allows me to get away with being a social hermit. While I appreciated it in the beginning—and it may have been good for me initially, since my old school left me absolutely destroyed mentally and emotionally—I have been left with no one. I’ve tried to rekindle some relationships from the past, but nothing stuck. My one friend, who I consider the only best friend I ever had, moved away from me physically and emotionally, as she found a partner that ultimately left no room for me. I’ve tried to look outward for people; to go online and make some friendships there, but over the years I have developed a bunch of anxiety, intrusive thoughts, self doubt, etc. that it takes so much out of me to write something so simple in a public chat that I can’t make myself known again until a number of weeks.

1360,michaelk528,1645343584,1,"First post here. Hi yall.

Been going through a long depressive spell. Longest I’ve ever been through. But something new this time is the pervasive feeling of isolation.

I work ridiculously long hours. I’m awake before everyone at home, I get home when everyone’s asleep. I typically don’t have any social energy after a long day of work and my friends all have daytime jobs. So I end up being skipped over a lot.

I find it hard to establish and maintain new relationships right now. I’m as single as one can be because I simply cannot create spare time. I try, but it never goes anywhere because of this.

And this is how I feel completely isolated even among people. It’s like I walk this earth with a bubble around me. I can see others, and even interact with them. But I can’t get close to them. I’m stuck just watching, by myself.

I’m tired of it. Tired of slaving away at work but I can’t just stop it on a dime. I know there’s others in this same boat, and it eases my mind a little because I know there’s at least one person out there that understands.

I just want to reconnect. Live. And be happy. But I guess I can’t do any of those things right now. But oh how I long for them. 

How I wish to just walk this path with someone, just to quell the loneliness. To know another presence is actually alongside me. 

And I wish I could do the things that used to make me happy with the same passion and vigor as before. But the isolation saps my energy for any of it.

I’m a very lonely guy. I have no friends at all. I am trying to make friends however when I attempt to start a conversation, majority of the time I get left on “seen.” It is a pretty crappy feeling to feel that i’m not wanted, or that i’m not thought of. I am unsure if this is normal or if there is something I can do to not feel this way, or get people to engage with me first. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Family wise I only talk to my mother, brother and father. As well as my amazing girlfriend which I am beyond grateful to have. I cut the rest of my family members off. I don’t talk to them at all. My grandparents, mainly my grandmother, always puts me down. Has since early childhood. As a result I am suffering mentally from it. All the other family members just don’t give a single shit. My sister only wants to talk to me when she needs something. So now I never talk to her either. 

All I want is a big group of friends, big get togethers where we all have fun and enjoy each other's company, to have family members who actually give a shit and love me.

But nope. I’m alone all the time. No friends, barely any family and no one to hang out with at all. It's that one thing you want so bad that so many people have right now but no, you can't have it. What is the point in living when no one even cares about your existence. Unwanted by everyone. Always was and always will be.

1409,d-a-v-i-d-c,1645322370,1,"The title may seem kind of vague but what i mean is that if I stopped talking to people, they wouldn’t make an effort to still talk to me. Truly, I have one friend who I’m really comfortable around because she’s the only one who doesn’t pick on my insecurities as a ‘joke’. She’s truly the only real friend I have. I have other friends who are new who I feel sort of comfortable around but it’s still hard to feel like I can be myself. Everyone in my school goes to big events where they can meet up with friends but i’m too uncomfortable for those situations and others make fun of me for that but I can’t tell them that I have anxiety at places like that because it makes every social aspect seem forced. 
One thing no one knows about me is i’m bi (I think anyway). I feel like I can’t tell anyone but I don’t even have a reason not to. I can’t even tell my one close friend even though I know she’d never tell anyone. One of my newer friends would make jokes and say ‘love you’ and if someone said anything to me he’d say ‘leave my man alone’ or ‘leave my hubbie alone’ and now I’ve started to catch feelings for him. I don’t want to tell him cos i’m pretty sure he’s straight and if i tell him and he doesn’t feel the same i’ll lose him as a friend. 
I’ve got a history with minor mental health problems and I feel like they’re getting worse. 

I just wrote this to vent but any advice would be nice.",lonely,I feel like my whole social life is reliant on me.,2022-02-20 12:59:30
1410,user394616384153,1645322071,1,Hi so this is a throwaway account i created but i just needed some sort of motivation or positive outlook on stuff. So i (f17) have literally had 0 friends for a long while and have been lonely for years and have just lost hope and i watch everyone else post with their friends and stuff like that and i stay in my room all day everyday lmao. Like all throughout high school id hide in the bathroom during lunch and was alone 24/7. I just dont know what to do and i feel hopeless bc ive noticed everyone with close friends have known them for years since they were young and i feel like ive wasted my teenage years and i genuinely have no one. Ive tried so many times to make friends and it just feels like my fate is just to be lonely. Does it ever get better after high school?? I graduate in may and im just scared that college will be a similar experience and its so sad living like this and i just need to find a way to keep going but its hard when it feels like no one wants to know or be around you. Anyway this was long and i appreciate any feedback if you read this far :),lonely,Just need any kind of motivation or something idk,2022-02-20 12:54:31
1411,unobodie,1645321857,1,"probably, the first thing that pop on ur mind is ""wtf this gurl is deeply blue by a relationship of less than 2months"", i've heard that a hundred times... but, he's perfect. For me. Even if he and i know that isn't.

I joined on this new job as an illustrator, he, an animator, was my boss, 'cause when i get changed to design department, he stared to flirt with me, by a list on spotify haha, everybody told me ""that's foolish"", but i found it so cute haha. Soooo cute. then we stared to date, i have to say that i was in love with him, since 7months before. 

I don't know if he was a bad person - cause all my friends say that -. But he was always saying ""i'm not goint to date on you, we're not going 2be a pair"", etc. then i decided well, i pick and keep his crumbs, its enough for me. Then the day has come, he ask me to be his girlfriend, after a night of drunkness. We stared to date, and i was sooo happy, damn so happy, but then, my fucking disgusting lifetime depression comes and fucks everything to shit, i was so anxious to lose him. Literally, i was spying his social network to see his interaction with other woman, i was jealouse of his friends, i stopped to do my chores by staying with him and i have loved it, fuck fuck my eyes are on tears now, i miss him so much, sleep with him, touch and feel his warm. see his face on morning and his eyelashes and brows in that severe expression that shows frivolity...

well, i asked him, on a drunkness ""we still being a pair, right? and he said ""if u keep asking that, then no"", so i decided well, i have to effor to not give him a disgust 'cause he will get apart of me, and well, naturally, and obiously because i fuck every fucking good thing that happens me on life, i get him tired of me... he left me, cause he was afraid of a codependent relationship. 

i don't want anybody to read me, idk, just, say it, because everybody are tired of me being in a failed love, but it hurts, it burns. Being on the pillow and feel it cold, his hands over my shoulders on a hug, being with him doing nothing or hearing his awful laugh, snoring or farts hahaha. once we were trying, well, i was, trying to ennumerate the things that i love of him haha... i think that's all.",lonely,a two month relation shipt cracked my mind,2022-02-20 12:50:57
1412,PlayfulBeyond9699,1645321392,1,"I am being devoured by my loneliness. I have tried everything but no one seems to want me relationship wise, friendship wise. No one really wants to interact with me. I am so tired of the gaslighting I see and have experienced myself of not trying hard enough when I know I have tried. Even if I or others hadn't does that mean we deserve to be alone? There's plenty of horrible evil people who make no effort to keep their spouses or friends yet can with ease. 

I wake up alone, I spend all day anxious about one thing or another, I gorge on food or starve myself depending on how weak I feel, then I shift my focus to hobbies. Get bored, go to sleep. Repeat over and over again. After a while I'd just sleep for as long as possible to avoid dealing with the day because there's nothing for me in it. That doesn't help because then I face the night alone I can't escape it. 

I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like to have a loving family, a loving partner, loving friends. Someone that truly loves you as much as you love them. Never had it, I always loved more. I can't fucking take it anymore I am tired of being so lonely and in so much pain. 

I remember being on another subreddit and someone rather cruelly posted images of those that had committed suicide to deter suicidal people like me. It did nothing for me but make me feel nauseous for a little while. I felt like it was disrespectful to the deceased and just cruel to suicidal people who'll see it, plus I've reached the point of no return nothing will really stop me if I get a good chance to end my life.

1417,Human_Operation8589,1645319057,1,"Well to make I long story short I was talking to this girl for several weeks we both pretty much fell in love as it seemed but she moved a couple states away so we couldnt be actually together at the moment but we were fine woth that... We wanted to start a family right now even though we were apart and I was fine with that because she planned to move back in a few months... Well I knew she was extremely horny alot so I was fine if she went to find a fling once in awhile we both were ok to an open relationship to a point... Well yesterday she seemed off in the morning before she went to work amd when she messaged me she told me she took the day off because the job was stressful and she didnt feel good which I already knew, but she just seemed off in her replies and didnt message again until this morning... She was hesitant to say much but then she told me she went out and got drunk and went home with a guy which I was fine with but she kept saying she felt so bad because it wasnt me she was with and asked me how she could make up for it and all I said was I would like for us to do more sexy things over the phone which we have talked about alot but she was pretty shy on the phone she claimed... Well this girl woke up everyday and always sent me naked pics and vids playing in the shower every morning and was always initiating sexting everyday simce we could physically touch amd I thought we were happy as we could be for our situation... Well after I asked if we could do more on the phone she replied several minutes later saying that ahe hates sexting and would rather have hands on her body which i replied I know and we will be together soon.... I get busy with work for the day and checked in to see how her day was going and im blocked on snap so I txt her and no responce either... Now I know I shouldnt be broken up about it as much as I am but damn it hurts investing time like that to be ghosted again... I should have known better with her being way better looking than myself... Idk maybe it is better to be that asshole guy that just fucks and forgets and never worry about love again

1433,Schmile13,1645312744,1,"I thought I had experienced friendship when I was younger. They were supposed to be people you hung out with and did things together right? 

But I could never feel comfortable. I could never feel okay enough to be myself. I always felt this extreme pressure to make sure I ""entertain"" and care for them, I could never bother them with my dumb shit. I had to be there for them, because that's what a good friend does.

Of course it just led to me suffering burnout because it eventually became exhausting to have to take on that role all the time, there was never an opportunity for me to be myself. I ended up experiencing panic attacks, because people wanted to hang out with me, and I just wanted to get away, to recharge, to not have to feel that constant pressure and anxiety. 

But even when I isolated myself completely, and had literally nobody to talk with, I could still always feel that everburning desire for companionship, and the horrible dread of loneliness.

So during the lockdowns last year, when I realized that literally nothing in my life had changed at all with all the restrictions, I tried to reach out to people on friend-finding subs. To perhaps find someone I could talk to.

I stumbled upon this one post right here on r/lonely, which shocked me to my core. It was so extremely well written, it was so sensitive, and so open. They talked about how lonely they felt, how they just wanted to feel a connection with anyone, talk about whatever is on their mind, to show love and appreciation.

It felt like I was reading a post by a more eloquent and smarter version of myself. And talking even more with this person just kept on revealing more of their saintly understanding and compassion. I didn't know this persons name or gender. But their writing made me feel so fucking strongly. I literally fell in love with this person, just from their thoughts. As a presumed straight guy, I felt like the physical traits, had ceased to matter as much. I loved this person for their sensitivity and wisdom. I **needed** to be close to this amazing soul, no matter what.

Having shared hobbies and interests did not matter one bit to me, to me it felt a thousand times more important to know if they had a similar loving view on humanity and kindness.

After talking for days on end about tragedies and horrors that we had experienced and were experiencing, I asked what her name was. I revealed my name, and she admitted that she thought that I was woman as well, by my words and messages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having been so incredibly lonely for so long, my mind went into extreme overdrive. I apologized to her and admitted that I had never felt so connected to someone before, and that I was developing an extreme crush and infatuation with her. And she showed me nothing but acceptance and encouragement. She was happy that she could give me those feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologized for appearing obsessed or too intense, because I knew how I was going to act. And again she told me that I should never apologize for being myself, and that any amount of intensity had would never scare her off. She told me I could reply as many times in a row as I wanted, she would appreciate each and every thing I told her.

&amp;#x200B;

I was so completely fucking overwhelmed, by this brilliant and loving soul. She made me feel valued. She made me feel appreciated. She made me feel like a human being for the first time in my life. She taught me to love myself. To not suppress and hide myself. I felt more comfortable in her presence than I had ever done previously. Talking with her was my favourite thing to do in the whole world.

&amp;#x200B;

Any time she had replied, all my fears and anxieties were just swept away, I felt happy, I felt energetic. I wanted nothing more than to spend every waking moment with her. It was a completely new thing to me, I actually **gained** energy and strength by talking with her. That was when I realized what it really meant to have a friend. For the first time in my life I wasn't afraid of scaring someone away. I wasn't afraid of bothering her with ""meaningless drivel"". The fact that she accepted me so much, meant that I learned to accept **myself**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was a depressed sad sack barely capable of doing anything. But thinking about her, and how much I cared for and wanted to be there for her. It revitalized me. I suddenly had untold energy and determination and motivation. I wanted to live my life, for her sake. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the world around me changed. The sun started shining brighter, I could hear the birds chirping, I could literally appreciate flowers. I felt like I had to find beauty out in the world to share with her. I felt alive. I wanted to start decorating my apartment, because for so long, even since I was a small child, I had never cared for anything like that. I was fine with bare white walls. But something made me realize how empty it felt, how I wanted to take space and make it my own. She literally brought color into my life. 

Everything I ever struggled with for almost 30 years, was worth it, because I got to connect with the most beautiful soul ever in my eyes. And I can be glad that I feel so intensely, so overwhelmingly. Because it is the greatest feeling in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

This is only a small part of a long story, and it's already extremely long, but I just wanted to share my experiences, of what it has meant to me, to find a kindred soul. To be accepted. It surpassed my wildest dreams and expectations. And I'm so grateful that I never stopped trying to find her, even after decades of failures. She saved me from a life of nothingness. My hero and my idol.

The thing is, that I've noticed something has changed... 
While a few months ago I'll be looking for ways to make friends or to cope with my mental health problems, now, I just feel... empty. And most importantly, I can't tolerate the things that made me feel good anymore. This includes the fact that I have no interest in socialization, I just can't. All I want is to be alone. 
Right now, what only makes me feel a little bit better, is college. But I'm having problems too. Sometimes I can't concentrate and it frustrates me. Fortunately, my grades haven't decreased due to this... for now. But I don't really feel like if I were learning something. 

Why I'm talking about this? 

Because it makes me feel trapped. Only few things are worst than live in a third world country and suffer from mental health issues. I haven't looked for real help to be honest, cause I feel like it isn't going to do any difference.

I've been going through a breakup and it's hard. Hazards of life made it that my friends I trust just abandoned me. 

All my attempts of making new friends didn't work much. I met some people but they ended up sending no more messages (I tried making efforts but since it's just one way, I decided to give up).

I believe a relationship is two way , not just me.

And my ex didn't wanna be with me forever. He was toxic so though I'm still hurt and not over the breakup, I know it was the best decision for myself. I know he lost someone reliable ,worthy ,loving and caring. He didn't care enough about me so he abandoned me too

Yeah I went through a lot of abandoning. And it sucks. It's not like I didn't make any efforts

I've been trying to meet people. I tried app, even dating app. No more dating apps for now because I saw my ex and it broke my heart since I remember everything had ended between us.

I've tried activities but only elders and people with their own friends.

I even wonder if going alone in bars ,café, restaurant ,movies would be fine ? 

I'm a petite woman and I'm kinda scared to do those things alone. Movies and such why not ,it's during daytime. But going into bars could be delicate and risky ! I might try when I am more confident but right now ,I think I need to learn to do things by myself and trying being haply on my own !

I've been much sad ,depressed because I only had myself for so long . And trying everything to meet people who don't care about you in the end ,it hurts as hell.

Yeah I don't know what to do. But I just feel like going out of my comfort zone . Now I just need to be brave enough. I went to a coffee alone once , an afternoon, 2 years ago, and it sucks lol. I felt lonely and embarrassed 

But I wish I could meet people this way ! Encounter in streets sound so amazing , or during travels too.

I haven't done anything on this planet since my existence.  I'm immature for my age and dumb. One of my biggest insecurities is how dumb I am. I don't like talking to a lot of people because I sound dumb. I don't know anything and I'm terrible at everything. I'm not independent enough for my age and this concerns me. Time is going so fast that I can't keep up anymore. I am on the spectrum which makes socializing hard. I got my diagnosis at 15 and had a hard time accepting it. I wish I had a lot more energy than I currently have. I would also say I'm incredibly boring as a person. I have no humor I'm very serious by nature. I wish I could make more people laugh. English is also not my native language so I apologize in advance for my English. I was born to older parents and I am an only child. My cousins are like 16 years older than me so I couldn't connect with them either. Never met either of my grandad's. I'm too self-centered and I realized this.  I have always wanted a group of girlfriends and I know lots of females don't have a group of girlfriends but that would be my dream. I feel disgusting like I'm always dirty and fat. I have no romantic experience whatsoever. I know I should take responsibility for this and make a move I know. I have missed connections my whole life and felt lonely. I have never really hung out with friends. Got proper friends for the first time in high school but after school, they didn't want to hang out with me. I feel rejected and I have tried and tried to be active when it comes to making friends. People talk about hanging out with friends like it's just an everyday thing and for me, it's a huge privilege. Summer vacations were always the worst when I was younger. I saw a ""friend"" one time for 3 hours during a 2-month summer break. I know that these are first-world problems so I don't want to seem like I'm ungrateful. It's just frustrating feeling like you're never worth anyone's time. What do they have that I don't? I also want to feel wanted at some point. Not just people being disappointed when it's you. The disappointment on their face when they see it's you. You just feel like this fat disappointment.

Guys will usually complain about not finding a partner for a romantic relationship but the struggle we women face with our problem shouldn't be invalidated.

We women face the opposite problem, all guys wanting to date us. Every time I thought I made a male friend he ended up having a crush on me and confessing his love. It's so saddening to see guys ghosting you because apparently they feel too much pain being near you. It always makes me feel guilty (I know I shouldn't, it's not my fault), almost like you are denying them something by saying no even though you never flirted or shown any interest in them. It's so detrimental to a woman's career and personal growth to keep losing all your friends because they girlfriend-zone you.

This happened to me so many times. One of the worst cases was a guy friend I known since high school basically ghosting me because I didn't reciprocate the romantic feelings he developed for me. He knew very well my physical type, they type of men I like, yet he decided to ruin the friendship with his unrequited love. I wish it was just one case but this is the experiece of every woman my age I know. I'm not even attractive, I'm average at best yet this keep happening. Sometimes I wish I was an old wrinkly lady just to keep my male friends as I share so many hobbies with them and I like spending time with them

I wish guys just understood that women also experience loneliness, it's a different kind of loneliness but this doesn't make it less valid. We are all together in this so we shouldn't fight each other. What if the solution is just to befriend each other? I wish society gave more importance to platonic relationships, not all male to female interactions have to be romantic, it's a toxic expectation and men shoulnd't be shamed for valuing friendships over romance.",lonely,Why can't a woman have platonic male friends?,2022-02-20 06:21:23

I want nothing more than to share my life with another man and get married and be loyal to one person, but at the rate I'm going, i cant even get someone to watch a movie with me let alone anything further.   I recently lost my job working in a grocery store through a third party app due to covid, so the app says... Well now i cant get hired anywhere because i have an old dui on my record and i have an old conviction involving theft.  I mean NO ONE will hire me.  After the background check is run, the company usually just leaves it up to the background checking companies notification emails to take back the offer of employment.  So, im reduced to doing surveys online and allowing certain apps to have access to all of my personal and private data and also to watch everything that i do online on my phone in exchange for about 200$ a month in total, which pays my cable internet bill after whatever the emergency broadband govt program doesnt cover and my daily necessities for myself and my dog, which is my only friend, and i dont even think she is happy that i rescued her from the pound with how bored and miserable she acts all the time.  Im lucky i have HIV and get section 8 housing assistance from the federal government, otherwise i would just be another homeless statistic right now.  So my reason for going into all of this is to show you, the reader, that i have nothing to offer anyone, in a friendship or anything beyond that.  I just sit here in my apartment day in and day out with no visitors and no one texting on my phone anymore.  When i reach out to people i once was at least aquaintances with, they never have the time to bother to respond to me.  I vowed to never let myself get utterly friendless again after briefly being in this position 20 years ago when i was 20 years old, yet here i am again, faced with the fact that it takes friends to make friends, and no one wants to be friends with a really tall goofy looking white gay dude who has no interest in sports, cant drive thanks to the dui, has no money or job, has nothing to offer, except for AIDS.    And this city i live in, Tucson, has got to be the worst city as far as people and their personalities or lack there of goes.... I just dont know anymore.... I need a miracle right now to get me out of this rut that im stuck in.   I just wish i could earn regular money, then i could turn my life around no problem.  You would think with this labor shortage, i would have no problem finding a job, but it's next to impossible.  I just read an article today that says there are millions of men in this country from the ages of 28 to 40 who are in my position with a blemished record and are unhireable by these companies who wont budge on their hiring standards and would rather go out of business rather than get employees who want to work.

1483,Hernysaur,1645294146,1,"English is not my first language so there might be some mistakes. Anyway, I'm turning 21 this year and I have never felt loved in a romantic way. I used to think that nobody felt attracted to me because I was overweighted, but after I got my ass to the gym and lost 20 kilograms nothing changed. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or maybe I do, but recognizing and fixing it is more difficult than it seems. Maybe I am still too insecure and the real problem is inside me and not in the way I look.

 I don't feel comfortable at parties and in my country most people my age only like that kind of entertainment. I have friends who care about me but I don't get to see them very often, and even when I see them I don't find the courage to talk to them or my family about how lonely I feel. I am afraid that they will judge me or say the typical ""you should ask girls out"" or the ""the right person will come"" lines. 

I know I should ask girls out but it is not easy for me, I am shy and have struggled with my self esteem since I was a kid. I am better now thanks to the healthier lifestyle but when I have to talk to a girl I just see myself as I was before the gym. My mind picture of myself is like that and it makes me insecure. I will not lie to you, loosing weight IS worth the effort, but not for the reasons I thought. 

I usually find myself overthinking about my loneliness and how I never do anything when I like someone, which makes me feel like a loser. I can't even have an interesting conversation without thinking that the other person is getting bored. I believe I am not interesting so talking to me must be awful.

 The society rule that the man is the one who should approach the woman is fucked up, it makes shy men feel that we belong nowhere, that we can't be ourselves if we want to find a partner, and that we have to pretend being someone else. 

I had never posted here before and it feels great to finally put these words somewhere out of my head and the fact that this is anonymous makes it even better.

If you read up to here, I want to thank you and let you know that in spite of everything I still have hope that all of us in this sub will feel better someday.",lonely,Being shy and insecure sucks,2022-02-20 05:09:06

I thought I was depressed because of my life long social and general anxiety that through the years eroded my life despite the fact that I’d wake up every morning saying “today is the day I change” and go to bed without having been able to overcome my fear and timidity.

So one day I realized I’d never change, and having that epiphany, and the implication that I then would never be able to live a life I enjoy and pursue what I want, I completely collapsed into a depressive state where daily I’d question the value in living.

I saw my friendships dissolve one by one until none remained. Every romantic prospect was in actuality never really one. My anxiety around women became even more severe and I’d go years without even a hug.

I thought maybe the chronic loneliness, deprivation of sex, lack of any intimacy, and growing, raging jealousy might have had something to do with it.

Watching every limited year of my life be ticked off without any good memories. Knowing each day I was closer to dying, and that my young adulthood was being robbed of me, every Normal human experience alien to me, every healthy life milestone not being met, whether it be a sex life, career, or even simply a healthy relationship with a female, I thought some of those might be the problem.

Every effort I made that was a failure, every time I tried to branch out, I strained to expand my comfort zone and was disappointed by the ensuing failure, every endless night, kept awake by thoughts conjured in the deepest recesses of a nefarious abyss, depriving me of a healthy sleep pattern, keeping me uncontrollably fixated on every failure, every unfulfilled primal desire I had.

She is not perfect and maybe not even my type. But having her around is fun. And I'd like to believe I'm there for her. 

Today a friend walks up to me and says that I have to cut her off. Apparently I tend to overshare and me, being a senior, cannot do it to a junior, especially a girl. That I must do the right thing and cut her and everyone else who is a junior off. My batchmates and my seniors don't care about me and I have no friends, despite trying so much. 

I think I've lost the one thing I could hold on to. I have major depression and severe chronic anxiety disorder and I have nobody to talk to. My family doesn't allow me to see my psychologist anymore and I cannot afford to pay for therapy. I'm back to reddit because it's always been my last option to atleast have a one way conversation. Maybe someone listens, chances are nobody does. 

I just don't know what to do. I think I should've killed myself when I had the chance. I bring nothing but negativity and sadness and toxicity to the world.

I thought if I was ever facing my own death it would be later in life or on my own terms and I'd get to comfort my hypothetical loving spouse and tell them how I've had so much fun already and I've experienced so much happiness so dying doesn't seem to bad and there would be so many friends and family all around and all that lame stuff from movie deaths.

But nothing like that is prepared. No massive hoard of friends and family, no wealth of happy memories and fun experiences, no true love holding my hand, not even some mild success in a career. I know people die all the time, at all ages and situations, but it's a little heartbreaking. Even if my brain doesn't kill me, it feels like all of the bullshit in my life/General Global Nonsense makes getting onto any sort of actual path impossible

Like not even one person? Really? Seriously? Out of all the people I've met, not one person in all my years of life has ever thought to themselves, ""Wow, I wanna ask her out. She's so pretty!"" 

Wow. Like genuinely wow. 

Most of time, I don't really think about it too much. I have more important things to do. But it'll still pop up every once in a while, and creep up on me out of nowhere, like tonight. 

Am I truly that ugly? I know the answer is no, but...I mean, cmon, there are people younger than me that have had several relationships already. 

I think that's what's beginning to hurt a lot more as I get older, too. Time keeps going and turning -- and I still have never had someone romantically before. I always wonder what its like, too. To tell someone I love you, and it not be in the context of family or friends. To truly say it genuinely with heart, compassion, and love. Whats it like to love someone genuinely like that? What's it like to fall in love at all? To have a crush? And for someone to reciprocate that crush back? 

For someone to ask you out, and be able to believe them, instead of thinking it's a joke? 

What's it like knowing someone likes you that much? And finds you attractive that much? 

I'm just tired of feeling that slight bitterness whenever I hear people talk about their relationships. I'm genuinely happy for them, I am! But I really can't help that part -- the ache, the heavy lead in the pit of my stomach that makes its way down to my feet and back up my heart.

I'm an introvert which is probably part of the problem, but I've often tried to make new friends or put in a lot of effort to keep the few friendships I had alive but I never got back much. 
People almost always told me they wanted to be friends and hang out with me but then never had time when I asked and never wrote me or called me again.
It really has been like that my whole life and I just can't figure out why. I often feel so lonely and disconnected..

Fortunately today I do have a sweet boyfriend who is there for me but we have a long distance relationship and will have one for at least 2 more years so we don't see each other often and even if we did, he is still my partner and is not supposed to replace a stable circle of friends. 
I also do have like 2 or 3 other friends I can talk to if I need to, but they also live quite far away so we rarely really meet. 
And again, usually I am the one who's checking up on them, rarely the other way around..

Sometimes I just feel like everybody already has enough friends and is well connected with others. Everybody, except for me. 
I just can't seem to find people who share my interests (which might be a little unusual for a girl I must admit) or want to get to know me anyway. And I just don't know why really.

Do you have any tips/suggestions what the problem might be?

1537,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1645257706,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program co-director at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. I'm currently in the thick of the semester and taking 5 classes ( Just one semester left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! I'm also open to voice chat as well but there's certainly no expectation. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. It would be great to find some good company.

I’m just at a point. I’m at a point where I would offer to marry someone as long as they support me financially. Not pay for my things and spoil me. I mean handle our main expenses. I’d cook 3 meals a day, clean, and do whatever else would make things easier as long as I could stay at home. He doesn’t have to take me anywhere. Doesn’t have to buy me anything. The necessities like foot and water all his choice. Whatever. 

I have a great career but would drop it for this. Simply because what’s the point? I don’t want to work the rest of my life, however much longer that is so the sooner I can just not, the better. I loved my work but it’s not doing anything to help society or solve any major issues so I can give up and be fine with it. 

Even if the man doesn’t love me, I’d be fine. He could go be with whoever he wants when he leaves the home. As long as he’s around sometimes. I’m used to sometimes and maybes. Id need him around Just enough to pretend I have the life I thought was for everybody. I’m used to seeing two adults who clearly don’t love each other interact. To an extent it feels normal and nostalgic even. 

It wouldn’t even have to be for that long. Just 6years minimum. Enough time for me to relive the best years of my life. Early childhood before everything went to shit and messed my mind up. Hopefully id have a child. Actually a child is a must. The whole experience. Then Id truly feel like I could go peacefully. I just want to experience happiness one more time that way.

1543,heartspaceenergy,1645253493,1,I think that everything is fake. I think that everything is a lie. I think that people just want to get something out of you one way or another doesn't matter who doesn't matter what the situation doesn't matter what the association everybody just wants something. That would be all fine and dandy if the thing they wanted wasn't so damn superficial or based on the lower emotions and desires like lust etc. What I find the most upsetting about it is that they usually don't even tell you but they lead you on and make you think you want something more real concrete and significant when truly only want to do is drain your energy and get some satisfaction out of your physical body or your mental psychic energy. I think the best thing for everybody to do is to just kind of preserve themselves for something better don't worry about the time because the time is infinite and never ending so whether we find the delight and pleasure in this life or the next it shouldn't really matter to us either way when the timing occurs. I just try to believe and tell myself that the future that I wanted the future that I seek is already ordained for me and I just have to sort of let it go let go of the whole idea and let go of the will I have for myself as well because I know that I want life to surprise me and that's what life is only capable of doing really. And I think that when we get stuck on what's familiar to us and when we keep going back to the toxic relationships we are being redundant and we are repeating the same errors that keep us confined to isolation and feelings of unworthiness and lack of true significant deep connection to others who could actually be there for us and are actually ready to love and give. I think it's really important to weigh the pros and cons and to make sure that you're getting returns on your investments because our energy is our currency and if we're not getting returns and profiting from our investments then we need to withdraw our funding we need to close down the accounts of the people who are not creating value in our lives. Otherwise we're just going to be spent all the time and that's no way to live really we need to understand and have common sense to know that our energy is valuable. And we should be making ourselves and our time more expensive because if we don't we're just going to keep on being used up and played.,lonely,My heart hurt bcus I'm never gonna be someones favorite delight,2022-02-19 17:51:33

First it was a big car accident that left me in rehabilitation for years, then it was having a surprise pregnancy and then it was becoming a parent during Covid and battling PPA. 

The cherry on top is that my claim for the accident settled last year, but during the process I found out a handful of friends (we were a tight group) all actively disclosed information about me to the lawyers of the insurance company (note: one of the members of this group was driving the car I was in during the accident). Even though I had nothing to hide. The insurance company ended up settling with me because their snooping was fruitless. But I feel so betrayed. I did everything right. I was honest, transparent, hardworking and eager. I climbed out of a hellish pit and found new success. Why would they do this? 

For perspective I was finding lots of success before my accident and was heading towards a great career. The accident derailed that and I spent years in full time therapies to get somewhat back to where I was. I had to walk with a walker, I gained a ton of weight and had to leave both my job and school. Throw pregnancy and a pandemic on top of that. But, by the time I settled I had gone back to school and graduated on the deans list. Got into a competitive graduate program. Lost all the weight I’d gained. And had finally come out of my depression.

Wednesday:

I’ve been having a pretty shitty day like non stop. And then I started getting insecure about being single again. Then I go to my art class. And a girl who I was mostly ignoring. Cause I didn’t want to give her any ideas. Out of no where(it’s just her and her friend and me in the room at this point). They’re talking about dating and stuff. And then like she brings up something about how it took her 2 seconds to know she wasn’t into someone. I thought nothing of it. But then she tells a story about a run in where she just saw the guy he didn’t do anything she just saw him on a walk and I knew at that moment that guy was me. And she said She looked at him and like ew. I remember that day and I was kinda hunched over cause I was constipated. So like yeah I get that my posture was weird but like. What the actual fuck. And the thing is I’m not even mad at her. I’m just so fucking tired of this shit. A. Girls shit talking me for no reason(usually because I end up ignoring them or not looking at them) and B today has just been absolute shit over all and like the consecutive bullshit that had been happening all day can’t be a coincidence. God hates me. And that’s that. Fuck

Yesterday:

Didn’t think it could get worse. But it did. Day four[four days that were bad but the second one where real shit was happening] of an escalating shit storm it seems. On top of constantly having my hope crushed and things pushing the idea that I’m going to die alone. Our theatre teacher had failed to put up any information on what we were doing today. Surprise surprise I’m unprepared for all of it. Not to mention an additional bombshell that was dropped regarding a play we have to watch this weekend which I can’t go see because I have work back home. So yeah. Fuck me. Tomorrow and Saturday are probably gonna get worse. And let me guess. On Sunday or Monday someone drowns and I’m unable to perform cpr or some other bullshit.

Today:

I ended up feeling lonely alone and fucking tired of being single again for hours. Got desperate and texted a girl who had begged to be fwb a while back. I said no because I wanted standards for myself. Fast forward to now. She’s even crazier than I remember. So not only that but also I think she completely forgot about our whole ordeal. And so my attempt to get with her failed. And I managed to get embarrassed in public cause we were together at the cafeteria for too long. Then when I’m finally back.

I still don't really have anyone to talk to, but I've found that my perspective on the world and myself has changed greatly. I feel like part of my overcoming of loneliness, anxiety, and depression, has been a building a new emotional relationship and understanding with myself. I feel less afraid to express myself and be open about my emotions, even it's just with myself.

It kills me when she says “wow it’s been a while” or when she looks at me.

I can’t help but to think I’ll never have that with anyone. And there’s no one that I can tell how lonely I am or what I think.

I stare at the blank ceiling with the distant sound of TV playing in the living room, I get lost in my thoughts. Most of the time these thoughts aren't good. Most of the time they bring me to tears.

1572,llwizll,1645240222,1,"

I know this is gonna be a long post so i apologize. I am a 19 year old male and my life has steadily went downhill for the last 4 years. It started when i was 16 and I lost my first ""love"" if you will. I was just so obsessed with this girl, but our relationship was forced to an end because of her parents disapproval of me. I am African American, and they were  an all white family, and they continuously told her how people ""like me"" were scum, how I was just gonna get her pregnant and leave her ""like  all  people like me do"",  how embarrasing it would be for her to have black babies, and many other racist things. Her father threatened to send her to boarding school if we stayed together ( I literally only met her family once and treated them with upmost respect, and I treated her the best I possibly could have) so I knew it was about my skin color. We tried to hide a secret relationship, but there was no point because we both knew it couldnt work after what happened. What makes it ironic is, her father is the Pastor at our local church, AND their family were missionaries in Africa for 15 years before they moved here. What her family said about me ruined me, and I couldnt convince myself for years to get into another relationship. She married last year to the Youth Pastor of her fathers church ( shes 2 years older than me), hurt pretty bad. Eventually last year, I tried again and began another relationship with a white girl, and it was the EXACT SAME SITUATION. Treated her and her family with much respect, but they overall did not want their daughter with a black man, so it ended quick. I have not considered dating since. I want to be in a relationship so bad just so I wont be lonely, but I dont have the courage to. I have no friends, as I went to a VERY small private school, and only had 8 people in my graduating class, and we all went our seperate ways after graduation. I hate going out, no parties, no bars, so I cant make friends that way. I try to message people on dating apps and so on just to make friends. I am not bad looking, Im 6 foot 8, was a division 1 college basketball player (before i got a career ending surgery) and I consider myself pretty funny. I know what youre thinking, how can a tall, funny, college athlete have no friends? I dont know myself, I just dont. I have also been diagnosed with POTS and Chronic fatigue Syndrome as of last year, which has basically made me a lazy bastard who does not have energy to do anything, and makes me feel like I am dying all the time, it is miserable. I am just so miserable I cant take it. I had the girl I loved, a promising career in basketball, good grades, and was happy. And now I am heartbroken, damn near bedridden, had to drop out of school ( scholarship was revoked due to my injury and I cannot afford it on my own), and miserable. I feel stuck, i feel like my life is over. Its so depressing just sitting around all day lonely, barely having the energy to stand up. I am not suicidal but I would not mind if one day I just never woke up. Im sorry this was so long, but I thought it might help to finally have some people to rant to about everything.

After achieving large goals, I was so thankful and overjoyed by finally achieving things I have wanted for so long, and was so thankful. I had met someone and it seemed like icing on the cake.

But it was a facade because what once made me happy, someone close in my life, new friends, new apartment, new job, it slowly became clear that what I thought was making me happy was actually making me miserable.

The apartment was nice, but it made me realize that I am alone in it.

The job was great, but the ups and downs of the emotional rollercoaster at work, was making me miserable.

The new friends were bringing new experiences and fun times, but the deception was making me upset.

The new date was making me experience true moments of happiness and calm, but the abandoning was making feel hurt and alone.

And so what's was an amazing rush of great change in my life, brought me so many blessings and brought me to a place I never thought I would be, the veil of unhappiness is ruining it for me. Life is never perfect, but how can things I truly love and make me feel safe and successful, also make me unhappy.

So now I have to slowly, articulate the small things that crepped in with the blessings, and try and meticulously remove them. Do I do that by making rash decisions? Of course not because it would also remove the blessings in my life. 

So I have to try and find the small things that are making me happy and change those, while maintaining the things in my life that bring me joy.

1607,goofypee,1645224227,1,it’s been about 3 months now since i last spoke to her(16). I’m currently 17(male) and i’ve lost the only thing good i really had left in life. She was so sweet and was the only other person who had the exact same type of humor as me. We’d been friends since 3rd grade (i’m currently a junior) and i don’t know what to do next. i don’t feel happy anymore not without her or anyone to joke with or about. I was devastated when she first broke things off with me and i’m still torn apart. I loved her like a best friend should love their best friend. It was always me and her doing things and playing games and going to each other’s house and just plain having fun. I know i still have much of my life left to live and heal but i still feel so empty. I always thought about this and it seemed like it would be easy to get over after a while but when reality hit me i just couldn’t take it. most of my family aren’t home when i am so i’m practically alone most of the time. i don’t even enjoy doing things we used to do like watch movies together or go to the park. i can’t even make myself enjoy playing online games anymore either because it just reminds me of her. The worst part is i still don’t know what i did wrong to make her hate me. I was always mean and jokeful in a friendly type of way but when it came to serious problems i always thought i was good at being caring and cheering her up. i can’t remember a day going by when i haven’t thought about it and not choked up let alone bursting into tears. i don’t relate to anyone else at school and i also don’t like anyone else at school. She’s had this girlfriend since 7th grade (they started dating when she was 12 and her gf was 16) and i always thought it seemed off having an almost 4 year age gap but she was my best friend and i didn’t talk about it much because i never wanted to upset her. her girlfriend always hated me for some reason. i never loved her in a romantic sense just a deep connection and bond since we’d be together practically our whole lives up to this point. Idk if her girlfriend made her break things off with me out of spite or what but i still cry just thinking about it. i’m sorry if this is all a mess to read. i didn’t plan it ahead and have just been speaking my mind as it comes to me.,lonely,i lost my best friend and i don’t know what to do,2022-02-19 09:43:47

I find it refreshing to do little trips by myself. Three years ago, I holidayed in Edinburgh solo and I had a blast! I didn't have to worry about anyone else but myself. I felt like an awesome lone wolf, and the world was my oyster. 

The one thing I don't miss about having a large social circle is the increased probability of drama and panenonium. From my experience the more people I interact with, the more drama I have to put up with. I'm a firm believer in quality over quantity. I'm happy with having just a handful of good friends rather than having a few good friends, and a lot of crappy ones. I had to learn it the hard way years ago and it was a real learning curve for me. I haven't looked back and safe to say I feel less stressed as a result. It helps that I rarely log into Facebook. That site has passed its prime anyway. 

Dating on the other hand...not all great. It's always been one stroke of bad luck after another. Instead of devoting time to trying to find someone, I decided to devote time to going to the gym and joining an archery club (turns out I'm good for a beginner). The way I see it, if no one wants me, it's their loss, and I'll just devote more time to myself and focus on myself. No point wasting time on people who are just going to screw you over. I'm feeling too old for this crap now...the arguments and the bloody mind games...it's just going to make my hair fall out.

If anyone does need someone to talk to... I'm in a good mood and online for the time being. I'm a 42 year old straight male if that matters to you... it doesn't make a difference to me what you are. We can talk about whatever you want. I won't veer the conversation toward myself or anything sexual unless that's something you want to talk about. Just felt like being here for anyone who was feeling lonely.

Topics that interest me include... travel, psychology, religion, mythology, honesty, human sexuality, history, politics, Marvel, gaming (though I'm not at all up-to-date when it comes to this), languages, relationships, love, movies, music (favorites include Nine Inch Nails, Fiona Apple, Beethoven, Eminem, A Perfect Circle, Weird Al Yankovic, Nobuo Uematsu (video game music), movie soundtracks, my tastes are literally all over the place), depression and treatments for it, the Middle East, education, animals &amp; pets, Asperger's, photography, art, humor, cars (used to love my '99 Dodge Viper), meaning (of life), philosophy, etc etc... but... we can talk about whatever you are thinking about or are interested in. I don't know much about... sports, fashion, TikTok, crypto, and quite a few other things, but happy to make the attempt to carry on a conversation on any topic.

P.S. this is not a veiled cry for help or attention.... I don't need to talk to anyone right now. I'm actually feeling better than usual at this moment. So... appreciate it... but no need to reach out if you yourself are not feeling lonely right now or like you need someone to talk to. (I mean, I'm open to it, but, not necessary)

And if we don't talk or exchange messages, just know that someone out there cares and hopes you are feeling better sometimes soon.

Girlfriend just moved in, have a good salary, 2 dogs, good health, family's in good shape.

The problem is that I'm constantly thinking about the future - on where I should move to, how much money I will be making, where I'll be living and the kind of people I'll be meeting.

It's like my mind is keeps running from the present and it's so frustrating because I feel like I'm losing so much by doing this.

I'm not very sure why I do this, I suspect that it's because I lost contact with pretty much all of my friends since college and that was what kept me grounded.

Feels like my life today is pretty much all work and no play, even though I treat myself constantly and work's really flexible with not much stress.

Hence the desire to move out, I've been fantasizing a lot about living in another country or moving out to a place with more quality of life, beaches and that sort of stuff.

Honestly, I think I really miss having my sort of people around me - last time that happened was in college and it was the best time of my life. It seems like I'm having issues moving past that.

My hope is that by moving somewhere else I'll be happier and attract the sort of people that I'm currently missing so much in my life.

It is too much. Definitely. All those negative emotions. I don’t want it anymore. And if it wasn‘t for my cowardice, who knows what I would have done to myself by now. 

It‘s so hard, sometimes tears come into my eyes while in public. Just happened today. And I hate sounding so pathetic and full of self pity. But it is the truth.

I‘m fighting it. I’m doing everything I can. Meditation, gym, a lot of talking to the few friends and family members that I thankfully still have, approaching people in public (a lot, for an introvert), reading on different topics that might help (stoicism, buddhism, etc.) and keeping myself busy as good as I can. I also saw a therapist until recently. 

Sometimes it helps, but most of the time it doesn’t or just barely works, like today. The feeling of loneliness is always lurking in the background, just waiting for the right moment. This moment often arrives when it gets dark and I come home. Then it strikes. With a cold blade directly into my heart. 

Sometimes I think I came into this world only to experience negative emotions extraordinarily high. It‘s like this is the purpose of my entire existence. My duty. To always suffer in the most extreme ways. In order to keep the universe balanced. So that others don‘t have to. So that some can live a life with a normal amount of suffering/loneliness and some can be happy, carefree and loved. 

I keep fighting it. I will get up tomorrow morning and do my best to feel less lonely and be more grateful. And the day after tomorrow and all the other days still to come.

Again, this isn’t supposed to sound like an heroic act. I‘m not motivated to do so. 

There is just no alternative.

i (15amab), before (ages 11-13) i am at the phase that i am not that mature, that's why my hopes and motivations are high, but i am already done away from that phase. i am here in the phase that i would understand reality more. 

before, i totally really didn't have any emotional support and guidance, that's why i stood up for myself (which is Great and i am thankful or my past me's choice and courage, idk what am i right now without them), i am really motivated back then. No One is really close to me for two reasons: 1. have a toxic and emotionally absent household, 2. i don't fit-in because i am different. and those two reasons are the ones i am still suffering up until today. 

of course, this lead into isolation, but i was okay and i embraced solitudity, because like i said, i am still in that not much mature phase of high hopes and motivation, that's why i still felt okay. After all, I raised myself starting in my adolescence. 

i am done in that phase and after that, i really felt depressed and suicidal, and i attempted suicide once. i was really emotionally stable back to those days, and now i was really tired of the isolation. and i am just a human, and humans basically needs People Who Truly Really Care And Loves Them, but i didn't have that. and i just realised that all the ""You don't need anybody, being alone is Great"" is just not all true.

people be like ""there really ones who loves you, you just don't acknowledge it."" no. the people who claimed to ""love"" me are the same people who abused and hurt me the most. Also really back-handed. 

i am just also really irrelevant, i don't fit-in, of course there's nothing wrong with that and we're really just not everyone's cup of tea, but again, as a human, i basically just need people who truly wants and loves me. i am so irrelevant and weird. 

In this february i just cried, i really got so emotional that i also cried, i cried because i really don't have a true family, and convinced myself that i really don't deserve it and prayed to G-d about it. i don't know though, maybe if someone would show me care like, ""true care,"" maybe i would resent it because it doesn't feel right because i don't even deserve it, but i don't really deserve it, who am i to think that someone would really come to treat me as real family. 

i also just really tried a long time to find people who me will love me and me love them and to find ""my"" people and family, but nothing really successfully happened, i only got a lot of heart breaks, sadness, and being depressed. No One Really, No One Really. i wish i am dead.

I feel like I’ve wasted my life. I haven’t pursued any of my hobbies because I couldn’t really make money off of them. Now that I’m out of practice I can’t get myself to try them again. That damn gifted kid burnout syndrome.

My homeschooling has been on a downfall ever since it started really, I know it’s entirely my fault but I can’t get any motivation anymore to do school, my parents are pretty much always working, sometimes six days a week, so they don’t really have the time to help me with school.

Before the divorce she left me twice within a one year period without reasoning why or what for just broke up with me. Both times when she did break up with me she was in a new relationship the same day. I thought that was pretty messed up you know saying she loved me and everything like that always wanted to be with me till we were old and everything. The last time when she left me and she left me for the baby daddy and wasn't even with him for long before she was with another person and engaged to him before we were even divorced. It's been 6 months since we've broken up one month since the divorce and I don't know what I want. I thought I try friends and see where it goes online instead of just rushing into a new relationship. But it seems like a lot of people don't seem to understand that and wants to rush into a relationship. I don't know if that's what I want or not but I hate being alone. Before her I was used to sleep in my own and having coitus every so often when I did get it. But after being married and being with someone for that long I can't stand sleeping alone no more. What really bothers me is the fact of not having coitus for as long as I have now when I was used to having it a few times a week.

I really don't have friends or anything like that no more because before my ex took off she pretty well messed up all of my friendships or made them think that you know I was the person in the wrong. I have trouble talking to any of the females that I had known because she really started a bunch of shit with them and blocked a lot of people so no one talks to me.

Gosh I hate the word “normie”, but I wasn’t sure how else to describe it. 

I wish that when I felt down, I could just look at a live laugh love type poster and feel inspired. I remember trying out therapy and in the middle of me talking she said you can do anything if you just put your mind to it, and in my head I was like- ????¿?? ma’am, I am dealing with SH and I can’t see a future for me, I literally have a due date to die pls omfg ;-;  

I wish I could watch “inspirational” videos online and actually feel something rather than thinking how about how fake and forced it is. Like for example, those videos about people helping homeless people? I wish I could turn off my brain and feel inspired by it like everyone else instead of thinking how this influencer is using them as a prop.

I also wish I was more… mainstream I guess? Keep in mind, I’m not saying “I’m so cool because I don’t like mainstream stuff”bc a lot of things I like are extremely popular. I just don’t know how else to describe this feeling other than to use the word mainstream. What I mean is that for some reason, I feel like I’m lacking in stuff that a lot of other people connect with in real life. I wish I could laugh at the same type of jokes that I see most people my age laughing at. I wish I could use certain slang or emojis, but it feels so unnatural to me. A lot of stuff I straight up do not give a shit about, but I feel like I have to research into so that I can understand what people are talking about and so I can be more involved in their conversations and interests.

I’m failing all my college classes right now no matter how hard I try something gets in my way. I use to be really good at school.

Because of that it’s been hard getting some hours in to actually learn and then do my assignments confidently. Everyday I ask why am I doing this because I truly hate it. 

I am 20 and if I die right now, only my family will notice and then my boyfriend 2-3 days. He lies to me and says he is at work but he is just at the park or with his friends that seems to be more important to him than to just be honest with me (I know because we have our location on).

Now me and S have gotten close since October and she tells me I'm her best friend, and how lucky she feels to have me in her life, and that I am really the only person outside her family that she trusts. 

I value her and I am not waiting on the sidelines in hopes that she will one day fall in love with me--fuck that noise! And i dont believe in that ""friendzone"" bullshit either, so please dont paint me as some nice guy.

But, i do feel the sting of rejection everytime she tells me about some guy she's going out with, or how hot some guy across the bar is when we go out. She talks about wanting confident, good looking, more successful guys and it makes me feel that I'm not any of those things.

The Friday before Valentine's day she went on a date with some guy--I know it went well because I didnt hear from her all weekend. If a date goes bad she calls me, or if shes just at home with no plans, she will call me over since we live close.

She said me and her should do something for Valentine's Day but she called me that day and said she was gonna hang out with that guy, not even mentioning or seeming to remember she said she wanted to hang out.

But I've been getting less texts from her, less calls, less invites over, and less interaction in general.

I truly hope S connects with this guy, and that she is happy, but I'm starting to feel lonelier than even before I met her.

Now the only texts I get are from my two friends in the group chat I'm in, and some other guy friends.

Its so hard meeting someone romantically, but this is even making me not want to open up to new people at all.

Where do i begin?...is right where i begin.
I can't even promise i will ever reply if i get any comment on this, so please don't be offended.
Maby i delete it tomorrow, maby never.

Im mostly alone these days.
Been like this for a looong time.
Why?
I have a very difficult/complex past.
I experienced a series of traumatic events, spread out through the last 15 years or so...maby even longer.
Some of them are even unexplainable.
Now, im in my mid thirties.

I avoid people and conversations as much as possible, though i easily speak with both known and strangers..
Im kind of introverted, but i surely can be more extrovert than most people, in some occations.

Why do i avoid people?
Because, lets say i meet an old aquatintanence or friend, most of them ask ;
""How are you?""
Or;
""What have you being up to lately?""
Or;
""Do you remember...blah blah blah""
...or other things related to ""the"" or their past.
They tell a story from their past.
I tell a story.
They tell a story...
Mine goes deeper..and deeper..and deeper.

It triggers my mind in a weird way i can't explain..
Its kind of annoying.
Draining.

A friend might start mention something from his past, then suddenly Pandora's box is fully opened, and my difficult past presents itself like pearls on a string, little by little like a red cord of stories that i usually have buried not to be seen or heard, because it is to heavy for most people, makes them uncomfortable in some way, and it might even go into more existential and spiritual subjects, even to the point of questions about ""the reality"", or experiences in the universe.

Deep down, i litterary didn't wish to talk about it, thats one of the reasons i usually prefer to be alone... but the person next to me more or less initiated the conversation about the past, and...here we are, in the future of uncomfortable feelings.
..and im to blame.

Suddenly it becomes to heavy for them.
I tried to restrain it, but...
They litterary asked for it; ""who are you?""
""What have you being up to?""
..but then i have to put myself into a tiny box..
""Viewer discretion is adviced""
It is heavy for me as well, and in the conversation i have barely scratched the surface.

That's why im where im at this very moment.

They might even judge me, because i prefer to be alone, see me as weird or a loner.

Sometimes i feel less alone when im alone, than when other people are present.
""You need to open up""
""You need to this, that or the other""

(Opens up)
""Please don't talk about this or that.""
""Please keep that to yourself""

Why do some people repeatedly seek contact with me, when they clearly see that we are not compatible?
...When they litterary demand me to be someone else than who i really am in their presence?
...they demand that I become who THEY are.

The times im most lonely, is right after a visit of a ""friend"" or ""aquatintanence"", after a conversation about subjects i most likely wouldnt have thought of if iv just had stayed by my self.

I didn't mean to ""occupy"" the conversation in any way shape or form.
I even got the notion that ""you"" where actually interested in what i was saying, if not i would have shut up long time ago.


After the conversation i might even feel i was somehow unconciously led into the subjects of my past, and when i somehow tell about it, im made to feel like i did something wrong by opening up.

Then im left by myself again, with something that feels like an open wound i didn't have earlier.
A feeling of hurt, lonelyness, sadness, anger...numbness.
Alone.
When i can be myself, without anyone's judgement, restrictions or demands.
When im allowed to reach a state of mind best described as ""comfortably numb"".
When im allowed to just flow, and forget.
When im allowed to just be.
After some time, might be hours, might be days, i slowly feel better again, though the iceberg is still floating in the sea, i can manuvere around it as i please.

They might see ""my story"" as complex and even dominating..
That I was the one who dominated the conversation, though they completly forget about all their empty words and stories  that led the way to the subjects in the first place.
I was listening as well.

I really don't know how to put it...
It all seems insufficient when i put it down ""on paper"", like this.
Like i can't express it in its fullness.
Lack of words and vocabulary.
Painting a colorful picture in black and white.

On the right; ""Please listen to me, Please understand""
On the left; ""Why don't you just leave me the hell alone?!""

She isn't having any of it and soon she will be gone. The hardest part is that she still has me thinking there's hope. That she isn't doing these things behind my back or lying to me. I've caught her in several lies already, but she just doesn't realize it... Why haven't I confronted her about these things? I've certainly tried, but every single time she gaslights me into feeling like a shitty terrible person for even daring to bring up such things and I always back down and apologize...   


It's my own fault I suppose. I enable this kind of thing. I'm weak. Pathetic. Desperate. Lonely. I stay around despite how she hurts me emotionally. She hardly considers my feelings... she ignores my messages and in the last few months, she's started talking to multiple guys. ""Friends"" of hers, yet, she doesn't want us to interact, talk or even know about each other. She's distant and keeps her feelings to herself and all I want to do is be there for her...  


I've worked so hard to better myself as a person and a lover and a friend and anything else I can think of. I've come a long way honestly and it's all in part because of her. I love her more than life itself yet... Here I am, despite everything... contemplating how I'll end it all once she's gone.   


I've tried for so long to find my place in this world. I've fought long and hard to achieve what little I have but it's all falling apart. I'm completely numb and the tears won't even come. I feel worthless, burnt-out, and tired... so very very tired.   


It's easy to give up, I know that. Ending it all... taking the coward's way out... its weakness I know that but I don't know if I can do this anymore without her in my life. I have no job. No place of my own. My car is broken down and these days I hardly get to even eat.   


I've truly tried everything I can think of to keep pushing forward in this life but I truly feel like I've reached the end of my rope. No friends. No family. And soon... I won't even have someone I can pretend loves me anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess at this point I'm shamelessly looking for someone to give a shit about me. Someone to actually care. I know most people who see this post won't make it past the first few paragraphs so I don't even know why I'm bothering with this at all.   


I guess it's because I just want someone to know? Someone to hear me and see me in these final days. I have a dog. So I'll wait for her to reach the end of her days but after that, there's literally no reason for me to continue on.   


I guess despite everything I'm still clinging on to hope.   


Hope that things will change for the better. That my hard work will finally pay off. That I can truly do something with my life. There is still time, I guess, a few years at least but I can't see anything beyond that handful of years except darkness. I can't afford to seek professional help with these issues, I can barely afford to stay alive as it is.

They only came around for money and ditched me any chance they got. My uncles, aunts etc never said happy birthday or ever check in. My grandparents are mostly all dead and the two I have on my mothers side have never had a connection with me so it’s almost fabricated anytime we talk. When it comes to friends I had a small group of 3 close friends that we’re practically brothers to me. But lately no one has talked to me, I’ve reached out and even just wanted to hop on discord to talk but no one responds, it’s gotten to the point I’ve spent a week now just kind of getting deeper into my head and no one has reached out to just say ( hey ). Something so simple that I did frequently just to check in on them or call them. I’m not upset I’m just hurt that I have no one in my life anymore, I can’t tell my parents because we’ve never had an intimate connection where I cry about a topic or share my mental state. It just really hurts most days and I feel so foggy, I contemplate just ending my life or disappearing. I’m not upset with my own life either, I’m doing good in school I’m happy in other areas, but when it comes to my social life it’s hollow.

Found out I have complex PTSD and became obsessed with trying to heal myself. Found out adult children of alcoholics seek out “fixer-upper relationships” and realized almost all my friendships require one-sided emotional labor from me. I just can’t help myself trying to delve into people and really understand what makes them tick. It’s always bothered me that the same interest isn’t really returned and that my mental health status is a taboo in conversation. 

Told my best friend all the way from elementary school that our friendship wasn’t working out and I’d be ready to talk when she was willing to offer reciprocity in the friendship. No response. She has almost always treated me as the backup friend and only really engaged when she needed someone to talk to. Sticking up for myself resulted in a fleeting sense of self worth. I feel even more like a loser now than I did while I was anxiously hoping she’d just respond to anything I had to say. 

Went skiing this weekend for the first time ever with some friends. Got in over my head not listening to my comfort level because I didn’t want to seem lame. Completely ate shit twice down a hill, activated my fear response and was unable to get out of my head for the rest of the time we were there. 

I feel like a loser. Like I have nothing to offer in a friendship but an ear for others. I’m nervous to initiate conversation with others and don’t want to be ignored by “friends” anymore. Most my day i spend fantasizing conversations, conflict, affirmations from people that I’ll never receive. I can’t think straight. I can’t have a train of thought without trying to frame it as an actual line of dialogue that I won’t ever have. I just want peace from this communication obsession.

1866,Chairbottletooth,1645094434,1,"I (male 41yo)just felt like I needed to write this down somewhere. I've done that before a few times, but then when I find it a year or so later in a saved text file on my computer, I get kind of sad that it's just been sitting there and no one will ever open it. 

I want to start out by saying I'm not fishing for sympathy, I'm quite tired of that. I always get the sad ""oh I'm so sorry for you"" look whenever I tell someone about my life. 

A bit over 8 years ago I my body gave up suddenly when out inspecting a nature preserve, luckily my highly pregnant wife was with me so I got home ok. What followed was 2-3 years of not knowing and fighting with doctors until I got my diagnosis, ME (formerly chronic fatigue syndrome). Which doesn't really say anything since it's just a diagnosis for everyone presenting a certain amount of symptoms, you still can't test for it.

Anyway, one year before me and my now wife had moved away from the city I grew up in, Stockholm(Sweden), to Örebro, a smaller town. And two months before I fell ill we bought a house, around 30 mins outside Örebro(Fjugesta). Needless to say I didn't have that many friends and mostly at work. After I became sick I couldn't work anymore so any social connections I had started, fizzled out. I was also quite a lot worse in the first 3 years of being ill. 

Around six months later my son was born and it was a hard period trying to get my body to work when it didn't anymore. And after that my wife spent around 1,5 years at home (yeah that's a great part of living in Sweden). Then she went back to work and my son started preschool, and I was alone again. Since then we've had our daughter (she's 4 now) so my wife spent yet another year and a half at home. Now I've been alone at home for a few years again. I guess that's the very short backstory of the last 9 years.

Now I'm getting to the part of why I'm writing, I'm lonely. I have no friends anymore and I didn't have time to form any new friendships when we moved and now it's almost impossible since I spent almost all days at home. At most I go shopping sometimes, maybe once a week when I'm well enough. Sometimes we go to the open preschool to meet other parents and kids but it's mostly quite young moms (&lt;25yo). And while I'm not ageist or care if your a man or a woman or anything in-between, we don't have anything in common.

I joined a Facebook group for finding friends in my area, but that feels, in short, mostly like a semi dating group. I feel it's hard enough finding friends at my age, but with my illness(that makes me quite tired and fatigued) it feel completely impossible. I've tried reaching out to other people(and groups) with the same problems I have, but that just ends in me listening to a wall of self pity, just the opposite of what I want and need. Since I fell ill I can't drink anything alcoholic, and that (and having kids) seems to the the go to pastime out here where I live.

I'm not writing this because I think it will change anything, I just needed to vent. My wife is awesome in every way, but it's apparent that she is buckling under the strain of handling so much (even if I do as much as I can). As a side note my son has just been diagnosed with autism and he's having a hard time with everything social, much aggression at home among other things. My daughter was born allergic to just about everything edible, including breast milk... We(90% my wife) have had to fight for every little step for help with both my son and daughter, having just fought for every inch getting my diagnosis. 

Some times I just want to be with someone and not talk about everything crappy in my life. Have someone or someone's to just spend time with, maybe fishing or gaming or whatever.

I wish I wasn't so weak and easily damaged, I wish I could be amused by the small things that make most people happy, but I'm not, because I'm missing what means most to me; Eboni, Morgan, Jake, Kodie, Jadon, Bartek, and Kirsten, and Alicja. But why do I even talk about it anymore? It's done, they won't come back, and I don't deserve for them to either, I dragged them down and nearly burnt them out, I didn't mean to, but hindsight is a bitch.

When you appreciate the small things, when you can enjoy the comfort of loving someone or a group of people, it makes the small things feel like everything, it gives you a reason to want to live even if it is meaningless in the end.

I've come to the conclusion that, I'm not meant to be loved or cared for, I'm merely a stone that people trip up on and move on from, whereas my problems are mountain ranges I simply cannot surpass.

So moving on from here, after countless suicide attempts, therapy, hospital treatment, medication, what do I do? Do I simply wait for life to go through, and risk living life in pain with the sliver of hope that may die one day, that could give me a reason, or I could just say that these very words are my final encore, find the courage to end it, leaving these very words on a piece of paper next to the rotting corpse of something that was never meant to be",lonely,I Failed And I'm 15,2022-02-17 19:26:43

Hey everyone. I enjoy computers, science, and engineering. My best friend (who is also into CS) moved away three years ago and can’t visit more than once or twice a year.

I live in a relatively small town where everyone is obsessed with football and joyriding. I have a small friend group that I hang out with, but I’ve been too busy with work and school for anything more than a passing ‘hello’.

School is a pain. I’m taking Calc and Trig at the same time (I’m only supposed to take one, but I demonstrated an ability to take more), and the college *just* informed me that RS won’t cover the tuition despite being halfway through the quarter. I now owe a bunch of money in school debt, and it’s too late to drop the class for a refund.

Work is a joke. My manager is stupid and not qualified for the job. She’s constantly turning off the open signs and shutting off the lights in the restaurant so that customers won’t come in, and then getting after my co workers saying that we are the reason that the company is losing money. She is pulling rotten food out of garbage cans and selling it to customers, and she vapes in camera blind spots.

My home life is a joke. My parents constantly yell at us for stupid reasons when they get home from the bar every night, and they force us to follow rules that they read in an article on facebook. They are overall some of the most bi-polar toxic people I have ever met, and they get offended whenever we avoid being with them.

I planned a stress relief get-together with my closest friend for today after work, but he tells me that he can’t make it after I had already been waiting nearly 45 minutes to hear back from him at our usual meet-up spot. It wasn’t his fault that he couldn’t make it, but he doesn’t know how important this get-together was to me.

While I do have a small group of friends I hang out with, no one that I have ever met in person seems to share my interests. I’m hoping that’ll change soon, I’ve started to get into Amateur radios, and I’m meeting with a local club in a few weeks.",lonely,Small redneck town,2022-02-17 18:26:25

1910,slugsquad0007,1645070576,1,"20M, compsci major, just got into a four year after two years of community college. Community college was hard because of the loneliness. I paid tuition out of pocket. All I did was school as there were no events. Average age of a community college student is 28, but I was 17 when i started.  The loneliness messed me up really bad. Now I started at a four year and I’m overloaded with things I can do. People I can talk too. Clubs I can be apart of. 

And I’m angry.  Because I know deep down, I know I need to focus more on my industry. The way my major is set up, we all want  the high  paying jobs. You only get those by studying in your free time. So I have no real “free time.”

I spent so many years wishing I had money for a four year so I can do all the cool college stuff I see on tv. I wanted to be a jock on the football team. I wanted to join every club, and hit the gym all day every day. I wanted to be invited to every party. But that’s just not realistic. Truth is, if I’m not focusing on class, I’m studying for technical interviews to land a high paying job. And I’m dealing with the same loneliness. Nothings changed. 

Why? Why charge thousands in tuition to help run rec centers and sports teams and clubs and e-sports game rooms, knowing that we will never have time to appreciate these things? Why sell me a dream? College was nothing like it was supposed to be according to what I’ve heard. It’s just more stressful highschool.

1915,albynalbynalbyn,1645068849,1,"Hi. I've been getting really anxious about not having people to hang out... Back when I was at university about 10 years ago I had plenty people to hang out, or if no one called I could just pass by several spots and find people I knew there. Nowadays it is obviously a younger crowd which I've hang out with but their convos are just not my thing, like I can hang out with them but I'm forcing myself to talk about their stuff which is just now my thing.  


Having a girlfriend would be great but the more women I meet, the less I want to be in a relationship. I've had a lot of serious, non serious, one night stand, fuckf riend and all those complicated things people embark and cannot manage at all. After 20 years of that, I can say I dont want it anymore and I'm ready for a LTR but good luck with that now with the 'mee too' and 'micro rape' and 'safe space' and things I dont want to get involved with. I lean left but finding a sane partner that also leans left is getting more difficult and the younger the person the worst it'll be ideologically.   


\[anecdote, you can skip to next paragraph: &gt;!my last partner was 39 (I'm 38) and I was amazed by how we were supposed to be in the same ideological spectrum but even my radical left leaning views (my BA is Sociology, the Europe classic view, not this Anthony Giddens mac n cheese thing, punk rock, went and still go to protests and march, etc) and that woman would outleft me on women and lgbtt+ rights in such bizarre, unsustainable with no path to plausibility... but she did. Voraciously and uninformedly that I would facepalm and think ""The F\* I want this in my life. Like I dont want a second, gtfo a lifetime"". She was like that and her numerous, good looking, normal looking, successful female friends and colleagues were all also in this extreme views. In short: There are a lot of normal looking people that are in a contaminated extreme view of things so if you are in the middle and chill and such things are not important then you'll not have a good time.\]!&lt;  


Then comes the people I could ask to go hang out but I dont want to. One of my horrible traits (most people have it, they just wont accept it) is that I, by second nature and something as an adult now catch myself doing, is that I give people certain social currency: you are fun, play an instrument, know whats going on? Then you are desirable. Are you just like clumsy, dorky and just not fun then you get to the bottom of the heap. Same thing about attractiveness, if you look good then there is a better chance of looking approachable than you just not having good genes. Of course if you are ugly but have a great, fun, outgoing personality then this is the card to trump all. There are people my age I still see hanging out and a few places but I've hang out wit them before and are well in the alcoholic/drug fiend bracket or are kinda deadbeats with negative convos like they are broke, have this problem with the law ,etc. Not something that I can learn and feel elevated and feel grateful about this opportunity to learn... nope, just bad stuff.  


So thats my dilemma: Going out by myself will connect me with mostly younger people with not a lot of things in common, forcing myself to talk things I dont like or feel pasionate about. Finding a girlfriend that seems to be a unicorn, exasperated by the 'me too' cancel culture and ruining your reputation just becasue thats ""what has to be done"" and finally, having the option of these people that I know, I wont have fun or are drug fiends, alcoholics, problematic (i.e. street fighting, car racing, etc).  


Not sure you noticed but I havent mentioned \*my\* frineds, and thats because most are married, living in another country/state/geographically far or just do not like to go out.   


I'm an extrovert but even if I manage to talk to strangers with ease, it just dies there and it's very strange me or the other part engage in development. So finally this is all very tiring and I feel like throwing the towel. For real if I was to find something at least 50% what I want I could do this forever but I think I'm becoming more me and the world is moving faster away from me than I thought. Maybe one thing to try is joining some club like chess. I want company but from a very very small fraction of the population that each day gets smaller hence difficult to fulfill. Should I just quit and start to adapt to beign alone doing longer stints of time, making each part longer until 100%?

I’m a 27 year old man. But I feel like a kid trying to get by..

I feel like a failure. Everything is wrong no matter how right.
I could buy a meal for a homeless guy and he will probably be allergic to it. 

Everything I do is a fuck up.
I am trying so hard to be a grown up but I just can’t. Stress is taking a huge toll on me, Physically even.
I’m in pain, everything hurts. I’m sad and even when I am surrounded by loved ones I feel alone.

Things I loved doing with people I hold dear to me just seem like something I am forced to do.
But when I am without those people I feel even worse.

I currently sit here alone. Quarantining. With a brand new diagnosis of Bell’s Palsy.
I am sick of crying. Im sick of feeling hopeless. I am so fucking tired of the constant racing heart, of the chest pains that feel like a heart attack. I keep running back to doctors and they say my heart is “ok”.

So what is it? Anxiety? How the fuck do you calm anxiety down? By telling me to calm down has helped fuck all.

I’m done with the headaches.

But I am especially tired of working so hard to try being a good individual. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I don’t want to bother anyone.
I don’t want to put anybody down.
I just want help and can’t find it.
I want someone to try to understand that there IS something wrong with me.
I’m so tired.

I’m alone.
My head won’t let me move on. It tells me everything hates me. It tells me that everyone is better than me.
But it also tells me that happiness is impossible for me because bad things are inevitable and random. And frequent.

Just wanted to make a post to express to everyone some insights I have had recently.

In October of last year I lost my cell phone, and since then have made the decision to not get purchase one. Not having a phone has been a blessing in many ways, but the change in my social life has been profoundly terrible. 

The friends that I did have, started inviting me to less and less events and eventually stopped inviting me altogether. Now they don't even want to be around me because ""I'm just too out of the loop.""

 I also was going out with a girl and she broke up with me in December. She said that ""I just can't date someone who can't text."" I honestly can't blame her because it probably felt terrible to not be able to reach out.

And honestly, who doesn't have a phone in todays age???

1943,pleasefeelbadimdead,1645056541,1,"So I've written stories all my life, everything from comics to screenplays etc. I'm in my late twenties and I struggle with mental illnesses, self loathing, last time I had a girlfriend was in High School--yada yada, it goes on and on--so for the past several years I've tried ""working on myself"" and all that jazz. Well, I fused both my passions and my struggles together and decided to write a novel about loneliness, depression, suicide, something that could help people who haven't experienced these things personally learn and then help them understand their peers who have experienced these things.

The thing is, in order to make it more palatable and not a total gloom and doom trip, I made the novel a dark satire. Some of the main points of the novel are to satirize therapeutic creativity and the modern need for representation, but how people with mental illnesses i.e. people who are Neurodiverse basically have NO representation.

Well, I've submitted it all around the industry to over one hundred literary agents and the rejections I've received that aren't just plain form rejections state my writing is well done, but ""too controversial."" I've taken criticism all my life, but for some reason these particular comments have just shattered me. Too controversial? How can my life--how can OUR lives--be too controversial? Everything I wrote about was genuine and honest. 

I feel like everywhere I go, I'm constantly faced with people trying to discredit me. They tell me I don't know what I'm talking about or that I don't try hard enough. All I've ever done is try. I just don't understand what people want. Some of the agents even suggested I tone down my novel and move away from the depression and suicidal struggles...well then what's the point of writing it then? Don't people know that this constant invalidation is one of the things that actually drives suicidal thoughts?

...If I even had idea of who was I anymore.

People say that before lovin someone else i gotta love myself, that self love is the key of happiness, but...how the fuck am I supposed to love myself if there is no reason for me to do so?

I'm hideous: I hate going to the beach, i hate wearing short sleeve shirts, I hate wearing pants that don't cover at all my legs, and I hate going out without a face mask (even before quarantine), all because I don't like to look at myself in front of a mirror.

Even if I do not consider myself a bad person, my good values aren't enough to compensate my flaws, doesn't even help that staying insolated in the last two years only withered my mental health.

My life is nothing interesting: While some of my fellow mates and relatives have done cool things in their lives such as becoming top players on my country, working in mid-high projects as freelancers, getting sports scholarships to Greece or having a biz for their own. What about me? What have I done in my life? NOTHING. I'm not a freelancer programmer/animator, I don't run a biz, I'm not a top player nor a successful streamer, not even playing for a soccer team, I'm just a plain and boring college student who has nerdy hobbies (like if that wasn't enough to make me less appealing) and still live with his parents.

I have no talents, and if I ever had a talent, I soon get outclassed: Am I good at drawing? Well, I will never reach the level of my favourite artists and even my sister does better. Am I smart? My friend is smarter than me. Do I have skills in a game? The rest of the boys make me look like a noob.

I really tried to do anything for myself, I gave my best, even losing sleep time, yet I barely see any improvements, specially my social skills, i was already a shy and introvertive guy, and now trapped in my house I can't develop them anymore, specially having a mother who watches after me like how the FNAF animatronics watch after the security guard. I can barely go away from home for my own, sicne everything has to be a goddamn family trip. I may sound self-centered or disgraceful, but at this point, the love of my family, God or even my pets is not enough to fill me anymore.

11 years ago I was convinced to take care of a puppy dog. We was in a provisional home and (if there was no other choice) he would end up in a family where the humans had full-time jobs and he wouldn’t have had a very good life. Back then I was squatting. I adopted that dog as a brother. He was my best friend. I have always been quite alone, but he was always there for me. They say loved children have lots of names. I would call my brother by a dozen different names.

He would always listen to me. I talked to him about everything. I talked so much to him the whole time that he thought everything going on with me was about him. For example, if I’d get angry, he would think I was angry with him. Then I would feel very guilty “no brother, it’s not about you. I’m not angry with you”

I got in a lot of troubles because I refused to have him on a leash. I finally got a letter from the company owning my apartment and we had to be tied to each other when outside. I like bushcraft and primitive skills and there’s some forest near where I live. There was less trouble to get into by having him loose in the forest, so we were there a lot. We spent days and nights in the forest. Sometimes he would stay by my side and sometimes he would wander off a bit.

It isn’t much of a substitute, but it’s the best I’ve ever had, and a large part of me thinks it’s the best I’ll ever have. Having a different face completely ruined any chance I might have had of a normal love/sex life as an adolescent and young adult.

But I do nothing. I grind for my degree, do drugs, and play games. I'm an avid gym rat, but thats more for my own sanity/body dysmorphia, a distraction from things (like constant longing for this girl) that are out of my control.

I would probably do the same, and I hate that about myself because I think it’s weird and probably not healthy? I would love for us to both have a small world, where we spend most of our time together and we do pretty much everything together. I want to be dependent on them and for them to be dependent on me. Of course trust is important and stuff, and I don’t want a relationship where we’re jealous over every little thing the other person does.

Maybe this is just my brain going haywire from being lonely and having social anxiety for so long and if I was in a relationship like this, I actually wouldn’t enjoy it, idk. Maybe this type of thing is normal and I just don’t know anyone who likes this type of relationship dynamic.

Hey I’m [M] 28, I feel lonely even though I’m married and have a group of really good friends. 

So to start I’m married we’ve been together for 7years it started amazing. We were constantly touching holding loving eachother. Now we touch in passing most times I try and be physical or passionate I receive. An annoyed look and response. We kiss when I leave for work in the morning and when I get back from work in the evening. Maybe once or twice as I am up and about doing things around the house. 

I love my wife but she’s become even more distant since the end of her pregnancy and birth of our daughter. So on top of her being distant physically and emotionally. She hasn’t worked for almost a year now. Making me the sole breadwinner for a relationship that was designed around 2 active incomes.At first it was nice she did all the chores and made dinner. Then that all stopped and I’ve had to pick up even more slack. Every financial issue causes more problems. That basically seem to be my fault.

I have a small group of friends I was the one who met and introduced everyone to bring motley crew of guys together. The shortest relationship among them is around 9 years and the longest is 25. We all used to hangout, party and go out every weekend now it seems I’m usually just an after thought for plans. They’ve all become better friends with eachother than with me. The point we’re they’ll literally make plans infront of me and then shrug it off with a don’t worry man you don’t need to be there every time. 

So I’ve reached out on platforms like Reddit for alternative forms of intimacy. But it seems they burn hot but burn really really fast and they lose interest. And I alway somehow always find the one I like most lives too far away to even make it feasible… not sure if that’s coincidental or just my subconscious. 

I’m just so burnt on life and have no idea what to do anymore.

Just had a birthday so all the shortcomings in life are being magnified and nothing is changing in my life no matter how hard I try to make a change. 2 steps forward 1 step back, then it's probably 2 steps forward 4 steps back etc etc. 

Trying to stay positive but it's tough. Thought about deleting Reddit today morning coz I realized there's so much vile, depressing, toxic stuff on here. When you're scrolling and 95% of it is deplorable it starts to weigh on your mental psyche. Losing faith in everything altogether. 5 days straight rain forecast where I live which absolutely kills all motivation I could possibly have to do anything at all. 

Being a good person doesn't mean shit anymore. What's so difficult is trying not to fall into bad habits and develop negative thought patterns even though it's always surrounding you wherever you go and whatever you do. 

I want to have someone to confide in and trust and have debates with but you cannot trust ANYONE. Your life can be ruined within a few clicks or your whole self esteem and self worth can be shattered within seconds. 

The one thing I haven't tried so far is face to face therapy which itself is not even possible to get now because of restrictions. The next best thing was to have phone calls or possibly zoom calls but it was all a complete shit show from the so-called mental health professionals from all parties involved. Didn't even book a session before I decided to be done with it. They have no respect, no morals or values and I truly cannot comprehend how they were able to become therapists, counselors, etc. 

At a complete loss, as per usual. My parents are the only people I can trust and talk to so I guess with that I'm still luckier than most but they unfortunately cannot provide the kind of support and actual companionship I need (obviously) and I am living away from them anyway at the moment. 

Suicide has made a return to my daily thoughts which I really didn't think would happen again. Just goes to prove that things can indeed always get worse rather than better, and I'm not fully surprised either. 

There is very surprisingly a girl that has recently entered my radar and I have a slither of hope that I could develop something decent with her. Problem is that I've never been in a relationship and coupled with the huge amount of  information I have absorbed on relationships, sexual dynamics, modern dating, etc I really don't know how to go about pursuing her and if it's even worth it. I am honestly scared shitless that it won't work out and she'll just leave me heartbroken and mentally destroyed. 

Very surreal/out of body experience I'm feeling. Just wave after wave of crushing solitude, anxiety, small hope then denial day in day out. I can't seem to develop bonds with anyone and guess I have to except responsibility and acknowledge that I am probably projecting all these thoughts and emotions unknowingly to everyone around me (which is limited to maybe 3 people only anyway). 

Struggling constantly, battling my mind. I am still strong, no vices or addictions. However, the loneliness and anxiety/self-doubt is slowly but surely killing me literally. Science says chronic loneliness is akin to smoking heavily every day or whatever it was. Basically it brings real, tangible health issues. I feel myself slowly but surely withering away spiritually and physically.

Im so lonely. I’ve been lonely for so long. I haven’t really been with anyone in years. I made out with this girl in February of last year and that was about it (nothing else happened with her again cause she basically said she regretted it). I masturbate every day and I can’t stand it, it’s just annoying and mostly done out of boredom at this point. I at least stay away from porn now, but still. (And NoFap doesn’t work for me, just never has, just don’t bother with that shit please). Dating apps haven’t worked for me much. A few dates here and there, but I just never felt any connection. I felt like I was just desperately picking whoever wanted me, which made me feel low.
Last woman I was with (we were dating without a title?) pretty much fucked me up emotionally, and still is, even when we aren’t talking. I can’t let go of that pain. I can’t move on. I feel like im just not good at relationships whether they’re serious or casual. I don’t find myself to be physically unattractive or anything like that, but women can smell my low self-esteem from a mile away. And I can’t fix it. My self-esteem is non-existent and I’ve gone through therapy so much throughout the years, but nothing has worked. Im a lost cause. I can’t fucking do this anymore, I’m just mentally exhausting myself and I feel like there’s no way out. I’m just existing. 
It’s not like I have a bad life. I have a job I actually like, friends and family that care for me, and my own place. But I’m just not happy. I just don’t believe I’m good enough for a relationship of any kind and that it’ll stay like that. I worry even if I start seeing someone, it’ll be out of desperation rather than genuine interest.

Maybe she’s trying to get over social anxiety herself and saw me as an easy person to talk at cuz she knew I wouldn’t respond with anything more than “thanks” . But I know I didn’t smell nice, I have to walk a kilometer to school and anxiety makes sure I sweat unless it’s below like 5C. Plus I badly needed a shower. My one guess for *what* she could’ve honestly smelled was my dry shampoo, it’s pretty fragrant on the way out at least. But I still don’t have a goddamn clue why she’s comment on it.

And as narcissistic as it feels, whenever something like this happens I inevitably end up imaging they like me. I can’t fucking stop it, it just happens. I know they can’t, they can’t. No one ever did when I was giving a shit about looking likable, why would anyone like me now that I’ve stopped caring? I don’t even have a personality in public, I’m just a scared but polite NPC reacting to other people. There’s nothing there for anyone to like. But I still think it and it gets me terrified because being loved is all I’ve really wanted from life since I was 13, but I know I’m shit and anyone can do better than me and I just hurt people and mess up and I don’t even have enough energy for friendships let alone a relationship. So if someone actually liked me, I’d either take the opportunity and fail and hurt them and hate myself for that, or I’d skip the opportunity and never forget it and hate myself for that.

To begin my story, I am a hungarian guy, 21 years old, and I reached to a point in my life, where I require a big help. Since 16 I am working, tried to have a job to get money. As long as I was in a High School everything was OK. I had a girlfriend (2.5 year long relationship) I had friends, and I had a lot of planned free time activities. As I finished school for a period of time I had my friends around from the school but we drifted apart. I started to work hard, like 16-18 hours per day, and I did this 7/7 a week. I got tired, and my colleagues introduced me metamphetamine. I used that for a bit but as you expected, I got TOTALLY exhausted and I started to not arrive to work in time. I Was always late, and now for the result I got fired. After 2-3 days of sleep, I realized that I am in a huge trouble. I dealt with the drug problem, I havent used meth since I was fired (2 month) and I am not addicted to it. But the real problem, is I haven’t got any friends, no communities etc.. I know myself that I am a “community centered” person, I love to make people laugh, arrange meetings, and back in the times, I used to have a medium sized community, as a secomd family. I really loved it, thats where I met my girlfriend, and i Have really really good memories from these times.  But now, I have nothing. I feel empty and I feel that I am dying inside because of that. I need a girlfriend, I need a community, a group of friends, I need to socialize. But I can’t. I don’t know where to start, how can I make friends, or how can I reach to the point to have a girlfriend, or a stable group of friends, I feel that I am lost. How would you solve this situation?

But it's gotten bad. I can no longer interact with strangers. I find it really hard to find interest in them. It's starting to scare me. I lost the ability to socialize and to care about people. And now it's bleeding into my work relationships. I interact with maybe one or two people a week. And by interact I mean maybe a 15 min conversation. I feel so incapable and so alone. It's just a deep sadness I feel. Ever so slight. Sometimes I feel like I'll be this way forever and it's scary.",lonely,A profoundly deep yet subtle sadness,2022-02-16 10:21:20

2099,Lspnrodsgwp,1644965625,1,"Not sure how I ever became lonely, but I have. 

I go to college and see others there, although 80% of the classes are still on zoom. I know a couple people there and think they're cool, although I don't spend time outside of class with any of them and due to the limited interaction it would probably be weird to ask to hang out and stuff. I am at school twice a week for 3 hours at a time, different classmates for each time. 

I have had a girlfriend for over 2 years at this point, although for a long time now she is literally at work 6 days a week from 8-9 AM til 8-9:15 PM and I only usually get 30 minutes or less of actual interaction with her a day. 

I have had many friends over the years, but have lost touch with all of them and had some relationships go bad for one reason or another. Many have moved away because I went to boarding high school. 

All that's left are my parents. Although they live over an hour away and are both full-time high-producing professionals who rarely have a minute to chat. Although they are the closest things I have to friends as i talk to each 1-3 times a week on the phone. 

I work at my desk on my computer at home, whether on schoolwork or individual projects, literally all day every day. Every once in a while I'll go to the gym and swim, and sometimes I'll go grocery shopping or run other errands. But that's it. I eat the same food for more or less every meal, I sit in the same desk all day with few exceptions, and there is only one person who I see more than once a week. I interact with people face-to-face perhaps 5 times a week. I recently watched a documentary on solitary confinement, and I was depressed to see that even those prisoners get more social stimulation than I do. 

So I just sit here, cold and lonely, trying to find motivation to keep working but I can't when nothing feels exciting. I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm just whining, and if it does sound like that then it's because I am I guess; I just don't have anyone to express my feelings to and I feel immeasurably lonely every day. 

How can I meet people and develop a deep relationship with them? I've done it very many times in the past, but it just seems my current life circumstance is different and I don't have anyone to spend time with, and I don't know how to meet others when it is not done for my by school, work, or some other thing.

2101,Miserable-Neat3318,1644964175,1,"I'm scared of a lot of things, the most significant being loss.

The thought of losing those around me has prevented me from maintaining meaningful connections, I keep everyone at an arms length. The few times my vulnerability is shown, I simply break down. 

I think this stems from loosing my cousin, who was like my older brother growing up. He died about a year ago-I was so busy, I never had the chance to see him before he passed. He was only 25 and died from an opioid overdose, I had no idea he even used drugs like that. My aunt, uncle, mother, other cousins, and boyfriend are addicts. Meanwhile, I can't even have more than one drink and have never even touched drugs/ nicotine. 

Most days, I can get by with the facade of being present. I got dragged to a club by a friend and she brought along her ""poser"" NYC friends (daddy's money types). I was playing along with this unbearable situation, acting like I was having fun because I should be right? 21 and in NYC? 

That's not what happened. My friend began to see right through me and I could tell she was analyzing my demeanor, trying to understand what was off about me. I couldn't act anymore, so I shut down and fled the situation the earliest opportunity I could with a half-assed explanation of why I needed to leave early. 

Since then, I feel broken. Like I can't manage to keep this act up, but if I crumble, my whole ""life"" will fall apart. 

My significant other has been gone for about a month and a half and gets back next week, he is the only person who has seen me really vulnerable, and I regret that. He does not understand the extent of my situation, I don't expect him or anyone to. I told him I feel awful and kept it simple, it's lonelier saying I need someone and having nobody there. 

I can't muster up acting like I'm okay, I almost find it easier to cut him and everyone else off completely. 

Is that even a good idea? Not sure. I just know I am feeling deeply broken, I want to be alone with no distractions but this might only push me further into this depression.",lonely,What are you scared of?,2022-02-16 09:29:35

But last night when she called, she told me had to prioritize her family and didn't care enough to prioritize this relationship. This friendship was not worthy of her upkeep and her emotional energy. I let her say what she needed to say. I didn't fight it. Part of me knew this was coming since her husband and I don't get along. 
We haven't spoken since October until yesterday. I had drove by her place to drop off her Galentines day gift. She told me she was too busy for dinner or even a lunch with me so I figured driving by was good enough.

2106,throwaway_61602,1644959812,1,"My parents are on a completely different level of strictness as I've seen other strict parents. I know, I sound like any other teenager, but it's true. My parents see things in a very extreme way most of the time. 

When I started highschool, I was moved to a virtual homeschooling program to 'protect me from bad influences'. The year between the start of ninth grade and the start of the pandemic was alright, mostly. My only friends were from church, and even then they were just the 'friends during the good times' type of friends. I'm not religious but have to fake it to keep my life from becoming a living hell. So, with these 'friends' I was never my true self, just a fictional version of me that had almost no interests because I couldn't actually aay what I was interested in without getting reprimanded. 

Then the pandemic started, and my parents decided this was worse than the bubonic plague(not literally, but they just treat it as if). I have not had any physical contact with my church 'friends'. I have no phone nor am I allowed socials, so no way of communicating with them. When I say I have no social interaction in real life, I mean it. It's 100% the truth, unless you count my parents. I avoid my parents because they always make me feel bad about whatever it is I'm doing. 

So long story short, I have friends now. Online friends. A best friend. A crush. All online. I see pictures of them hanging out with their friends, going out, actually enjoying what should be the carefree teen years, while I can't do any of that. I feel envious, then feel bad for feeling jealous, and this loop of hatred for my life starts. I spend all day imagining what it'd be like to have a normal life, but when I get snapped back to reality and remember I will never have the life I should I feel a terrible pain. I'm depressed all the time, emotionally numb unless it's a negative feeling.

Now, I feel terrible just talking to any of my online friends. I feel annoying, like I'm stealing their time, and like it's all pointless. But when I push people away and they leave I feel worse. I've become obsessive with my friends, and that unintentionally pushes some away. I feel jealous of them for having a life, and I hate it. I am just so lonely all the time. In real life I am completely expressionless and plain because I guess I've gotten used to letters and not physical presence. I feel like everyone hates me, or will eventually. I try not to bother anyone, but it gets to the point where I can't handle it and practically explode with emotions. 

I need help. I want to learn to handle the loneliness. How to handle the fact I'll never have my teen years. That the best days of my life will be worse than everyone elses. I've tried begging my parents to let me go places with my church 'friends', but even without the pandemic I wouldn't be allowed, not without parent supervision. I've always been the sore thumb in the church friend group, the guy that shows up with his parents everywhere and that never has anything to say. I'm so sick of my life and wish I could start over with a different story. I've never found anyone as isolated as me, and that makes me feel even more lonely.

2108,Berserker-Hamster,1644959407,1,"So, I finished How I Met Your Mother the other day for - I think - the fourth time. And despite the fact that I love the show I can't help but wonder about the view society has on dating and romance.

Because the story of HIMYM is the story that is everywhere: you go on dates and you meet someone special and maybe you'll find that this person is not the one for you and you break up. But finally - just when you're about to give up - you'll find that special person. The one who makes you happy for the rest of your life. The end.

That is the only way it goes, right? There is no other possible ending. Everyone finds someone, right?

Except for the few who don't. A percentage of people that is too small to even think about. The ones who don't go on dates, who don't know how it feels like to hear the words ""I love you"", who don't know what it feels like to wake up next to someone they love and who loves them back, who come home to an empty apartment night after night after night.

The whole shabang of dating, kissing, cuddling, having fun together, laughing together, making memories together - the stuff that is as natural as breathing for 99.999% of people - we will never get to know that.

I am now 35 years old and I've never even been on a first date. No woman I've ever met has shown any romantic interest in me because I'm unattractive, boring and have zero confidence. I already have gray hairs in my beard before I even know what a first kiss feels like and at this point I probably have a higher chance to get hit by lightning than to ever find a girlfriend. Some days, like today, I have a hard time accepting this but all in all there is nothing I can do about it anymore. No woman in the world would date a 35yo ugly uninteresting loser like me. And I don't blame them for it. I'm just not boyfriend material.

Life feels pretty hollow and gray when you have no one to share it with. My only purpose left is to make the world a little better, a little brighter - for the people who actually have a chance of finding happiness on it. Because despite of it all I still love this beautiful world and the people on it. And I need to leave it better than I found it. That is why I'm still here and why I won't take an early exit although there is no silver lining for me. I'm gonna plant the tree even though I will never sit in it's shadow.

If anyone has read so far, my hat goes off to you. This was more of a public journal entry for me and I don't really expect anyone to read it all. But if anyone did I wish you a nice rest of your day and all the best.

(This applies to straight men, but if you’re gay, non-binary, or another woman, feel free to comment because I’m still curious)


Not gonna lie, I can’t see myself being with someone who currently has a healthy mind set and social life. I don’t like being “the mentally ill” one in a relationship. I like crying with people and listening to their emotions and problems. I have absolutely no idea how to connect with someone who wasn’t as or more mentally ill as me because I’m uncomfortable being the one who needs consoling. So that’s why I’m asking on this subreddit rather than asking on a place like AskMen.

I’m 20 now, and I have some stuff I want to do for self improvement so I can become the person I want to be, but I want an end goal of meeting someone and getting into relationship. I don’t care if I have to work on myself for years. I’m so hopeless and lonely, I feel like that end goal might encourage me, and I don’t mind waiting a long time if it means I’m going to improve and be able to make more friends because that’s also something I want. I know it’s childish, but my ideal scenario is to meet lots of people and become friends first and then fall in love, rather than hanging out with people specifically to date them. 

I was thinking maybe I could work up to being comfortable meeting people at conventions for anime, comics, video games, etc. (I have social anxiety, so that’s difficult). Other than that, I have absolutely no idea how to meet other lonely people. I spend most of my free time in my home, and I’m assuming a lot of other lonely people do the same. I play video games, but most of them are single player. I go to college, but it’s too difficult making lasting connections and I’m not on campus long enough to hang out with anyone.

I’ve tried dating apps in the past, but I feel like it wasn’t right for me. I’m so used to people instantly clicking with me by trauma dumping on me and me listening and consoling them that I had no idea what to talk about when I ran out of general topics. When texting men, I would try to make the conversation more emotional to get them to open up, but it seemed like a lot of dudes weren’t comfortable with it or maybe they just were generally happy in their lives and didn’t have any issues to talk about? I’m not sure, but I was so discouraged that after around a month, I deleted all my accounts. I can only handle so much small talk. I want someone else who also wants deeper conversations.

I hate that my type is dudes who are loners and live perpetually on the internet because I have no idea how to meet them.

So tired of this small talk I have to keep doing when ever I meet someone and then it just ends and that's it so gotta repeat the whole fucking process again. Why cant I just kill whatever need to be with others. Why cant I just be happy alone because clearly that's all I'll ever be is alone. Theres nothing that can fix this and every year it gets more difficult. I'm so tired of it.,lonely,Woke up in the middle of the night.,2022-02-16 05:30:21

I feel like I can never be my genuine self around others. I am one man with a million different faces depending on what situation I’m in, however, I rarely ever express who I am on the inside. When I am at school, I am a student. At home I am a brother or son. With buddies, an amigo. But I never talk about what means most to me unless I am doing something creative like writing or painting. This to me is loneliness, when people care about the behaviors of others and not what matters most to that person. If a robot replaced me and mimicked my behaviors and speech, would anyone care?

I wonder if everyone is like this. Is everyone like uninhabited islands surrounded by a vast ocean. We may see each others surfaces but never truly explore who that person is. Maybe everyone has something very unique about them, but no one will ever know because no one stops to try to truly understand that person. 

I can never get to know everyone I meet, but if everyone has a few people that truly understand them, that may be good for us. But I don’t know any person who have this kind of relationship with someone else.

2153,KiwiDelicious,1644938924,1," I just wanted to share my story, I don't know why I want to but maybe this will help someone else.   


So  I just wanted to get out of the red pill mindset, the black pill the  incel mindset. I am 31 years old and the last time I had a girlfriend  was in high school. It went on for 8 years and ended in 2014. First I'll  talk about the relationship a bit. I was the goth kid in my high  school. I was great with making friends and talking to people. I had a  don't care attitude about things. I just liked making friends and making  people happy. So at that time I was desperate for any female attention.  I would notice my friends girlfriends would leave them and gravitate  toward me. My friends didn't have as much confidence as me and I was  always the class clown and doing weird stuff to get attention. I loved  when their girlfriends hung around me and sometimes they would leave  them to hang with me. I was into watching porn a ton while I was  younger. I had huge collections of it on my computer (still do). But one  of the girls that left my friend she liked me and I didn't like her at  first, she felt troublesome but hey it was a female and I wanted that  attention. Before I met her I was friends with the popular kid in  highschool, we didn't have the same interests but we spoke often. He  always hung around girls and girls seemed to be all over him. He would  talk and show how much phone numbers he got and I would lie saying I got  a couple as well.   


So I was with this girl for a total of 8  years. It wasn't a good experience. I was so open-minded talking and  making friends with everyone around me and she never had that ability.  She was like a slave in her own house and had to do everything for her  family. She never made or had much friends. She would get upset if I  looked or even spoke to other people and even though I didn't like her  at first we hung out more and more and eventually I liked her. I started  skipping school with her. The female attention I was receiving was  amazing. I didn't get to have sex with her for the first 2 years, she  kept saying she didn't want to just give it up so easily. That I had to  earn it. So I did.. I ended up giving up most or all of my friendships  in those years. It was me and her and I liked her... I didn't love her. I  never did finish high school. My grades were so horrible. I tried to  make her happy so many times, it didn't always work. Trying to make her  happy felt like a full time job but I was happy when things did work  out. I grew up with a lot of anger issues from my own family and getting  angry at her felt like a double edge sword. I was stabbing my anger at  her but it also stabbed me. Getting angry at someone you like is  annoying. Throughout those 8 years we had sex 6 times. She hated that I  was bi-sexual. She always brought up stuff like being her knight and  shining armor and I dunno... at times I did find myself going to LGBT  Centers and meeting new people. This mostly happened on our breakups and  once again I found myself making friends in 3-6 months. Eh, I never got  into sex or anything but it sometimes almost happened. You see I was a  shy person until people cracked my shy bubble then I was the most  talkative open person you'd ever meet. I liked her because well I was  afraid of STD's (still am) so it felt nice to be with someone who I  could share things with and be with someone that didn't have any  diseases. But I knew she didn't accept me fully for me and I didn't want  to leave the relationship.   


I kept telling myself that being in a  bad relationship was better then being alone. But there would be so  much times when I got home from hanging out with her telling myself that  I'm just sad and frustrated. I didn't believe in love and sex was  something I felt like I was begging for. I did want a family, I always  wanted to create the family I never had. At 2014 when I was 24 I  convinced myself that this was it. This relationship had gotten to me so  badly that I tried to k\*ll myself. There is so much details that this  would end up becoming a book. After it was over, in about a week I  contacted her back asking if we could be friends. Being alone felt like  death. Me and my family didn't get along at all. I wasn't the favorite  child. I realized that maybe I didn't want love, maybe I just wanted  sex. But clearly I didn't know how to get it. I found videos in 2015  about PUA and RedPill. I loved those videos because I felt like I was  that blue pill nice guy. I grew up watching Disney movies and always  tried to be nice to people even giving up food to others if it meant I  would go hungry. I loved making people happy because it meant I had  purpose in this world. It meant that I wasn't a waste of space. In  middle school I attempted to get run over by a car, since then I figured  I'd help people anyway I can to give my life meaning.   


The thing  with PUA is that I always felt like ""Aren't you still simping for these  women?"" same with MGTOW. All this bitterness and some of it I felt like  I understood. The whole divorce r\*pe thing. That the court is in favor  of females. It all scared me to know that my life could be ruined by  interacting with females. I tried following MGTOW because it felt the  easiest. I mean PUA was okay and I read many books about it but it  didn't feel like me, it felt like I was taking advantage of females. I'm  not a mean person or I try not to be. I figured I just work on being by  myself, a lone wolf. I figured I'd forget about women but over the  years I started to hate them. The fact that women can get a guy just by  being alive. Even ugly women had a better chance then most men. It felt  unfair and I wished to be bornin the 80s or something. I never said  things like, ""Women Belong in the Kitchen."" I felt if I had a woman I  would treat them well. I wanted to love but didn't believe in it. I  looked into prostution to get rid of my needs but I live in NYC and well  I hear nothing but how cops arrest guys like that. It angered me that  prostitution was illegal. What the hell are lonely guys to do? I felt  screwed. Like women had this advantage that I never knew about. That a  girl can easily pick and choose who she wanted but a man could go years  without even a single hug.   


Like I said I looked up a lot of  things and I told myself I'd work on myself and forget women. Don't pay  attention to them. Now... problem was I still liked women. At least how  they looked. Even though I was Bi-sexual I liked men who's body was more  feminine. I never liked big giant muscles or hairy guys. So in a way it  felt like I liked the personality of a guy with the body of a female.  But I haven't dated either. Hell dating feels weird on its own. I like  gaming, I like p\*rn, I stayed home a lot to save money because I don't  spend it a lot. I also lived with my parents and they would never accept  a female coming inside. Not like I knew how to get their attention.  Talking to random people who didn't first break my shy bubble was...  unheard of. Even to guys, I didn't want to pester or bother people. But  as I said I can be very talkative and try to make jokes. Either way it's  2022 and while playing a visual novel dating game.... yeah... I kept  telling myself I would like to be around or be with a decent down to  earth girl. Maybe not marriage but to at least laugh and joke around  with. I don't even know where to start. I just know that I hate this  red-pill crap. I hate thinking I'm some beta male when I'm somewhat  intelligent with technology, I love helping people, I love being there  for people, I'm very good with kids and a great motivator for other  people. I don't want to hate anyone and I feel like at 31 I'm too old. I  know deep down I'm a basement dwelling loser who hated women for all  the wrong reasons. This year I got my GED, I lost 70lbs and I got into  calisthenics. I just know I don't want to hate people anymore. I don't  want to hate women because if a woman gave me attention I wouldn't throw  it away. I know I should treat women like people and not think of whats  between their legs. I know I should get better at socializing and maybe  I should spend money to just go out and find where fun where tons of  people are... it still doesn't mean I'd talk.

2158,jellybeanbea,1644938569,1, I have realized this bitter truth about life and don't really want to try to love anyone anymore. Everything feels really temporary and fake. Why would you want love to be loved when you can be replaced by just anyone in a jiffy? I really don't understand why people place so much importance on things that only give us temporary happiness? Loving yourself and people around you is enough. That's a lot more than most of us can handle. People do not know how to love someone truly. That's okay because we as humans can only do so much. Idk why so many people feel incomplete when they are single like stop it..no seriously stop. The very concept that we need someone else to feel complete is flawed. It's untrue. This thinking does more harm than good without us even realizing it.  We essentially undermine our own ability to be absolutely independent. Telling yourself that you need to be with someone to be happy is like mentally torturing yourself because you're constantly seeking out something without looking into yourself for your own needs. This puts undue pressure on the person you're with.  Relationships are only a temporary fix for emotionally wounded people nowadays. We should only be in a relationship when we want it not when we need it. Instead of being content with what you already have you tend to feel bitter because of the self created void you're so desperately trying to fill with what you think is love. If you feel like this it only means that you are in need of your own love. If you have read till here you'll realize that Valentine's Day is not only for couples. You can show yourself some love. Personally I think Valentine's Day is not really for showing people love because it actually just leaves people out also if you truly someone you can celebrate Valentine's Day with them everyday. The key to happiness is to realize that no one will love you the way you love yourself. You will never replace yourself but someone you met on Tinder last night definitely will.,lonely,"No matter how good,funny,interesting,attractive you are you will always be replaceable",2022-02-16 02:22:49

...No, I don't want to hurt anyone but I thought I'll mention my mental health right away because apparently people are freaking out the moment they hear a scary word that means ""he's not normal, ooooohhhh"". Seriously, this kind of treatment actually makes me want to hurt someone. Just because I'm sociopathic and I'm aware of it, doesn't mean I don't have enough room for 1-2 people or that I'm going to do something bad. Stop watching TV, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit and talk to that weird kid in the back of the classroom. You'll likely find someone more trustworthy than any of your trashy diva-friends or absolutely normal Real Men/Women who will talk behind your back and cheat at the first given opportunity.

With that out of the way... I'll repeat again - I hate most of the people and the way our world works, but that doesn't mean I don't have enough empathy for 1-2 friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22, male but leaning to non-binary. Not sure what to pick since you're all making identity into some kind of statement... Here's some facts about me:

* too white for absolutely beautiful ""non-monogamous vegan pagan PECAN"" liberal Americans to consider me a ""vulnerable individual"", haha; and too foreign for conservatives to consider me of their own, what a bummer! :(I'm actually pretty happy about this. I've been able to see just how unjust both sides are. Interacting with people and seeing how some react to my nationality has been very eye-opening. Especially since I used to have nationalistic views back in my homeland (Ukraine). Nowadays I don't care about politics at all, they're all about power fantasy. Just like a certain Arthur once said, ""I'm
* too h\*rny! Good girls and boys might want to RUUUUN from this little freak!! He's addicted to p\*rn and doesn't know how to stop, wowie! :O Not sure whether I actually like the stuff I'm watching or if it's simply a way of dealing with loneliness and frustration. Either way, I don't talk about these things. I just want to point this out to scare away those who run at the very mention of p\*rn. I think friends need to be able to discuss any problems. Had some girls who stopped messaging me just because I said I'm addicted to p\*rn and don't know what to do about it... not their problem, right?
* I watch anime and play video games non-stop. I literally went over all anime on MyAnimeList, added the ones I found even slightly interesting to my list (over 1900 entries) and plan to watch them all eventually. Luckily, my current job is not very strict and I get to watch anime pretty often. On a regular day I can watch about 5-8 episodes just at work, on a long day - 10+... The job I work at is pretty awful and boring, doesn't pay enough but being an immigrant, it's not like I can choose much. It's actually a big issue for me right now and I'm considering returning to my homeland once the situation with Russia calms down. It's hard to find a job here and everything is too expensive;
* I did mention games. Just like the anime, I went over the list of all the games released since the 90s and up to 2021. I've also made a wishlist of what I'm looking forward to in 2022 and beyond. Having played video games for pretty much all my life, they've been a very important part of me and I doubt it'll ever change. At this point I have a very refined taste and a sense of appreciation... but the bad side is that I believe in games far less than I used to. Regardless, I still enjoy them a lot.To give you an idea of my taste, I'll mention some upcoming 2022 games I'm looking forward to: Gran Turismo 7, Elden Ring, Monster Hunter Rise DLC, Mario + Rabbids: Spark of Hope, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, Triangle Strategy, Modern Warfare 2022 (mostly for the multiplayer), Babylon's Fall. And at work I usually play Fantasian or Hearthstone.I'm proud of my taste.
* Music is a complicated topic for me. I find most of the popular music to be very cringeworthy and poorly made, animalistic and lacking depth. So, there's very few artists and bands I listen to which make music with lyrics. Most of the time I listen to classical (Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven and other). I think music and hobbies in general provide a good overview of the person's inner world but people take their time finding what they actually enjoy and often don't find it at all. In the modern culture classical is frowned upon while stuff like country or rap, pop are applauded. It truly shows our world for what it is - obsessed with flash, lacking substance and depth. But maybe that's what we deserve for ruining the planet.

I expect you to be:

* over 20 years old. Children, go enjoy youth and don't talk to broken people like me, seriously. I've had numerous minors try to talk to me when I say ""only 20+ years old"" and this is rather annoying.
* not cisgender unless you're capable understanding different points of views.
* crazy because most of the people are awful and boring. ""Oh my gosh, what are your pronouns; I'm really sorry for your loss :( (NOT! XD)"". Seriously, if you're too normal, just go find someone to talk to in real life, do yourself a service.

But mostly it's just people from one country. So they have their own group, speak their own language. They know seniors very well as well because the seniors are from that country as well. 
I don't like going to parties and drinking exclusively. Also I am a introvert. All these things, combined with the fact that I don't know their language and there's so many of them, makes it impossible for me to make any friends. 

Usually I can ignore it but it gets very hard to study anatomy in labs on cadavers without any friends, and our professors don't teach so that's one more minus. 

Now these classmates of mine know seniors very well ( same country, big community of their own in our med school) so they know how to study and what to focus on for exams and what teachers like to ask. 

I am quite good at other subjects where I focus on lectures so they are usually very good to me during those subjects. But when it's anatomy and i am the one needing help and direction they all.. Basically behave like bitches. I think I should stop being so good.

Speaking of attractiveness, I'm not conventionally attractive by any means. Social media had done it's damage here I think.

My longest relationship was almost 3 years. I have multiple ex's.

2 weeks before Valentine's Day, my most recent ex cheated on me.

We would've been together 2 years in March. I shouldn't have gotten a place with him after only 1 year, but I did.

3 months left living here with this asshole, who admitted he's been lying to me since February 2020.

He never accepted my mental issues, even though the night we met I talked about A LOT, including how crazy I am.

I thought he was self aware enough of his own head illnesses, but turns out he's not and he wouldn't listen to reason.

It's not just my romantic life that's shit, I've been in people-induced Hell for over 2 decades.

People keep hurting me, false accusers/creepy stalkers/bad perverts/fake ""nice"" people/etcetcetc.

Drama, mental health, social problems aside:

I wish someone would rub my ugly feet/make them prettier.

I wish someone would cuddle me without needing sex.

I wish someone would say ""I love you"" during sex and actually mean it.

I wish someone would care about how I'm doing more than they care about my pussy.

I wish someone would help me and not see me as a burden.

I wish someone would actually understand.

I've gotten SO MUCH UNHELPFUL ADVICE when I complain, instead of people knowing what I'm talking about.

I just don't fit, I'm too ""dark"" for people or not ""dark"" enough.

I know how I look/sound/seem to the majority of people.

Just wish somebody would make me feel better or take me to a good place.

I'd say I want the pain to stop, but I've gone through the ""I don't care about anything or anyone"" emotionless phase, never want to do it again.

I couldn't even get laid because I'm picky AND now have to get a new std card, because sir CheatsAlot had sex with me after he had unprotected sex with that woman.

Plus I have to wait to get an std card until there's enough ""material for testing""

I don't even have platonic friends, just 2 neighbors who keep inviting rapists/rape supporters over.

How can they say they love me when they invite over a man who tried to force himself into my home twice?

How could he say he loved me when he was lying about accepting me from the day we met?

How do people say ""I love you"", but continue to knowingly hurt us, for no necessary reason??

At least now I know how cheaters and abusers sleep.

I'm exhausted and quietly sobbing right now, while my ex is on the other mattress sleeping soundly.

I just want to go to a good place with a good person or people.

we had class yesterday and i sat behind him (i usually sit next to him but was a bit anxious to do that) and i know he saw me but didn’t acknowledge my existence. he didn’t even come greet me after class like usual, he just left. the previous day he texted me asking about an assignment and i replied, but he still hadn’t replied by then… i thought it was strange. and after our class i texted him saying hi but received nothing back. today i’m supposed to see him again cuz we have class again but he’s been ignoring me. when we do talk, it feels like all we talk about is class now. idk what’s up with him but i’ve been speculating it’s either cuz he’s trying to distance himself from me because of his gf or he thinks i’m boring or something. it has just made me feel like complete shit and it hurts like hell. does he even consider me a close friend anymore?  he’s done a complete 180 within the past few weeks. i just want an answer…

i’m dreading sharing more classes with him this week. he probably still won’t reply to my messages. and i don’t try saying anything else out of fear i’m bothering him. i just fucking hate playing these mind games with people. you say i’m one of your closest friends one day, then all of a sudden i don’t exist to you. feels like no one values my existence and i’m tired of it. this post is so dumb i shouldn’t be depressed because of this but it hurts because right when it feels like i made a good close friend, they leave me in the dust and ghost me. idc if this sounds dramatic, it happens every time",lonely,i should be asleep…,2022-02-15 20:09:54

I opened up wounds last year in therapy by facing my trauma head on, and now I'm dealing with emotions I've never dealt with before.

For most of my life I pretended to be just so I could find someone. I was always afraid to face my trauma and I knew sex would make me do that.

now it's gotten to the point where i'm too broken and far gone to be of any good to anyone anymore. my body, mind, and health are failing. i had a panic attack so bad a few months ago i ended up in the hospital due to sheer anxiety. the only thought going through my mind was how badly i just wanted a simple, normal romantic relationship for fucks sake, and then everything in life would be swell.

but now it's just too late for me. i'm too bitter and desperate and miserable for anyone to ever have interest in me, so every day i sit around festering in my own loneliness just pushes me farther and farther away from my dreams. now i resent myself and resent being alive. i can't stand it anymore. all i want is to be hugged and have someone be nice to me. is that really so much to ask for?

i've never done anything hurtful to anyone. i've always tried to put other people first, to be there for them, to be nice without expecting things in return, to sacrifice myself for the sake of others, but nothing has ever come out of it. i've been cheated and have been forced to live a deprived, unfulfilled life to the point where now i'm shutting down and i feel like i'm dying. the suicidal thoughts come casually now, without any hesitation.

I hope to have helped any one of you out there. Love you all and have a good day",lonely,Here to spread positivity and happiness,2022-02-15 15:37:34

2235,OldExistential,1644899055,1,"I’m of a certain age (much older than most redditors) and I have no one. My parents are gone, I have a couple of cousins, but they’re in their 70’s+ so old enough to be my parents so I don’t even know them. I’ve met them before, but we’re not ‘family’ if you know what I mean. I have a sibling that I unfortunately live with and we hate each other. We don’t speak and our housing situation in my area makes leaving impossible, plus we own the home together. Their adult kid is ok to me the few times they’re around me, but they obviously think I’m awful due to my relationship with their parent (my sibling). For context, sibling is toxic and a narcissist who loves to push buttons and then play the victim.  

I have no friends. I had one that I texted with a bit, but now they’re distancing from me. I’ve been at my job six months and haven’t made a single work friend. No one talks to me first other than good morning, how was your weekend, etc. all interactions are extremely brief. I try to be friendly, outgoing, I smile, I laugh appropriately, I ask about the few things in their lives that I know about and I just get nothing back other than brief small talk. I know I’m kinda awkward, but I honestly don’t think my friendly attitude is different from others? I can’t figure out why people don’t like me. I don’t do negative things that would make people dislike me or talk about others. I offer to be helpful, but not in a desperate way.  I show compassion and empathy. I know there must be something fundamentally wrong with me to have all these issues with others, but what??

2244,Alb1noGiraffe,1644898046,1,"Been feeling down and very lonely the past couple of days due to a lot of things, but one of them is definitely feeling forgotten/unimportant. A good friend and I were planning on doing a call on Sunday since we wanted to catch up. They ended up forgetting about the call I guess, and I saw on an Instagram post that they had hung out with other people that day for the super bowl. I guess I could’ve reached out, but this same thing happened last Tuesday when we originally planned to call, but they completely forgot.

It makes me feel like I’m not that important and easily forgettable. This happens a lot to me, not just that one friend. I have another group of friends that are my “core” friends, yet I rarely hang out with them, only a couple times a year. Whenever we try to get something together they usually have to push it back last minute because something came up with their other friends. Obviously I’m not priority.

I do have my family and siblings, I’m really appreciative of them. I do feel left out sometimes tho because my other siblings are closer in age and can relate too each other more easily.

I know I’m complaining a lot here and I guess I don’t have too much of a right to complain because I could be reaching out more or be a more interesting person. I don’t have much to contribute to conversation anyways. Most of my day I just lay in bed and watch pointless YouTube videos. I know that’s my fault and making things worse.

I think it started a few months ago when my cousin brought his two baby girls over. My parents doted over the girls of course and the topic of me having kids inevitably came up. My parents looked at me and said ""well we have to find him a girlfriend first!"" And they all laughed, not me. I just forced a small smile but I could see it in their eyes, the idea was planted. They don't wanna set me up for my happiness or whatever, they're just desperate to be grandparents.


My mom took me to a small gathering last year and another woman brought her daughter along and introduced us, this shit was obviously preplanned. The girl was clearly embarrassed and looked uncomfortable, and I also tried my best to be uninterested. Later that night I did some light cyberstalking and saw that the guy she recently broke up with was a budding real estate agent, had his own house and was a big outdoors guy. He was taller than me, clean cut and had facial hair. Oh lord, she would be downgrading massively with me.


Soon after that my mom made me bring wings to her and her coworkers. Sure why not. Little did I know it was a ploy for her to introduce me to a girl. She was bang average. A few days later she continued telling me all about her without me asking and mentioned that she was a single mom. Oh nice, if I wasn't interested before I'm DEFINITELY not interested now lol. Soon my mom invited the girl and her mom to our house for dinner, the mom came but not the girl. The mom's excuse was that the girl was embarrassed but I know the truth, she smelled the bullshit and wasn't interested in me. Oh it's mutual hon.


Now I suspect my dad wants to set me up with one of his coworkers daughter. He made me cyberstalk her and she's some average redhead. I'm not interested in her. In fact she could look like Jessica Chastain and I still wouldn't be interested. And just this weekend on Friday night I was watching a movie in my room when my mom interrupted me that I should've gone to The Village (highend outdoor shopping mall kind of place) theater instead, maybe I'll be there and meet the perfect girl for me. Then she said if I play video games all day I'll never get a girlfriend. So the next day after I got back from morning jiu jitsu, I took a shower and played Red Dead Redemption 2 all freaking afternoon. I went to the gym in the late afternoon and came back to continue playing until 2am.

2265,Tall_Explorer_9691,1644893266,1,"Hello everyone,

Pretty obvious why I'm here, just feeling extra depressed and shitty and want to vent since music, games, porn and all the other usual coping mechanisms aren't getting it done.

Anyway, I feel so fucking pathetic. I'm 27 now and have wanted to find ""the one"" pretty much since I first developed an interest in the opposite sex at all. My dating record is laughable, with the sole relationship of my life having ending over 5 years ago now (which... Holy shit do I feel old). Right off the bat I wanna distance myself from this sounding remotely like this is an anti-woman or hate thing. I've never blamed women or any woman for not loving me or being into me or anything. I think everyone has the right to be attracted to whoever they want, for whatever the reason. We can't help how we feel or who we feel attracted to. Besides, I know I'm not shit anyway. On top of that though, I'm just super shy, insecure, and awkward and I don't put myself out there. Dating has become such a mindfuck for me, I just feel broken. Even if I get a match on a dating site or whatever (pretty much the only avenue for dating that I have), I immediately tense up and freak out, and get super obsessive (you should've seen me when I was actually \*in\* a relationship). And I don't ever know what to say. I'm too impatient and just don't have it in me to strike up a conversation. Just wanna take someone out already. And I'm just so sick of feeling like some anxty high schooler or some shit. I'm so damn immature and I just feel like even if I did temporarily fool a lady into thinking I'm alright, I'd just ruin it anyway or chase her away by my awkward, and desperate behavior. I just have no experiences and it's so obvious.

Anyway, idk just really sucks. I tell everyone I know all the usual crap; that I just don't care and that I don't need to meet anyone. The older I get, the more it really does just feel like a joke. It really sucks cause I can tell my family just thinks I'm a freak. I just wish I could stop caring so much. I feel so fucking useless and nothing really makes me happy.

There's a huge difference is what I've learned these past couple years. I feel like I can't really go to anybody. I can't share what's on my mind in fear of worrying someone I care about, them not understanding, or leaving feeling invalidated. It's really confusing because I know that I have people that care, that's a fact. But I *feel* like no one does sometimes. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I need something else. Not more than what I have or anything. I just wish I could go to someone and ask for a hug. I know I can I just don't want to worry anyone or seem needy. As someone who has struggled with mental health before (I am in the recovery process and am doing much better) I feel as if every time I express that I'm not doing okay it gets chalked up to a mental disorder and I get meds shoved down my throat or told to get more therapy. I know the people that tell me to do these things care and are trying their best and I'm so thankful but I also know that it's hard for them to understand.

Hey,

I used to have a friend that I would talk daily to and hanging out with play games or doing nothing in general sadly we had a falling out and I kinda miss having such a person in my life. A bit about me i’m 23/F and honestly I spend 99.9% of the time coop up in my room. Most of the time spend browsing the web or rewatching the same shows/ listening to music. My sleep schedule is also all over the place so I don’t care where you are from, it would help if you don’t really have a schedule/ routine cause otherwise it most likely won’t work out. I’m a pretty caring person who will be there for you if you need it. I don’t take much seriously and I’m easy going. I get along with others who are easy going as well. I literally ask for the bare minimum in a friendship and that is be kind and non judgmental of others. Apparently this is already too much to ask of some people. One thing to note I’m in no way looking for a relationship so please don’t request pictures since that is irrelevant.

I went to community college for about a year but never developed any lasting relationships with anyone despite making a lot of acquaintances along the way. Nobody really seemed to want to be friends with me

A couple days ago I found myself with a lot of free time and drove an hour and a half to see my best friend who I don’t see very often because he’s in college so I just see him during holidays. It was OK, but I just couldn’t have fun. It just wasn’t really my scene. Most of all though, I was honestly just way too depressed to try to bring the energy needed to socialize, which didn’t help either. Any time my friend introduced me to his friends I just felt dumb as fuck. I seemed pretty reserved and it showed. I could tell none of his friends really liked the energy I was bringing, but I couldn’t help it. I didn’t fit in at all, It was so embarrassing. 

It was also ojust so depressing for me to see him with a lot of new people and seeing that he’s got a pretty well rounded social circle, it helps that he’s involved in a frat as well I guess. Meanwhile in my life I literally don’t have anyone to talk to or hang out with. I literally haven’t gone and hung out with anyone in nearly 2 years now, meanwhile he has a plethora of people to have fun with and talk to. It just felt like an alternate universe. I felt so left behind. Not by him, but just by life in general. To be clear, I’m not jealous of him making new friends, I just wish that I had my own set of friends that want to hang out with me or that share common interests like he does, but I don’t. I just don’t. 

It’s very easy for me to make friends but very hard to create lasting relationships. Like I make friends with everyone at the place I’m working at or when I’m in class I meet and talk to a decent amount of people, but nobody ever wants to like, talk to me outside of those times or hang out with me. I don’t think I’m socially awkward otherwise I wouldn’t make any friends at all. I just don’t know what to do. 

Feeling this lonely is really affecting my life. I’m kind of losing hope for everything. I’m not even in college anymore, unemployed, and I just feel so unbelievably depressed. My life uo until this point I was ALWAYS either in school, working a job, or most of the time I was doing both. But I’m so fucking depressed now that I’ve somehow ended up with neither. My restaurant that I had been working in closed down and I was so preoccupied with my depression that I didn’t even realize that it was time to sign up for classes again that I missed signing up and now ive missed a whole semester of community college. 

How does one get out of this situation? I’ve truly never experienced something so shitty in my life. I just want to give up on everything honestly. I don’t see a point. And now im stuck having to vent to random people on Reddit who will more than likely skip this long ass, ridiculous, whiny post because I have so little people to talk about this kind of thing with that I’m just desperate for anyone to listen to me. If anyone has any advice on how to overcome this shit it’d be greatly appreciated if you dropped that advice in the comments.

Instead of self-love, I found a very dark place full of hatred. Not at anyone, but at myself for never finding love from anywhere or anyone. I've never known what love is and I wish someone could show me. Without any friends and never having had a relationship, self-love has proven to be impossible. I know people say never give up, but I have. If it makes me a bad person or some other name, I guess so. I am not comfortable being lonely. I hate being lonely. I hate never knowing what love is but I can't bring myself to even begin to love myself because the hate is too much. Maybe if I had one person who loved me, things would be different.

There's a girl I(F19) was her best friend's friend at college last year, though I spent little time with them cuz sometimes I was too shy to go talk to them. However I saw that girl a few times on private courses so we talked and I really liked her.

Now we all take different courses at college and I lost contact with them, until last semester I saw her by coincidence twice and I was so happy to see her and I think she was too, we talked for a bit and the second time she asked me if I was free at a certain time and told to come and spend time with her at college before her lecture starts, but that was still 5 days later so I was so nervous she might forget about it. When that day came I actually went to where she told me but she was sitting with many of her friends (who were mostly boys) so I got so nervous I couldn't even just say hi with all these people around so I just left and I felt terrible the whole day, I really wanted to see her and I was even worried if she thought I ghosted her so I eventually texted her to apologize and explain that I just got anxious, she replied that it's totally okay, she's not mad at me and she didn't even notice I came (that hurt).

I barely saw after that and it has become so awkward, I saw her once but she was with her friends so we just said hi and that's it she didn't talk further and didn't say anything, she probably got sick of me now.

I thought about texting her cuz I still want us to be friends but I am worried she doesn't like me anymore AND we almost never text, last time was three month ago so she might find it creepy, and I don't know anything to talk about instead of courses and grades which is totally boring and it's not something that would make us close.

Is this the end ?",lonely,I wanted us to be friends,2022-02-15 09:21:11

2331,BeatsProfessor,1644876104,1," I posted this in another sub but I wanted to post it here as well. 

For context, I am a 26 M who currently works as a lawyer in a sizable city in the NY/NJ/CT tristate area. I work out daily, exercise self-care and have great relationships with everyone in my life. Overall, I'm very happy with my career and life overall.

However, I've never been able to find a partner. In fact, it's been a struggle finding someone. I've been single my entire life and have barely ever been on a date. Part of that is because the very first time I asked someone out, I was completely humiliated by them in front of my whole class. I took me years to realize how much that that event affected me and my ability to be intimate and close with others. I sought out therapy and am now happy to say I'm over the issue.

However, while the resolution of that issue has helped, I still feel incredibly lonely. I've never been anyone's Valentine. I know I will be someday, but I just feel so empty. Like there's this void that cannot be filled. I've tried so hard to be more social and to be on dating apps, but it just hasn't resulted in much of anything. I see all my friends planning their life with their spouses and while I obviously wish them the best and can't wait to see what their life holds, I want that so badly for myself. I just want someone to come home to at the end of my (usually) long workdays to hold me and comfort me, and it just breaks something inside me to come to an empty apartment time and time again. I truly long for someone who will make the pain go away.

And look, I get that Valentine's Day is a stupid corporate holiday, but it makes it impossible to escape the one thing that so deeply upsets me. It's not that I even care that others are in love and building their lives - great for them! - but it hurts being reminded of something that I've never had, and it feels like I've never have. I try not to cry or breakdown thinking about it but it just destroys me deep down. I really just want someone that deeply loves me and I pray to God every night asking for help finding that person.

Anyway, I really just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening. For the others on this sub that feel the same as me, I wish that you find your peace. Loneliness is a terrible pain and I wish we were all free of it.",lonely,Another Lonely V-Day,2022-02-15 09:01:44

i know people just comes here to rant and vent a bit but the fact is... people who comes here and especially those who are lonely for a long time are not ok and as cliche as it sounds the change starts with you, your own attitude towards the problem.

sometimes i come here and i listen to peoples problems, and when they receive some advice that implies to actually do something to try to solve the issue they dont even bother replying back, stuff as simple as go out meet people, engage in a sports club, read a book to get started on the right path on how to deal with people (yes they do help!) but do they do that? nop! they just spend another year alone to come here to vent on valentines again and again, venting on how unlucky they are to be alone.

&amp;#x200B;

guys be more active! work towards a solution! get out of your own misery! it starts with you, yes for real!

&amp;#x200B;

and to the boys and ladies who are falling in love with someone special... get out of your dream, if its a good deal of a parter it probably has many good potential partners and you prbably fall for that person because it gave you some attention but guess what your not the only one who got attention from this dude or chick!!! yes they are good at dealing with people so on valentines day they have several people to go with, why to go with the lonely one who dont know how to deal with people?

2348,nria98,1644870631,1,"I work for a fairly large, but locally owned entertainment fun center (arcade, kids birthday parties, movie theatre, go karts, ect.) I was hired at the age of 16 by the longtime manager, ‘Jane’, whom I’ve come to adore over the years. She wasn’t the one who interviewed me, the deputy manager at the time did, but from the moment I met Jane, she has been the most kind, caring, and encouraging boss I could ever ask for. She’s always seen potential in me as both an employee and as a person. 

Since I started here nearly seven years ago, I’ve worked my way up from team member to shift supervisor, birthday coordinator, events assistant manager, events manager, training manager, assistant manager, and tomorrow, after Jane is gone and our current deputy manager, ‘Holly’, who’s a year older than me, transitions into Janes role, I’ll become deputy manager. Jane and I have become specifically close over the past few years as I’ve gotten into management. I have met her husband and she’s met all of my ex boyfriends. Our dogs have had play dates together and she even once gave me the money to adopt a cat I had fallen in love with at the pet shelter across the street. She has been like a second mother to me in many ways. 

Tomorrow is supposed to be an exciting day. Holly is becoming the big boss and I will be stepping into her old position as the #2. I’ll have a much bigger office at this time tomorrow. My salary, which is already quite generous, will receive a very healthy raise. Next year, our facilities are scheduled to relocate to a much larger and more attractive space. All that yet I still type this with tears in my eyes over losing such a wonderful figure in my life. Jane and I will still keep in touch but she’s moving 2,000+ miles away to be closer to family. Her husbands job brought them out here years ago and now that he’s retired, it’s completely understandable. I have told her that I will come to visit her at some point, but I think we both know that’s much easier said than done. 

I’ve dreaded this day since Jane announced she’d be stepping down four months ago. I will say my final goodbyes to Jane in the next few hours. After that, I’ll go home and more likely than not feel even more numb than I do now. Beyond my personal connection with Jane, she’s all I’ve ever known. It’s going to be so odd going into work tomorrow without her there. Seeing Holly in Janes office is going to feel off, as well as her having all of the power as manager. To be completely honest, I’m not overly fond of my future boss. We’ve never had any issues but she’s very reserved around certain people, myself included. She’s also worked here since she was 16 and was the previous titleholder of most of my recent job titles. She’s sweet but has a much more dry way of doing things compared to Jane.

I moved far away from home for college, so I feel far from friends from my home town and family and I have made friends here like close friends but honestly sometimes it feels like no one really cares 
about me. Which I know isn't the case but honestly that's how it feels sometimes. Like everyone will be out with friends and I'll be alone. Don't get me wrong I get invited places but you know when you just sense that your the third wheel... Yeah that's how I feel a lot of the time. Recently my best friend has been romantically talking to a girl and I'm happy for him but at the time I can't help but feel a little bit jealous of this girl because it feels like I'm being replaced or pushed aside. I forgot to mention I live with this guy and another girl I thought who I thought was my  friend. Anyway, if I don't go to that guy friend's room we won't see each other and when I called them out in it it's because ""I always go to their room because they live on the ground floor"" the amount of times I've cried myself to sleep just thinking if I disappeared right now would they are even notice and I hate how much it effects me because I known they have no idea what's going on. I'll bring things up and I'm always made to feel like I'm the crazy one and I'm overreacting or just dismissed. And don't get me wrong I know I'm sensitive, I know sometimes I overreact but I honestly feel so alone here. I literally attempted to kill myself and told them that and honestly there was concern for 5mins and then it was never spoken of again. I understand, that not everyone knows how to deal with stuff and but literally when someone says they feel alone and then tells you something like that to dismiss it (because that's how I felt) it honestly hurts so much and I hate that I let it get to me. 
I make them sound like awful people they're not, they are good but honestly I feel unimportant. Anyway, I digress, the really reason I posted was because I tested positive for covid and not one of them asked if I was ok. It was just stay in your room and such.

2363,jjnaa98,1644865355,1,"I work for a fairly large, but locally owned entertainment fun center (arcade, kids birthday parties, movie theatre, go karts, ect.) I was hired at the age of 16 by the longtime manager, ‘Jane’, whom I’ve come to adore over the years. She wasn’t the one who interviewed me, the deputy manager at the time did, but from the moment I met Jane, she has been the most kind, caring, and encouraging boss I could ever ask for. She’s always seen potential in me as both an employee and as a person. 

Since I started here nearly seven years ago, I’ve worked my way up from team member to shift supervisor, birthday coordinator, events assistant manager, events manager, training manager, assistant manager, and tomorrow, after Jane is gone and our current deputy manager, ‘Holly’, who’s a year older than me, transitions into Janes role, I’ll become deputy manager. Jane and I have become specifically close over the past few years as I’ve gotten into management. I have met her husband and she’s met all of my ex boyfriends. Our dogs have had play dates together and she even once gave me the money to adopt a cat I had fallen in love with at the pet shelter across the street. She has been like a second mother to me in many ways. 

Tomorrow is supposed to be an exciting day. Holly is becoming the big boss and I will be stepping into her old position as the #2. I’ll have a much bigger office at this time tomorrow. My salary, which is already quite generous, will receive a very healthy raise. Next year, our facilities are scheduled to relocate to a much larger and more attractive space. All that yet I still type this with tears in my eyes over losing such a wonderful figure in my life. Jane and I will still keep in touch but she’s moving 2,000+ miles away to be closer to family. Her husbands job brought them out here years ago and now that he’s retired, it’s completely understandable. I have told her that I will come to visit her at some point, but I think we both know that’s much easier said than done. 

I’ve dreaded this day since Jane announced she’d be stepping down four months ago. I will say my final goodbyes to Jane in the next few hours. After that, I’ll go home and more likely than not feel even more numb than I do now. Beyond my personal connection with Jane, she’s all I’ve ever known. It’s going to be so odd going into work tomorrow without her there. Seeing Holly in Janes office is going to feel off, as well as her having all of the power as manager. To be completely honest, I’m not overly fond of my future boss. We’ve never had any issues but she’s very reserved around certain people, myself included. She’s also worked here since she was 16 and was the previous titleholder of most of my recent job titles. She’s sweet but has a much more dry way of doing things compared to Jane. It will be hard to adjust to that as well.",lonely,Today is my beloved managers last day at work. I’m feeling really down despite a promotion.,2022-02-15 06:02:35

But THIS year. This year is different… this year it actually stings like it never has before. Because this year I had plans with someone… me and her made so many plans on how we would spend this day together… I was gonna buy her a big bouquet of her favourite flowers and buy her a box of chocolate with it, I was gonna spend all day with her and make sure that we have a nice day together, we had planned so much together for that day when we were together. I said to her that I’m so happy that I finally have someone to spend this day with for the first time in my life… I was so excited for it since last year… it was the first time I genuinely felt excited for that day in all my 21 years of life. now its here and I feel empty and heartbroken… because not only does it remind me that I’ll probably never get to have that, but it reminds me that I ALMOST had it this time. But once again it was taken away and I once again have to go through that day knowing I’ll probably never get to feel anything special on that day… just lonely and add to that, thoughts of what could have been… what almost was… I hate that day, always have… but this year it’s extra hurtful… 

I never felt that kind of heartbreak before, nothing to the point where I can’t get over the person or stop loving them even after months of a breakup. I wish I could stop loving her or to forget about her but I can’t. Till this day I still think about her every day. I still wish I was better for her.

I have no one in real life who I would call a 'friend' and this is because of my idea of friendships. I have 2 friends online who are both living in other countries.

I recently joined a discord group made by a club of sorts from our school, at first it was just to mess around and see how the place was, but recently I have liked how close everyone seems and I have been trying to get into conversations or just invite people to play games with me, however no one seems interested. - It seems like the more I try to make friends with people the lonelier I feel. 

Prior to this I felt neutral/happy, my problem has never been not having friends, but it has been not getting the feelings of a friendship from the people I have these relations with; I don't feel cared about as much as I care about them.

Obviously I feel lonely every now and then, but it mostly happens when I am trying to make friends as I have been doing recently, it seems like when I don't have any friends I feel completely okay.

I did an experiment of sorts and I deleted all my social media and cut contact with all online friends for  a couple months, and those were the most educational and healthy times of my past few years. I developed some healthy habits and self-care and self-love however I stopped those once I reconnected with the online friends.

2431,Low_Dimension965,1644841509,1,"The first few times you ask people out, it doesn't really get to you, the rejections hurt for a couple of weeks but you move on. After around the fifth person you start to question yourself though, every subsequent rejection after that just adds another weight to your shoulders, another symbol of how unattractive you are. After years of failures, they all build up and it gets harder to walk.
You try to become friends with people before you ask them out, you talk to them, try to show that you're a laugh to be around. Maybe some day someone could see you as more than just a friend. 

You don't regret asking these people out, if you never try, then you will never achieve anything... But at the same time the more you get rejected, the more you worry about your flaws. 
We don't get mad at people turning us down, we don't think we are entitled to love from anyone, they aren't the problem... It is us. 
""What is wrong with me?"" ""why does nobody want to dance with me?"" ""what makes me so bad?""
Maybe I'm just the ugly Duckling.

Every time someone turns you down you sit in your room, staring at nothing in the darkness, wondering if anything will ever make you feel bright again. You spend some time improving yourself, working out and picking up new interests, you have days where you don't think about it, sooner or later though you are going to see a young couple laughing, chasing after their toddler as he stampedes down the footpath in his little baggy pants.
You go for walks in the night time instead, when nothing will remind you of your loneliness. There are much less triggers in the night but there are still some. It's like you have PTSD

I see the problem here, I know I am putting too much pressure on myself to find a partner.
I should learn to love myself.
I should forget about all this romance stuff.
It would be great to just have a fulfilling purpose in life and not care for companionship.
I say this to myself every single week but something will eventually bring me back to my old thoughts.

I met a girl and asked if she'd like to go on a date with me, she said yes. That was the first time I got a yes.
She never spoke to me after that though, tried sending her a message but she ghosted. We never got the date.

I had thought about getting back into the dating game, went on the usual apps and even posted a few personals on reddit. But, I quickly realised, I'm simply not emotionally available for another relationship.

As time has moved on I have come to realise that in fact, I will never be ready for any kind of relationship. Platonic, romantic or whatever. I no longer want to put the effort in, the reward doesn't match the effort in my experience. I used to worry about being alone, having that gut wrenching feeling every time I thought about it. How do I consolidate the feelings of want with the feelings of denial? Well recently, I have found I think about it less and less. I'm not sure how, but now when I see or hear or think about relationships, I figuratively shrug my shoulders and move on.

My apathy is slowly turning to misanthropy. And I welcome it.

I'm now 24, it's felt like I've been floating through the years since I was 21, completely aloof. As silly as this sounds, I've recently bought myself a pair of very nice shoes and was unusually content that I had done so. Only tonight did it fully dawn on me why. It's the first nice thing I've invested for myself since my last breakup. Rather than feeling proud I just feel deep remorse, how could I have left myself in the dust for 3 entire years?

 I miss the genuine connection of another person, sharing a life, trusting and growing alongside someone. I miss the visits and the moments where I realized ""oh this is gonna be a cute memory one day."" The emotional trust, prospective goals, all of it. I'm so deeply frustrated at myself and yet I don't know what to do about it. I know this is flaired as suicide talk, and quite simply, and I say this with as much raw honesty as I can express, I think I need help. I'm no longer okay, no longer hanging in there and no longer happy. I'm quite certain I'm falling deeper into personally uncharted depression tonight.

I know that I can’t make people care about me, but I don’t know what other people are doing that I’m not. I can do everything right, but if my friends are still indifferent to me, and nobody else is interested, well I guess I just have to be okay with that ?

2511,114DragonSlayer,1644808272,1,"I've been reflecting on that quote often now, because that exact situation has happened to me three times, each time significantly worse than the last.

First was in 2016 when my brother died. We were practically best friends. Practically inseparable. Well, death had to separate us. Because death is the ultimate separator.

I hadn't realized it at the time, but this would hit me like a freight train years down the line. I've been unable to cope with his death, and still sometimes wonder, ""what if the police identified the wrong body?""

My unwillingness to accept the fact he'a gone has led me down some seriously depressive roads.

In 2020 I got into a giant, 3-day long fiery argument with my best friend at the time of 5 years. I said somethings I didn't mean too and now we're no longer on speaking terms.

And two days ago due too some bullshit I won't get into (because it's just a bunch of drama) I lost two of my other best and closest friends too. We're also no longer on speaking terms.

I could've coped with the passing of my brother. I barely coped with the loss of my previous best friend.

I haven't been able to cope since this. I've been eating hardly anything and haven't been drinking a lot of fluids. In fact I'm whittled most of my days away sitting in front of a screen, usually mindlessly browsing YouTube.

I used to be great at making friends, however over the years I've become more and more socially anxious and have found it harder and harder to make friends, let alone keep them around long enough to develop a close bond with them. In fact, after this recent event I've just decided to stop making close friends entirely. Everybody I've ever been close with has been violently ripped away from me and left be fucked mentally. I don't want to go through the pain again.

Right now I only have 4 friends I can easily contact, however I'm not close with any of them. I don't really trust my parents and I end up keeping many of my thoughts to myself and many parts of me I keep locked under lock and key, never to see the light of day. Despite having loving and supportive parents, 4 friends who all genuinely do care and worry for me, and has grown up in a fantastic neighborhood, I feel the loneliest I've ever felt. I've already attempted twice because of how lonely I feel. Once by rope, and once by knife. My rope snapped and I failed to cut deep enough.

Those two friends- well at least one of them- meant the world to me. And now their gone and are never coming back. He was everything I was missing and wanted in my life. And now he's gone, and never coming back. We made so many memories together. And now he is memory. And so is my 2020 best friend. And so is my brother.

Why do I try to even form close bonds with anybody anymore. It always ends up in flames.

I just don't know what to do anymore. It's a major catch 22 situation. I know that having a very close friend would help solve all my problems, but history always repeats it's self. That friendship is bound to be burned to the ground, simply perpetuating the cycle and reaffirming what I already knew would happen.

... so I've taken to putting my story out their on the web instead. Maybe if I scream into the void of the web loud enough, somebody will heed the call and listen.

I'll be on the couch watching mindless youtube video after mindless youtube video stressed beyond wit and depressed beyond sanity if you need me.",lonely,"""The saddest thing in life is when somebody or something that gave you so many memories, becomes a memory"" - Unknown",2022-02-14 14:11:12

People at work will go out drinking or hanging out but I'm never included in any of that either. My roommates treat me like I don't belong in my own home. I spend pretty much every day just working, going home, and sitting there alone until the day ends, hoping someone might message me back or just do the bare minimum to acknowledge I exist.

I’ll live my life through the character, but recently I’ve been a bit too exhausted for the emotional rollercoasters that would cause.

Everyone else can pop the bubble pretty easily, but whenever I try to do it, I can barely make a dent into the bubble. I've spent so much time outside of the bubble that I've convinced myself that I'm okay with being alone. I've given up on trying to penetrate the bubble.

But sometimes I get so desperate that I run head first into the bubble, only to find that it's not in the same spot it was before. It's hard to know when to enter into social relationships because they're always moving. It's another quality of the social bubble that I find overwhelming: not only is it hard to penetrate, but it's also hard to find. I feel stuck in time until I see the bubble again. 

Despite what *everyone* says (e.g. ""you'll find your people! It comes when you least expect it too!"" or ""there's someone for everyone!""), entering into the bubble, let alone finding it, is *not guaranteed.* I could very well end up never having penetrated the bubble in my lifetime. I could live and die without even knowing where the bubble was or who was inside of it...it's terrifying, but it's the truth....

I have a complicated relationship with the social bubble. I don't mind being stuck outside of it most times...I don't want to stay outside *forever*. I don't like being alone as much as I am. I don't want to feel like an ""extra friend"" who's expendable anymore. I don't want to live and die without being in the bubble long enough to develop meaningful relationships with people. It's these feelings that make me desperate enough to try and penetrate the bubble again, only to remember how hard it was accomplish this task before.

I got out of a 6 year relationship because my ex girlfriend was emotionally abusive, controlling and horrible towards me. She made me give up friendships by planting twisted thoughts in my head etc.. Anyway I became friendless and my whole focus was her. 
I work security, so a lot of my time is sat in my car or a building/cabin at night so little human contact. 
I did however manage to meet this girl, and she came into my life hard, and changed everything for me. I was single but not ready for another relationship, or anything romantic, but she was beautiful, persistent, incredible and made me feel valued, wanted, respected and loved. 
I fell for her hard and we started “seeing”. 
I have a beautiful son with my ex, so because of this, we both agreed not to jump into a full relationship straight away because things with my ex are bad and we didn’t want anything to fuel that fire. 
This girl made us swear to each other that even though we aren’t official, we were each others. 
Things started and we became closer and closer, spending as much time together as we could, booking hotels to spend the night together, she even dropped the “L bomb”. 
She would say everything that made me feel incredible, even stating that she wanted to be involved with my son when the time was right, planning out trips we could all do together etc. 
As we got closer, I started opening up about how I have no friends, my home life isn’t great and about my mental health issues (fully expecting her to her turn and run) but she stayed, and explained none of that mattered, she was there for me, to support me and love me, and would help me get friends too. 
More time passed and life was good, I made friends with her friends, I started being social and enjoying things and then it stopped. 
She told me she needed time to herself because of a loss in the family, which of course I agreed because of the situation.

It does not behave rudely. It does not seek its own interests. The wickedness of man does not rejoice in injustice, but rejoices in the truth, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things, love never fails."" Love cannot be seen or touched, like a transparent air that permeates all around us. Sometimes it is not easy to be noticed by us, but it fills our hearts. Love is pure, love is selfless, love is broad, and only by living in the ocean of love can you enjoy the meaning of love. has been integrated into life。

I've always considered myself quite the reasonable person, I try to be more logical than emotional where I can be, but sometimes its so overwhelming. No amount of logic can change the fundamental beliefs that I'm just worthless. To my core, I believe that I need putting down. I honestly believe that I have no place in this world and there is no hope in it either. I've seen therapists and I've had medication in the past, but all I've learned is that it's better for everyone else if I just repress, repress, repress, and act without emotion.

So I spend my days pretending to be happy for the sake of others, and people like the me that they get, whilst constantly thinking about how to kill myself. Even considering the idea of biting my tongue out so I can choke on it. Sometimes, it all just gets too much and I can't keep it in. I meltdown, so I stay at home and create new scars as the pain is a better thing to focus on. An endless loop, as I hate the scars too. I hate it all and I honestly just do not want to be here. And it's that feeling of loneliness that digs deeper than anything else. I don't even have a right to feel this way, but here I am. However, I've managed this far, this way.

Technically speaking I am attractive and pleasant to talk to I suppose; that’s what I’ve been told anyways. But I’m tired of always feeling like the only thing I’m good for is sex. 

I don’t have a single person in my life I can call a best friend. I have only close friend in my life still and it feels like it’s mostly superficial at this point. Pleasant hello’s or hanging out one night a year to catch up. 

But what I feel like I crave more than anything, is a partner in my life. Someone to call my own, that I can share my deepest and most disturbing thoughts and ideas with. Someone who is free to travel with me and curl up with me in bed and just make me feel..worthy. 

The biggest problem is, I hate most people. Humanity, as a whole. It makes it hard to meet people who share the same mindsets and goals as I do. And I feel like it leaves me out in the cold on my own, a lot. But I don’t want to change who I am, just to cure the loneliness. 

Every time I find myself getting close with someone, something has to get in the way. My emotions, or theirs, or were just downright incompatible. 

Usually I can shake this feeling, but for some reason, tonight, I find myself here.

2579,daydreamingoften,1644785187,1,"(I will post this on every lonely/sad/in your feelings Reddit page until someone replies since no one replies to me anymore 😅) 

I just ended a 5 year friendship with my best friend, OVER A DAMN BOY. 
In the past i managed to get my ex friend a boyfriend. I felt bad for her because she was fresh out of a break up and whenever she isn't in a relationship she turns into a whore and has sex with any male available, I pitied her and was scared for her. I thought I was doing the right thing. 

I regret my decision of helping her so much. 
My friendship was a trio kind of thing, three best friends. No one was left out and it was a good strong bond. Then she stopped talking to us, we informed her multiple times, talking to her, coming over to talk and seeing what we can do about the situation to make it better. At times it worked and she apologised saying that she's in her honeymoon phase blah blah. 
We forgave. 
Recently she sent me a hostile message asking if I don't wanna be her friend anymore blah blah after she realised that I wasn't really talking to her anymore, I chilled when talking to her because she made empty promises and claiming that she was busy at work but then i would see her snap and tiktoks of her posting her and her bf. Why should i talk to someone which is just gonna lie? 
I tried explaining to her again why I'm not really talking to her and she got so defensive about it and i was thinking wth. 
Then when i said my side she just didn't reply to my message but read it, what a sneaky bitch. 
I find it crazy how a guy managed to change her just like that, she's had many boyfriends in the past but didn't act this weird. I've always told her that my old friends from secondary left me for their boyfriend's because they thought I was jealous because I didn't have one, no it's not even like that they barely spoke to me and when i brought it up it was viewed as me being jealous. 
She said that she would never be like that because ""bROs beForE hOeS"" 🙄
Now she admits that she feels like she's pushing us away subconsciously but she doesn't know why she's doing that, probably because her relationship is going well so far but I wish the worst for her. 
She knows that in the 3 way friendship we only have each other and we've been fighting for the friendship but she doesn't care because she has her boyfriend. 
I actually hate people like that, how could you just forget about you're friends, I find it so damn weird. 
Maybe because I've neve been in a relationship myself but she definitely doesn't deserve to be inthe perfect relationship after she's cheated and manipulated men, I regret helping her so much. Now I feel so lonely because I don't have many friends in general and most of them are in relationships anyway lol. 
I genuinely get that there will be changes once you get into a Relationship but I just don't get how someone could just change within a heartbeat.

2580,wellick59,1644784496,1,"Hey. I'm writing this post because I have no one to talk to or share my feelings with. Every time I go to sleep, I lie in my bed and struggle to fall asleep while thinking about things that are worrying me. Sometimes I feel like I want to cry, I often do. I try to convince myself that it will eventually get better and I will finally be happy again, but the same cycle keeps repeating itself everyday. 

There was a point in my life during my school years where I was happy and had a lot of friends. However, our group grew apart after our first year of high school in 2018 because of an argument. At first I felt sad and lonely but I managed to make new friends. I hung out with another group but I wasn't as close to them as the last one. It was going alright until the first lockdown came in March 2020. During this time sitting at home, I felt like I didn't matter to any of my friends because I was the one who always started my chats and convos with them, and if I didn't, none of them would text me. 

I graduated from high school online (June 2020) but we eventually had a prom night later during the summer. I went alone because I didn't have a girlfriend and didn't ask a girl to come with me (I felt it would be awkward to ask because I hadn't any close girl friends and we all spent all of the school year online because of the pandemic). I'm an average looking guy and talk to girls quite confidently but never found a girl that had reciprocated romantic feelings for me. It makes me sad that I never had any kind of relationship with a girl during all my life. I've never kissed or touched a girl intimately in my life. 

After finishing high school, I left with two persons whom I considered to be my only relatively close friends. None of my two friends from school went to the same uni as me. I thought that my university years would be a fresh start and that I'd make new friends and even have a girlfriend. Unfortunately, I feel like it's been a similar situation to high school until now, if not even worse. The first two semesters (Fall 2020 and Spring 2021) were online so I never set foot on campus and didn't make any new acquaintances. I felt like those were the hardest days because I would sit in front of my computer all day and study alone. My grades were mediocre and less than average which left me very frustrated (I was a good student during all my school years). 

I also spent the summer of 2021 kind of alone, I would occasionally hang out with those two friends but I felt like I saw them less and less frequently. I decided to start going to the gym during the summer to focus on myself and feel like I'm doing something worthy. I was doing some noticeable progress and enjoyed it a lot. I was still lonely but I felt like working out was the highlight of my day and it would keep me occupied so I didn't think much about it. I spent the rest of the day watching series or playing video games. I would also spend time with my grandparents in our home village because I went there for the summer. I didn't hang out with friends much, but the activities I did kept me happy.

University announced that we would resume our courses on campus during the fall semester of 2021 so I was quite thrilled and hoped that I would finally enjoy campus life and make new friends. I started to talk to people and tried to make plans with some but it didn't work out as I had expected. It feels like none are interested in being friends with me, everyone hangs out with their small friend groups which they know previously from school and I'm left alone. I stopped going to the gym because of time constraints which made me feel even worse. I'm overwhelmed and always stressed by my studies and barely have time to relax. My two old friends are also busy with their studies, we chat sometimes and hang out once every week (during the weekends) or twice a month.

This spring semester of 2022 started a month ago and my situation didn't get any better. I see that everybody around me is happy, all people my age are having fun, going out and enjoying their days while all I do is study and be sad. I've been feeling lonely for the past two years since the beginning of the pandemic and can't seem to find a  way to end this cycle of pain. I just want to have some friends I can hang out with daily at university and a girlfriend that I love and that loves me. I just want to be happy the way I felt before everything went downhill.

I know my problems might sound trivial to some, I know some of you have it way harder than me. But tonight I felt like I couldn't bare this feeling anymore so I decided to put my thoughts into words. If you arrived this far, thank you for reading my post. I'm sorry if it was a bit long. I hope all of you can find happiness.

**Tl;dr: I've been feeling so lonely for the past two years and this feeling is eating me alive. I never had a girlfriend in my life and it makes even more sad.**",lonely,This feeling of loneliness is tiring me so much (19M),2022-02-14 07:34:56
2581,aemonlaid,1644784339,1,"Hey guys I'm curious if any of you relate. I talk to 4 people everyday we mostly text  but I started spiraling really bad last week and I know that when I start to get bad I become kind of mean and irritable so I was m.i.a for maybe a week and some change as to not say smth mean to my friends just because im feeling depressed. when I came back to social media and things like that none of my friends had texted me or messaged me AT ALL! I could have been dead for all they know lol... So basically I realized the only reason we are ""friends"" is because I text THEM everyday.

Extra bit here, one of my longest friends texted me said hey whats wrong, I decided to open up about how I'm feeling AND SHE GOT MAD AT ME! She was like ""well living life is meaningless anyways who cares about if you feel blah blah"" ??!! then she started to make it about herself...

Am I expecting too much? am I selfish to want them to check on me? am I being over exaggerate? please help me assess this my view is obviously biased haha. Thank you

I don't know why but I feel lonely at nights more. I just need someone to talk to like a close friend or a girlfriend. I want to talk, drink some beer and smoke cigarettes with him/her.

Actually, I have one close friend but I feel lonely. And I cannot understand this situation for fucks sake.

And lastly, I have never had girlfriend. Another Valentine's Day is coming and still lonely. My flirting skills are bad and I am too short. So it's normal that I haven't got girlfriend.

So I, 19 F, just moved to DE from South Jersey and I’ve been here for a couple months now. I’ve been trying to make friends around here because it’s felt pretty isolating moving and not really having a community to automatically find people in. I’ve tried at work and at the gym, but honestly I’ve never been very good at it because I never had to try. I moved a lot growing up and in school and everyone wanted to be the first friend of the new kid. I know DE is a pretty tight knit community, I’m familiar with the area (more so around Rehoboth) so I expected difficulty, but I don’t have many other options to be able to reach out to people. 

Anyways, I’m in the Middletown area (I don’t want to get too personal on here because creeps exist) and I would be cool to talk with anyone who reached out to me. I’m only looking for platonic friendships. My IG is k.at.la.v 

A little bit about me: I literally enjoy almost anything. I love all things psychology/neurology related and I’m also an aspiring writer. I read a lot, I like the outdoors and love to go on adventures. Whether that be road trips or just checking out random local places. I go to the gym but I’m definitely a beginner and am still learning. I think politics are interesting, but I think about politics from a “devils advocate” perspective.

2596,kayy_mm,1644779684,1,"So since the start, I can make friends easily if I want to.

Childhood: Used to switch places a lot, so I had to keep making friends over and over every new school (10 schools I've changed) additionally since there was no technology at that time I had to keep making friends again and again which I did.

Teenage: My best friend left for another town (we still are in contact and talk almost every day). Had friends, had a decent relationship but soon all fell apart. A particular incident changed my life. Latter, I got emo-edgy and started getting distant from people. Switched to a new city again.


Late Teenage: Felt too much like an outsider, spent most of the time watching anime. Had a few 'friends' as well but since they didn't pass on exams I graduated to the next semester and they got left behind.


19-21: Had a friend who was like a sister. Invested my everything to help fix her untreated sexual harassment and break up stress. We ended up on a sour note so it got over as well.
 


To the people who I got romantically involved with have found someone else as well.


I guess I'll always be stationary.

I like being alone, I enjoy my company and I almost always try to hide my introverted nature. 


Conclusion: I always try to reach out, do the right thing but idk my efforts are just never enough. I'd like a girlfriend/partner, I'd like someone to talk to, someone to touch, someone to hug, someone to make me feel alive (without manipulating, emotionally hurting and using) basically is impossible since I have no one who I can approach to and most people tell me I'm good looking so they all assume I have females laying around and pretty soon I'll be living all alone soon with no human contact so high chances of my insanity sky-rocketing :p.",lonely,I like how I always turn out alone.,2022-02-14 06:14:44

When I try to talk to my parents or siblings they make it about them saying how much I stress them out with all my mental issues. I’m sick and tired of always being alone. Nobody gives a fuck about me enough and it hurts in more ways I can count. I’m most likely going to wake up tmmrw for work and just drive away and never be seen or heard from again because it’s just easier that way.

Most days i don't have anyone to talk to. It's gets so fucking lonely.. it's not fun anymore.. i think it makes you appreciate the small things though, for me the highlight of the day is something like hearing a good song or seening that beautiful girl.

I have never had a girlfriend. It's might sound dumb but it's something i really really want.. i want to have someone who i can love unconditionally, cuddle hold tight and share a connection with. I would love to hold someome tight and sleep, run the tip of my nose on her's, varm her, and hug her as tight i can.

Lately i have just lost the care for anything though. The things i used to care about i don't anymore. I'll just lay in bed and hug my pillow all day but at the end of the day that just makes me feel worse and more lonely.

I want to introduce myself. I’m 36 year old bloke from Finland. I have few short relationships behind me. Last one was 2009. Since 2010 I’ve been living with my dog. My dog whose liver is now expanded and it might be liver cancer. I’ve been crying since Tuesday when that came around. My dog  is 11 years and 10 months old so not a young dog anymore. 

I can feel the loneliness already. I’ve been thinking how my life’ will be when I don’t have that dog anymore. At the moment I can’t think about it. The empty house, the empty sleeping spots. Everything. 

I’ve lost my sleep and my appetite. Even though my dog is still active and alive I’ve been pre-grieving already. 

It’s been over 10 years since any relatives have died so I’ve been blessed with constant and stable life for long time. 

It hurts like hell and worst is that he is my only real friend and after he’s gone, my apartment will be so empty and silent. I’m sure you understand. Just last weekend was joyful and we didn’t know nothing about his liver. This shows how quickly everything can turn around. 

I’m pretty sure writing to someone helps even though face to face might be better way to get help but it is what it is.

I know it’s not an issue with how I look because guys have tried to message me, but that’s not what I want because it’s clear by how they speak that I’m just a replaceable girl to them and that they just want someone to sleep with and then ghost. The people I know are all talking to people or on dating apps, and I know I could just start flirting and having casual sex so I could at least have some form of intimacy, but that type of stuff won’t cure my loneliness, it would just be a bandaid on a larger issue. I just wish I could experience love for once and for me to love someone else just as much. I wish that I could become best friends with someone while also falling in love. I’m trying to sleep right now, and I hate that my bed is so cold and lonely. I sometimes even wish I had a stalker because then at least someone would care about me in one way or another.

Never been kissed.
Never been with anyone irl.. 
Still a virgin

Being ghosted without a reason 
Being left alone without a answer for months to years..

Do I even try to continue .. like what's the point.. im trying to understand but I have my limits, my body took on a toll from these experiences and I'm tired of fighting..

2673,ApexIsPain_TA,1644745051,1,"Last week a coworker asked to take my Saturday shift so he could go on a date with his girlfriend for Valentine’s Day. I knew I had nowhere better to be and I could use Saturday to get midterm prep done. Today I was called into work last minute because the manager had a family medical emergency (which is understandable) but when I asked to have V-day covered by someone else (I don’t work weekdays much, again I’m a college student) he said that everyone else at our brewery has plans and called Monday off, instead I’ll be given extra time off in the following weeks. Later in the shift, a different coworker came by as a customer with his girlfriend for a Valentine’s date at a nearby restaurant, so even in terms of having to cover for the manager I was the only one who could because I am single.

I’m not a virgin, but I’ve never been in a relationship, let alone a second date. All my sexual relations with other people (one of the women I’ve hooked up with now identifies as non-binary so even though I’m straight I’m including them) have been one night stands. I heard through friends that a girl I hooked up with in the past was telling people I was good in bed, which was a nice confidence booster since my love life has been dry this pandemic, but still I’ve accepted my position as a male butterface. Another friend compared my sex life to Little Caesar’s pizza: not at the top of anyone’s list but I’m cheap, easy and get the job done. And honestly at this point it’s not even about sex: the last time I cuddled with someone else is twice as long ago as the last time I’ve had sex.

Being permanently single has always been a sore spot for me. While all my friends used the pandemic as an opportunity to get into relationships instead of hooking up, I haven’t had such luck. Whenever they were going on dates and claimed they were busy, I’d distract myself from the crushing loneliness by playing video games, watching TV, reading a book or lurk this subreddit. However, being singled out at work for being single has stung me harder than any of the FOMO I’ve experienced this pandemic. I love my job and my coworkers, and we’re not expecting a busy V-Day because breweries aren’t the ideal Valentine’s date location. But now I’m working a night of the week I’m never scheduled, and I’m basically going to spend it getting drunk from the host stand watching couples pass by my work in favor of the hip wine bar and expensive Italian restaurant next door.

I know that some of the qualifications to my experience are far better experiences than the loneliness others experience on this subreddit. I’m just astonished by the consideration of “relationship status” in the scheduling of my job this week and I was wondering if anyone else was dealing with this, especially outside the service industry.",lonely,Fairly certain I was asked to work Valentine’s Day because I’m the only bartender at my work without a boyfriend/girlfriend.,2022-02-13 20:37:31

The issue is, I don't fit in with the other guys at work. It's especially frustrating because I've spent so much time with them. We've even been deployed together. But, for whatever reason, they don't seem to include me as part of the group. It's partially my fault I know, because what was initially awkwardness and anxiety has become anger and spite. Sometimes I can fight it down to try to show a good face, but either way I'm always left sitting in my barracks on the weekends. I hope it will go away with time, but it's been over a year now.

I realize this is partially my fault. I could ask someone to spend time with me. Maybe part of my problem is that I'm afraid of rejection. But more than that, I don't believe I'm the sort of person people want to hangout with. I'm not funny or entertaining. Asking someone to spend time with me is taxing, I feel like I'm wasting their time. 

Perhaps my loneliness is created by my own low self esteem?

It hurts when new dudes show up, and they seem to fit in so quickly. They spend time with the guys, going out to bars, getting drunk, going on hikes, grilling. What do I need to do to get included?

You might ask- why don't I try to find friends outside the military? That's honestly a great idea. But I have no idea where to start. Due to my occupation, I'm in a place where I know nobody except for the people I work with. I'm feel trapped.

Yesterday, when I was at work, I got a message from friend from school, if I wanted to grab a beer that evening. I got excited because I haven't seen him in 3 years and he said there would be few other guys coming. I was extatic.

I got there and in short time there were all 5 of us, drinking, reminiscing about past. Telling each other what we've been up to, about girlfriends, achievements, stories. I mostly just sat there and listened, shared about my career, hobbies, you know, not much. Still, it was a great time.

But then arrived 6 shots. One for each of us. With one extra. Another friend lost... due to stupid accident just few days ago. We haven't seen each other in 3 years and didn't talk for 2 but it fucking broke me, especially because I lost another, close friend not month ago to a suicide. We then sat there in quiet.

2692,TOPH-BE1FONG,1644735229,1,"A lot of people say that in order to love yourself, it must come from within. That is, you must learn to love yourself first before anyone.

Truthfully, I think that's a lie.

Instead, I think that if someone were to love me enough - like, sacrificing the most colorful, violent parts of life to stay close to me - I may just be convinced enough to love myself.

Maybe if I can see someone loving me first - holding me like I'm the most fragile object in the universe, loving me like they were hungry for it for a thousand years - I may be moved just enough to see myself painted in a new light.

Instead, I feel like a ghost. Ghost made flesh that floats around everyday with no purpose, no significance, empty, cold, and invisible. I feel unimportant.

If I died, I truly believe the event would go unnoticed: the world will keep moving forward; my existence will be like a silent whisper - went as fast as it came. Un-heard and unforgotten. No one will try to trace me back to humanity. I was just a thing made and destroyed. Same as everything else.

This isn't to say I need my name in the index of a history textbook to feel *something*, but it is to say I wish someone would be able to know me better than my self.

That is, if I were to die, if they could, they'll take all the dust of my body and mold it back into the shape of me, breathe life back into something undone just because they understood the warmness of my body better than I did, remembered every curve and pore of my skin, and loved me so tightly I was something that could be rebuilt again and again - in memory and in soul.

I want to live in someone's head. Reality is haunted by my presence. They find me in the spine of a poetry book, the crackle when the egg hits the pan, or the smell of fresh rain after Spring.

I want to be made human - every part of me real and alive and pulsing in someone's head - my laughter that haunts them in their sleep, the shy glances they steal to look at me, and my smile forever made tarnished in the backrooms of their mind.

I want them to hurt for me. Feel their heart crunch when they saw me cry. Rope moons and jump rivers, dry oceans and drown desserts, if it meant me being okay. If it meant I could pay them back another smile. I want them to catch the world in the bareness of their hands, skin their heart alive to say ""Here, here, this is what I have for you. Take all of me and run with it. ""

And I would do the same for them. I would unapologetically bleed myself if it meant I could feel their pulse again. Love them like their blood was something that could be spinned Gold. Wrestle Demons or Angels. Love them like it was the last thing I knew. Love them like it was obligated, sacred, a religion I devote myself to. Love them, love them, love them.

Anyway, I can’t stop thinking about it and I’m trying to get over it because he is not looking to get into a serious relationship and lives a separate life from me.

2709,Slytherin445,1644727460,1,"Sorry for this long post I’ve had a bad few days. I F22 feel like everyone around me is in a relationship. I have selective mutism and really bad social anxiety so it’s hard for me to talk to people. I was feeling really lonely a couple weeks ago and posted about it on Whisper. I got a dm from this guy and we were messaging for about a week and had plans to go out, which would have been my first date ever. 

I’ve never really had a conversation with a guy before, so it was very stressful for me and I didn’t really know what kind of flirting was normal. He said some really crass and overly sexual things, which I felt were weird to say to someone you’ve never met. I tried to dismiss those things and focus on all the nice things he said, however he made a comment jokingly talking about non consensual sodomy and I made the decision not to go out with him as I did not feel safe meeting him in person. I told him I didn’t want to talk anymore because of the comments he made, and even apologized if I had wasted his time, and he told me that wasting his time was a huge understatement. I know I was the one who brought up wasting his time, but his comment still really hurt me because I actually opened up to him and it just reinforced the negative thoughts in my head that I’m not even worth getting to know. 

I feel stupid for being this upset over a guy I never even met. Despite what he said to me, I still miss having someone to talk to, and receiving compliments. I literally hate myself and the way I look and when he complimented me I actually felt valued, which is why I think I let a lot of his comments slide. I just want to find a guy whose going to respect me and not pressure me into having sex until I’m ready. I don’t want this bad first attempt at almost dating to keep me from trying again, but I just don’t know how I’m supposed to meet people, I hardly leave my house and don’t feel comfortable using dating apps. Holding a conversation over text is hard enough and the thought of going on a date and having a conversation in person literally terrifies me.

2712,wylaxian,1644726960,1,"I'm kinda fat, I'm pasty white, I have a hard time wearing normal clothes, and I breathe wrong. My jaw's all fucked up and my face looks weird. I can't think or talk very fast or coherently. I am socially unaware. Most people ghost me after a few interactions. I'm an outcast.

When you're an outcast, your life sucks. You're not hanging out with alt girls and goth kids. You're not being celebrated by queer people or people of color. Actual outcasts don't have friends. They don't really get invited to go anywhere or considered to be a part of anything. People might not bully them, but they certainly won't care about them. Outcasts are supposed to fade into the background and die quietly while conformists and influencers dominate the stage.

And yet, all around me, I see skinny, attractive teenagers and fast-talkers talking about how they're ""weird"" and ""different"". There are luxury fashion brands that call themselves ""outsider fashion"" or ""outcast fashion"", as if outcasts are glamorous. I see content creators talking about their humble origins, and it sickens me. If someone manages to get pretty privilege and be successful, they're not outcasts, and they don't get to claim that identity anymore. It isn't a prize. It's an awful burden.

I saw a video by Veridis Joe about how he's ""weird"". It made me sick to my stomach. This is a guy who uses weird as an insult in any other video, and seems to celebrate fast-talking and bullying people who behave problematically because of social unawareness. I don't even disagree with him; I think he's right to condemn a lot of the people he condemns, but a guy with 150k+ subscribers doesn't get to talk about how much of an outcast he is when the rest of us are calling into suicide hotlines just to hear the sound of somebody else's voice. 

I don't even mean to call him out specifically, but he's the most recent in a long line of popular people trying to tell me that they know how it feels to be an outsider. Hell, they're not even trying to tell *me* anything—if these interactions were face-to-face, all these so-called ""outsiders"" would be actively avoiding me. Maybe they'd be right to; I'm pretty fucking hard to be around, apparently.

When was the last time any of these ""outsiders"" called into the suicide hotline? When was the last time they ate alone? When was the last time they left a bar in tears, because they couldn't find anyone to talk to? No, fuck that—when was the last time any of them genuinely lost control of their emotions and humiliated themselves in public? For me, it happens at least three times a week.

I hate the discourse about who's ""real"" and ""fake"". I don't like gatekeeping. But it genuinely hurts me to see how many people are claiming the title of outcast when they're living and broadcasting happy lives.",lonely,the appropriation of the outcast identity,2022-02-13 15:36:00
2713,nekoisitam,1644726106,1,"I'll start first. Right before I started high school all my friends left me because apparently I was weird, repetitive, boring, annoying, etc. I was bullied in middle school but when I stood up and fought the bullies back they just acted as victims and I was still the one in trouble.

After starting high school and remembering how bad everyone had been treating me back then I just didn't have the courage to talk to anyone and remained with absolutely 0 friends. My classmates in high school are waaaaay better than the ones in middle school (I fucking hate them), but what bothers me is that no one can really see my true personality. Everyone just thinks of me as ""The quiet kid"" or ""That weirdo that always isolates himself and doesn't ever talk"". It's honestly rather frustrating seeing everyone just judge you without knowing what you'd experienced in the past and automatically assume you're a cold person.

As high school is passing I am becoming less emotional, more careless, unfriendly and unwelcoming. The bullying in middle school literally made me think everyone is against me and now and I have to stand up but now that it's gone I have no one to stand up to.

2714,TerminalCorrosion,1644725925,1,"Hi there.

As the title states, I'm almost 30, without a single friend, and at this point, my family is completely exhausted from all of the bullshit I've caused.
I don't know what to do. I never learned how to act in social situations.. and even if I did know what to do, where would I go to meet people? Who would want to meet a person like me anyway?

I'm bipolar 1, so this state of mind will probably pass in a few days. I'll either go down deeper, or up to the highest high's again. And I'm just so goddamn tired of this endless roller coaster. I wish I was normal. I wish I was friendly. I wish I was nice, and kind, and generous with my heart... but I've beaten myself down so much over the years, I don't even know how to love anymore. I don't love myself. If not even I can love myself, why would anyone else? If I can't love myself, how could I ever love another? Romantic or no.

I feel trapped in this life. Trapped in this mind. This broken, garbage brain of mine. I wish I could restart, in a new body, with a better head on its shoulders. 

I've burned every bridge I've ever built. At this point, I'm unemployed, living at home with parents that rightfully want me gone.. I mean, I'm almost 30 for God's sake. As I said earlier, got no friends, no one to talk to, no health insurance, so no therapist or psychiatrist to go see. That being said, I've already tried therapy. I've already tried countless medications. Therapy may have helped, if I could have afforded to continue treatment... Medications never did, either made things worse, or completely dulled me, took what little of myself I actually kind of like away. 

I don't know.

Why the fuck am I even posting this? What will this solve? Other than a brief conversation with a complete stranger, in which they tell me *""Everything will be alright, just hang in there.""* This seems like just another in a long line of completely pointless efforts. 

I just want to lay my head down, close my eyes, and wake up a different man.

I am so, so very tired of this life I've made for myself.

Hope whoever reads this is in a much better spot than I am, and if not... *Everything will be alright, just hang in there.*",lonely,"Almost 30, completely alone.",2022-02-13 15:18:45

2731,LonleyUser,1644719795,1,"This is me just venting cause i need to get it off my chest. Feel free to look at TLDR 

I used to be really close with someone when I was in high-school. Probably the only person I really felt myself with even though I only knew them for a short time. Their family moved quite a bit and they were gone by the end of the year. We kept in touch in the beginning. Things eventually got quiet.

It's been maybe 7ish years since then and I'm a pretty lonely dude. I'm not sure if I can be considered *truly* alone cause I have people I'm friendly with, but I still feel pretty insignificant to my peers. I'm the quintessential ""extra friend"". I'd always be the one to keep the conversation going and text first, etc. When I stopped doing that (as an experiment to see what would happen), things were quiet on all fronts. The only people who actively contact me is family and scammers. It's honestly painful.

The only reason I got a social media was see what people were up to cause I'd be totally in the dark if I didn't. Sometimes I get fed up and delete the app only to come crawling back to it. It's bittersweet seeing people make new friends and have new relationships. They make it seem *so easy*. I literally can't comprehend how people can make close friends and open up so easily. 

**Cutting to the chase:** I found the profile of the old friend who moved away. They look like they're having a great time with the crowd they've settled into. Old memories hit me and I tried reaching out to them. I only get one word answers or nothing in return. I tried reaching out a few more times before I recognized that I was rekindling ""extra friend"" habits I promised to stop for my own sanity and mental health. 

I've always thought the people featured on r/niceguys were super clueless for not taking a hint when people didn't want to speak with them. I nearly broke in half when I realized that my old friend didn't want to speak to me. Silence *was* their response. I realized that they didn't want *me* in their lives and that was that. I tell myself that if my peers cared about me, I wouldn't need to beg them to talk to me. I cried a good 30mins last night when I realized it applied to them too. I don't think I've ever felt so foolish and insignificant before...

And yet, we're still ""friendly"" on social media (and it makes me feel like an idiot). I get unreasonably excited whenever they post on instagram. I like their photos but don't comment because I don't want to seem too intrusive  (I understand they'd rather not speak to me). I only keep my snapchat because they actively look at my private stories. They wished me a happy birthday recently...something they haven't done in *years*. 

That's the extent of our contact, though. The worst part is that I pathetically look *forward to it* (like an idiot). It's like they're ""there"" but not really, I guess. I'm mentally aware that I need to stop and get some self-respect. I think that my emotions just need to catch up...

If you all read this far, thanks. I'm glad I got that all out.

2736,Junefullmoon,1644718199,1,"I've spent the most part of my official adult life trying to please someone hoping i'll be loved in return. I was 19 when I met my first real boyfriend. I spent the last 12 years trying to please him and be there for him, regardless of how mean he was to me. There was alot of breakups and alot of getting back together after false promises. There was a year in there that we split and dated separately. I ended up dating one guy exclusively and that ended horribly and got back together with my ex, mistake. 

I don't have close family. I don't have close friends, I lost most of them cause I kept choosing the toxic men in my life. My fault. I also have a habit of not keeping many new people close because I felt like my home life would run them off. 

Now its just my kids and I. I haven't felt not lonely in close to a decade. No matter how hard I tried to love. How much I tried to please. What I forgave... im still here, basically by myself. Im constantly checking my phone hoping for God knows what. Someone to give a fuck?

I've never been good enough to marry, or even as little have a guy remember my birthday. I'm not a bad person. I just make bad red flag decisions. And I know, gotta love your self first blah blah blah. But im just the type of person that really really wants someone in my life.

2741,Dipesh1990,1644716241,1,"I think the easiest way to overcome our problems is by focusing on something greater than ourselves, like helping others or taking care of the planet.

A lot of the time when we try to do this we get burnt out and start to suffer, and I feel like that is because we have this expectation from others. In my experience if there is no expectations from other people than there's not much suffering. If we keep helping others then that helpful energy will come back to us, and help us when we need it.

We are always caught up in our own problems and what we will get out of the situation. And I think that's the root cause of the problem. We shouldn't be focusing on ourselves all the time, there's a need to take care of our body and mind, but not to constantly worry about yesterday and tomorrow. There's a need for a long term plan to get ourselves out of the hole we have dug ourselves into.

I consider myself an introvert because going out and socially engaging takes a lot of effort and energy out of me, but I still enjoy the safety of having other people around. So I’m introverted but not anti-social.

So here I am trying to distract myself. I love being at work because my coworkers are around working too. I don’t have to put any energy into interacting with them. It’s just chill. But when I’m home, I find it hard to rest alone. I don’t do much other than sleep.

So I guess I’ll just try to keep myself distracted. What foods do y’all enjoy? I’m trying to go on a meat-light diet and would love recipe suggestions. I’ve never been a big meat eater but inflation has made it nearly impossible to afford more than the occasional meat purchase.

this is maybe a very uncommon topic but since months and years I want to be hugged from beautiful girls. Also I have dreams where I have an accident and someone helps me and is there for me..

Anyway, do you have the same dreams or are yours more positive, is this normal what I dream or a sign of depression?
So the thing is that I would like to have a girlfriend and friends because I have no one, maybe it is a sign of loneliness?

I like to cry in my dreams and I like to play the victim but isn't it unprofitable when I want friends/a girlfriend because no one likes victims?

I’m happy being friends but I just want something more for once in my life. I want to be someone’s favorite. I want someone to go out of their way for me for the first time in my life. I just want to feel like someone genuinely cares.

I’ve been spiraling the last few days. Humans are tribal creatures and I have no tribe. I feel so alone, empty and hopeless. I would do anything to get rid of how I feel. If I was 21 and not living with my parents I’d probably be drinking away. I feel I’ll die before finding people who genuinely want me around.",lonely,"Depressed, Empty, Alone",2022-02-13 09:18:22

2782,rightclickunzip,1644702680,1,"I'm a complete failure of a person. I don't have any friends. I can't keep any friends or relationships. I end up pushing everyone away. I thought I was growing and becoming a better person but I'm not. I'm the same exact person I was a year ago. and I'm repeating the same mistakes over and over again. 

recently I've been feeling like absolute shit. I've been stressed like crazy because of work, school, and having to deal with becoming an adult. my mom keeps pressuring my about college, getting a driver's license, making some friends. but I don't know what I want to do in life. I don't want to go to college. I don't want to drive. it's terrifying. and my pharmacy switched my prescription of my medicine for no reason. this new medicine has me physically ill and exhausted. and it has my hormones all over the place. I feel like I'm a slave to my own emotions. 

and then my boyfriend broke up with me. we got into a fight, it wasn't even anything big, it was a small issue we could have easily worked through. this time of the year isn't good for me because this was around the time I met my ex and endured sexual and emotional abuse. and when we got into that fight my boyfriend said he needed to be alone, and left without saying goodnight or I love you or anything. all night I cried, I cried myself to sleep because all I could do was worried. I was terrified that he hated me or was thinking about leaving me. so the next day I talked about it with my boyfriend, and I told him about how I felt. he just said, ""okay sorry"", nothing more, and then continued to talk about how I was rude to him and how what I did wasn't right. and I know that it wasn't, but to have how I felt completely shut down like that. it hurt really bad. we kept arguing and my boyfriend said again, he needed to be alone and he was leaving. I begged and pleaded for him to stay. I begged and said I was terrified of being alone, terrified of him leaving me and hating me. I completely overstepped his boundaries and crossed a line I shouldn't have which is the same thing that pushed my ex away almost exactly one year ago. my boyfriend called me mentally unstable and broke up with me on the spot, just like that. 

I just wanted to work things out with him. I didn't want to feel that empty and alone feeling. but my insecurities got the best of me. but still, to break up with me just like that. to forget about everything like it was nothing. I don't understand it. 

and three days before valentines day too. I've never had a single good valentines day in recent years. every single one, for one reason or another. it ended up being a bad memory. my boyfriend said he'd try to give me a good valentines day. and now this happens. I don't even know when he's going to talk to me again. or if he wants to talk to me again. I feel so empty and alone. and I got him gifts for valentines day, one of them just arrived today. I don't even know if he's going to open them or just throw them away. 

I hardly have any friends. one of my friends has been a good help to me, but he's very busy. he has his own life to deal with so he can't talk to me very often. but that's pretty much all I have. I tried talking to one of my old and most trusted friends who I haven't talked to in a long time. we used to be very close until he admitted he had feelings for me and couldn't be friends with me because he couldn't respect the relationship I was in. he's always been my life line, the one person I could talk to and come to when I feel like I have nothing. but not even he can help me. he explained that he's busy now, he has no time for me. he has a girlfriend who he spends all his time with now. he has many friends. he can't babysit me anymore. 

so now I'm left with nothing. I want to become a better person, I'm desperate to. but I feel so alone. I've always, for my entire life been the type of person who needs others. I base my life around my friends and my relationships. I thrive when I have people who can support me and just people I can have fun with. when I'm alone, nothing matters. nothing that I find enjoyable is fun anymore. everything I do I just feel empty, even my hobbies that I consider to be my favorite. I can't do them. 

I've been taking off work but I had to go today because I don't want to get fired. I have two jobs, I have to work a lot. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, going to work and suffering trying to put on a straight face. last year when this same thing happened I was put into a depression for months. I quit my job and spent all my time laying in bed. I feel like it's going to happen again. I haven't eaten or showered in days. I can't bring myself to shower so I look and feel like shit. my eyes are so swollen I look like I've aged 20 years. and I'm starving but I can't bring myself to stomach anything. 

I just want to go to bed. I just want to cry. I just want to go to bed and wake up like everything is a bad dream. I'm so lonely. I just want to be consoled and hugged so bad. I just want anyone to tell me that it's going to be okay and I don't have to cry. but I don't even know if I deserve that. I'm a horrible person. I can't handle being alone even for just a second. I'm not mature enough for anything. I'm still the same child I was last year, or even the year before that. I'm sad and empty and feeling like I want to just disappear and nobody cares. 

I just want the pain to stop",lonely,I'm sitting at work trying not to cry. I feel like I have nothing and no-one. I'm a complete failure,2022-02-13 08:51:20

I must say that I am indeed a very positive person, and try to see the good side on everything, but lately things are becoming way to difficult to bare. 

I won't write down an autobiography or anything like that so I won't waste anyone's time on unimportant shit, But I feel like this words are stuck in the botton of my throat and I need to write them down. So, my wife died on the 21st of january 2021 and my dad died on the 23rd, both claimed by covid before ever having the chance of getting the vaccine. Ever since that day I've been isolating myself more and more, I've completely shut myself away from the world and I feel like I've lost everything I ever loved in this world. My dad and my wife were not just my only family, they were my best friends and the reason I woke up every morning. I have no-one left after their passing. 

I've used to be a businessman, owned my own pub/restaurant, but after 2 years of restrictions and having to stay close 8 months total really ruined me and I was no longer capable of keeping the business afloat. So yeah...bankruptcy...not fun! but the Icing on the cake was my accident! 

The icing on the cake happened 4 months ago, I was hit by a car crossing the streets, shattered my leg and wrist, broke my ribs and had a punctured lung, almost died again and now I am in chronic pain, surviving through painkillers and a cane to walk around. Anyway, I sued the driver, got some money, but used it on a surgery that wasn't covered by my countries health care system, It's the only reason I can still walk, even with the help of a cane. 

So yeah, I can't work, been trying to find solutions, but to no avail, I am on welfare, but it's not enough to pay both rent and food+meds, of course i choose to buy the later, so I'll be evicted at the end of the month and have nowhere to go and will be forced to live in a shelter or the streets. 

Even with all the bad in my life, I still appreciate the good, I am alive, that alone is a miracle, and I am sure this is a storm before something amazing happening, so I am not too worried and I am hopeful that something better will come, but I'd be lying if I said I'm not scared, hell, I am terrified, but I'll find a way to fix this situation. 

The loneliness tho, the loneliness is maddening, I miss my wife and dad so much, everyday they're in my prayers and thoughts, but I just miss them, their company, their laughs, I want to be with them so badly that hurts.

I'm in college trying to get a degree so I'm not working at the moment and barely have time to myself in between raising a kid alone and being in school. I have all A's. Not that it means much, but I'm proud of it.

I had this weekend to myself because both boys are with their dad. I saw a party being advertised on Instagram all week so I decided to go, but couldn't find anyone to go with. It was a costume party, so I tried to dress up with whatever I had in my closet and ended up looking really cute/cool! I thought for sure I look cool enough for these people. The party was in New Orleans and it was basically like a rave/costume party. I ended up going alone, which I didn't want, but I really didn't wanna sit inside alone doing algebra lmao.

I was super nervous and had almost a panic attack in my car before getting out to go in to the party. Idk why. I physically fit in with these people but still felt so out of place. I just don't really socialize with many people anymore and mainly hang out with just my kid. I don't even talk to people at school. Anyway, so I go in, the party was just starting so there wasn't many people there yet. I got a drink, smoked a cigarette or two cuz I was so nervous, and tried to dance a lil bit. By myself lol. 

I did this basically all night, and ended up with a headache from all the cigarettes and liquor. I tried to start conversations with a couple groups of people and failed miserably. There were two dudes talking about old violins and I chimed in, respectively of course, saying ""oh yall talking about violins? I have a super old one too, it's from the 1920s"". They were just like ""oh cool"" and stopped talking to me. It's like I tried to relate, wasn't rude about cutting in to their convo, but still my energy wasn't reciprocated. Also, a friend, ""friend"", I've known since high school was there and didn't even acknowledge me when I said hey. I mean, they said hey but that was basically like it. Also another dude I traveled with years ago was there. Talked to me for 2 secs and dipped. I guess I'm just not understanding why people don't like me or want to talk to me.

I spent the whole night alone, dancing with people but not really with people, yknow? I left around 4 am after giving up on meeting anyone interested in talking to me. Like I said, I fit in physically, I looked the part, but still wasn't ""cool"" enough for anyone to talk to me.

I’ve written a paragraph to introduce myself and 85% of the time no one answers out of the probably 150 people I’ve tried to start a friendship with. 

I could go on a rant, but life is so short. My family has dealt with sicknesses since Christmas, my family then after getting the flu got COVID and I have been taking care of them since together. 

Recently my dog passed away,  and I just don’t know. He was my baby boy and he had the best life he could have ever had, and I’ll see him in heaven with much of my family when it’s time. It will take time but I know I will get through this. 


I’m just tired and want someone to talk to. I’m tired of trying to reach out so often- I just want some good and mature friends. No games or bots or stuff, just realistic people. If I don’t reply I am sorry as this has been a very difficult year, but I will try my best. 

Here is a post from last time as I just can’t type this all over again- thank you and love you all.

M23, Currently beginning my legal education! 

I’m looking for some friends to talk to, I have had some success but I wanted to try more to see if that works out. 

Notes: 
Please be 18+, have a bit of a seasoned account(as in you didn’t make it in the last week), and be ready for any intellectual conversations. Please know I don’t flirt, nor do I want a relationship right now. The most I got, and enjoy, and my dumb jokes lol. 


Extra: 
I’m dry at first, until I find a topic I know rather well. Nonetheless, I will do my best, and celebrate your own interests as well, as that’s what friends are for.

Concerning my hobbies, I have 5 garden beds I take care of, I used to do historical research (Roman, US, US Feminism, US Racial History, some East Asian) and I enjoy it a lot. I’m pretty glad to have book recommendations as well, since I tend to ready about these topics. If you want to LEARN, I am more than happy to help you and provide books to recommend. 

I play trumpet, sing, and a little piano and guitar. I’m wanting to get a new guitar though for Christmas since it always sounds out of tune haha. Then I also do hiking when I can, camping, and cooking/baking. If you wanna learn trumpet I can do that too for fun.

2805,CaffeineEnjoyer,1644694866,1,"I have no friends, I have never dated, I have never fit in during my days at school and I don't fit in at college. 

There's no connection between me and other people. The conversations are always about something I'm not interested in. I made a friend, or an acquaintance really, and our conversations don't do anything. My conversations with them amount to nothing and are boring. I worked at a part-time job for 2 or 3 weeks before disappearing from it, they commented on the fact that I do not discuss anything with them. They thought I disliked them. I don't have any opinions towards them, my mind is blank. I had nothing to say to anything.

I don't want to feel how I feel, I feel like I have nothing to live for. there's nothing to to look forward to and nothing to miss. 

I wouldn't be able to make a real human connection if I tried. I also wouldn't be able to date. I've never wanted to see anybody and consequently no one has ever wanted to see me. One time I saw an attractive women but it just made me sad. I feel like an ape in a pack of primates that is left out of everything and is physically weak. Like a rat in those rat utopia experiments.

 Life for me is sleep, schoolwork, sleep, schoolwork. I feel like a degenerate weirdo. I live on the fringes of society it seems. I am not like other people. I don't care about anything. I cannot remember the last time I've ever actually wanted to do anything. I don't look forward to things, I am incapable of doing that. 

There's no way to integrate into society. It rips everything from me and gives me nothing. School work, sleep, repeat. Life is not about enjoyment only doing repetitive useless things for no big reason. Consciousness is hell.

I never get a good amount of sleep. Always either 8 hours max but mostly 6 or 5. I don't know what it would be like to have a girlfriend. I don't think I experience emotion on the same ""plain"" as other people and thus cannot get a girlfriend.

I cannot stress this enough: Life is meaningless. I feel like I am talking to robots when they try to interpret what I mean. Maybe I'm the robot. Everyday I do tasks and things. It doesn't matter. I don't care about anything. I don't care about eating, I don't care about schoolwork, I don't care about my health, I don't care about people, I don't care about the news, I don't care about anything! If the people closest to me died, I don't think it would affect me at all. 

It feels like I live in someone else's world. I feel like an object rather than a person. 

I experience little to no pleasure in life. it's all seriousness. No purpose.

2817,asking4boobies,1644691350,1,"At least, it is for me. When I tell people how terrible my online dating experiences are, these are the types of responses I get:

“Yeah man it’s all about hookups on those apps.”

Ok… like that’s a bad thing? I’d LOVE to get a hookup! But I haven’t gotten any matches! And when I do, they don’t message me! I don’t understand why people would say “Don’t worry about it dude, it’s just sex” as if that’s a bad thing. 

“You’ll never know unless you put yourself out there/Don’t even bother, you’ll find someone eventually”

I hate these pieces of advice because they’re literally the exact opposite. How am I supposed to meet someone if I don’t put myself out there? At the same time, putting myself out there makes me look desperate?! So I’m just fucked either way?!

“Don’t worry, you’ll find The One”

This one really gets my goat. I’m not looking for *the one*. I’m looking for *someone*. I know I’m not going to find the love of my life right away, but for God’s sake, dude… I just one to go on ONE lousy date! That’s it!

2855,coffee-cactus,1644667541,1,"Some days have been easier than others and some days have been really hard. That’s what anyone says. I don’t know if I’m becoming emotionally numb or just becoming the hyper-independent girl I was before you. The girl who kept everything to herself, didn’t allow herself to be vulnerable and express herself to anyone, and just accepted being alone. 

It becomes numbing when you don’t really have anyone you want to talk to and do stuff with. To look forward to talking to and cherish their good morning messages or that they took the time to leave a voice mail because you fell asleep before they could call. It doesn’t feel fair when so many people take that for granted, when I’ve been here for going on two years and only have myself. 

It doesn’t feel fair, but so many things in my life hasn’t been fair and just feels like another part of the shitty hand I’ve been dealt. A hand that I just have to deal with it because it’s my life. How many twenty year olds get up go to work, come home, don’t talk to anyone, maybe eat, maybe try to do something they kinda enjoy, but mainly just sleep or consider drinking because then they don’t have to feel anything or try to feel something? How many don’t even want to try making friends anymore because all you have been is sexualized, heartbroken, abused, and traumatized? When it doesn’t feel like living anymore and just like trying to be an adult losing all the things you looked forward to and hoped of. When your life has become trying to exist instead of thinking about places you want to go, things you want to do, goals you have, wanting to be happy. But instead trying to ignore the thoughts of wondering if I’ll ever genuinely be happy again or am I just trying my best to exist. To fight away the thoughts of if I’m meant to be completely alone. Without a family. Without friends. Without love. To fight away the thoughts of wondering if it would make a difference if I was here or not, that any of my effort is actually changing anything, or if my existence is more pain than it’s worth. 

Being told your young and have time, but your entire life has felt like you never had youth and already feel like you’ve lost so much. Feeling naive because at one point you were happy and your smiles were genuine and not a coverup of all the pain you held inside. Once hopeful eyes that took pain as strength and thought better days would be along the line. That moving out would finally let you start to heal from the abuse you’ve known your whole life. Feeling that you were naive to think that things would actually get better for you. Feeling you are at fault for ruining that one thing that gave you hope that gave you lightness instead of the black void you feel inside everyday. I’m logical. I know there is nothing I can say or even offer the world to you that would change your mind. I know that yet this suffocating feeling of wanting that happiness, that love, that care you once felt for one person that they felt for you. 

No matter how you try to distract yourself, it’s crawls in the crevices of your mind always shadowing your thoughts until those nights were the little grey cloud you’ve been shewing away starts pouring. Filling your mind till you’re drowning and no amounts of self care and therapy can silence the voice of wanting to sink under the bath water. To succumb to the seductive voice in your head telling you to let your lungs let out your final breathe as the once warm bath water turns cold. To tongue kiss death as the fear of it sheds each day as a succubus flirts with its fresh prey. 

The looming reminder of them and the fact that it feels like they have forgotten about you and that all that was invested meant nothing. That they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth to a degree which you understand. You know you shouldn’t, but you still love them. You still care and wondering if they are eating, and sleeping okay. Wonder if they are happy and doing well and hopefully less stressed out. Wonder if they think about how you felt under their finger tips. The way you fell asleep in their arms. The way that you were so vulnerable and trusting. And no matter how stupid you know it is and the facts can prove yourself wrong. Yet you wonder if they still love you. . .

I tried writing down what I’ve been feeling and thinking I’m hope of possibly feeling better, but I just feel more empty and broken. I’ve been going to therapy and trying my best to get better, but each day I feel more numb to the world. I’m tired of hearing that things will get better in time, but with how much I’ve been through it doesn’t feel like it. Am I just bound to this reality? 

PS: I know the grammar and flow of this is probably shit, but that wasn’t the focus as stated previously. I apologize if that caused any frustration or irritation. Also, those who might be confused, the “You” I’m referring to is my ex-boyfriend. I’m sorry this is super long, but again trying to put words to my thoughts and feelings. . . There is much being said in between the lines as well as somethings I couldn’t bring myself to put into words. It’s not just a breakup. I wish that were all I had to deal with.",lonely,Alone and not really in a good place at the moment. . .,2022-02-12 23:05:41

That being said if you wonder, my interests are reading, my favorite book is game of thrones; listening to music; genres that go from classical to classic rocks to pop, playing video games; Minecraft, EU4, and CK2 on pc. I also speak three languages, and have some lovely pets.

I’m not looking to talk to anyone in particular, other than what I just said, I want someone as friendly as I strive to be.

2858,Emphraa,1644665837,1,"It's hard for me to write this down..

During alot of my life, I've always failed. I don't know what exactly was the impact of these failures but they far outweigh any good that came my way

For a long time I tried to face these things and carry on with my life. Maybe tomorrow is a better day? Maybe the day after that, or the one after that. 

It's been a good 5yrs now. And good did come. But it was outweighed by the bad. And what good did come, by my own actions turned into some bad and very heavy to carry things (why I keep carrying them is another conversation). 

I know life is alot longer than 5yrs. And I'm not even 24 yet. But the trend in which my life is going, how good things turn into bad things and bad things become even worse things, it's very difficult to be brave enough to live on.

At the start of February I decided that I will pay close attention to the good things and ignore the bad. But like a loud horn in my ear, the bad things simply force me to look at them. And the good things are too fragile and fickle for me to keep focusing on them. They're not as strong as all the bad things going on in my life. 

I have become a bitter, whiny and sad individual. I cry alot, I complain as you can see, and i no longer have the patience to keep on living in this trend in my life.

I've tried to live, my petty defiance to keep living despite all the bad has been watered down over the long years. My bravery is giving out. 

I hope something good happens. Something strong enough to drown out all the bad things. I know waiting may only lead to more waiting, but at my current strength, I honestly cant hope for any better than this. 

I will give myself a few more days. I will focus on the good. But I'm not very optimistic. With all the courage and will I can marshal, I will live another day.

Until I cant take it anymore. Please forgive me for being such a coward...

Thank you for reading. English isnt my first language, I'm not very good at it.

I've been self reflecting for some time now, and I'm going to continue doing it. I'm also going to attempt to treat my body more nicely and pick up a lot of hobbies for my entertainment. Oh, and for context, I am a senior doing online schooling. I have friends I communicate with maybe twice a month. To my misfortune, they're social creatures unlike me, so they're dwelling amongst each other at school in person while I'm the only one in the friend group that decided to remain at home- granted, it *was* my choice so I have nobody but me to blame. 

I have come to realize as we slowly start to communicate less and less that those friends I had, despite them being loyal and truthful- they were just temporary friends. Friends gifted for me during my time of being a freshman/sophomore. As soon as covid hit, that was when my personal journey began and we've strayed away from each other. I decided during 2020 that it would be best to make use of quarantine and find out who I am, thus I became more mature along the way. 

I am a reserved, sophisticated teenager who just wants a simple life; having a job, and saving enough money to buy a small apartment and just living like that. I have no interest in having a huge career, getting a big house, or having children once I'm an established adult.

Everything being physical at first and then it being intimate .. generally makes me feel that i wont be able to find someone who i can share my life

Friends who have betrayed me... Partners cheating on me..i have come to a state where i wont be able to trust anyone. I dont think i would be able to love someone with my whole heart as instincts would kick in and get defensive and ruin it. Even if i find a good friend..me being clingy might make them go away.

At this point of life i have stopped trying to make friends or look out for a partner. Just finding new stuff to experience alone and doing stuff i like is not really helping me as such.

The emptiness is never filled and it feels like im not even ready to put myself in a position to find someone to fill it.

2906,Careless_Jaguar8008,1644641187,1," here on a throwaway account. I posted this on r/self a while ago but I been feeling sad again recently and want opinions on this


I was born premature and was diagnosed with autism from a young age. Didn't have much friends during childhood. During my pre-teen years when I first had access to the internet I decided that people irl sucked and met people online who I can call friends. Because of this I rarely made effort to make friends irl. This wasn't really a problem for me though, I spent almost all my teenage years with no irl friends, until a few months ago. 


At the first day of this year I had a long distance relationships of 8 months end. From then until now I had a number of friendships, i think I can count with 7 people, some were platonic, that didn't last long due to them being fake friends. 2 of which hurt me the most. The first person sent a message saying that we can't be friends anymore for some reason I'm still baffled about to this day and blocked me. The second (I'm still not over this one) started to become less active in our relationship and in the end didn't want me around anymore. Because of these bad experiences it's hard for me to trust anyone and I believed that even if I do get another relationship they would just dump me again for whatever reason. I also have clinical depression lasting almost 6 years and these people made me happy for a bit. I have been really sad lately because of how lonely I am, I do have (online) friends but they aren't close friends like those people were. I have no one to call best friend, to talk to everyday, etc. I feel so pathetic.

I wanted to be loved, cared for, feel wanted to someone and to love them back too.
I wanted to come home to someone and see their face, talk to them, hold them, ask about their day or plan a fun day together. 
But it doesn't matter If you are smart, pretty, funny, fit, normal.

But I realized, love doesn't exist anymore like it use to. People so easily dispose other people, they go on apps and find someone new for causual dating or hooks ups now. People don't want simple  cute dates or just to spend time anymore. 
People want accessible, easy, convenient to help their needs and urges. 
No love involved anymore. People don't value or want kind, warm hearted People anymore it's outdated now. 
Relationships are meaningless and no longer needed. No one doesn't do that anymore.

I learned that love is pain, people just want to physically/mentally abuse others or scam them and waste your time by exploiting your vulnerabilities. 
There's nothing to love anymore, people just settle for anything, it's mostly lust and friendship, nuy no actually love. It's been an illusion to believe you are wanted and make more kids to bring in the world.

And people say ""you'll find someone,"" or 
""There's plenty of fish,"" 
Is like saying, ""there's food in the fridge, but nothing to eat,"" or telling a homeless person, ""there's plenty of houses,"" they don't understand, dating was easy to them.

I will be alone, even surrounded with people I'm still alone and should just accept my loneliness, be a hermit I was destined to be.

It crushes my heart everytime I think about.
Like a painful ache just squeezing it. My heart just doesn't  want to accept that reality. My heart wants to connect, feel loved and care for, but it doesn't understand  that people don't do that anymore. People want to abuse or hurt us
No one wants us

No other heart beat to lay next to or listen too. That warmth we crave so much, doesn't exist anymore in this cold world. There's no other fire to be next too. 

I wish I was loved by someone, get married one day, build a family, been patient, but those values are no longer wanted and old to think that way.

I work out everyday, and eat well. I have a somewhat crafted body but I’m not satisfied yet. I sleep at 8pm and wake up at 4am to hit the weights because I wouldn’t be able to fit it in my schedule otherwise and it gives me the extra time to get ready for school. I also have the fucking Patrick Bateman face routine (it’s pretty different though) because I look up to him for his self preservation. I have a good family, though I am not close to them, they still provide me with food, shelter and luxuries.

My grades are a work in progress and I plan on retaking a few classes next year. I fall behind because I go to school hella late if I’m late with my routine simply because I value my health more than my education. 

I have many friends at school but nobody I can truly connect with. They are just there for company and most of them seem to like me. I really have nothing in common with these washed up pot heads. I don’t even smoke weed anymore, only nicotine but that’s a typical high school thing where I live and I mostly do it to fit in.

I left my actual closet friend of 7 years because he crossed me multiple times. This is a major reason as to why I’m not close with people anymore.

I have a good physique from all the hours I’ve put into dieting and working out. My major flaw is my nose.

It’s my biggest insecurity. 

I desperately need a girlfriend and I suck at flirting and talking to girls. Some girls I would date liked me for a bit but I didn’t act soon enough and I think most of them moved on.

That and also myself, seeing how co- dependant I became with my ex, my exams almost got impacted by it but luckily wasn't, I was anxious 24/7 without talking to them, I was really unhealthy. I don't know if I can ever be loved by anyone. 

Part of my reason going to the gym was competition with my friend, seeing how close I got to his deadlift PR, I'm probably 10 kg away. The other reason was to try turn things around, more healthy physically and mentally, maybe even socially. I'm still stupidly antisocial. The saddest reason of all, I wanted to look better so that I can attract someone. I don't think I look to good.

I admit that I am pathetic, I want to die because I can't get a girlfriend.

I sometimes want to scream for help and be loved but I'm just sat with a poker face

I don't like my personality, tbh I am jealous of other people, I have a negative attitude to a lot of things, my only redeeming thing is that with most stuff, despite having a negative frowning attitude, I still get some things done. I give dirty looks to my other friend in my head when he says positive things about himself, things like, 'oh I see some more definition on my arms'. I'm just a douche bag inside, I don't like it.

Hey. I’ve been reading posts entitled, “I just want a friend” and “I’m so lonely, please help.” But the creators don’t respond to messages.

I do believe that loneliness is a terrible debilitating problem. But so many here treat it like a cancer where you can complain that you’re going to die because you have it and you get to be mean and nasty to others who genuinely want to help because they don’t understand your pain.

Nope! Everyone who posts or lurks here understands what it’s like not to have friends show up at a birthday party for or not have a shoulder to cry on or to feel completely left out.

You’re not special in your loneliness. More than 40% ofUS citizens are suffering!

Once again, you’re not special but you are important.

Damn important.

We need each other to cure our own loneliness.

Stop being victims of your loneliness and do something to cure it… like answer a chat message when you ask for connection. Don’t just talk about your pain but also listen.

Fight that fear of rejection. Fight that pain of resentment.

2949,Danial__zh,1644624750,1,"Hi, I would like to share something with you!
Some of us always trying to find a GF or BF because we may think this would fix our loneliness and our feelings.

Well I've had this thoughts at least, was alone for 21 years and for 1 year I was trying to find a girlfriend to talk to (I tried in social media)

And after trying for that, I unexpectedly became close friends with a girl in PlayStation and we were spending so much time everyday in games and talking about everything in life, laughing, sometimes saying love you in messages. (Nothing special)

But all of this ruined after a few months because I was still feeling lonely even we loved each other and spending 6+ hours talking together.

I won't make it longer but here's what I found:

As long as I'm not happy and okay in life if I'm alone, going in friendships won't fix that for me. 

If I wanna be happy and okay in a relationship, I should be like that before engaging. 

And there's something else...

However I'm alone now, but my loneliness was better before this friendship, because as long as I didn't experienced love, I was only sad Because of that, but once I felt it, now my loneliness hurts more.

Took months until I recovered myself

And if you are wondering, all of that friendship ruined since she didn't want it to be in real life, she said:


""I love you so much more than anyone I've ever had in my life and I never wanna lose you, that's why I don't want ever meet you in real life, ever, you can find another girl and marry and we stay friends in social and not real life""


That was when I realized something else as well, if you're going to have a friendship or relationship, try to ask and understand what's your point of having that friendship, because you may cry someday because your friend had different sight!

at this point im in a bad emotional state from failure but here goes
What I’ve learned from approaching 700 girls…it’s really looks or popularity at the end of the day. There’s nothing else to it. I’ve approached women through Snapchat, Instagram, highschool, work, and public approaches.

Through Snapchat I’d text a chick and everything would go smooth until asking me what I look like, and this is the point the interest fell off. Either shed tell me I’m not her type, say I’m ugly, say she has a bf, or give smokescreen excuses as to why she doesn’t want to go on a date with me. With Instagram no matter how smooth and witty i tried to be nomatter how normal and fun i tried to appear, it was always the same. I’d be ghossted, left on seen, it never went anywhere. In highschool I was bold enough to talk to and constantly ask out chicks because i had no fear, I would be rejectedd because they’re interetsed in another guy or they aren’t looking for anything or they’d call me ugly. Like my tall goood looking friend   tried to set me up with his ex and she just called me ulgy, and said that’s the reason. At work i’d be upfront and get the snapchat and id get flaked on or reject3d, i never caught a break. And I was a lifeguard were there were no shortage of chicks. In public like mall and target I had a high rate of getting the information except they’d not respond or give smokescreen excuses why they don ’t want to hangout. The common denominator was always my fa ce. At the end of the day I understood I didn’t have the looks or popularity to makeup for my looks which made me doomed to fail. At the end of the day women are men with a 😺. It’s always been about attractive ness. What i had to do is plan palstic surgery on my face to make me more attracitve. I catfshed my face into a better version and posted on tinder and i was swarmed by the womnen. Everything is confirmed. It’s not about common interests, it’s about how you look

I quit smoking 2,5 years ago, which used to enable me to socialize outside of pubs or in the youth center, but because of the sudden lack of reason to actually be near other people at these places, I started drinking more heavily, which gradually evolved into full-fledged alcoholism when I started going to university and had a place of my own (student dorm room). However, since the drinking affected both my financial stability and made me fail two important exams, I went teetotal. I've been clean for 20 days now, and I have never felt more helpless in dealing with the loneliness.

I've made the conscious decision to try and focus on my university duties, to study harder and properly complete my experimental project (I study experimental neuropsychology and I'm developing a visual and auditory perception experiment in a VR environment), but I've noticed in the past that overloading myself with work doesn't actually distract me from the incessant feelings of loneliness - this observation was in fact what led me to smoke and drink in the first place. I don't know what will happen during the coming months, and I don't look forward to finding out. This conscious decision to try and focus on my work, essentially to try and become a workaholic, will not help me. It will not ease the loneliness, but I'll do it anyway because it's the only thing I can do to avoid encountering other people. This seems contradictory, since meeting other people would presumably help me in defeating this loneliness, but merely seeing other people has actually become enough to get me to feel downtrodden, hopeless, in constant jealousy-infused agony, because merely seeing other people in public, where their friendships and love lives are ostentatiously showcased, already causes a near-involuntary chain reaction of sadness, ruminative thoughts on experiencing this constant lack of true, human connection, let alone meeting a potential significant other, and actual, physical malaise, all of which I'm sick and tired of having to go through on a daily basis.

I don't know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish by posting this here. I assume it's to be able to get this off my chest, since I have no one close to me who could perhaps comfort me and assure me it will all be okay. At least I still have my cats and dogs, who are always happy to see me and who I can cuddle with whenever the touch starvation becomes too unbearable (at least when I'm home, not when I'm in my dorm room - which is 80% of the time).",lonely,"I got all of my addictions under control, and now I have nothing left to battle the loneliness",2022-02-12 08:05:48

Of course I quickly fixed it and will never charge them a dime for any IT service or help as they are my friends. The fucking ashole hasnt even sent a thank you msg for fixing the pc. They just expect me to be kind like always.

2990,ScreamWitch,1644609784,1,"As an average young guy I didn't know what being ""lonely"" truly means until my depression phase. It felt heavier each year as I was stuck in my mental prison and forced to watch every single one of my friends disappear as they move towards their own future. At the end no one was aware of me and no one had any expectations from me except my mother. I was somehow the main villain of the story even though I tried to be nothing but nice to others. The last basket I put all my eggs in (a girl that I hope was different than others) was now judging me with foolish assumptions. I couldn't take it anymore and left social media completely. I don't want to get into details since this post is meant to be somehow motivational but it took me well over 5 years to get out of this sink. It was full of ups and downs, despair and most importantly a lonely road. I've tried to socialize mainly on discord and with that I also understand that no one gives a f. about you unless you stand out. None of my interactions lasted longer than couple hours. I was either ghosted or totally ignored. Failing at each and every interactions in your life is a hard pill to swallow. But I didn't want to give up. I forced myself out of my room and tried to run in nature for couple minutes everyday. No matter how disgusted I felt of this life or how appealing it was to shut myself in, I've never turned back. As a result I attend to my uni. exam one last time and get into one of my dream schools with %50 scholarship. After all of my mental wars, I'm able to control my emotions, analyze personalities of other people to protect myself and most importantly feel happy about my life. Time really is the best medicine. Something you consider as impossible today may become one of your achievements in the future. I took my Final exams a week ago and study my as\* off to have full scholarship for the next year. Almost all of them went amazing except Calculus lol If there is anyone reading my story, please do not give up. It's okay to cry and become angry sometimes. It's okay to sit down and think about your future, just hold on and let time carry you through new adventures.",lonely,Positive impacts of being ignored and pushed out by society,2022-02-12 07:03:04

There was one guy in the dream that I didn’t recognize. All I know was that I liked him a lot, and he stayed behind when I told him to tag along back to my house. I frantically texted and called him, but there was nothing, no response. I felt like I failed him, for some reason, all because he wanted to stay put. Usually when everyone is hanging out and someone departs, we all gather and look for them and convince them to tag along. But in the dream, it was just me looking. No one did anything to help me look, or anything for that matter. The reason this dream still haunts me to this day is because I was around all my friends, and I tried gathering the last piece of the puzzle, but it kept falling apart. When I woke up I cried for an hour in an empty house. I want to cry right now thinking about it, because I love my friends dearly. And if someone I know is hurting, or uncomfortable, or feeling lonely, I will do anything I can to help. I’m alone, though. I don’t have friends anymore. The group split because everyone got busy. I find myself crying for someone’s presence, someone’s touch, someone’s beautiful, wholesome laughter. I try to socialize, but everyone I’ve met just does small talk, and they are nothing like me. Hell, they’re not even fun; they’re the most boring people I’ve talked to, and it makes me miss my old friends. And I do, I miss them so fucking much to the point of physical hurt (I don’t harm myself, the pain just hurts so much that I can feel it resonate in my chest). It just keeps getting worse, too. Nothing is getting better, and I wasn’t going to talk about this because there’s nothing you can do, but I needed to pour it out. It doesn’t help that I’m trying to quit vaping, either, and I got a book on the way.

College wasn't bad for me. I was an excellent student and I was pretty much the kid who always handed their homework on time. I finish first and I lead all my group projects well. People say I'm fun and charismatic but no one knows me. I finished college but the moment it ended, I just knew that all the friends and acquaintances I met won't really talk to me anymore. It was all just empty words and now that there are no urgent assignments or projects for us, they just drifted away. No one bothers to check up on me because they assume I'm doing fine. After all, I was the over achiever. They all think I have an active social life. COVID took that away from me. Not that I had that in the first place. Strict parents + no car + unable to go to parties + online school = lonely teen. 

Little did they know that this burnt out, lonely kid just wanted some friends too. I wish I had people who would notice when I'm sad, or just people who would text me things they think I might like. I wish I had friends who wanted to call or even remember my birthday. I want friends who would watch movies or TV shows with me or even just friends who would ask me how I am. 

Because I am that friend to everyone. I remember their birthdays, I text them funny shit and they all think I'm okay all the time but I know that I'm not. I wish I could be vulnerable but I just can't. 

The worst feeling is during those long afternoons when it's raining outside and I feel like I'm dead on the inside. Like I don't need to kill myself anymore. I'm already a husk. Sometimes, it scares me that I don't have anyone at all to call or text if I'm in a super dark place with my thoughts because everyone will freak out. ""Wait, no way! You always looked so happy! We were just talking yesterday! You seemed fine yesterday!"" I just know they won't be able to handle it or they will say I'm being overdramatic. 

I stood under the rain today and felt a little happy for a while but being alone still hurts. It doesn't hurt as much anymore. Just like a numb toothache that doesn't go away and sometimes, I'll wake up at night and check my phone but there are no messages. Then there's this dry feeling behind my eyes like crying but without tears.

Recently got back on Instagram, and followed like 50 people, classmates, family, etc. and ngl been feeling pretty shitty everytime I look at their posts and stories and how much fun they seem to be having with their friends all the time. 

I'm feeling a lot of fomo rn. Though I was OK before, instagram made me feel like maybe I shouldn't be. But not in a positive way that'll give me the motivation to put myself out there and seek people out but in a ""you're pathetic and a loser for having come this far without being able to hold down even a single quality relationship in life. Shame on you."" 

Social media has a weird way of making you feel this intense obligation to post and let people know what's up with your life.

And even if there was, it's not like that'll make me any friends.

I ain't a very good looking person mind you and the way I was raised I never had good self esteem since I was 6 years old, I mean maybe I am a bit weird I don't and never liked social events and deep down I know what my family thinks of me they probably think I don't know but I know. personally deep down...

I was hoping to write this just so it can fall on some eyes of people who don’t know me and can give me some advice. I’m in college at a state in school practically in the middle of nowhere. I have never felt this lonely and depressed before in my life. I have cried more than I ever have and I have gotten to a point where I feel exhausted with my life. There are other personal things happening in my life to contribute to this but with me being at school most of the time, being reminded that I have no friends is what hurts me the most. I have a roommate who I consider a friend but they hate our school more than I do and they are fairly negative about everything. Being around that constantly has also made me very sad and wonder if they (freshman) feels that way early on there’s no hope for me it that makes sense. I have tried tinder, bumble to find friends no luck. I joined 2 clubs last semester but both came up short with one not holding meetings anymore and the other people stopped going. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I like this school, it’s not bad I just don’t have any friends here and am tired of having repetitive days everyday with nothing to look forward to. At my school, most juniors leave the dorms and move into apartments but I can’t really financially So I’ll have to be one of the few juniors living on campus which I feel embarrassed about.

I'm down to one friend now, just got out of a very toxic, manipulative friendship. and this one friend is basically my brother, I'm at his house at least 5 days a week doing whatnot. but they never ask to hang out, go places, they never start conversation, anything of the sort. when we do hang out though we have a good time, but 25% of the time I just feel like he doesn't like me/I'm being around him too much.

and I know I sound very self-centered but my entire life I've been catering toward all my friends, going to their games, cheering them on at their cheerleading thing, going to school after hours to do school relate stuff (which I never do), being there for then when they are going through a rough time, etc.

I  just feel  really lonely and useless today and yes it’s partially because of the holiday that shan’t be named

(There’s your Harry Potter reference you potter heads)



It doesn’t help that I work in produce which is literally 10 feet away from floral so all day I hear about people getting flowers for he her and them and getting all the candies And everyone’s buying fresh fruit and veg to make an impressive dinner for there significant other and like I’m like what do they got that I don’t and for the record I don’t believe in the “woman only like jocks that treat them like Shit stuff” that mentality is fucking stupid it’s like a gateway to red pulled black pilled incel mentality rabbit holes.


But the worst is the balloons and I’ll tell you why


In 2020 my ex  confessed she had feelings for me but it was pretty much long distance cause we had went to different schools. We also kinda kept it secret.

But Valentine’s Day 2021 we decided to meet up at her house for the first time since middle school.


I had a big box of her favorite chocolates and a card with money in it.


She gave me this balloon 

That day was probably the best day ever in my 18 year old life.

We had lunch and dinner and she cuddled me and for once in my critical thinking life I felt normal I felt like I was close with someone that wasn’t in my family.  I felt companionship and wanted
That day honestly made up for all the parties and homecomings and dances and proms I didn’t go to. Or at least it felt like it.

But the balloon I kept for as long as I could and what’s ironically tragic and funny was that was that the balloon stayed afloat for as long as the relationship was on. And for a year it floated even if low to the ground

The day before what would have been our first anniversary she told me and was honest she wasn’t as invested in the relationship as I was and she broke up with me.

That same day the fucking balloon fully deflated.

And I’m over her like 99.9 percent but I dunno the day still hurts reminds me of how for most of my middle and highschool years I spent chasing people and putting girls on pedestals that I wasn’t good enough for or didn’t want me. 

I often wonder if highschool the people I knew and my ex were my one shot at feeling companionship and wanted and I blew it.

No one in my house understands just how much loneliness hurts. It aches. It brings me down so much. It makes me cry. It hurts so bad. And watching one of my family members go off to a 4 year university, meet friends who like the same music genre as her, and have someone ask to be roommates with her for the next semester so they can bond over their similar interests while I just sit here with no change in my life pains me. No one approaches me. No one seems to have the same interests as me. And the people who do online, are all younger than me and the ones around my age already have their online friend groups or just don’t want to talk to me.

I always see people around my age with their groups of friends hanging out almost everyday. Social media has made things worst for me but if I leave, I will have 0 social interaction. Social media is all I have and people just ignore me. I have a fanpage and post instagram stories there, like people are so intrigued by me, how I’m doing, or even my jokes. 

I feel so ignored all the time. I feel like I’m not interesting and no one would want to be my friend. It hurts me so much I wish I didn’t have to deal with this loneliness everyday of my life. I am never happy. The depression is still here. Nothing is changing. I’m so tired.

What if it really wasn’t meant to be for me to have friends? How am I supposed to live the rest of my life like this? My family won’t always be around forever. Eventually I’m going to be without them too. 

Why can’t I have just one friend? I’m going to be 23 this year and I’ll be loneliness at that age too.

I have only ever told one other person about this story, which, after almost two decades I finally sat down to write. Partly to cope, partly to remember. I told someone I have never met, save for over the internet, which is curious to me, but I find her comforting even if its superficial.

I lost the love of my life before she knew who she was. Before I knew who she was. Before either of us were old enough to recognize or act upon the feelings that we had. We were best friends then.

We met in the street, driven there by similar situations. We were both 15 in 2001.

Neither of us had a comfortable home. Her father was an awful, perverted drunk - her mother in the fog of severe opiate addiction and depression. My Father was a man of few words, but he spoke fluently through his fists. My mother was a weakling.

We were both often hungry and bored. She didn’t even have a bed - she slept on the couch.

We would leave our personal hells every night. Walking, talking, dreaming together through the streets of our sleepy beach town. She wanted to be a classically trained dancer; a ballerina, I guess. She had the figure for it. Supple and nimble with striking grace that far exceeded that of a normal teenager.

We would sit on the sand close to the empty boardwalk and dimly illuminated carnival rides. The only lights that were on at those hours were a few security flood lamps shining lazily onto the sand; they created her stage.

She would dance for me - her audience of one - to show me what she had managed to learn by reading her ballet books from the library. I had no idea, still don't, if her dances were correct or in proper form. To me she was dazzling. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I was hypnotized through her twirls and bends and jumps.

She would ask me for opinions on her performances: critiques, tips, etc. I never had any, which would frustrate her.

After her performances she would join me sitting on the sand. Sometimes next to me, sometimes resting her head on my shoulder and sometimes sitting between my legs using my chest as a back rest.

During these occasions, as her head rested to the side of mine, touching one of my cheeks, I would be absolutely overcome with the smell and softness of her beautiful black hair. This was my favorite - I never told her. We were just friends. I still try to remember the smell and softness. Sometimes if I am still enough; if I can quiet my thoughts enough; I can.

The day came where I had the chance to attend college on scholarship. She was so proud, beaming even; after all, I had the chance to leave. When I told her the news, she was 100 times more excited than I was. Mostly because, at that point, I had decided I wasn't going. I wasn't going to leave my friend.

As quickly as I had \*thought\* I decided, she decided again for me.

She wanted me to go, was pleading with me, even begging me. The distance was far, but she reasoned she would visit, and I would visit, etc. She was certain I would become a big-time jazz musician; maybe even lead a band in the big city! She wanted to dance as a part of my shows. I still hold onto the image that created in my head.

I visited 6 months into my first year. I was overwhelmed with the classes and wished I could've visited sooner, but it just wasn't possible. My friend Bryan had picked me up from the train station and dropped me off in front of her new apartment. Boy, was it shitty, and we both laughed about it during our reunion: laughed like old times on the beach...but it was all hers and no one else’s so I was happy for her.

She had gotten a job as a bartender at a local gentleman's establishment and SEEMED to be doing OK. At least at this point.

I returned to school for another 6 months, but while I was there, learned from a mutual friend, that my friend, my friend with the beautiful black hair, was in trouble. I got home as soon as I could, about two or three months later.

This meeting would be our last.

She wasn't who I had known. A vicious downward spiral into rotten men and cheap booze was changing her. Though, I would see glimpses, flashes, snapshots of the girl I grew up with, but they were gone almost as quickly as they appeared.

I was gutted.

I should have been there.

I should have helped.

I kept her safe.

If I had stayed, she'd be safe!

I got the call from my mother on February 10, 2006.

She died alone, on the beach, from a lethal overdose of heroin.

She died on our beach. Our beach where she danced for me in the dim security light on her stage of sand.

She was a beautiful girl with the softest, black hair.

Her name was Isabella, I miss her terribly.

A decent friend of mine seemingly invited everyone I know to a massive party of her's, where it looks like I was the only one not invited. I've never been the most social type, which doesn't help much, but we got along quite well and I'm not a complete introvert. As a result, never really been invited to a party, which isn't something I'm particularly remorseful about, but the fact that I wasn't even considered in the first place just makes me really sad. After repeatedly excluding me from friend meetups, ignoring my messages and straight up leaving me by myself on a day out we were meant to have, instead going to another friend's on a last minute notice, I want to completely ghost her and never speak to her again, but we go to the same college, she still talks to me as if everything's fine and is indifferent about it which somehow makes it worse.

 I can't wait to ditch the many people like her in my social groups and leave their messages unread when they want to catch up on my life in the future after they forget about me for a while, and cut toxic people like that out altogether. However, for now I just have to deal with it.

The college I go to is incredibly tightly knit and all of the people there aren't really who I'd prefer to be friends with, but there are some alright people who I talk to fairly frequently.

The way to stop it is to let it run without resistance, once the intense mental turmoil is over, there is peace on the other side. It's hard to not engage with the mind unless we create some distance from it, and to do that we should practice meditation. 

Here is a simple guided meditation if you need it, you can't go wrong with this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHnl\_XugJyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHnl_XugJyE)

Just note that to make peace a permanent happening in life, one should practice daily. But doing it once should convince you of the benefits. The mind is very agile and long term momentum can be broken in just 5 minutes of proper practice. If the pain is physical, its a different story, and it might take a longer time and other things, like yoga or breathwork.

Obviously there's gonna be some people that will say this is nonsense, but to those people I would say, have you tried it?

3163,Available_Clue_5639,1644514081,1,"I have been feeling lonely for quite some time now. Not quite sure when my loneliness really began and that's not really important.

But what's most important is that I'm feeling more and more lonely the older i get which can honestly suck

Of course my ideal life is to have many friends and to have the ""perfect lifestyle"" and also have a healthy social life but to be honest, i don't really know what a social life is because i don't believe I've ever had one. 

I don't go out or have friends. I don't meet people in real life or go on dates or any of those things that we've been conditioned to believe that we should do all those things to become ""more human"" 

I get horny multiple times during the day. I blow my load like a few times in a day. I do it to forget my loneliness for a while because i get a lot happier after ejaculating. It's self-love in every sense of the word...

All i can ever think about is my future boyfriend and how we would be with each other once we're under the sheets. I get a lot of those naughty scenes in my head. It happens a lot of the time. I can't help it. All it takes is some lube and my imagination to get me going.

I know that being lonely isn't ideal but sometimes it can be once you think about how much effort you have to put in into a relationship. All the amounts of blood, sweat and tears and just a lot of time to get things right. And once you get into a relationship you have to at least be good at commitment or otherwise the relationship won't exactly work out but then i remembered that I've never been that great at committing to anything before.

I used to do all those courses and study and all that. But I've never really been able to finish anything properly in my life. Not really sure why. Maybe I'm just lazy. Maybe I'm not the type of person to be motivated or whatever. Not everyone can be that way. It's cool if others are though. Good for them!

I could blame the way I've been feeling on anxiety but then again that won't really do me any good. All it will do is cause more issues for myself in the long run

It's also sad having to always only have yourself and yourself only to rely on. I do have a family but to be fully honest, they've never really supported me that much in terms of actual emotional support. They've never really been available for me at all. And throughout my life it just felt like I've been truly abandoned. Not to sound too dramatic but this is exactly how i have been feeling for so long.

Even when i was a lot younger. I never felt like my family were really there for me. And it just feels like we're constantly having arguments with each other all the time which is why I've recently decided to not speak to me. This has been going on back and forth so many times. I'll not talk one day and then the week after i will talking to them all over again like it was nothing but i don't think it will be that way this time around. 

This time around I'll take a bit longer. I've decided to only communicate with people who are helpful and who will actually talk to me with decency and not with arguments and non-stop fights because i deserve much better than that and i know it.

I can't keep on going to war with my family all the time. Because this is getting a bit exhausting nowadays. It's too much. 

Obviously in an ideal world, things wouldn't have been going this way but since we're living in the ""real world"" of course things has to be more shit. 

Over the years I've noticed how my mother would just not reply to me at all when i would talk. I've always found that to me extremely fucking weird. Just the fact that i would actually try to have a ""conversation"" with her and she would completely act like i wasn't in the room. And whenever i confront her about it ask her about it. She's always like ""I'm listening to you"" her way of listening is just so fucking weird and it just feels like I'm wasting my time on my own fucking family. 

It's been like this for way too long. And i know that things won't really change and i have to just give up. I should just stop trying so hard. Things will always be the way they are and i just have to accept that finally. 

I haven't been talking to them in a while now and i have honestly felt so much better. Way better than when i actually do talk. I feel like it'll be a whole lot better if i didn't have to actually talk to anyone ever again. Being all by myself and silent sounds like a great fucking plan to be honest. Talking can be terrifying. The idea that you can mess up at any point while you're interacting with someone is so FREAKY to me. I can't stand talking to people. But then again it all depends on the right person too. The right people are always amazing to talk to.

I also have to accept that my parents are from a different culture and they think differently from me. I have a different way of talking and thinking. My thought process aren't the same as them and it will NEVER be the same as them. Sometimes i do wonder if i was adopted because of how different from everyone i am. I've never fit in my whole life. Not even in my own family which might sound weird but that's how it feels   like.

My parents talk in their own language and i don't really enjoy that at all. I just don't see the whole point of them coming to a brand new country and them still acting like they're fucking living in their old country. 

I've made my decision once i came here. But i remember it took me a long ass time to commit though. But i still did it which is super nice but whatever though

I'm referring to the time when i came back from school one day and basically decide right then that i would speak english only. And i haven't gone back since. I have spoken english ever since that very day. It's great to see me actually committing to something there 👀 

I get where the connection thing between us and them went wrong. But at the same time i don't live just to fucking please everyone. FUCK THAT. I please myself first and foremost and I'm not really here to fucking play any games with anyone 💅 

It was the right decision at the time. Even when i was still in my country at the time, i was never a big fan of how people talked there. I was just always so damn irritated by that. I just never saw that as me being ""lucky"" just because i was born in a place where they have lots of beaches or whatever. That doesn't really mean shit and people shouldn't let those beautiful views fool you.

Just because it's a masterpiece doesn't mean that it's flawless. 

Same for that old country. It has lots of beautiful beaches but still doesn't make it a beautiful country just because there are a few good beaches in that country. It doesn't really work that way.

And also let's talk about how i do feel ashamed of being from there and I'll give you some reasons as to why i do feel that way exactly. Because it seems to me that some people don't quite get it.

Because i get that people always say shit like ""you should be proud of where you're from"" and of course i wish that it could be that easy but it's really not. It's a whole lot of work. So much, actually. 

I'd be proud of my roots if it was a decent country to begin with. I definitely would have been a great representative of the country if that country was the greatest. But the thing is I've never really felt that way. I've never really had that pride in me. I wish i had though. I remember i was trying way too hard to embrace more of my culture and it just didn't work at all. Computer didn't compute. 

It's not my fault though because i have nothing to do with the fact that the country itself is a fucking massive dogshit hell-hole of motherfucking place😀🔪

I want to be nice and lie to people and say that this is one of THE most beautiful country ever but that wouldn't really work, would it?

Because what if one day they decide to go on vacation there and then they get hugely disappointed by everything there like we did when we went back there.

My own dad was super disappointed by it. Probably more than i was, actually. Just some of the road on the street looked like a mess and apparently it was meant to be ""under construction"" and yet it's been looking that way for so dsmn long and basically no one's thought about actually being productive and re-construct those roads but yeah this is how things are there.

People you meet can be super rude and mean towards you. You just have to really be careful about literally everything. It's not really all that fun and crazy there. It can be such a pain in the ass to just see it all in real time. 

And also the fact one day we went on the beach just to walk but then there was this pavement place and it was kinda close to the beach so anyway we basically saw a used baby diaper. It was one of THE most grossest thing I've ever had the pleasure to see. It was just so fucking vile, man. It was A LOT of crap. Literally and probably non literally.

It's hard to keep seeing this country as a good country after seeing that used baby diaper basically on the fucking beach. It was just super weird. I don't really know how things are that bad there but somehow they are. 

I have no clue if i enjoyed my time there at all or if i was literally forced to go back there. But I've promised myself that it will be a nice trip and we can talk as well",lonely,Not sure why i feel this way....,2022-02-11 04:28:01

I got notebook with $3 tag still on it… I thought the world of you guys…and you didn’t even think about me at all… I showed you time after time how much I loved you guys, and have never been shown love back.

But, once my usefulness has expired, I just sit there, watching everyone else carry on without me. I tentatively wait to see if anyone wants to spend time with me or talk to me, but it doesn’t happen, not really.

I’ve become a worse person because I envy my friends talking to each other and everyone else except me. Doing things, without me. Making no effort to acknowledge I exist until they need something again. 

I know they don’t owe me anything… it’s just… I thought after all the time I spent trying to be a good friend and be helpful, they might’ve remembered me when organising something they were doing, or maybe they might remember we haven’t spoken in a while and pop in to say hi.

I don’t want to just be a tool to be used. And yet every time they ask I will comply because the alternative is that I never hear from them again anyway.

It reminds me of the saying, ‘Don’t light yourself on fire to keep others warm’. I feel like I’ve emotionally set myself on fire investing myself into people I wanted to be friends with (and I hate myself for saying I still do want to be friends with). I’m sat there, on fire, waiting to see if anyone will notice and offer some water to douse the flames. But no one even notices.

- I feel stupid for hoping they might change
- My envy has turned into resentment
- I wish I could tell them how much I hate how little they don’t even try to talk to me it feels like they’re avoiding me

My heart goes out to you men!

You know somehow people always care about women. Even if she isn’t the most attractive lady, it’s much easier for her to find a partner than a not so attractive male. I find it unfair but that how it is really. 

Most women are also just so much more easier to talk to. They’re open to their emotions and feelings and crying is a norm. My brother was telling me the other day, most men he knows usually don’t ask for help and bottle up their emotions to not seem weak. I just find that sad.

3181,cozIfailed,1644499904,1,"
These days I can’t help but think of a good place to die. I grew up developing a pretty good amount of pride so I think of suicide as a really shameful activity where u let others see how much of a failure u are. It’s shameful but I had to bear with it if I want myself gone in this world. 

The thing is, I just don’t want to die at home, where my family will mourn for me, question the reason behind my decision, and possibly think they are the reason behind it. I especially don’t want my mom to be like that. She did everything possible to give me a better future despite raising three children on her own with a meager salary and making sure all of them could go to college. My mom is the kindest and I don’t want her to think she failed in anyway.  

Another reason I don’t want to die at home or in any nearby place is to spare my family of shame especially my grandmother because I know it would be really shameful for her to face her neighbors if her granddaughter killed herself  which they thought to be “intelligent and has a bright future ahead”. My grandma used to brag to our neighbors every achievement I had in school like being a consistent achiever and etc. I know she will be like that because she care so much about what our neighbors will think of her.

Lastly, I don’t want to die to this place where I grew up, to this place where a lot of people know me, talked to me, hang out with me or just simply shared a conversation with me because I used to mock those who killed themselves, for wasting their lives over a simple problem. Yet, here I am now, on the way to give up my life. I just didn’t ate my words, I swalled it whole and took seconds. 

For these reasons, I just wanted to die in the middle of nowhere, or in a place where no one knows me, in another country. I prefer dying in a less painful and quick way but who am I to choose? As long as no one I know can discover my death I’d gladly accept it immediately. If someone could help me go there NOW  I’d take it right away even if it involves taking my organs for the black market.

I know this is silly because upon death I will no longer have to worry about shame and other people but I can’t help it. Without it, I know its going to be easier for me to let go. 

I’m not that religious even though I was born catholic but I don’t believe with heaven and hell 100%. I want to do a lot of things, go to a lot of place but also a lot that keeps me from achieving it. I want to cling to a chance that if ever there is no such thing as heaven and hell and we get to be reincarnated right away after dying, I might be able to live a new life but if there is in deed heaven and hell, I’ll just accept my terrible fate in hell (because I know I’m guaranteed a spot in there)

I've noticed partners have never been able to be there for me, I assume because they were too busy struggling with themselves. I've never had a confidant for my emotions. I don't require them to be a therapist, but something more than ""That sucks I'm sorry to hear that"" is something I've always provided but never got back.

I don't know if I'm ever going to find a partner capable of genuine emotional labor. I've put too much in with too little return. Not entirely their fault (I don't think they do it maliciously) but knowing that never made it any easier. I still felt alone while in their company because I couldn't confide in them. It would be talking to a brick wall.

When single at least it's a constant level of this feeling. It doesn't get better nor worse, but constant is predictable and more manageable than the throws of a one-sided relationship, of the rejection that a non-listening ear does to someone. 

It feels strange. I'm deeply saddened by it, but I think I'd take this over how low it feels to have your partner not understand your concerns or feelings. Or respect them. That's more isolating than anything. I simply want to feel understood and acknowledged. More than I want a hug or to be held by a lover. I want that emotional release of feeling safe with my emotions in their hands. That's the type of love I've wanted but somehow escapes me each time.

I still live with my parents, ended up quitting a job that while it paid well I hated so I could help my family (grandparents need almost constant care) and have no friends to speak of besides my mother who I have become more of a confidant to than anything. Listening to her vent and feeling like the only time that I can actually *feel* anything of substance, is when I'm nearly stumbling drunk.  
I became addicted to masturbating a long while ago and have been trying to kick the habit, for myself and own mind if nothing else, only to keep falling back into it. The very temporary feeling of happiness quickly turning to dread and disgust moments after. This partially stemming from having never succeeded in *anything* with a woman. Strike that, I've been on *one* date right after high school. With who at the time was my best friend, and she had been pressured into it by her Mom.  
My successes feel like little more than events that happen rather than something worth remembering and at least personally celebrating. As stupid as it sounds I'm fairly personable, make stupid jokes and sometimes have people laughing and can make 'friends'. Those 'friends' though are fleeting at best when even my rather interesting hobby of HEMA (sword fighting) or even simply trying to be a good friend doesn't do anything to retain them.  
For a lack of a better term, I feel like that guy at the bar everyone knows, that people don't mind talking to, but never gets invited to hang out. That never gets remembered past an interesting story or acting silly. Who's red hair and beard are a more defining characteristic than his personality. ""You're such a nice guy!"" ""You're so real man!"" Could you do me a favor and tell me who I am then?

She dumped me on the spot and told me to &gt;!kill myself!&lt;. She said she never wanted to speak me again, so I respected her wishes. I always knew she was bisexual w/ a preference for women, I just made the mistake of thinking she actually cared about me, when in reality I was just a sack of meat meant to keep her parents out of the loop.

I spent the next year moving on, and thought I might have found someone else, just as I was about to ask him out he told me he had just started a relationship with someone else - then there was the pandemic. By the time we saw each other in person again he was single and graduating / finding employment, so he very kindly turned me down (after thinking I was joking about it more than a few times). Now he proudly teases me about asking him out whenever we're together or with our friends.

Last Fall I met this girl who I thought I connected with. We met through mutual friend, and she was always happy to see me whenever we would hang out in a group; and we were having *decent* (if rare) one on one conversations. I really wanted to ask her out and even talked it over with two of our mutual friends - one said he didn't think it would hurt to ask and the other said they didn't think she was in the right headspace for it based on private conversations they had had with her. Low and behold I get back from spending the holidays with my shitty family and she seems to be unofficial with this other guy. Now she doesn't even look at me when we're talking.

I feel like I'm just an annoying waste of everyones' time. I have friends who are making plans for marriage &amp; friends who have had kids. Meanwhile, I'm just the pathetic virgin who's technically been single for 4 years, but who's arguably never even been in a real relationship since the only one I was in was built on a lie. I put myself out there with one guy and now I am perpetually teased by him for doing so; and when I was about to try again I sought the advise of others and blundered into loosing my chance all together. 

My timing sucks. I just want to find someone to love and who is ok with at least tolerating my existence. Even when I meet someone I click with they become disinterested faster than I can build up the confidence to ask them out. What's the point?",lonely,(22M) My Timing Sucks,2022-02-10 14:56:18

To that friend that says “stay single” and sees it as freedom.

You do not see the chains it wraps me in.

To be lonely with nobody to love you is a constant suffering with no comfort possible.

It is a constant pain of only being half a person. An Incomplete soul.

It’s searching in darkness for a part of your broken heart that isn’t there. 

It’s crying yourself to sleep every night, and awake every morning.

It’s a constant mocking torment of never being able to share your deepest thoughts and heart with anyone.

It’s a starvation of love that cannot show mercy and kill you.

It’s a miserable anguish of existence in a cruel world with nobody to give you escape.

It’s deep wounds punctured into your chest by spikes of self hatred, with no way to heal. 

It’s a desire for death that never comes, and never ends.

It’s the unceasing and taunting torture of despair you feel when you see others kissing, hugging, cuddling, and nestling.

It’s a life without love, without happiness, without affection, and without hope.

It’s distant life in which you are wandering alone in a grey mist, with nobody able to see you are lost.

It’s a cold life without warmth.

It’s a desire to have a genuine and loving hug or embrace, but only ever receiving fake or loveless ones.

Ahh suicide...a grand idea...damn you life and all your hard subtleties and nuances...damn woman Im seeing getting the better of me.

Couple bottles of pills later I awake in the Lakewood hospital to my then gf grabbing my junk and shoving it in the specimen container. Scott they need a sample. Dafuq has happened? Is this real life? Damn moms crying. Damn...I woke up. Couple weeks later I find heroin for the first time with the same then gf. She hits me and I'm fucking hooked. Like I was on the idea of...of...who cares bruh. Black is the business. Few months later straight broke dick homeless and strung the fuck out. Still then gf who has started hooking and the like to support hers and mines habit can't take it anymore and leaves back to Chicago. Waving goodbye at the airport was like watching my very soul say I'm sorry kiddo...best of luck eh? Try to maintain a relationship of some sort with her. Hopelessly addicted to heroin. Truly homeless. Family is done. Won't answer phone calls. Get out you useless junkie. Fucking tweaker...I give up. I give in. In those first few months I am so lost. One fine evening I remember sobbing for no reason for like 2 hours uncontrollably. Not sure why. Find out later on that I had a daughter. Who was kidnapped and murdered that night. A year and a half old...never got to meet her. Fucking heart broke that night. I died inside. Still dealing with it. I've spent almost 5 years on the streets up until today. I just got my section8 voucher so I can move into my very own apartment here in Santa ana. My family has all pretty much moved on with their lives while here I am trying to get mine going. Just mom left really. So thankful for her. I hate myself when we hang out cause I get loaded occasionally still and she knows it. Still loves me though. I'm diagnosed schizophrenic, depressed, insomniac. Having a hell of a time finding good mental health services. I just had a year clean and sober but hated it. So yeah drugs are prevelent. Not my whole world anymore though. Companionship and love and trust are what I'm after. Life is too hard on my own and the idea of being alone with just my own thoughts terrifies me. I've applied for disability which should be coming soon and for now I have medical gr. 355$ a month. Plus 250$ In food stamps. Not great but it's a start. I need someone who has appreciates how horrible life is with the absence of love and hope and trust. Someone who laughs at pain and sorrow and doesn't mind not living a glamorous lifestyle. I love food, music, music...saves me most days from my solitude. Cooking, animals notice the comma haha. Movies and cartoons. Building models and even reading books again. Totally willing to go back to work but just trying to see how this disability thing works out. So while I may not have everything together I am totally right in my spiritual and mental points of view to try having a relationship again. I'm a cuddler. Very affectionate. Romantic to the bone. I hate thievery and I rarely ever lie anymore. I just can't. I'll snitch myself off everytime I do. I'm white skinned. About 6 feet tall. Brown hair and eyes like the last leaves of autumn. I'm very into the magic of life. The idea of having a child scares me but, I find the idea enticing and would love to have a baby with someone. Even if I don't seem like a match as far as romantically don't be afraid to reach out just as friends. I could always use more friends. I have barely any as it is. I find that we are what we keep and I don't want trash friends or family. Reddit helps me to find so many things out. I love Reddit. Way too many nsfw subs and I've spent far too much time masturbating here lol. Oh yeah I don't really have a preference at all.

And I see people when I'm out with family at the mall, movies, shopping, etc.

But at the end of the day, I'm so lonely. I know I have family, and I do appreciate having them around. But I have no one else. No girlfriend, no friends, no one but family to have fun with. I don't know if I'm making any sense. Like I have interactions with other humans and they're positive and friendly, but they don't care about me - at least not at the level a girlfriend would care. I joke around with my coworkers, but that relationship ends at 5 and I go home to being lonely with family around me.

I want a girlfriend not even for the sex, but for the deeper human connection. For someone to truly care about and someone who truly cares about me. Someone to live my life with and face challenges together. Interactions with coworkers and professors feel so superficial, ya know? Like we're all polite and like each other's company, and we even play games together at work, but then I go home to being alone and no one who I can tell everything to. I want someone to unconditionally support and love and who will do the same for me.

3256,Willing_Swordfish_76,1644454874,1,"Am I the only one that ever just feels as though no one really cares about me? Cares being the word. I will go out if my way to talk to people, to send a text once a day, to try and start a conversation. All to be left on read, or have it be Days before a response is give. 

Today, I just wanted someone to talk to me. To initiate a conversation. It never happened. I messaged multiple people and only one responded back to me. I consider them a good friend. However, out of the 6 others no one responded to me. A couple people saw it but didn't care to even send an emoji or a haha, anything. 

On top of it the only person that I ever recieve a hug from is my wife and child. Though it's not often, cause family. I'm not even sure what emotion I would have if someone just gave me a genuine hug. 

I've also realized in the last few weeks that I'm not even good at anything, I have no special hobby. Mainly because I'm never asked about things I do or want to do. I thought about going into Astrophotography thinking ""maybe when I produce an amazing Pic"" someone will want to talk to me or hangout with me and watch the process. 

Just last week I went and saw a movie with my two guy friends. But I had to initiate the offer, and coordinate, and put in the effort to ensure we could go. 

I dunno. Life just sucks sometimes. I so badly long for a best friend that can be there for absolutely anything, surprise me with a message, give me a bro high five or hug when they see me. Just as I do with some people. However, the act is never reciprocated.

I work all day, from home for the last decade. I can't just go out and make new friends. It's not that easy. On top of it I am introverted but I try regardless just to make friends. 

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to, not be popular, but desired enough to be asked to do things, be apart of events, etc. I have my own hobbies but no one is interested. I like cars, computers, programming, swimming, hiking, fishing, and the list goes on.

There's a girl that is a somewhat close friend that I thought would be the first person that is actually interested in me. Today I asked her out for lunch, it's been 7 hours now and she hasn't responded, but she has texted on a group chat I'm on aswell an hour ago. I had a close friend that I was giving support after her finding out she got pregnant (she's 17), for a week I had to calm her down every night, she would talk about how scared she is of the pregnancy test, how she was feeling suicidal because people don't like her and no one was there for her (except me because rn it's become apparent I don't matter) or talk about how she was feeling hurt that my best friend didn't like her the same way she liked him. I tried helping with the one thing I could help, I told him she liked him and he said that she was just a friend, far from being something more. She got mad at me and left our chat group, supposedly because it was too close of a connection to him. That was the day before my first and only girlfriend broke up with me, it was christmas eve. She was the best thing that happened to me but since we're so far appart there was nowhere to take our relationship, which is okay I guess, it makes sense, 2 weeks after she gets a girlfriend and I was completely destroyed, we both were sad about leaving each other but why does she gets to have someone now, why was I the one that had to keep being alone, I'm okayer with it now but still, the one person that made me feel even a little more than most people now cares about someone else. My other friend hasn't spoken a word to me, after a week or two I thought it would still be because of how I'd be a connection to my best friend, but you know what's even a bigger connection to him that she didn't cut? My friend, she still texts him, trying to talk and get closer to him, he still has no interest so he just replys somewhat coldly, but won't call her out on being a jerk to me after so much of my time I spent on her, and now she ignores me and still has the audacity to post shit about how no one wants to talk to her, dude I'm right fucking here, the one person that thought you were interesting, that thought you were gorgeous, that cared about you, like you claimed your classmates didn't, your family, your friends, but me, nah, ignore me, talk to the person that you absolutely adore (which is understandable he's a pretty cool guy, shoutout to you mate) but refuses to care about you like I did. I finished higschool last year, now I'm working at my family's store, everything feels like this same sycle, I know it could be worse, but that just makes me feel more shitty, I've got it this good and yet things feel shit. I don't see anyone anymore, I don't have classmates to talk to anymore, it pisses me off, that the only way anyone will come and talk to me like they care about me, like they are interested in me, like they love me, is when I pretend to be a fucking woman on the internet, I don't know which is worse, that or the fact people can't even tell. I cannot remember the last time someone came to me or hugged me or anything like that because I am me, because they like the person I am, I'm just so tired at this point, but I hate going to sleep, it feels like the biggest form of acceptance there is, if I go to sleep, the day ends, I'm choosing to end the day, the day has been shit, if I go to sleep I'm just accepting that and confirming it, it feels like life laughs at my face each time I do, there's nothing to look forward for tomorrow anymore, everything feels aimless, nothing changes, I don't know what else to do anymore.",lonely,"Life is too much of a nonesensical mess (Sorry if bad english, I Brasil)",2022-02-10 11:51:16

Before that, I was diagnosed with emotional regulation problems, adhd and I showed a lot of symptoms of a personality disorder, but I didnt get officially diagnosed with that since there isn't a clear cause for it.

My best friend of 18 years (she's also my cousin) was perfectly aware of the shit I was going through. I told her everything about what happened in september, to which she and another friend of ours responded with the fact that they were there for me. 

However, around december I noticed that we weren't in contact with each other as much as we used to be, even though we are in the same class. Probably because I don't go to school as much anymore. But then they started hanging out without me. Our other friend got her drivers license so they were constantly going to things without me. Not asking me to go out in the weekends which we used to do all the time. I was at peace with it at first, but now it is starting to eat me up on the inside. 

They started being less understanding and sympathetic to me. Haven't asked how I'm actually doing or if therapy is helping me. And whenever I try to tell them what's up, the subject gets changed. Now I only talk to them if it's about school.

I just feel lonely. I don't think I have healthy friendships anymore. Another friend of mine who I'm really close with has been starting to suck the energy out of me. He's also struggling with depression and suicidal tendencies for a while now, but he says he isn't ready to look for help. I feel responsible for his well-being all the time, but it's so draining to be his friend when you're also struggling mentally.

Now I am in college and I feel worse than ever and its all because I felt what it was like to be happy. I was in a 2 year long relationship with a girl who randomly joined my discord server. I had never seriously tried dating before that but I had always assumed that it wouldn't be worth it because I would just bring my partner down. Before this relationship I always felt like I was depressed due to thoughts I would have and how I always was sad like 3/10 and could only really reach 5/10 happiness. There was one time in my life where I truly felt like 1/10 permanently no matter what I did. Being with this person immediately made me feel like a 4/10 and even though I was still sad I was actually able to reach 7 or 8s and I realized what it was like to be happy. We broke up a few months ago and I think I forgot what it was like being alone. I am once again stuck in a permanent 3/10 rarely reaching 4 or 5. Even though its more then likely the same and isn't the worst I have ever been knowing what it was like to be happy makes it so much worse. I am constantly torn between hating myself for finding out what its like to be happy to being grateful for it. I am so lost and alone now.

3288,MilkClean6690,1644432976,1,"Idk how this app works or anything im just using it as a bit of an outlet right now.

Im a 24 year old woman currently outside taking a smoke break at work as i type this. Im not really expecting any response or sympathy despite this pretty much being a sob story. I also apologise for the bad grammar and lack of punctuation im not good with words. I am also gonna try and keep this brief so there will be a lot of wholes in this story. Feel free to ask for more info

I truly feel like i am supposed to be alone in this world and i am having a hard time trying to accept that this may be the rest of my life. Ive always liked the idea of making new friends and being around new people but it just seems so hard. I didnt come from a good home and would always look for others for some kind of connection 

Growing up as a young girl with my dad was hard. He was abusive and manipulative and never let me leave the house. This stunted my emotional and mental growth especially because I would even go days without talking to anyone at all. It was lonely. 

I always looked forward to moving out and going to university and when i finally did i was exited to make new friends. I thought that I would be surrounded by people i love and care about and who would feel the same about me but i was wrong. The people i met here were very cliquey and werent as open as I thought and those i did click with were very toxic. Im not gonna sit here and make ppl feel sorry for me thinking i didnt take part too but i was doing so because i didn’t want to be out of their circle until i had to accept that if they were bitching about their own close friends then they were about me too. So I dropped them and the loneliness returned. 

I have tried to get therapy trust but i couldn’t afford to do it regularly so during the breaks in between each session all these bad memories I forgot would come back to me and there is only so much you can talk about in a 50 minute session. 

I have a few friends and i know that people say that when you enter your 20s it becomes the loneliest period of your life because everyone is moving on and tryna figure themselves out and everyone has their own lives and problems which i completely understand to be true but it seems like they are hust keeping me around because they feel bad for me. That being friends with me is a chore. Ive seen them make time for people they know less than me (which is fine i guess) I just hate that they lie about missing me and wanting to spend time with me and when i try to ask if they wanna meet up it’ll be weeks before they attempt to reply and when i do almost immediately then the conversation will go dead. Just another month of me waiting. 

I know you’re probably reading this and wondering why i dont try. I do. Trust me i do try and i put myself out there but I had learned the embarrassing way that if people say “hey lets hang out sometime” and give you their number that they don’t really mean it. 

Just last year i had even hand baked some goods for some former friends birthday because I really felt like they deserved it and even planned a surprise picnic for another. I dont do things because i expect things in return i just enjoy being kind, but when it came to my birthday no one remembered. I didnt even get a birthday message until i made a post of my day out to the museum and only a few of them sent a message and only 1 apologised. I was upset but gaslit myself into thinking that i had no right to be and that everyone has something going on with their lives and that no one has to remember nor that anyone asked me to make anything for their birthday and i was just being dramatic. 
When i came into work the next morning i didnt think anything of it and just decided to move on then my manager walked in and screamed happy birthday and gifted me with a box of chocolates. I was surprised and held in my tears. Another one of my coworkers (who im not even that close with) found out it was my birthday and quickly ran to the store to surprise me with a cake and got everyone to sing which also made me emotional but also taught me that if people cared then they would put in the effort. 

Right now at my current job the only person i click with is my 19 year old coworker but i feel so lame that this kid is more responsive to me than my own friends. It also depresses me more knowing that they have more of a social life then i have ever had at any point growing up but i have to keep reminding myself that even if they are messaging me memes outside of work they are just a coworker and is still a kid not a friend of mine which hurts more. I want to be a teen and try again. 

I try to connect with people online hut it seems like the only form of communication that i get is with strangers in comment sections on tik tok and twitter. 

I know you may have suggestions that i go out to activity clubs and whatnot but i have tried. At this point i am getting exhausted while still being hopeful that i will meet the people that i finally click with. 

I am still hopeful that i will find where i belong and have applied to study at an art university in a big city. I keep having doubts that nothing will come from and at that point i dont know what im gonna do next. I’ll just have to wait and see. 

There is so much more that i want to say but like i said i am at work and reddit is lagging on my phone so it is hard to type hence why this is all just a nonsensical ramble. 

I might delete this idk I just needed an outlet.",lonely,Tired,2022-02-10 05:56:16

He didn't even bother to meet me before going . He and I was like a brother from another mother. We used to play together hang out together all day long . We used to have lots of fun i mean it and i really miss those moments. Only for bath and for eating I used to come home or else I always was with him . But for last 2 years for busy life of each other we barely could contract . Last i meet was last month. I also had so many close friends alongside with him . But as i mentioned about 2 years , we got into fight with each other and lost our tracks . Now many are busy with their jobs many moved to another area and many are don't bother to contract. We had lots of moments together like pranking with each other surprising each other playing each other having parties too . But now I realize maybe that wasn't enough cause when i recall my memories with those brothers my tears came out cause for the last 2/3 years we are no same brother i had no friends but some online friends but they are busy now too. Had one sided love now she left from my life . Have pretty messed up family my parents live in separate . I just have no one no body to hangout . Some times i even say I'll give you treat come lets go to restaurant for just company, still they don't come but sometimes maybe they try to come . I feel so lonely that i doubt on my existence . I like to have friends like have hangouts like make memories i m too soft hearted to have these pains . I don't know why I'm writing cause i even have no one to talk about it .

I wanted all the bad thoughts to stop. Everything was too much for me. This world is better off without someone as useless as me anyway, because what do I contribute other than being a waste of space and air anyway?

To not know if their emotions are true. To not know if their thoughts are their own. To not know if what they’re seeing and hearing and experiencing is really happening or not. It’s pathetic.

I remember me and a friend at the time were talking for hours about where to take our women. We were both completely head over heels in love. Fuck. I can't explain how much we loved them. We both wanted them by our side forever. All we'd talk about was....them.

It was February and we wanted to treat them to a nice meal in the centre of the city, in a well-known Chinese buffet which had a great reputation. And, we did. We surprised them. We were going to do a double date but decided to go separately to be more intimate/romantic.

Long story short: after 7 years and being engaged to her, my ex cheated on me. 2 years later, my friends' girlfriend left him for another man she met at her workplace.

What I believe is the wrong ideals taught to people at different point in times ! Why are people not sticking today ? Because they are sometimes ignoring basic requirements of their partners. Some people stop being intimate to their partners and eventually kill the feeling and desires of that man. 

Life can be happening for many who wish to also respect what people around them want. Be a bit selfless and try giving out. Only material charity is not the best, emotional charity also exist but no one has named it. 

Ignoring sex has become so famous now even in more advanced cultures that it becomes primary reason of cheating and less couples in the first place. I think Men are cursed with high libido and they may be repenting for the past sins here on this world , cause in this time people only have to masturbate and reduce their desire and sexual ignoreance is at its peak.

You see, whether it's coworkers, friends or family members, I'm usually curious about them. I like it when people open up and tell me about their hobbies/passions, work, health and general life. I feel appreciated as a listener. It doesn't have to be something I am familiar with, you can talk about dancing and I still want to know more. 

But I wish the feeling would be mutual. At best, I get asked how I am today and what I did for the weekend. Problem is, people don't want an honest answer. They want to hear that I'm fine and that I did the usual. If I tell them that I have been lonely and sad and I wish that somebody cared for me, they'd back off really quick.

I had the opportunity to talk about myself in the past but it was usually just met with an ""uh-huh"" or an ""okay, well anyway..."". I wish somebody would share my interests. I wish somebody would want to get to know me. I wish I would be more approachable. I wish I knew how to be not boring or how to change my personality. It has to be my personality, right?

I've found that a consistent theme is that no matter what I say, do or experience with somebody, whether it be for a few months or multiple years, people will project whatever they want onto me, no matter how terrifyingly inaccurate and degrading it is. I know everyone has this happen to them but for me it's been just about everybody and often to extreme degrees. I'm alone a lot, which is both wonderful and terrible, and every time I think about any significant past connection of any sort with someone or start getting too on edge about being alone for much longer, it always comes down to this core issue. I can't describe how it makes me feel. I've never been an actual person to anybody and nothing I do or don't do seems to change it enough for it to actually help me properly or give me a good enough reason to truly cherish them back. So I'm left with a lot of fragmented and awful memories, confusion, grief and regret. The best medicine is to just do me, but there's no cure. I just don't understand it and I want to scream until my voice is hoarse. I've meant so little to people- the REAL me. The REAL me has meant fuck all to people. I'm determined to focus on my own goals and I can at least say that I have a good scope of my own worth and I can even laugh at them in pity for having no idea what they missed out on. But at the end of the day this is a horrifying thing and I'm seriously scarred from it. No matter how ""close"" I seem with another person or how intense our dynamic is, there's always a core key ingredient missing.

So i’m currently a freshman in college with no friends whatsoever. And no, this is not an exaggeration. When i say i have no friends i really don’t have a single friend. Sure, i have a couple people i talk to in class but it’s not going anywhere, there people you usually talk to in class that sit close to you so it’s not awkward the semester. My day consists of waking up, going to class, coming back to my apartment, studying, and going to sleep. I also live alone which can be hard sometimes. Sometimes it just gets so damn lonely. I literally lose my voice when my parents come over for a weekend because I’m not used to talking anymore. 

I use to have a lot of friends in high school. I was the talkative and outgoing type who just talked to any and everybody. I had friends from different types of school and etc. Since I came to college I’ve just lost my social spirit that makes me who i am. Now i find it hard to talk to people and before talking to people was what gave me energy! I did come to university with my child hood best friend, but he showed his true colors when we got here. He joined a frat and just brushed me off like i was nothing. If i’m being honest it did hurt a lot knowing somebody I had so close just ditched me when he had the chance. But i’m over it now so it’s not a big deal, i’m just venting ig lmao. 

I just find myself depressed all the time now and i don’t know why. I feel so empty now and i feel like i’ll never make friends who are really friends again. I mean i figured it’s gonna be impossible to have friends when i join the work force. Is this just how life is and i have to get used to it?

Or when we go to the movies, after the film I'd really like to talk about it, cinema it's my passion (and his, at least he says it is), but he doesn't reply to my comments.

A lot of times i say something meaningful he replies with something that doesn't have nothing to do with it, like he doesn't care or doesn't listen. Both when i share my feelings or want to discuss about some topics in an deep way.

I honestly thought I was fine, and felt like I had good people to reach out to. I'm crippled with self-doubt now because my friends aren't free to chat or just aren't answering.

After a rough breakup and rebuilding my life a while back, I thought I was over romance. I happened to make an acquaintance with whom romance was **not** the plan and initially wasn't even on my mind. He kind of made me realize I'm still the hopeless romantic I've always been. We've been hanging out quite a bit.

I think maybe my autism caught up with me and I showed a little too much enthusiasm, because I haven't heard from him in a while. I feel like if he'd at least sent a message saying ""Hey, I don't want to hang out anymore,"" it would be fine. But it's just been quiet. We had a few plans on the books but I haven't heard anything from him.

I'm going crazy with different pressures in life and since he went quiet I realized I didn't have anyone to share with. How do people meet people? Why is this so hard? And why the hell am I crying?

My mental health has been way better since my last relationship ended, even accounting for the loneliness. But right now I just want to apologize to everyone for my existence.

3440,Crafty_Rip7662,1644341960,1,"I need to admit something to myself. I find that writing things down helps, so I am. I am posting it on here because I just want to be heard, so here we go.

It's not that I am scared of women. I'm not. I don't have any problems in conversation or anything like that, for me it's just a conversation with another person. Friendship wise, also no problem. I am quite a testosterone filled individual, so it's hard to relate in a platonic way with most women, but some of my best friendships have been with women who are similar to me. It's dating that is the problem.

With the rise of the internet comes the rise of my two main issues. Number one being the ridiclous standards of ***CERTAIN TYPES*** of women, sadly the types I find myself attracted to. The internet has given these women access to almost everyone on earth, and them seeing the very attractive men and supposedly perfect relationships on social media and such has lead them to believe they only deserve perfection in a man. The list typically goes, ""A man needs to; earn 6 figures, be extremley good looking, drive a fancy car, own a house, cook and clean, be emotionally stable, have a great relationship with his mother, devote every waking second of his life to me and worship me like I am royalty"". A 20 year old university student once said this to me. The years of hard work needed to acheive this is astounding, and I am not there in life yet. So I think to myself, okay, not all women are like this, I just need to stick through and it will work itself out. But then theres my second issue.

The absolutley disgusting attitudes of these ***CERTAIN TYPES*** of women, sadly those whom I find myself attracted to. Some of the things I've heard personally; ""All men rape"", ""All men are trash"", ""Men opress women"", ""We don't need men, they are pointless"", ""You don't like me so you just don't repect women"", ""You don't like me so you are gay"", ""Why would I come out with you if you didn't pay for dinner?"", ""I am a prize so prove you are worthy"", and my personal favourite, ""You are not good enough for me because you are a man"". Yes, someone took the time to set up a date with me to tell me that 30 minutes in. I mean fuck, my last girlfriend of only 6 months broke up with me because, ""I feel like I'm not your #1 priority so I will find someone who will make me theirs"". To add to all of that, I see people who have been robbed for everything, cars smashed to bits, PlayStations thrown up the wall, kids lost, and I think, what is the point. Why even bother.

Yes, I know not all women are like this, but it is an alarming number, and I'm past logic at this point. Yes, it's not just women but men also, however I am talking personally. My mom and dad, who were never together, also always tell me just not to bother because of attitudes these days. I am irrationaly scared that if I allow myself to be vulnerable to a woman, she will rob me of everything, whether that be physical things and money, or just my soul and wellbeing. I know it's stupid, and I want to overcome this fear so bad, but I am really struggling. And at that, I hope all is well with everyone, and that you all have a nice day.",lonely,I'm scared of forming meaningful romantic relationships with women (please don't get angry),2022-02-09 04:39:20

3456,CAWvid333,1644330636,1,"I moved recently and have been staying with two friends and their three flat mates, while I try to find my own place. One flat mate decided to move out. Since I got along well with the other two flat mates I was getting excited that I would be able to take that room. Well I started getting the feeling that one of them actually didn't like me much and no one offered me the room. Mind you, I had made it clear to my friends I would love to take that room. I was pretty upset but understood that the other guy doesn't click with me so have been keeping a brave face and holding back the tears. Not only am I upset that I'm not wanted here but also that I have to find a new place, part of me is excited to meet new people but I'm also afraid.
Anyway, just now, the guy who doesn't seem to like me had gone to bed and I was sitting with the others. Then one of them brought up how many applications they have for the room that they have to through. They were just siting there discussing how to choose and what criteria the person would have. I didn't want to show that I was up set so I sat through as long as I could and quietly got up to leave after a bit. But I don't see how they could not see how hurtful that would be. I kind of think I should point it out but also don't like ruffling feathers. I moved country and lost all my support systems in hopes that my friends from here would support me and I feel betrayed, even though it know it's unfair to presume I would be allowed to move in because all the room mates need to agree but to talk about it right there is so hard. I would think my friend would take me aside and say ""I know that you wanted that room but unfortunately the others want to look for someone else."" Instead the topic was ignored so I would just get the message, I accepted that because they maybe feel to awkward but to talk about it in front of me. I'm not going to fucking sleep well tonight because I'll be fighting a thought spiral about how people don't like me and I'm unwelcome. I feel so down for the past week because I feel unwanted.

every single day of my life I'm on autopilot, expecting things to change when they really don't. I feel as though I am solely wasting my time away for nothing. I _have_ wasted every opportunity for building connections to people in the past 10 years of school because I took everything way too seriously. I don't ever go out to meet someone, I only go out for school or a little bike trip if I want to. 

The sheer fucking frustration every single day of waking up only to miss every opportunity for social interaction is getting to me. Nothing ever changes. No one ever comes up to me for anything other than wanting something from me. My entire family has told me about how much they actually despise me and having to deal with my shit. 

My only truest friend I had was my childhood dog that died in late 2020, and ever since it's fucking ruined me. No one is excited for my arrival; they'd much rather want the opposite. I don't see why I should keep up with being a burden for everyone. 

nothing feels rewarding anymore. I've just lost all willpower to do anything. Why should I even bother? Every rare time I ever get a compliment it's the same hollow meaning. If I reach out about anything, people will act extraordinary and be all ""ohhhh no you mean so much to me"" but it's all fucking hollow. I have hurt people before. I've made them upset, I've made them cry, I've been a total ass for no reason at all other than getting some interaction, and I cannot forgive myself for that. I'm positive that I am fault for someone ending themselves because of me jumping to conclusions too quickly. Everytime someone gives me the slightest bit of attention, my mind goes ""haha imagine they like you"" 

not to sound like Elliot Rodger here, but I cannot even see any sort of romance or even friendship without thinking of how fucking miserable I am. Every time I feel like ""oh, well, it's not so bad"" it repeats all over again. I can't even structure this dumbass text because I can't think right. Well, solution is easy, just talk to people right lmao? if only. EVERYONE has someone else they much prefer to talk to. I see chats of my friends talking about the memories they've had together, and not a single mention of me comes up. I don't get invited to play so why bother? People make excuses to not do things with me and I don't blame them. I am actively failing at finding a job, my grades are plummeting, no one is there to help me out. I do not know what the fuck to do anymore. I fucking hate myself for everything I've ever done. 

I will not adjust myself to others for their liking. Even if that means that I'm alone. I am thoroughly sorry for being incoherent. I'll just go back to coping with my frustration.",lonely,i just don't see the point of doing this any longer lol,2022-02-08 23:14:28

I know i'm ugly and awkward and boring but I'm also afraid women just find me creepy. It's to the point now that just seeing or hearing women at all depresses me because all I can think of is how disgusting I must look to them. If I see a couple or even just girls and guys talking or hanging out, I can't help but become filled with jealousy. And a lot of times, hatred.

I dont know any effective way to get women to talk to me but even if I did, I just am not anything that any woman is intetested in. I have no life and can't motivate myself to change things because being *this* lonely and knowing just how gross and ugly I am, absolutely kills any good feelings I may be capable of having about myself.

I have no friends, never had any flings, no exes I can call up to try and to rekindle or at least a booty call. Ive got no one at all. No one has touched me since my twenties, not even a hug. Not even a fistbump. And I'm not young anymore, there's no more time to figure things out. I'm just unlovable, unfuckable and unwanted.

3471,pinestripepajamas,1644310322,1," Mom and sister are gone again. I’m starting to realize how alone I have been. Not just recently but for the last year. There isn’t anyone around for me to feed off their energy. The only occupants in the house are me and the dogs. Cuddled up in the corner of the furthest room. There might as well not be any more rooms. We just need this little cave to dwell in. There is no one to blame for these feelings of loneliness. Finding people to call friends is a skill that is developed. I don’t think I ever developed those skills. 

For as long as I can remember I have always found at least one person to cling onto. I haven’t pushed myself beyond my limits of comfort. I want that to change. All that is required is being kind to people and the bravery to be vulnerable. Yes, there are those who will never see eye to eye. Thankfully we live in a civilized society where manors reign supreme. Those who are the most confident and kind at heart can bend the rules and point out the negative in themselves but more powerful point it out in other people and laugh about it. Yes there is always an exception, there are those who are just plain asses. I’m careful not to label the asses as evil as that requires much more of an understanding of the individual’s intent. Which is an important milestone in my thinking of other people. Up until recently I have had this notion that other people are out to get me. That simply isn’t true. If that were so the window in my room would have bars across it. No, people are much more reactionary. When someone is negative toward them the defenses automatically raise. At my old job there is a poster that reads “kindness is the language everyone understands”. I’m not normally a fan of posters with motivational sayings but that one suck. Time and time again I can see the tiny reactions of earnestness when I am my authentic self. No hats have to be worn. Masks can be taken off. 

The bummer about being so alone is that my sensitivity to others rejection hits harder. Working in the hospital made rejection thrilling. Armor was always on and shining. Worn with pride. As if to say you can’t get to me. A game of jousting between people I see for only minutes is separated by days between interactions. After my quick back and forward I would report back to my small group of coworkers to squeeze all the shit talk possible out of those brief superficial interactions. Now that that’s gone I can see how few people actually play a welcome role in my life. I will cherish the people who have real conversation. Those who don’t play the games of comparisons. The next step is to actively seek those who resonate at the same frequency. I know I will play the fool before I can quickly spot people who I want to join my tribe. That is where bravery will be my strongest ally. For me to become the person I want to share with others I need to have confidence in myself. Which will begin to come about from quitting all the time-wasting self-loathing activities that take up too much of the week.

3482,BugConsumer,1644304019,1,"The blinding light of this eternal plain burns, it’s reach expanding as far as the inner eye can see. Yet today, as my body lie in its room: alone and thinking; the void inside it has been populated. Surrounding me are mirrors, each one reflecting me; a humorous mockery of me. They all whisper and yell different things, different messages. But they all sing the same song, the ever last song made by myself.

The reflections go silent, though. Stopping their crying and screaming as a new being steps forth. Yet, this entity feels as if I’ve known it since I was brought into this world. It looks like me, a one for one match: but it’s eyes are hollowed out, replaced by tiny white pinholes for eyes.

“Why aren’t you doing anything? How cowardly can you possibly be?” It says, slowly approaching me with a soothing voice. “You’re nothing, you’re worthless without me. You know you have no looks to attract people, no talents to give your purpose, and no personality to make people stick around. You’re just a husk of what could have been, but you just had to insert yourself.” It says, it’s approach marching towards me, churning my stomach in fear, in dread.

I can feel it lashing at me, I can feel the slashing of the words against me: yet I like it. “You’ve been feeling that burning, stinging pain of solitude for months now. And what have you done to fix that little bird? Chat to faceless people online for a few days at most?” It says, mocking me as the reflections repeat its words. I feel it surrounding me, I feel it grabbing and ripping at my flesh: yet it is in-front of me, nearly arms length away.

I can do nothing as it gets up in my face, staring right through me. It doesn’t breath, yet it lives. And when I expect this demon to kill me, to harvest my life and move on like it did with my father to me: it surprises me.

It hugs me, and it whispers to me. It whispers thousands of words to me in seconds, all familiar sentences I understand and speak myself. It knows me, but how can it be so? Am I the real me, am I what it speaks into my ear; incomprehensible by the ones outside this cell? 

I start to understand its message, for it gives me purpose. I’ll grow stronger if I accept it, I’ll be able to become contempt with my future failures. If I refuse it, I’ll only go back to the cycle that I’ve been living in for years now. So I hug it back, closing my eyes as it smiles, silencing its preaching of fate and fortune.

I raise my head, my eyes barely adjusted to the darkness of my room; or what I consider to be the only place that I truly live. I can hear it’s voice again, but this time it’s in control. I see myself open the drawer I refused to look it. I see myself pull out what I dread, even if I can’t see it in the dark. “Spare your suffering. Things won’t improve, it’ll only get worse. So why not help yourself by sparing yourself the pain?”

3484,AnExactEstimate,1644303724,1,"I recently lost an online fwb because he finally saw my picture. 

We uh...*interacted* voice only. He was enthusiastic,  highly interested, texted all the time, always wanted to call and talk. Then he saw me. It was immediately all over, he was out. 

The depressive in me thought, *Doesn't matter how sexy your brain is, I guess ugly is just ugly.*

The one before him checked so many of my boxes for a fwb. He seemed to like what he saw when I showed him. He disclosed that he was in a relationship, but that it was poly and they were pretty long distance. I was absurdly attracted to him,  I couldn't get enough of his mind. We touched on the idea of meeting because it turned out that we're about 3 hours away from each other. He had a lot of very flowery and charming things to say. We talked a lot about how lonely and touch-starved we each were and often checked in with each other a few times a day. 

He gave me his entire week's work schedule so that we could make time to talk. 

Then, suddenly...short, cold responses. No more checking in. No more flowery language. But also nothing to indicate what any of this meant so I assumed he was tired because he works a stressful job. 

A flirty text was met with the news that he and his partner had very recently decided to become exclusive, and an offer of friendship. Everything we had been talking about not even two days prior had suddenly become a no-no. 

""It's because you're not enough,"" said depression. 

Under my NSFW (audio) alt, I come across as a strong, confident, sexual being with the attention of many. I probably don't seem like I could even be hurt by the rejection of someone I've never met in person, but here I am - lying alone in bed, alone in my apartment, posting on r/lonely because I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

I feel so lonely, ive always lived under the idea that i had tons of friends and ppl who care - but counting it now and reflecting - i have only 5-6 proper friends, none if which i can emotionally connect with. If anything it feels forced and im always the one initiating any contact or conversation. I dont get it - i dont deserve it - im a good person - i always help ppl out, im always there to emotionally support anyone and help anyone anytime they need. After that its all just surface level friends and ive got no one. 
Going through an insanely rough patch rn and i cant talk to anyone because i dont know if my feelings are valid because i just simply cant understans them. Ive just put it down to loneliness. I cant talk to my parents about it, i dont wanna burden any of my friends who are busy as it is and prolly dont care too much and im way too embarrassed to talk to anyone and open up to someone i dont even know. 
Ive lost track of school work and im jeopardising my future. Im honestly just embarrased of who i am, and thw stuff i do. I cant help but get insanely strong waves of self hate, overwhelmness, and anxiety. Cant do anything but tear up as i panic and inflict any sorta harmless pain that overpowers those sensations.

I've never had a best friend, I never had a group of friends to hang out with, and I guess I couldn't when I was young. The house was like something on Hoarders, without the filth but all the junk and we couldn't dare let anyone in the house, so the most I got out of friendship was just what there was at school.

As a young adult, I saw others planning to hang out with friends after work, but I was never invited. But I didn't try too hard, I felt ashamed at the thought of anyone knowing exactly how desperate I was for a friend, afraid they might discover they were the only one. 

But as I'm getting older in my 30s, I can't help but wonder if I was just too weird, if I'd been marked somehow that was visible to others and not to me. Im unapologetic about being myself, have been told I'm a scream, but that never factored into the formula for friendship enough to seriously interest anyone. Why change things now, anyway? I wonder if time with myself is really all that bad. I know what things I enjoy, I never complain, I'm always conveniently in town, and I often treat myself to dinner.

Recently I realized that B was in the same university course as me, so naturally I told A, because it seemed like something to talk about. She said something like “that’s cool” and we never mentioned it again.

Fast forward a week or two. I’m working on this really difficult assignment from this course. A texts me out of the blue, which NEVER happens, and says “how are you doing with your assignment?” You can imagine how nice it felt for her to spontaneously ask me that. I told her I was getting by, etc. Then she says, “cool, can you help out B? He’s really struggling.”

So being the nice person I am I said “sure, I’ll reach out to him” even though I’ve never met the dude in my life. He says something like “thanks for the help I’ll let you know if I need more.” Fine, whatever, it feels nice to help others. But he never lets me know he needs more help.

Then eventually I get another text from A. It’s like deja vu: “hey, how are you doing with the assignment?” I say “fine, etc.” Again she says, “cool, can you help out B? He’s really having a hard time.”

That time I said no. I said no, I don’t have time to do his work for him, and it’s also an individual assignment, so I shouldn’t have been helping him in the first place. She seemed pretty surprised. But I won’t be surprised if she asks again.

This is my second post today to follow up from the first.

Creating closeness with another person is about opening your heart. It doesn’t matter if you are with at this point, it’s about how close you can get to your own self.

When I’m in touch with who I am , I feel this aura of silence around me, there’s a lot of space in between my thoughts, and there no doubt or hesitation in my action.

Opening the heart can mean doing stretches that open the back and shoulders or aligning the upper chest area. It makes more sense to work on the root if we aren’t stable and allowing that groundedness to slowly open the heart, otherwise if we are unstable and try to open our heart we will get really hurt. But if you need a quick way to feel that openness, then working on the chest area might work.

You can also meditate on the location at the point in which your rib cages meet, this is known as the anahata chakra. However, it’s still best to work on grounding and going about this slowly. I don’t know where you are in life, and I’m just sharing what I know.

3564,Dipesh1990,1644272914,1," Hi guys,

I just wanted to talk about how our own perspective is created by our mind. And how to reframe that perspective that perspective to work for our benefit. We are not lying to ourselves, just changing the angle from which we look at things.

For example, ""I have no one to talk to"" this can be reframed to ""I have to reach out to someone"", in actuality there is any number of people online and in real life to reach out to and talk to. Over time these people can also become friends. The way you know which thought is bringing you down is because when you have it, your mood suddenly goes down. The new perspective should come with a sense of joy. When you actively generate that thought, you should also create a sense of joy, as if you were have a cup of coffee.

The simplest way to overcome loneliness that is created by a lack of friends is to make them. There's another type of loneliness that exists where we feel lonely, even if we are surrounded by friends, and for that I think the person should just spend time alone and introspect. But if we just need some more friends then we should start reaching out to people. We can't expect a friendship to magically get create, it requires some effort on our part. Today is a result of my actions of yesterday, and tomorrow will be a result of my actions of today, If I want to change tomorrow, I have to change today.

One of the biggest things that might cause problem is just the simple fear of reaching out, or talking to someone. I think that it's important to understand that we can always let go of the person we are talking to, and the fear of what might happen doesn't actually exists, what is needed for this kind of anxiety is immediate action. Whether or not the other person likes us, shouldn't hold us back from trying. If they don't like us, we can move on the next person, even if 1 in 100 people like us, that still a lot of people.

Many people will want something from you and you will always be able to sense that in your body. If someone is doing something wrong you will still feel it, it will just make you a little sick. So you should always listen to your intuition, and follow what feels joyful. I can understand this is not for everyone, but if it helps, it helps.

For those of you who are willing, I advise you to write down 3 or more mindsets that you feel might be preventing you from reaching out, and then write a new perspective for each one. You can do it in a comment here, and I'll try to help you or you can do it alone.",lonely,Loneliness mindset,2022-02-08 09:28:34

I feel like I objectify women too much. I realise I don't love actually. I only crush on people or feel romantic, but I never feel that ""love"". 

I've met lots of women. It happened that they were kinda crazy, so I started feeling okay not running so much after women. Not to say that women are generally mad. Throughout my life I had encounters mostly with mentally ill women (depressed, Asperger's, suicidal, revengeful). I apologized to them before we would go separate ways that I cannot bear them emotionally.

It got to the point where I kind of got scared to try to get into a relationship. I don't try anymore. I would really like to have a girl with which I can share my life with: all my thoughts and passions ever really. But I don't feel that romanticism constantly... I feel also as though I am too unconfident that when a girl encourages me to si something, it feels ""cringe"", but only after some time I realize how pure one's heart can be. And now I'm not so sure about sexual desire either. I am such an objectifier (maybe I am hypersexual) that I feel that I will never ever have a functional relationship.

Am I too greedy? Am I a psycho? Or am I afraid? Or too comfortable? Am I weird with girls? What's wrong with me?

3572,Big-Collection-4440,1644271006,1,"I’m (23f) so lonely. Almost all my close friends have fallen away and for most of them I’m not sure why. For most of them I just feel like I was filler for them and I never meant as much to them as they meant to me. For some of them we drifted apart and I left it too long to get back in touch (although if I hadn’t they wouldn’t have bothered I presume) and when we do see each other now there’s a distance there that there wasn’t before and I feel like I’m playing catch up when I used to know everything about them. The person I regarded as my best friend moved 3 years ago and we had a disagreement and apart from a few texts when we eventually made it up we’ve not spoken since and she seems happy and unbothered by the fact she’s lost me, whereas I mourn the loss of her still constantly. 
I live at my parents house with my boyfriend (been together 4 years) but he’s just gotten a job for a few months that is hours away and doesn’t seem to be all that concerned about what a massive change it will be in a few weeks when he moves away. I only found out how soon it would be today and there’s nothing I can do except say I’m happy for him as I know it’s what he wants and I don’t want to move away with him and be somewhere jobless and completely alone without even my family. I love him but I feel like this might be the beginning of the end and he will get bored of the long distance or find someone else. Or he’ll never come back (it could become a permanent position and I think he’s hoping it will be). 

I work alone 3 days a week and when I’m not working I stay at home alone all day mostly unless my boyfriends not working then we both just stay in. He’s got lots of friends and he doesn’t really get what I’ve been going through the past 3 years. 

I’ve always struggled with friendships since I was about 11 as I was always bullied (psychologically) in my friend groups both by girl friends when I was younger and then my male friends when I was older. 

The one friend I had left that I saw on a semi regular basis moved a way a few months ago and has since made 0 effort to catch up with me. I try to speak to her through Instagram at least once a week but she has been short and distant with me. I genuinely have no idea why. There is absolutely no chance I’ve done anything to offend or upset her and it’s triggered such low feelings inside of me that this has happened again. I feel like there must be something strange or wrong with me. 

I did some courses last year which I made some friends that I could have seen becoming close with but the course we were meant to carry on with was cancelled for this year and so I’m back to square one again. 
Im trying to find jobs in my desired career (not what I’m doing now) which might present more opportunities to make friends but I keep getting rejected on the basis of lack of experience. 

I feel so low and hopeless and just keep thinking that even if I can make a friend it won’t be the same as what Ive had with my old friends that I met in my early to late teens and have had so much shared history with. And on the flip side, most people at this age already have established friend groups of their own and wouldn’t be looking for the same kind of closeness I am yearning for. 
I also admit I probably have some issues with trust and with closeness at this point.

I should feel happy that I have a new job, started a new semester, have a chance to meet a bunch of wonderful ppl, but I just don't feel it anymore. So many friends that I liked, ended up ghosting me. Some of it was my fault, and I regret it. Some of it, I still wonder what I could've done wrong. Some of it, I knew was bound to end the way it did, but it still hurts because I never got to say how I truly felt. And even now, I don't know how I truly feel. I just want someone I can trust, and I'm willing to talk it out, but I'm not always given that opportunity when ppl are more interested in saving face.

I find it harder to talk to ppl now than I did a few months ago because I feel more guarded now. I would rather protect this internal peace that I have than to let someone in and be hurt again. It doesn't help that all the money in the world doesn't make me happy.

3609,Johnny_Cage_262,1644257251,1,"I have a disorder that causes me to process information slower. So a small conversation could feel like a satisfying one. And a fast one takes time for me to process everything that's said. So if someone is looking for a quick response after they finish speaking for longer than 30 seconds I will need to take some time to process the information which was spoken to me. This causes me to not really be a fun person to talk to. I can't really train my social skills past my mental illness so being witty is almost virtually impossible. Now that we got that out of the way, let's get to my story.


We met in December. In the beginning, we could talk for hours. You see, I've taken every single social skill advice in the book. Ask questions, emotional responses, pay attention to what the other person was saying. My auditory processing disorder made that hard sometimes but I managed since the environment was mostly quiet. So my first impression was of someone who can handle themselves well in a conversation. All thanks to the advice of the internet. Thanks, internet. 

Now there's one piece of information the internet left out...That this advice is meant to grow you as a person in terms of social skills. Now, most of my social skills problems were caused by my mental illness. Stuff like ""asking questions"", ""looking at people in their eyes"", was stuff I could actually work on. But that advice is just meant as a starting point to jump off at to become a good conversationalist. Here's the problem, I have a mental illness that causes me not to get there. Right now I would say I am as good as I ever can be social. I'm confident enough to walk up to a random stranger and ask them a question just like how I'm confident enough to ask someone out on a date. My problem is, after someone knows me for a while, it's almost like this ""confident"" side of me fades into obscurity as they start to jumpstart quick-witted conversations with me that I can't process in time to make a good response back. Even deeper conversations can be complicated when I don't have time to respond to everything a person says. And sadly, this goes for texting too. Because I process information a lot slower than others I can be fully satisfied by a 2-minute texting conversation when compared to others who can text for hours. And when I'm in a group chat, I get extremely left behind by how many text bubbles are coming out of nowhere.

So me and that person I was talking about earlier, how the friendship ended a few days ago. And I don't know why. They're just not talking to me anymore. They have no interest in me anymore. The reason I don't know, but what I can say is after we talked that night I become a more quiet and closed-off person. Not because I want to, but because I just ran out of things to say. I'm not able to process what I want to say fast enough to make a sufficient response.",lonely,"In a way, I've always been lonely thanks to my slow information processing disorder.",2022-02-08 05:07:31

3614,Sudden-Sand-Storm,1644253940,1,"For context. I’m a 35 year old man, from the UK. The town where I lived and grew up is a little odd. It’s too big to be a village, but too small to be a town. As such, everyone seems to know everyone and their business, there’s no resemblance of privacy. 

Myself and my now ex girlfriend were together since middle school. As such, 99% of our friends were shared. She was short, petite, very sweet to all and just had that personality that made her seem that she could do no wrong. This becomes important later.

We were together for 20 years and all was fine, I was totally loyal to her, but this is where the fun starts. 

A few years ago, I found out that she was cheating on me. For 7 years. The initial revelation came when I found condom wrappers and a second mobile while I was doing a spring clean of our apartment.

I confronted and she admitted it, even had it in messages. When my Nan was dying and I was caring for her during her last days, she was out getting laid. When I was working away to make money for us to buy our first owned home, she slept with her ex. She left a trail of dirty messages to one of her best friends husband too, all so horrendous.

I wish I was kidding.

However, she was clearly interested in protecting her reputation, so she blamed me to our wide group of friends and others, I don’t know the specifics as very quickly I because unwelcome, but denied she had cheated but I was the cheater, who invented this story to make her out to be the bad guy. She also threw a bunch of other accusations. Fast forward a few months, she then became a bit stalker-ish. Asking for me back, shaming me for “being totally alone” because of her. She dangled the carrot that I’d have my friends back if I took her back. I declined. She smashed my car up, broke my kitchen window, put superglue in my door lock, very petty and very expensive. Her dad is a local charity worker, political counsellor and a overall loved guy, so there was no legal route I could take to deal with it, without there being a total cluster**** of crap coming my way for trying to correct the issue. He also believed his sweet daughter implicitly.

Suddenly the whole group turned on me. I was totally isolated. Even my best friend turned and was convinced by her that I was the B******. I was alone in a town surrounded by people that hated me. I took it on the chin for years, and tried to just carry on with my life. I did this for 2 years, but the rumours, ostracisation and loneliness got to me, so I upped and left.  

I started over 100 miles away in a new city. Found a amazing job, went back to uni, generally tried to build back up. Found a wonderful woman who I care about. 

However, I’m lonely. Since then, I’ve struggled to make new friends. I’ve been told by some at work that I come off a little cold until I know them, then people don’t really want to get to know me. They don’t invite me to functions, work social events or anything else. So I stopped trying.

I go to work, come home, stay in until bed. Start over. Unless I’m with my partner, I’m on my own. 

Really I needed to vent, to ask for advice and to clear my head. How do you make friends when you don’t know how, and you got burned so badly that you don’t know what to do?

I believe I'm only in this situation because I put myself in it, but the rope I brought to hoist myself out of the hole isn't long enough. I waste all my time online playing games with strangers. In real life I hide the fact I just want someone to care for me as much as I can, out of fear of looking fragile, even from my closest friends and family. I'm not even sure when the last time I cried was. I just wish there was someone who would hold me and caress my hair and tell me everything will be okay as I fall asleep. I hardly ever have these feelings because most of the day I spend writing or playing games, keeping myself occupied  so a mask of happiness looms over me.

3658,doubtfulsigh,1644222582,1,Initially I thought the act of dating people would feel easy and loving like a warm hug but fuck it is far from the case. My family and friends have been recently telling me I’m a pretty thoughtful charismatic and joyful kind of guy and I would consider my self handsome/attractive (source: I hit the gym pretty often and groom/dress my self well I also did some modeling before the pandemic if that gives any credibility lol) But those compliments often turn into wondering why I’m single. After thinking about it honestly people just ghost me or I’m either a rebound to make their ex jealous like I’ve been tagged in romantic looking photos with women who intentionally use me to make their ex pay attention to them and then they kind of just forget about me or tell me they’re focusing on them selves but then they go back to their ex. I’m not angry at any of them for doing that because ya know you’ve only got this life so make it count I guess but fuck it hurts so badly. All I want is to give my love to someone incredible and feel loved in the same way but idk I guess that isn’t in the cards for me rn. Now that I’m really thinking about all this I’ve only ever been a stepping stone for someone. It doesn’t make too much sense to me because I only ever try to encourage people and I actively listen to people when they’re venting or when they need help with something I’m there even if I dislike them and I do stand up for my self when need be but idk why I’m just so alone like if I didn’t have my family barely anyone would returns my calls or even bother talking to me. Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if the person that is perfect for me is either in a relationship or they died in some horrific accident.,lonely,Why is dating so confusing?

I was too, she deserves it. Well, in the midst of that euphoria, she told me about how she used to be like me, she used to not believe that there's someone out there for her, she thought she was going to be alone forever until that guy came to her life.

I was cool with that. I understand the high of a new relationship, that is I have heard of how it is. Then she told me that I should just open my heart. And not close it off. 

And I went all 'huh' because no, I never did mention that I was closing my heart. It's just that no guy has ever wanted me *that* way. Yes, they flirt. But they flirt and go and I am exhausted. I have been ghosted about so many times in the past five years yet some people still expect me to have an intact mindset when it comes to dating? I don't. I have been hurt so many times.

So I questioned her about it, told her I understood her views on waiting until marriage and I had no issue with waiting but told her I have sexual feelings for her and want her like that. Following day she told me she lost all romantic feelings for me and it turned her off? How the hell is that possible? I wasn't pressuring her at all, just told her how I felt about the situation. Rewind 3 weeks before that she told me she loved me and needed me and was grateful to God for me and then after all this happened we talked and she told me she didn't see herself being married to me or a future with me, ended up texting me and telling me she didn't want to see or talk to me anymore and told me goodbye and that was it before blocking my number.

I’ve never had a “real” friend. I’ve gone through two friend groups in 8 years and they both ended similarly. I just couldn’t change with the groups. I didn’t want to be the guy they were asking me to be. It’s always about fucking drugs or sex. And so when I try to watch shows or read books and there’s always a friend group involved and doing stuff together I just start to bawl my eyes out. How did I get like this? I don’t have people to talk to. I have no one I can confide in. “Go to therapy.” I tried. They said I’m just “in a lull” and to “try reaching out to different groups that align with your interests.” I’ve tried that too. It just didn’t work out. 

God it fucking sucks. And really, there’s nothing to cry over with my love life cause there’s literally *nothing* to cry over. I feel like a damn wallflower just screaming to be let into the garden.

I am a 23m  have somehow put a facade about hiding my true feelings (It makes me cringe just about writing that sentence) to cope with the loneliness. The true me is someone who is very depressed and was addicted to weed,LSD and Xanax and had suicidal thought for a long time. The other me is a funny guy who tries to be funny and caring about others and helps in any ways i could. Everytime i exposed the true me i get ignored or vent off or i am a pussy. Every time i wake up i am in a ''i don't care about anything mood'' until i go to work.

As for friends, I have a group of friends. One group is guys i went to high school (*I wasn't someone very popular in hs nor a bully target i just didn't care about it*).i was close with the group at the beginning but my brother came and now i live in his shadow(i never get calls from them about me every time i got a call from them it is about my brother) I also got left behind for a move because i had to search my vest and they didn't care nor answered my calls , Second time was my birthday we had a move with all the squad to go to the arena but i got ghosted and celebrated it alone. They also created a fake profile on tinder with my face and acted like i was a creep. I know I have like two or three real friends who never did me wrong. I know it is a VERY VERY toxic relation and i am aware but it is far better than total darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

As for my romantic relationship since i am very shy and have a lot of difficulty about being the center  of attention plus mixing some social anxiety is a bad disaster.I dont see myself as ugly (*.83 meters tall,Not overweight but not skinny* ) . I recently realized that there were girls who were flirting with me i just didnt realize it and it makes me angry about me but i have to accept it. And for now i am still in love with my hs crush i am just to scared to talk to her again but i want to try i am just scared about making a fool of myself so i do nothing. I wouldn't call it an obsession but i think it is too long gone to try to make a move

I have also lobbies to help me cope like walking for 2 hours on the weekends and 30 mins on working days which is a very good way to be in serenity.

Maybe it was a bit too slow, slow enough for my mind and eyes to wander. That's what I get for never setting clear boundaries, but that will change. I need to ask what they want from me and let them know what I want from them. I need to initiate the conversation I know I need to have. I don't want to be alone anymore and I think I'm ready to be in a relationship again. 

It freaked me out when they told their ex they were dating me. I felt horrible that I didn't see it that way. I thought we just liked each other, not that we were supposed to be exclusive to each other. I should've clarified more back then, but there's no better time than the present and I'm doing that now. I want to be to exclusively theirs. I want to call them mine. Nothing has to be set in stone, but I need to get this ball rolling. A conversation of what we're looking for and if we want the same things then that's great. I don't know what they're going to say or how they're going to react yet, so I'm trying to rid myself of expectations. 

I guess what I really need right now is someone who can keep me grounded in reality and is okay with letting me ramble. Someone who's okay with me clinging and giving them constant affection. Someone who will be honest with me, no matter how ugly the truth may be. I need someone who will be patient with me while still communicating their needs and wants. I'm not going to be so afraid anymore. If I'm going to love again, lord let it be fiery and passionate. I'm going to establish boundaries, I won't let myself be buoy floating with no direction.

3712,PsalmoftheSad,1644206331,1,"... That's all I think I really wanna say. 


I hate how short I am. Nothing I can do about it which makes it twice as worse. I'm a joke to women.. Can only date online so that way they'll see my personality before my height. Well -- then again, no I can't date online apparently. This girl I knew for the entirety of last year just told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore. We've been back and forth where I was trying **SO** fuckin hard to hold on because it'd mean going back to... Well.. THIS.



You might think I did it to myself when I say this part, but I just told that girl I hated her. This girl that I held on to till my fingers turned blue, the one that meant the world to me at one point. She kept pushing me away the second she found out I had feelings for her. Little by little, day by day, she made it a point to go out of her way to make me feel different than her regular friends. **Worse** than her regular friends, actually... 



Either way, I could tell the whole story but we'd be here all fuckin night. I don't feel bad about it, either. I told her ""I hate you for what you did to me"" and that was the end of it. There's no way she can contact me anymore, apart from sending me a letter in the mail -- but who's gonna waste money on postage for that shit 



**... But now what?** I go back into the lonely world again, that's what. I've made post after post about being terrified of going back to this shit again. What's the point? I spend my time either at work, exercising or here. On this computer, shitposting on reddit. I could play some video games again, but I played my favorite ones with her all the time and they just give me bad memories. When I get on GTA there's a whole camera roll where we took pictures together that I swore to myself I'd never delete. Even if I did, I don't think I'm ready to yet... 


Speaking of not being ready to get rid of things, she sent me a letter too. Y'know, like on paper and in an envelope. That's the first time in my life that a girl ever cared enough about me to write something so personable. She put her perfume on it, and even added a little tracing of her hand too. Just a little reminder of what it'd be like to hold her hand.. We made plans, man. She'll deny it up and down the street but we were gonna meet and things were gonna be okay for once in my fucking miserable little insignificant life. We were gonna go to concerts together, we were gonna go to arcades. We were gonna go fishing... I'd finally have something in my life to give it meaning other than obligations at a job. 


If I still had tears to cry, I'd flood this fuckin city with them. 



And that's the worst part too, no amount of typing in a stupid fuckin reddit post will ever make this okay. It's a great catharsis sure, but at the end of the day I'm still pecking away on this keyboard at 11 at night, trying to find something to keep the stresses of this life from taking me. Which, if I'm being honest, sounds pretty fuckin great right about now. 



I can't believe I've gone through so much heartbreak in this life, so many trials and so much pain, just to have **MORE** of it shoveled onto my lap. Isn't it supposed to get better like everyone promised? Where's that ""light at the end of the tunnel"" everyone swears by? Does it only happen to the normal people that don't have to suffer with loneliness or being Forever Alone? 



I'm not gonna sit here and say some dumb shit like ""a girlfriend would solve ALL my problems,"" but y'know what? It'd sure make this bitch ass life a fuckton of a lot more bearable. 



Sorry for the profanity.

3741,frenchmadridista,1644191912,1,"TW: Suicidal thoughts, depression, drugs

Hey guys, I am in the 1st semester of my junior year at college so I am just over halfway done. I had a tight-knit group of friends in my freshman year until everyone got sent home for covid. My entire sophomore year was online and I have a pretty hard time keeping in touch with people over long periods of time if we are away from each other. In addition, I had to take last semester off due to extreme mental health issues and it is for that reason that I am a first-semester junior during the spring. I came back here knowing that I was going to have to go at it alone. The first couple weeks during our remote learning period were great because my roommates were around all the time and people had very little work to do so I was relatively social. Now that we are back in person all my roommates are busy with their own lives and classes (as they should be) and never have time to hang out or do anything. In fact, the most I usually see them now is in our living room/kitchen for a couple of minutes while we make small talk and nothing more. I was also rushing fraternities this week and vibed with two of them a lot but they didn't give me a bid because I am a junior (one of them I suspect but the other one had a brother that flat out told me this was the case). The clubs on campus are not hosting many events, if at all, because of how shut down this area is due to covid. The people in my classes literally just sit down, don't talk to anyone (even if I try to initiate), and leave the moment the professor says the class is over. In the dining hall/food court area I feel invisible. Everyone (as they should) is hanging out with friends and if they are alone they are working on something on their laptops. I was a loser in middle and high school and I feel like I am back to being one in college. I was told that college is where you ""find your tribe"" but over halfway through college I am as lonely as ever. I just don't know what else to do or if there is even anything I could do. I love sports but my school has no school spirit so the stands are nearly empty and the students that actually do go are, similar to the dining hall, with a big group of friends already. I feel like this world is not meant for me, I just sat in my room all day when I wasn't in class in high school and middle school, and now I just sit in my room all day in college. The only difference is that I get high (weed) a lot to numb the pain and break up the monotony of my life. The only thing I have to look forward to is studying abroad but that won't start until late August which is in just under 7 months. I have no clue how I am gonna get through a lonely semester and summer (where I will at least have my family around). Any advice would be great. I just can't keep living like this over and over again. Thanks.",lonely,No friends at college as a junior and feeling hopeless,2022-02-07 10:58:32

He always knew how many kids I have, it wasn't like I was keeping it a secret. I'm just devastated. No one will ever want to be with me bc of my kids. By time the youngest one is out of the house, I'll be too old and still no one will want me.",lonely,No one will ever stay,2022-02-07 09:02:18

[When you are alone with yourself all the time, with no one but yourself, you begin to go deeper and deeper into yourself until you lose yourself. It’s a perverse contradiction. It’s like your ego begins to disintegrate until you have no ego. Not in the sense that you you become humble or or or gain some kind of perspective, but that you literally lose your sense of self. And I’m not sure anyone, unless they have gone through it, can can can truly understand how  profound that loss is. It’s like the psychic glue that binds your whole notion of existence is gone, and you become unglued. 

I think, therefore I am. I think too much, therefore I am not. I am not, therefore I am nothing. I am nothing, therefore I am dead. And if I am dead, then why am I still so goddamn lonely?

3782,AceDangerous1010,1644182207,1,"I don't know. I would consider myself a habitually lonely person, but things just feel so much worse right now. My wife and I don't really have much of a connection anymore, not for lack of trying on my part. There's no emotional or intellectual intimacy. She just does not care about the things that matter to me. She does not care about or have any sympathy for my struggles with ADHD. It's hard to live every day feeling like I'm barely tolerated in my own home.

We have a son who is just my favorite person in the world. He's only 5 though. So while I cherish him every day, he just doesn't understand me yet.

I need to leave my house. I haven't done that other than to go to work for a while. I used to go out and enjoy hobbies and have some kind of social life. I rarely see my friends. I've made an effort to start playing roleplaying games with some of them online, but that's not the same.

I've got this ethically questionable friendship with a woman I work with. We're both mutually attracted to each other and get along great, but have some firm boundaries in place about what's acceptable behavior between the two of us. the lonely way I feel has me wanting her attention so badly right now and I can't have it. I don't want to be needy or annoying, but I just want to be seen and understood by someone and I don't have anyone else in my life I can turn to. But even that's not accurate because she's got her own life and I can't even get enough attention from her to soothe my loneliness.

I don't really know what to do. My marriage isn't working. Something needs to be done, and although I think divorce or separation is probably the ultimate answer, I have no idea how to get there in a way that ends with amicable coparenting. I need to rebuild old friendships and foster new ones, but I don't really know how to do either. And I need the kind of relationship in my life where I can just talk to someone anytime I want and know that they'll always be there for me.

I went to the mall with my friend, but then he left me alone claiming that I should talk to people and warm up.


But I am desperated, I dont know what to do, I dont even know exactly where I am, I have no money, and I dont want to force a conversation.


I am here alone as I am typing this post, my battery is 10%, and I dont know what I will do when it ceazes.


I am Lost here at the mall, I cant find him.


The place here looks so nice, the ambient is cool, but I am so fucked up that I cant enjoy this.


My friend was also shaming me for my fear of height and for ""walking weird"", that I must ""be a man"", or that ""people in the stores will know I have no money Just by seeing me"", ""that the way I am dressing is weird"".

He also complained for taking to long to awnser him when he texted me from home, but he never called me. He also Said that the next time, he wouldnt comply, denying any possibility of calling me, for NO REASON.


It was supposed to be a pleasant experience, but he basically left me alone to rot.

I thought he got better, but he is acting like the same dick he acted before.


EDIT: I just got home and I am not well, a little after I made my post, he found me, he said we would be in a social show, kinda like a ballad, but for the entire night, I said no because of my parents, I wasnt prepared mentally, he then came into a restaurant show, but changed his idea, he said that I didnt want after claiming that it would be for a few hours and I deciding  that I wanted it. I was sad, because I felt guilty that it was my fault that I messed up a potentially great experience. Then we came to another mall, we randomly went to many places, ate, there were some provocations to me and superficial dumb stuff, and I got lost from them twice, then his dad took us from our homes.




I am sad, I feel fucked up, I can barely function in social situations, I barely get the oportunity, and when I get, I aways feel ashamed and disconnected from the world, many times I feel like I am stopped floating in the space time, I feel like a ghost, a wraith, I dont feel like I am there.


My wish is to actually find my social circle, but I am too eccentric, I speak too loud, make too many gestures, and I am too fixed into deep stuff, especially philosophy.



In a month, my first year of college will begin, psychology, I am excited that there will be many girls, but I am so detached from reality that I am almost sure that I will be avoided, seen as a weirdo.

I feel like a loser, a dammed person, a cursed person, I am convinced that I was born in the wrong world. When I think about the path I am going in life, I feel like I will end alone, a incomprehensive genius, a fucked up person with no hope.




Btw I am 20, I wanna be hopeful about college next month, but my performance will suck, I feel that is already too late, but I am such a asshole that I will ending bothering everyone trying to connect, and they will see my true self, but I wont give up, I will continue to be an asshole, because that is what assholes are, they bother everyone with their selfish desires.",lonely,I am so ashamed for being the way I am,2022-02-07 07:30:06

I don’t know what it’s like to see someone for the first time in a week and give them a hug because I missed them

I don’t know what it’s like to be extremely nervous when I tell someone I love them for the first time

It’s all these things that I feel a lot of people take for granted that I wish I could experience.

Sometimes I just wonder what it would be like to have people there to support you, that you can share stories with, and depend on. I know with any kind of relationship comes some drama, but I’d rather have loved and lost than never loved at all.

I feel like there are two main categories of lonely people (but correct me if I’m wrong): There’s people who have friends and are somewhat social but despite this still feel alone and distant, and then there’s people who have very few friends or none at all and feel alone because of that. This post is referring to the latter.

Even with all these people around me living their best lives, I feel so alone. I can’t imagine a world where I have people to depend on, or people to console me in times of need. I especially can’t imagine having someone I could fall in love with and who loves me back. It all seems like a distant fantasy.

It’s been this way for my whole life, and sometimes I wonder if the rest will be the same. People say “you’ll find friends/a significant other in good time, it just takes time, just wait for your life to take its course, etc” but that’s not true for everyone. Some people truly have no friends for a majority of their life and I’m scared and disheartened that this might very well be me. Of course if someone doesn’t want friends and wants to be alone, there’s nothing wrong with that, but that’s not me. The loneliness really really sucks, to put it bluntly.

I hope my life changes soon but I know the only way it will is if I take action, and that’s the hardest part. There’s a lot more I want to say but I’ll stop here so I don’t keep rambling. I purposely kept this post vague because it’s easier for me to write that way but just for a little context I’m a female in college.

Hi

Some introverts suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety.

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them.

You can find the Zoom link here:

3838,clintonshaughnessy,1644161318,1,"It seems to me the best antidote for my particular loneliness is to find other people. I have remarkably few people in my life, and the last five years have been particularly destructive. I'm posting here while I wait for this account to be old enough to post elsewhere. 

It's difficult to rebuild a life at 34. Almost all the bridges leading from my youth have been burned. Or collapsed on their own. I find myself floating on my own in a dreary Indiana town which has seen better days. It might even be enjoyable to explore the town a bit more, but I have no human companions. Luckily I have a cat whom I adore - she gives me some company. 

I'm a marijuana aficionado, and while that comes loaded with stereotypes of peace-loving hippies, I'm about as jaded as they come. I was political in my youth, but now my life goal has transformed from saving the earth to saving my life, and I have come to believe the best way to do this is to find my person and start a family. It wasn't easy to come to this decision, and it's a very difficult decision in an age in which so few desire families. I'm not saying I want to jump right into that, but it is what I seek, ultimately. 

It's sunny today after a snowstorm a few days ago. It's still cold. The ice remains. I'm spending my Sunday alone at home as usual. When I'm not working, this is how I spend my time. I'm hopeful that I'll find someone who might help ease the burden of loneliness - once and for all ideally, but at the very least for awhile.",lonely,Lonely 34 year-old man in the frigid American midwest,2022-02-07 02:28:38

Sometimes I feel content with myself enough to the point where I have a small bit of confidence, but honestly if I were ever going to go on a date, a girl would have to drag me out of the house by force. I'm so socially anxious and awkward.

I have an appointment with my psychologist tomorrow and will tell him about it but I am sure I will make an enemy out of both of them by doing so. I feel so lonely thinking about how I will probably be forced to move out of the house through my actions.



I am on a disability program from the government so if I say that I don't feel safe in my home they will be more likely to listen and act on it. Both parents will see my actions as pointless and destructive since my sister did similar actions with bad results.

A few years ago both my sister and mom got cancer at the same time. I pretty much lost myself in depression to this news and as a result lost my job and my husband of 10 years left and remarried.. I moved out of the country solo and thought I got my shit together with exotic new perspectives, but I still struggled with anxiety.
I finally found a job and moved to south florida a year ago. Two weeks after starting my big new role,  I was diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome, which makes me highly likely to get certain cancers. I did a colonoscopy due to the diagnosis and they found a 30 cm tumor in my colon.  I had no idea it was there. No symptoms.  Soon I had (almost) my entire colon removed (no bag). It was stage 2 but they appeared to have gotten the cancer, but now I have to have a hysterectomy and double mastectomy over the next 2 years.
 I'm turning 40 years old in a few days.
I have never been so lonely and fearful for the future. For the first time in my life I don't have many friends and a non existent love life. I spent most nights and weekends in my apartment alone and unable to motivate myseIf to be the productive i know i can be. I am scared that I will never find someone who will love me despite all of these organ removals. I'd really just like to love and care for someone and to be loved in return.

I recently got an Asperger’s/high functioning ASD diagnosis from a provider at a residential mental health program and I guess I’m just trying to figure out where to go from here.
Ever since high school I have never been able to truly become close friends with anyone. I always have severe social anxiety which prevents me from making any first moves, and I realize now at 23 years old that I don’t have any close friends in my life. Sure I have people online I sometimes talk to, but nobody else considers me a good friend, and it’s an awful feeling. 
Is there any way I can begin to be like other people and have a real friend group? Or am I just destined to be lonely for the rest of my life. What’s weird is I have been in a 3 year relationship now, but I’m still unable to make any real friends.
Sorry for the long post.",lonely,Having trouble keeping friends,2022-02-06 13:45:58

I've been going to the gym on and off, I'll go for 3 months and take 2-3 year breaks. I just went back.
I'm just starting to learn guitar and Brazilian jiu jitsu, and wanna learn boxing. I'm starting to be an outdoors person a couple years ago, ie camping, paddleboarding, snowboarding. I want to learn skateboarding too . I also want to get into guns and shooting, and I want to get into horses. I also want to travel within the states whenever I can.

People would probably say it's never too late and they're right, but what really gets me down is I could've started that stuff right after college (since I already dicked around in college and almost flunked but I digress). Basically 7 years down the trash. Right now I could be shredded, and a beast at guitar, boxing, shooting, and horse riding. I could have so many things under my belt that would make me such an interesting person, perhaps people and specifically girls would want to come into my interesting world.

Let’s see I don’t even know where to start but I guess a good place to start is the beginning of everything. 2015. I had been working an awesome wedding job and had a huge group of amazing friends. I found the love of my life that year as well. I finally experience true happiness. There was nothing wrong in this world. I was ready to settle for a mediocre plant job 9-5 life just to support my significant other and myself. 


A day after a vacation with them I was asked to stay at a friends house for a night just so they could decompress as they were feeling low, mentally. I happily obliged as it had been a while since I had hung out with the homies. The next morning I am blocked on every form of social media and from call/text. I find out they moved out of state and took everything with them ( I had a couple thousand saved up for us at our house that was taken as well) 


That was the last I heard from them personally. It absolutely devastated me and the lack of closure/answers tormented me for years. I went through a really rough time afterwards and came out a completely different person.

My friend group gradually got smaller and smaller as some moved away, some turned out to be not good people, some reached the end of their story.


Fast forward 7 years and I’ve been in two relationships since and they were both miserable. I loved them but it wasn’t the unconditional love I had once felt. I moved into my own place for the first time without roommates and it has left me extremely isolated and numb emotionally. 

I've lost all of my friends due to the ravages of time and the harshness of the world. I can't wait for the day I can leave this city. I can't wait for the day I make a new friend or two.  I can't wait for the day I find love again.

3948,QueenOfEgg4657,1644100620,1,"Sorry I've never done anything like this before, I just need to get it off my chest. I've never posted anything online before really, but I'm just feeling overwhelmed right now.

I feel like no one cares what I have to say. I don't have any friends, and although I'm friendly with my colleagues at work, we don't hang out outside of work. They'll often come to me for a chat, and tell me all about themselves and their lives and all the good and bad, but no one asks about me. Even when I try to tell them, they just nod politely and then carry on. 

I've been told multiple times recently that I'm such a good listener, but I feel like it's just because I've realised there's no point trying to join the conversation. It makes me feel so lonely, like I'm just a dumping ground for their troubles, and I have to have their burdens and mine. 

I can't tell them to stop either, as they're the closest to friends that I have, and I don't want that friendly interaction to go away, because if I tell them to stop, they might realise I'm just not worth talking to, full stop.

I also feel I can't hang out with them outside of work, even though I've been invited by one of them a couple of times to go to the pub. I've never been the best at holding a basic conversation and I don't drink so I find it so so hard to let loose at all. I feel like if I went, I'd just drag the mood down and they'd realise there's no point being around me.

I've also been thinking about how people ignore me, and it made me notice how no one has ever even called me pretty. It seems insignificant, and I know I'm really not the nicest person to look at, but just the fact that no one has even just said I'm 'pretty' even in passing has honestly taken such a toll on me recently. My love life has been non existent this far into my life, and that realisation makes it seem like I'm destined to never be loved.

3952,henker220,1644099555,1,"I'm  a 23 year old guy on the spectrum and I've never even been on a date  before. I've tried meeting women IRL when I was in community college,  online dating, etc. At this point, I lean on online dating because it  seems like every woman I try to talk to IRL is either taken or not  interested. Plus, I also had a girl in college accuse me of harassing  her for trying to talk to her and got me sent to the dean's office  (another reason I only do online dating). Predictably, online dating  isn't working either no matter what advice I follow or how much money I  invest in subscriptions or extra features. The little self-esteem I had  has been beaten out of me by constant rejection.

Since  I am on the spectrum, I don't do bars or clubs because I get sensory  overload. I live in a very red town in Florida and I'm a minority,  atheist, and politically left-wing (demographically speaking, the cards  are stacked against me...). The only meeting place for people my age in  my town is the community college and I just graduated. Moving is also  not an option for practical reasons. I feel like I'm just not meant to  have what I want (an intimate connection with a woman).

I  have hobbies apart from trying to pursue women. I like to read books,  play video games, learn different languages, watch documentaries,  distance running, things like that. The people of [r/amiugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/)  apparently think I'm not ugly, but evidently there is still something  wrong with me that's causing me to not be attractive to women. Everyone  around me is partnering up and losing their virginity and I still  haven't come close to doing any of that. The closest I've come to a  relationship was an online ""relationship"" with a girl I met on a pen pal  website who was studying in Europe.

I started my undergrad in the states, where freshman year I wasn't invited out, I never went to frat parties, I never went to house parties. Drinking age is 21 in the States so bars were out of the question until the last few months of my final undergrad year (I graduated a semester early so I never experienced legal drinking in college). FOUR YEARS. Not one party. Th only party I was ever invited to was the one in my own apartment thrown by a housemate. I studied abroad in 2 countries in my undergrad and went to a third for my grad career. Every single time its the same: I get along well with the people I meet in the beginning, become part of some sort of group, but am always the lowest member of the group, rarely contacted outside of the group setting and never invite to the big group activities (ex: my friends just took a trip to a different country and I found out from Instagram). I think they assume I have tons of other friends since I'm not a core participant of their group, but here I am, sitting alone in my room every single day. I'm so god damn lonely. It looks like its so easy or everyone else to just fall in step with people, find groups and friends and make strong connections. How??? I'm absolutely drowning. 4 countries 5 years and all I have to show for it is one somewhat solid friendship (I speak to them twice a year). I know I should start losing my alone time, but 5 years of alone time is a lot to love, and the more I hang out with me, the less I like me (so I guess its understandable why people don't stick around lol). I've wasted away my early 20s locked up in my room with no one to go out with, never getting invited to outings. I neer thought I'd turn out to be the pathetic type, as I was an absolute firework in highschool and earlier years (very energetic, easily making friends with the people I went to school with).

4034,NiJeLL,1644055164,1,"I'm happy for them of course! I'm glad they have someone who makes them happy and that makes me vicariously happy, but I wish I had what they had for myself. My trust issues have only grown and as much as I want to fall in love, I'm afraid of vulnerability and getting hurt again. I feel as if I need to work on myself, magically erase the hurt and pain caused by exes and ex-friends, but how the hell am I going to do that by myself? Sure not everyone is going to hurt me, but why even take that chance when you could just stop trying to form connections? I isolate myself when I know the best thing would be to go to someone. But it's always like... who would I even go to? Who can I trust? Often I think: ""even though they said it's okay, what if all of a sudden it wasn't actually okay to vent and they'll hate me/get mad?""

Don't get me wrong, I'm genuinely happy for my friends, but deep down I'm jealous too. I'm jealous when I see them hold hands or hug each other. I'm jealous when I see them kiss or makeout. I'm jealous of their affection between them and their partner. Even the guy who said I'd get a girlfriend before him got one before me. I want to kiss someone so bad. One, nice, passionate, long kiss on the lips. I want someone to call mine. I want someone to whisper sweet nothings to. I want to treasure someone and be just as adored back. Am I asking for too much? I always feel like I am. Earlier today, a classmate called me ""so demanding"" under their breath for making a request to the teacher that'd help the whole class. That bugged me, that hurt, and I know I shouldn't care cause they don't know me personally, but it reminded me of when I was told I was ""too hard to make happy"" by an ex. 

I don't want to be all alone, but forming relationships, gaining trust, and maintaining it all is draining. Cause how do I know it won't be the same cycle of them eventually leaving? I've had to make new friends every year. I don't know how long I can keep going. If I can't keep anyone, why make friends at all? Same thing applies to domestic partnerships, why fall in love when it can turn on you at any moment?

i should have figured out though, given the title of the sub, that this one in particular is, in fact, more used as a type of dating spot. i legit thought it was for people who were lonely, and either wanted to vent on it, or perhaps try and make real friendship connections.
i have had i don't know how many ppl privately hit me up to *talk and chill,* but have only been interested if it could lead into something sexual or dating wise. i am legit looking for a real person i can talk to and shit like that. 
I'm sick of dudes wasting my time bc they tryna get their dick sucked/jacked. 
believe it or not, I'm actually a pretty cool chick that absolutely adores inappropriate, off color memes, rock music, gore videos/pics, and decent convo. I'm pretty clever and can carry a conversation. not much on starting one though. I'm 38/f, but tbh, I'm more gender fluid then anything. 
i still enjoy the perks of being a bitch though (being only 5'3 i need help with tall shelves, and I'll find a man real fucking quick if i have a flat tire or anything that is easier to deal with that is man related), but i don't mind rolling my sleeves up and getting down in the dirty work if i need to.  not to toot my own horn, but I'm pretty fucking cool. wish somebody would chat me up though on some real convo.

The one girl I dated was constantly fighting with me and the other girl was cheating on me behind my back.I go out and do things but just about every girl I see in social places has a boyfriend. People always say go out and talk to girls, okay I get it but you can’t expect me to talk to girls when literally every girl at the bar, bowling alley etc has a boyfriend. I could try flirting with the bartender but that’s also just asking for trouble. Sure there are times where I see a group of girls hanging out at a table but I don’t want to be a creep and go up to them and just start talking to them they most likely will find it uncomfortable. There was this one time where these girls were sitting at a table and they invited me to hangout with them. I ended up buying them beer and shots etc and we exchanged numbers. I text them a couple days later but never heard from them again, looking back I think they were just looking for some guy to give them free alcohol. I was kinda sad after that but it’s whatever. I thought about going to a swinger club and hooking up with a girl but I don’t know. Anyways I just don’t see how people make getting a girlfriend look so easy, it just feels like one of those things were you have to have a friend who knows a single girl and it gets harder with age as most girls are having kids and getting married now. I don’t even want to know what the dating life is going to be like when I hit 30. I go on Facebook Dating and most girls on there just ignore messages, constantly won’t stop messaging me or they live 2 hours away. I did hangout with one girl on there but we just remained friends because I wasn’t into her like that. I will admit I am a little picky but I’ve just been feeling like shit lately and don’t understand how people make relationships or even hookups look so easy. It pisses me off too because most people are single because they choose to be, are too nervous to do anything about it or are single for religious reasons when with me it’s like I never have the opportunity to and in the rare chance I do get the opportunity to, nothing happens. People say your a good looking guy, things will workout and that I look like Tom Brady, I kinda do lol but things just never go anywhere and never get an opportunity to get a girl because their all taken. My best friend also had a kid recently and we never hangout anymore, I’m happy for him but it just sucks how we never hangout anymore. It’s like all life is now is work, bar and bed.

I got invited to a party (whohoo!), which is really rare for me. Normally I sit alone all the time and just do schoolwork (college) or play videogames. A coworker of mine invited me to a party at his apartment yesterday for Saturday.

In theory this sounds awesome, but there will be a lot of drinking, which I don't do, and the apartment is small with what will be 50 people stacked shoulder to shoulder I don't know. This type of environment is really not my thing and my social anxiety is through the roof just thinking about going. But at the same time I feel like this is what is normal for social people to do and how I'm supposed to meet people while I'm in school, so I feel like I should go. The only two people I will know there will probably be wasted an hour or 2 in, so I'll just awkwardly be standing there.

Anyone here have crippling anxiety and been to a party where you know you're gonna be basically on your own to interact with people? Is there any chance I'll find it enjoyable? How can I calm my anxiety about this?

I have this female friend that I’m very close with, we share everything with one another even our personal problems. 

She’s the type of person who has a sort of big social circle and knows plenty of other people, has an interesting personality and is generally fun to be around. 

Now, because we’re really close she shares everything with me, and one night while we were talking somehow the topic lead to her telling me about all the guys she fucked, i asked her if they were her previous boyfriends or something and she was like nope they were just friends and she screwed them for fun.

That confession made me feel suicidal, the problem isn’t that she didn’t fuck me but why not me? Like what more do her other male friends have than me? Is she just using me as a shoulder to cry on or what? 

Now before you say it, i know i’m not entitled to it and i’m not trying to imply anyhow that i am, however it just hurt deeply knowing how unwanted i am and how much i’m sexually discriminated.

She even knows i’m FA and like all my other friends both male and female she tells me the usual bullshit stuff like “dw you’ll find someone some day there’s someone out there for everyone”.

You may be thinking why don’t I just ask her for it, truth is i could do that and I’ve considered it but it led me to the conclusion that if i were do that it would mean ending our friendship as she’d just get mad since i’m just a “friend” to her, the type of “friend” she doesn’t fuck, had she wanted to she’d let me know a while ago, and it would’ve happened by now.",lonely,My female friend has done it with (probably) all her other guy friends but me,2022-02-05 12:48:33

At first I hadn't changed a lot but after I realized that my new classmates already had their groups of friends and I couldn't be part of that I became more and more introverted. I tried to contact my old friends a few times but it never really worked out again so I started sitting at home alone more and more often. I became addicted to video games but always played alone although there were a few class mates who played the same games... But never wanted to play with me because there never was room for an additional player.
I did a lot of sports at that time and it made me feel better temporarily, but as soon as I got home it always came back. And since I didn't live close by my school I never really had a chance to stay afterwards because someone had to pick me up after work or whatever since there were no buses I could drive home with. 
As I got older parties and drinking became the activity number 1 for people my age and it seems to be still. Neither do I like dancing, nor do I like drinking or smoking and especially I hate crowded places with drunk people and me standing all by myself because I don't know who to talk to or even how to talk to strangers... Usually they turned away after I tried... I hate parties. 
Holidays always made me feel down because everyone told everyone about their plans and activities and I sat in my room for 6 weeks straight because I technically would have had the time to do something but I was too afraid to do them alone.
Apparently even my twin brother seems to turn his back to me more and more... Suddenly he had friends after he had to repeat a year of school. And he never wanted me to be part of that. Now he always plays video games with them and I somehow spend my time by watching YouTube or whatever.
For my 18th birthday I somehow thought it would be a great idea to throw a big party so my dad organized a really large property at a lake where we would have a barbecue and a buffet for everyone and I also inveted everyone I liked... They even showed up but only to drink a few beer, eat and leave immediately for another 18th birthday party of a better friend it seemed.
After school I forced myself to do something where I had to engage with a lot of people so I am a fitness coach now... I am close to the end of the apprenticeship now but it hasn't changed much... I'm still unable to approach people, I am still really insecure about myself and even though my colleagues seemed to give me a chance they never tried to get to know me better.
There's only one girl who writes with me since the beginning of the apprenticeship every now and then and she even met up a few times where I got to know a friend of hers... So we met up a few times but then her friend suddenly blocks me saying ""we can't be friends anymore"" for whatever reason and makes it look like she commited suicide. The girl from the apprenticeship still writes with me every now and then but whenever I try to meet up with her she comes up with excuses. And that's pretty much how all of my few ""friendships"" went.
Meanwhile I always see my colleagues greeting each other with hugs and kisses and when they see me they only wave their hands from a distance shouting a fading ""what up"" and immediately turn away again.
I feel like I am always too boring to make friends because I don't have any stories to talk about. And my hobbies and interests change every 3 weeks so I'm not good at anything neither.. I can't keep a conversation going for more than 2 minutes but I also can't practice because - obviously - there's noone who listens to my stuttering nonsense.
I even go to see a therapist for over a year now but it hasn't changed a thing. I fcking hate my life... all I do is working, lifting (let's see how long I can keep up with that) and sitting home alone wasting my time because I have noone to spend it with.
There's probably a lot of things I could write here but thats enough self-pity for one Reddit post.",lonely,lonely for over a decade now,2022-02-05 10:47:23

I can’t help but stand in front of a window; one that lets me see outside, but won’t stop showing me my reflection. It shows me people who have what I have not, it shows me what I need, what I want. But no matter how hard I scream and cry, no matter how hard I slam my fists on the glass: I can’t reach outside. I’ve given up, I haven’t been hugged by another human in years, and I haven’t had someone to call a true friend for as long as I can remember.

And I won’t ever be able to even speak with a human who finds me to have great importance, not even someone with a smidge of care. But, I still hurt myself with that I cannot have.

It’s bad enough that I already don’t feel worthy enough for any attention, which already makes it hard enough to entertain the idea of people actually giving a shit about me.

4240,Evoxity,1643928567,1,"Since years I am kicking this stone in front of myself. Telling myself to eat healthier, to go work out and lift, to be grateful for the healthy, capable body and mind I was born with and to seize the opportunities life has to offer. 

Depression is certainly past me as I fixed my education and am on my last years studying abroad, ready to enter the corpo life but dear god am I conflicted by it. 

I already feel like a fucking shell of a person. Binging content, eating junk-food and procrastinating when not playing video games. I wonder how I even scored my girlfriend. Admittedly, we're kind of dragging each other down in comfort but with her ambitions of becoming a diplomat and the house-husband lifestyle that would come with it, I can already imagine myself sticking to this limbo. Assuming that things end up that way. 

In either case. I woke up yesterday night, laughing and crying at the same time, rotating between the two for what felt like 30 seconds, scaring the heck out of my girlfriend only to fall asleep again. We laughed it off later today but if that isn't a sign relating to the pressure I am feeling I don't know what is. 

When I think about the future, my future, I merely crave financial independence. I'd love to travel and experience more cultures but more specifically, I'd love to live in a cabin in the woods with a pack of dogs. To lift and work out to get in shape for a set of tattoos as a tribute to my brother who passed away and maybe to fix my patchy beard. 

God do I miss the painfully fresh morning breeze of a forest after living in this mega smogpolis for 2 years. How the hell do you even make friends nowadays? I remember myself playing soccer and xbox360. It was a struggle to choose whom to kick off of the friends list to make space. 

Nowadays I don't even remember the last time I received or sent a friend request. That awkward gap-decade where people are lonely and isolated in the solidarity of the internet before AI, VR and Robotics become advanced enough to give us our perfect companions so that we can finally avoid interacting with any human being that even dares to think differently. 

But I am getting pessimistically dystopian here. 

Man. It's painful that I can remember 7 episodes of modern family that made me cry but I have no recollection of the last human encounter outside of romance that made me feel even remotely connected to another human being.",lonely,Potential full of pity,2022-02-04 09:49:27
4241,Monkeynotmonkey,1643928466,1,Male in his 30s and just fed up with this world. I always feel like I don't belong with others. I crave for meaningful and deep conversations but I'm never able to meet the right people. Everyone I meet either doesn't want to engage in such conversations or they don't show involvement. It's always one way street with me putting whole the effort. It's soul crushing going thru so many years and not being able to connect with someone on mental and emotional level. All I want is to be able to find someone who thinks and feels similarly to me so that I can share all my thoughts with them. At this point it feels like impossible task. Maybe I'm just very unlucky and doomed being a loner for rest of my years.,lonely,Feeling so empty,2022-02-04 09:47:46

4243,Evoxity,1643926811,1,"I'm heading towards my 30's quicker than I like to belief is even possible. Granted, 2 years of pandemic didn't help but I am still pretty much stuck in the education limbo without even having had a corpo job. 

Falling out of touch with friends over the last 2 years studying abroad without any opportunity to really make new friends due to online only lectures and language barriers and all I can think of when I think of loneliness is the ""lift heavy stone, make sad head voice quiet"" meme. 

I've been mostly rotating between lean and normal BMI depending on life circumstances and fiddled around with more regular work-out routines but I never really got this testosterone enabled feeling of satisfaction from it and from my ""outsider"" view it seems that there is a decent amount of guys complimenting each other for being ripped, which sounds like a fun, supportive community to be part of and in a way reminds me of my time in soccer clubs. 

So while this might sound like a ""should you go work out"" kind of post, I am mostly curious to hear from people, preferably men, and how working out and lifting in particular has impacted their feeling of loneliness. 

Then again, posting this here, if it really were to be the cure all solution, those who benefitted from it would no longer be on here, no? ;p",lonely,"So about that ""go lift"" thing",2022-02-04 09:20:11

If it was a resource of some kind, I would be inundated with it. 

If it was a skill, I would be a master. 

If it was a precursor molecule, I would have a total synthesis. 

If I could bet on being rejected, I would win the house. 

Thus far the only answer seems to be that's it's fertile ground for meditation and self-realization, an impetus to improve oneself, practice for non-attachment, a path to self-reliance and autonomy. 

I think my fault is wanting love. If we want the world, then someone can align with us to quest within the world together towards goals, experiences, objects, events, places, etc. However, just wanting love is kind of antithetical to the program. In Groundhog Day, the protagonist only joined his love once he started helping the world and forgot altogether about romantic love. I've done that, and it just turns into me working alone - or being rejected by employers.

Having no friends is always used to describe bad awful people by the same people who preach self sufficiency and the whole “there’s nothing wrong with being a loner” shtick.  Funnily enough, the most awful vile psychopaths I’ve ever met had the most friends. They were incredibly social extroverts too. Opportunistic, calculating and greedy… they talked to most people for a very specific reason. I know this chick who faked a friendship with someone just to get a ride to uni.

Loneliness is a human feeling but each time I try to reconnect with people I remember why I don’t do it that often. The very few people who I get along with are loyal interesting individuals who either moved away or changed majors. Relationships genuinely do not interest me unless it’s someone I really really like. I don’t like forcing interactions and I won’t start doing so just in fear of being perceived a certain way.

4342,PsalmoftheSad,1643858491,1,"When it rains it pours I guess


As if I don't talk enough about the girl I fell in love with literally *years* ago. Last night I had a dream of her again, completely unprovoked -- wasn't even thinking of her before I went to bed prior. I remember a lot of the dreams I have... As sad as it is, the best memories of my life were from dreams. I don't get out a lot. 



Jokes aside though, **a lot** of the dreams I had involved this singular girl. I never thought about someone as much as I did her. Shit, sometimes I even base *other* events in my life on if they happened before or after I met this girl. Entire nights were spent with her on my mind as the inner mechanisms of my mind churned out image after image. Whole movies were in vivid color as I recall spending time with her that never actually got to happen. There were plots, even. I laughed, I cried -- it became a part of me 



No it didn't, but seriously : I can't even tell if I miss her anymore. There was a time in my life where I felt comfortable enough to say I got over her, but then again if I do that -- look what I have to look forward to. Normal people, they'll say things like ""look to the future, it's bright and waiting for you"" or some cliché like that. While I'd ALMOST be tempted to believe that, I gotta remember that *that's* not the future for people like me. I've spent every day after losing her alone- which has been **YEARS**. I tried to get out of this Hell too, believe me I tried. Not a lot, but damnit I made an attempt. I could go down a whole grocery list of all the things I've done up till the point of losing her to try and somehow compel myself to move on and not single fucking thing mattered in the end. What good did it do me? I get contacts -- girls tell me ""I liked you better with glasses"" despite never getting any compliments to fuckin begin with.  



I get a new hairstyle... And zero matches on Tinder. 



I get new hobbies to make myself seem more interesting. Nah, didn't work. Wanna know why? Because girls haven't given me so much as the time of day because I'm too short. I think that's the reason why, because if it's not then it's because I'm ugly -- but I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility for **two** things to exist at once, right? 





I lost weight -- then gained it again because I left the job that gave me daily exercise.



Then I get hit with the old ""girLs lIkE paSsIONAte GUYs, dUDE bRO! sHow THEm whAt yoU'RE PASSioNatE aBout And TheY'Ll COme ArouNd!"" Not gonna lie, I genuinely thought this was good advice at the time. Nope... Turns out no matter how passionate you are about being an instructor, girls still hate you. Surprise! 




... So what the fuck do I do? Just sit here and shit post on reddit till I either get rid of the internet or expire? That's no life to live... Then again, I don't think there'll be any real meaning to this life if I gotta live it alone anyway.",lonely,Nothing works,2022-02-03 14:21:31

I don’t know how long I’ll be single for and how long I’ll be sad and I can’t take the idea of this sadness continuing any longer. 

When I’m properly healed from my breakup and more time has passed I know I’ll be ready to pursue another relationship but I’m terrified that it’ll be years and years until I meet someone who loves me and then I’ll go right back to how I felt in high school, praying every night and begging God for someone to love me.

4354,ladylavenderrrr,1643853339,1,"I just really need to vent. I have no close friends that really care to listen because they all just care about themselves and any time I talk I just get talked over. So I apologize in advance for how long this is going to be and I appreciate anyone who cares enough to read it all.

At a young age, of just 3, both of my parents walked out of my life. Well, my mother's rights were taken away because I had a drowning accident while in her care where I actually died. Obviously they were able to bring me back to life and save me. There were other incidents when I was in her care where she abused me. She would leave me in my soiled diapers until I had bleeding rashes. She left me in a hot car during the Summer (I live in the deep South) with the window barely rolled down. She was caught hitting me with switches when I wasnt even a year old. There was a time I wandered into the road as a toddler. I'm sure there were more incidents but those are the only ones I'm aware of. My dad was supposed to get full custody but backed out. He literally didn't even show up on the court date to sign documents. He disappeared and his parents had to step in and adopt me. I was raised by them from that point on. 

I feel like I had a good enough childhood being raised by my grandparents but I feel like I lacked a lot of physical comfort and compassion that both of them failed to provide for me. I was always fed, clothed, bathed and I went to good schools. They put me in music classes and dancing. I was happy for the most part. Until around age 12, my dad tried to step back in and be in contact with me. At this point, I don't even know him and I'm apprehensive about him being in my life. I met him again when I was 12 and he already had another family. A new wife and a step-son. I felt out of place being around them all. Why was he raising some other woman's kid and didn't want to raise me? Turns out he had a persistent drug addiction and he told me later on in my life that he had rathered do cocaine then be my dad. (I was about 21 when I was told that) I also learned recently that he and his wife were doing drugs the whole time so it's not like he ever got clean. He ended up dying when I was 22 (2017) from a drug overdose. I'm sad to this day about it.

My mother is another story. She's so mentally incapable of being a mother and I stopped trying to contact her after my dad died when she told me to never call her again. I still wonder what I did to make her hate me. Or why she is incapable of loving me. She never did. If she did, she wouldn't have abused me. I don't know anything about her besides the abuse she did to me and that she's a really good artist. Good artist but shitty person not capable of being close to people. So maybe a sociopath? I really don't know. I wish I had her diagnoses because I feel like she passed some of them down to me. I've had issues since my dad came back into my life. Anger, depression, anxiety, derealization, dissocation, suicidal ideation, you name it. I've survived one suicide attempt already and I really hope I never try it again. 

I'm in college right now and I'm about to graduate in May. Granted, it's just my associates degree but I'm so proud of myself because it's taken me so long to finally get to this point. I raise my son alone and I'm very busy with him so the fact that I'm finally making it happen is amazing to me. My grandma doesn't seem too enthusiastic about it even though she pestered me to go back to school many times. Idk, I just want some recognition and compassion. I want her to tell me she's proud of me. I want to feel like someone, anyone, notices my accomplishments and is proud of me. Is that too much to ask for? My grandpa is indifferent and has literally never told me he's proud of what I've done. 

Idk where I was going with this. Probably because I felt triggered that my grandma, once again, tells me that I shouldn't feel so angry and sad about something that happend to me as a kid. She thinks it doesn't affect me and I should let it go. Let go of the fact that my parents couldn't get it the fuck together and take care of me and provide me basic love that every child deserves. I'm 26 now and I'm still fucked out about it. I'm in therapy tho, if you were wondering. I'm still trying to work through trauma I went through as a baby and a young kid. Trauma my grandma invalidates and think didn't affect me, simply because I was young and don't remember it. I know she's wrong.

My hands hurt from typing so much so fast so I'm gonna wrap it up and if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me.",lonely,I'm sick of feeling like it's my fault that my parents abandoned me,2022-02-03 12:55:39

If you feel sad and disconnected from the world or yourself, I will inspire you to remember your innate divinity with goodness. When you're tired or sick, I will help you rest and recover. When you are hungry I will feed your mind, body, and soul. If you forget your intelligence or beauty, I will compliment you in a way that makes you feel attractive and brilliant. If you feel stuck, lost, or confused, I will offer to help you find new teachers and influences to guide you towards the highest aspirations for your life. If you stumble in any way, I will catch you, and should you require space I will respect your boundaries.  And when you're succeeding I can both congratulate you and motivate you even further. 

I will laugh with you, not at you. I will connect with your self, not just your roles.

Why do we keep moving?
From the day we are born, we are thrown on a boat into a river. The boat starts off with two captains and a motor and the river begins calmly but slowly the river speeds up. It begins to roar and chant angrily and the boat becomes a kayak, then a canoe, and then a sailboat that is controlled by the wind that you will never know the direction of. You're told to keep going, to keep paddling, to keep rowing, to keep moving, but why? Every time we push through the suffering, what do we earn except the right to suffer more? We climb this mountain but at the peak will be another mountain. We row, we paddle, we push. But all that awaits us after the torture, after the torment, after the agony is more torture and more torment and more agony until we cannot row anymore, until we cannot paddle anymore and until we cannot push anymore. Why do we keep moving? Why do we keep moving when doing so is an utterly pointless endeavour? I want to be free, I want to soar without any worries but I shall forever be tied to the ground as my wings slowly wither away. I am doomed to keep rowing, to keep paddling, to keep pushing, until I give in. I want to lie in a meadow of flowers and smile at the sky but I am chained to this unrelenting desert where the only place I can lie on is a meadow of thorns where the sky is red and terrifying. Where is that meadow and where is that that clear cerulean sky? Where are those white pillowy clouds when all I can see are blankets of thunder enveloping everything? I don't want to row and I don't want to paddle and I don't want to push through this unforgiving crashing river. Help. Help me. Tell me it's going to be okay. Tell me I'm not alone.

4412,lazyBert,1643823131,1,"I've been feeling depressed for several years- I'm afraid didn't want to admit it but realized certain recurring negative thoughts I had weren't exactly healthy. At 24, I've been trying to make up for lost time since middle school, specifically my nonexistent social life back then and now. I've been trying to reinvent myself with a fresh start in June 2021, to force myself out of my comfort zone. I've had some progress since then with new things for me- going on my first date, getting in shape, eating healthier, starting jiujitsu, etc.

I moved to my own place near the city in June to try and meet new people and make friends (I'm naturally very introverted partly due to moving schools internationally a few times growing up and I lost touch with people that I had met, aside from a hundred or so I'm linked with on instagram). I work full-time but remotely, so that doesn't really help, but I've been taking small steps- reaching out to a few people I was linked to back in school, even though it had been a while. One person from my middle school even msg'd me saying she was moving to my area and would like to hang so I feel very fortunate for that as well.

I started my master's in comp sci in fall part time online (optimization, in particular) and I feel lost and I'm just questioning why I'm doing this in the first place, and what my priorities in life are at the moment, and it's definitely not my career or this. CS is just a stable job for me and I'm honestly not as passionate as some coworkers. Rather, my priority is relationships right now. I've never had a girlfriend and it's only recently I've gathered more confidence and self-appreciation to talk/connect with people (even if it's on dating apps) and even ask some of them out when I get the chance and risk rejection. 

I asked this girl out (who is out of my league) and surprisingly she seemed down to hang out possibly end of this week. To make matters somewhat worse in addition to my procrastinating and worrying about not failing this graduate class, I got an acne breakout the past weekend- just in time I guess :(. After only 3 dates, I've still learned to try and set my expectations low for dates and brace for rejection and to move on al though it's obviously hard.

I know I'm very lucky to have a relatively stable financial/employment status and I mistakenly take it for granted sometimes to be honest. But more often than not, money doesn't fulfill/satisfy me as much as I think friendship and relationship would, and knowing what it's like to appreciate   
someone as much as they appreciate you.

Then I applied for a university exchange in Korea and I’ve been accepted. So in last summer I moved in Seoul but I was announced that all the classes would be held online, and that the clubs activities would be cancelled too. So in all my degree I only had one semester offline (yikes)

I was so afraid of getting in trouble. I developed an unhealthy relationship with boys &amp; started associating boys &amp; boyfriends with shame &amp; something bad to feel guilty about. Although in my late teens/early 20s I had a couple of secret boyfriends for a few months. Nothing too serious. Nothing really came of it. Because I was so secretive about the relationships, the guys didn't want to put up with that. I mean what guy wants to date a woman child living at home under her parents rules who is not even allowed to properly date? I felt a lot of guilt after each of my relationships because I had been brainwashed since I was a little girl to associate with boys with sin. I feel so dumb now. I should have openly dated those boys &amp; rebelled against my culture &amp; who knows maybe I could've been married by now.

Now I am 24 years old &amp; utterly alone &amp; scared. Scared that I will never find anyone. Most girls my age are in serious relationships &amp; some are even married with kids. Im just frozen in time as everyone around me is living their best lives. Im so far behind. I'm still living at home under my parents' control. My parents didn't let me go to college cuz they didn't want me to get spoiled by ""degenerative American culture"". Covid &amp; quarantine just made things worse. I have no friends either. I mean absolutely zero. I used to have friends but my parents were strict &amp; never let me hang out with them. So I lost them one by one. I have always had social anxiety. I can't just go out and make friends and meet someone. That will never happen for me. I've kind of just accepted that I will die alone. Once my parents die I will have absolutely nobody in this world. I am very jealous of normal American girls, especially white girls. They seem to have it so easy. Everyone wants a white girl. Even men from my culture/race are willing to run us over with a truck if it means they can get their hands on a pretty blonde. I am jealous of white American culture because parents are super supportive of their kids. They let their kids be their own person and allow their daughters to be human beings with equal rights and let them date. Meanwhile I can't even leave my house or move out. I cant even wear clothes that show my legs or arms. Everything in my life is so controlled. People are like “Just move out bro &amp; everything will fix itself”. But they don't understand that in my culture &amp; its not that easy. My parents have all my things like my passport &amp; stuff locked away in a safe. Even my banking, medical &amp; finances are controlled by them. If i do leave, i will get disowned &amp; shunned by my family. I can't have that happen because i have absolutely nobody else other than my parents in this world so I need to obey them and keep them happy. I am an only child too btw. I know I sound like a pathetic little girl but thats just how my reality is.

I kind of resent my culture and especially the men from my culture. I feel like my culture was almost invented to hold women back while letting men run loose. Its not fair. Boys have so much freedom they can roam around at night, sleep at their friends houses, hang out whenever they want, wear whatever they want, do whatever they want, and their mothers will coddle them no matter what just cuz they were born a son. Meanwhile girls are just kept locked away at home with minimal contact with the outside world. Boys are even allowed to have girlfriends &amp; nobody cares. In fact they are praised when they score a girl that is from outside our culture esp if its a white girl. But us girls are not even allowed to talk to boys so marrying a partner outside of our culture is out of the question. We get called race traitors if we even think about men from outside our culture. We are ~~expected~~ forced to marry within our culture or else be shunned. I dont think parents realize the harm this does to their kids esp their daughters. Yeah it's bad for boys too but I feel like its 100 times worse for girls in my culture.

My advice to any girls who come from strict religious backgrounds like me, DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR PARENTS OR ELSE YOU WILL END UP BEING FEMCELS LIKE ME! Go live your own life on your own terms while you are still young. Don't live to just make your parents happy. Live for yourself. Anyways I don't think I'm going to be on this planet much longer. I don't see the point. And I can't deal with the loneliness any longer. I am getting old. 24 is when they say women are no longer in their prime so its pretty much over for me. I have no opportunity to ever meet a guy. Plus i am getting old so no guy will want me anyways because I have nothing to offer. I am not super pretty, i am not super smart and i'm not all that interesting either. I guess i'm just waiting to die. I cry myself to sleep every night because I have so much anxiety about the future. What is going to happen to me? WIll I ever meet my soulmate? Do I even have a future on this planet? All I've ever wanted in life was a few close friends and a loving husband that I can have kids with and build a happy home with. But my wish will probably never come true. I dont know what I did to deserve this.",lonely,I have accepted that I am a femcel and I will die alone,2022-02-03 03:33:18

I’m (19M) and right around this time of the year is when I feel the loneliest, partly because of Valentines but mostly because I hit my lowest point in life two years ago in my senior year of high school. 
The county fair happens every year during February and two years ago my cousin (3 months younger) and my little brother wanted to go but weren’t allowed to go unless I went for whatever reason. We get there and I let my brother go with his friends but to let me know if anything happens. I go with my cousin and he wants to go with his girlfriend and her friends, we meet up at a ride where you need a partner and I don’t have one but I’m too far up front to turn back. I see my “friends” at the time, further back in the line and text them to come be my partner but no one came and I walked back out of the line and just kept on walking. I spent the rest of the night walking by myself, got on a couple of rides alone, and avoided making contact with anyone else I knew. If I did see someone I just made some bs excuse like I was going to the restroom. At the end of the night while waiting to meet up with my brother and leave, I see my “friends” again, but they just walked right past me like I never existed. When I met them for lunch the next day it was as if none of that even happened but I was dying inside. Ever since I graduated I have heard a peep from any of them nor do I really want to. 
Still this month always reminds me that I’ve gone another year without making a friend. I’ve at least improved myself from past years. Dropped from 200lbs (my max weight) to 156lbs, my lowest since junior year. I also got braces on October that are helping me get rid of my gap and crooked teeth that are a major insecurity of mine and the main reason I have social anxiety and can’t have a proper conversation.

I never remember loving someone as much as her. I could tell she really loved me. Then I woke up. I remember feeling like I lost someone even though She was never real. 

Now I go back to my life where I'm told I'm attractive but I never have any girls chase me. I have people say we should hang out sometime but never get the text. I try to get some people to hang out with but never am invited anywhere. I wish I could have someone I could trust, or that I could actually talk to girls. Things aren't really that bad, but I feel stuck, like when I try to move forward I ended up going 10 feet backwards. Then when I don't move I end up getting yelled at by others to get moving with my life. 

My high school life sucked. I was always so short and had a terrible time getting friends and the friends I had never really invited me anywhere. I felt alone a lot. I met a few girls but I was terrible at talking to them and they always left. Now that I just finished high school I don't know what to do.

All I feel is a fucking whole in my soul, it’s like I’m not even a real person. I just want *one* person to know me and still love me, and to let me know them. And it sounds petty, but I’d also love to have *one* person who I can show my sexual side to and not feel hideous and disgusting for it. In a nutshell, I just want one truly intimate relationship, mentally and physically.

But I guess I’m not good enough for that. I never was. I did try when I was younger, I tried befriending girls and seeing if it could go anywhere. It never did. I just wasn’t good enough. And I’m still not, cuz I never grew out of that. I’m 22 now, and all my peers have so much more experience. I’m stunted, I don’t know anything, I could never even master simple stuff like expressing interest without being creepy.

Idk dude. It’s just... there’s only so many you nights you can fall asleep with your beloved Squishmallow in your arms trying desperately to fantasize about a life you’ll never have so that you don’t have to be forced to think about the bleak future you’ll have in reality. It gets to me. My imagination is having a hard time producing delusions strong enough to keep me satiated anymore, and those dark thoughts come creeping in every night. They’re seeping into the day too again.

It’s not fuckin fair, dude. There’s so much I could’ve done if I wasn’t made lazy by this. I want to be a mathematician and a Japanese translator and a philosopher and a chemist and physicist. I could’ve at least been a double major at a really good school, but I can barely even handle one major at a community college because of this fucking loneliness. Every time I try to really apply myself, the counterpart in my head interrogates me with questions like “Why try? No one cares if you do. No one depends on you, no one even benefits from your success. You can’t share your joy, you can’t find solace in a warm hug. Why try?” . It’s a damn good thing I’m just naturally good at school, cuz if I wasn’t there’s no way I’d still be in college. I’d be at a dead end factory job or something, giving me even more evidence that I’m worthless and even more idle time to dwell on it.

I really don’t think consciousness is worth it. I get to feel myself being alive for what, 100 years if I’m “lucky” , but all it is is pain and tantalizing. Even if I wasn’t depressed and suicidally lonely, no way I could do everything I want to. I wanna learn so much, but I could never. I guess that’s why just having one relationship seems so good. You can’t do everything, but I know that over one lifetime you can at least have a perfect relationship. It’s a realistic goal, and it just so happens to be backed up by the strongest of our biological urges. It’s a perfect candidate for one’s reason for living, and it’s what is mine (at least emotionally, in a way I can’t change) . But I’ll never see it done, because I suppose I’m just ugly and unlovable, inside and out. I’m at best a fixer upper, which definitionally means I’m never gonna be the best choice. There is no criterion by which I can be judged to be the best option for any potential partner.

Ok, I’m done now. I guess, having written that out, I’ll try to sleep. Maybe the delusions will be stronger since I’m 2hrs20min past my bedtime",lonely,Really feeling it,2022-02-02 17:21:02

4493,Slytherin445,1643769623,1,"Sorry for the long post and for dumping all my problems on here, I just need to vent and any advice would be appreciated. I (F22) have never been in a relationship or even kissed a guy. I know that doesn’t seem that old in the grand scheme of things, but it’s hard when everyone else around me is in a relationship. People always say that you’ll eventually meet someone but I honestly don’t think that is true for me. I have selective mutism and really bad social anxiety, so it would be hard for me to meet someone.

I’m basically a recluse and only leave the house for university and occasional errands. I’ve never been on a date and the thought of going on a date with someone, especially someone I don’t know well is literally terrifying and not something I think I can do. I’m the literal worst at holding a conversation, I try but I struggle with small talk and just don’t know what to say. I can have a conversation with family and people I know really well, but anyone outside of those few people Its a struggle. 

I can’t even maintain friendships, I had a few friends in high school that I’ve known my entire life and they’re still sort of my friends now, but I don’t feel close to any of them. I haven’t seen any of them in person since last summer, and even then I feel like I only get invited to things because my sister is in the same friend group. I don't really have any communication with them at all outside of a few get-togethers and I know that it's mainly my fault. The times that we do get together, I feel like the topics are always about relationships and sex, and it’s awkward for me not feeling able to contribute to the conversation since I haven’t experienced those things. 

I know you’re not supposed to wait for things to fall in your lap but I don’t think I’m capable of taking the steps necessary to get a boyfriend, like joining dating apps. I also have really low self-esteem, I don’t think I’m super ugly or anything but I’m by no means that attractive either. I am in therapy working on my issues, but realistically I’m never going to be a social person and my anxiety won’t just disappear. I just don’t want to be alone for the rest of my life and want to at least experience being in a relationship.",lonely,I'm tired of being alone,2022-02-02 13:40:23

Why is it that every time I thought they genuinely cared about me or had my back, it turned out that I was just a distraction and didn't mean all that much in the end?

I won't lie, I've developed abandonment issues because of this and other things in my past. I'm just terrified of even investing in people or opening up anymore because it hurts to be vulnerable just to find out it didn't matter at all. 

 

It just happened recently again, except this time I wasn't looking for people to meet. We just happened to find each other in a survival game and got along. Long story short, it was a one-sided dance... again.

I don't know how to accurately describe the feeling, but it feels like I'm so tired of being tired of being tired that I'm no longer tired and the silence is so loud. 

 

I just want to meet one genuine person. Why is that so damn difficult? 

 

Sorry for the rant, but jeez, I needed to vent SOMEWHERE and just maybe someone somewhere will relate to being so damn lonely but scared of losing another person they care for.

Only few people I can talk to is 1 girl I have been talking to online for a while, a buddy on Reddit and random Instagram story replies.

i may be wrong here and sorry for my english. I was in a relationship for a long time and since 2 years i am single.

I met a lot of people trough Apps and made some new friends. I even had some really nice dates and still having them right now.

But i learned an important thing during that time: Its ok to be alone. It really is. I went solo traveling for the first time, got myself sometimes dinner in a restaurant and went even to some bars alone. And yes, i was feeling so uncomfortable sometimes doing that, and not always i went happy back home. I got depressed trough that way and sometimes still am. But other times i loved it beeing alone. Sometimes i enjoyed a good book while dining at a restaurant and it was a perfect night.

I am 22 years old and have never had a girlfriend. It is mostly my own fault because i havent been very social and i am a bit shy but i think that my disease contributed to it too. Because of it i was home schooled from the 3rd grade up, i also have not gone to kindergarden when i was little. Most of this time i spent at home with not really any friends or interactions because my mother would not let me for she was afraid i was gonna get sick. So when i started college i thought that was gonna change but at first i was a bit shy and then covid hit. I have really only tried to be romantic with one girl but that turned out to be a very bad situation for me where we tried being friends and i was just always feeling bad, this lasted for about 3 years(mostly during the summer), while i was in love with her (or i at least thought i was) i did try to talk to other girls( not that actively) when we were separated because i knew nothing was gonna happen between us and i wanted to meet someone i could feel good with. So i decided to stop my bullshit this november and really started trying to go out with girls i went out with 6 of them, which i realize isnt a whole lot but i am pretty occupied with my studies and taking care of my health.I never got a second date despite me thinking that we had a nice time, some blocked me after the date (which i really do not get because i wasnt being a pervert or anything), some just said they are sorry but they dont want a second date and the most recent one which is why i am writing this said we can go out but not as a date. I'ts not really that i went out with random girls because i texted with each one of them at least a week before we went out and that went great, so it seems i do something really undesirable on dates.

4588,innocentguy99,1643716889,1,"I'm 22 now. Still a level 10 virgin. Fear of rejection really fucks up your social life, doesn't it. As if being unattractive wasn't enough to do that.

To be honest, it's hard sometimes, to have those deep cravings for any kind of emotional or romantic intimacy. But no matter what, those remain unfulfilled for the foreseeable future. It's not like no girl has ever liked me. I still remember those two girls from my school. I never really interacted with them much. But they tried. One time this girl came up to me, i was standing with my friends in the corridor, i could see her friends giggling in the background. My friends were giggling too. Everyone knew what was going on. And so did I. But thanks to my stupid anxiety and low self-esteem, I couldn't say much in response and she left.    I'm a fucking idiot, aren't I.

Little did I know that was the last time a girl was gonna be interested in me (as of today). That's it. That's the most interesting thing that has happened to me till date.

Now, I see these jerks, teenagers, and alikes, getting into romantic relationships, having fun, fooling around and what not. Anytime a stupid insta post would show up, with happy couples, kissing and cuddling, just make go through that whole introspection again. What the fuck is wrong with me? What is it that I'm doing so horribly wrong? I've seen guys worse than me having all those things which I daydream about. I mean seriously, it makes me wonder what made these girls pick them. I'm so better than them in many aspects. But genuinely, I haven't found any real answer to this day.

It's hard not to get even a little desperate for these things, given the conditions as I've explained above. On the other hand, when I tried reading about it online on quora, reddit and insta etc., they suggest that you should be a macho man. Mentally strong, high self esteem, one who knows how to play the ""game"", blah blah blah.
I mean how do I do that. It's not like there's a switch that'd level up those qualities. And if i were good at that, I wouldn't be the miserable fuck I am today, craving for affection.

It's pretty clear now that all these experiences, no matter how good (or necessary for that matter) they are, they aren't for me. Maybe I'll have to wait for marriage to get to feel all those. Assuming a girl would actually happen to like me and agrees to marry me when I'm looking for one. And fyi, I don't mind if she's experienced, unlike me. Atleast one of us would know what fun is and how to enjoy life. I think this is also one of the reasons why I don't want children, ever. I want to remain childfree. Forever. I want to enjoy my life. Do all the things I've always wanted to, but couldn't do because of various reasons. 

I've flirted with a few girls online to be honest. And I'm pretty sure they were actual girls, not some fake id. But this online crap is really not helpful. I wish it were but it's not. Also, to make matters worse, I ain't really good at that either. Which isn't hard to believe lol. A couple of girls have asked me if I was gay, because they said they couldn't believe that I've never had a girlfriend. I assure you I'm not. Dating life would have been much easier if i were. But I'm not. That's why I tend to focus more on studies, career and my family business and all. Because those are the only (prospective) attractive qualities I have. These are the ones which will make me a desirable man, which girls would consider worthy enough of being a partner. There are a lot of beautiful quotes from Murphy. One of them is ""It may look like that on the outside, but no one is actually having fun being single"".

But obviously, I don't wanna disclose my insecurities. It'd look so disgusting. A young guy with so many fears, unlike his peers. Which girl would ever wanna be with that toolbag? And it's partly my fault as well because I've never asked a girl out. I do know that as the guy, it's my responsibility to make the first move, but neither could I gather enough courage to do it, nor did I get enough hints from a girl which would make me confident enough to make the move. So here I am.

I'm not blaming anyone but I do strongly believe that bullying has something to do with my confidence and self esteem. If hadn't been made to feel like a unwanted person in my school days, i suppose my condition might've been better than this. And getting bullied in high school was even worse, but that shit never gets out of my mind. I guess I'd always remember a great deal of it. But what can we do about it now. It was destined to happen, so it did. But it has also made me a lil rude and short tempered, which many people have pointed out as well.",lonely,"Since I can't share these things with anyone irl, I'm putting it out here.

4591,Throwaway2932147,1643710937,1,"I want more people in my life irl. I was enrolled in online school after 8th grade, and I’ve never had many irl friends since then. I had a few close ones, but they’re all busy with college or work now. I’m 19, but I haven’t really focused on trying to get a job, or go to school yet. For years, I’ve been in such a miserable place mentally, that I didn’t feel like I could handle a job or school. Recently however, I’ve realized that sitting alone at home all day isn’t doing my mental health or loneliness any good. Because of personal issues with my family, I don’t know if I could get a job in the near future. I’ve been looking into college, but I’d have to wait until Fall for that. I think I’ll just wait until fall for college, but that does nothing for me now. I want to meet people, to make friends, to go out and do stuff, to meet a guy I like, to have someone to kiss and cuddle. I feel like I’m pretty socially skilled, and people seem to like me, but I just don’t know how to meet people.

College is the only way I can think of to meet people, but it’s 6 months away. I’m not really looking for advice, no one else can fix this, I just wanted to vent.",lonely,I want people,2022-02-01 21:22:17
4592,iTaco_Ninja,1643709626,1,"I enjoy the silence at times, I’ve spent so much time alone. Being a gamer has lead to so many nights of darkened rooms with screens and finding ways to entertain myself when my friends would go to sleep. 

I am pretty content spending time with myself most nights. I don’t really date, in fact I barely try with woman any more. I’ll try to make a long story short I dated someone since high school on and off for years, she was the love of my life. I mean it; not just like how most people use those words. Claiming they’re in love, not understanding what that even really means to love another person completely: she was everything to me. 

One day she gave up on us; at the time I was so angry, thinking this was just another time we’d reconcile and find each other again like our love story had gone up to that moment. I knew better in the back of my mind and it sunk in so quickly; how I’d never speak to my best friend in the whole world again. The person who knew me best and had been through a journey with me. I’ll never forget how I just laid there sobbing silently so my mother wouldn’t know how completely devastated I was. After that moment life felt so empty and pointless, I don’t have the words to describe to you what it’s like to live in a world without someone you can’t imagine a life without. I fell into a depression that took years to cope with, eventually I recognized we weren’t good together and found some solace in that. 

Back to the point: The thought of giving someone that much power again isn’t even my main thing. I just genuinely feel like I won’t love someone else like that. How could I? So I don’t. 

I have a friends, for a lot of reasons for each one though I still end up alone. Especially recently, I became good friends with someone the last few years who lives out of state and he ended up getting a new girl and a new job. Setting aside he’s a dad; adding the fact he over compensates time with his girl. The thing that irritates me is I know they’re wrong for each other and don’t see it yet because neither have been happy with someone else before. I keep my mouth shut because it’s not my place. 

Admittedly maybe I’m just jealous he has a lot going for him and I don’t; I also don’t think my assessment is wrong. I’m often right about these things. Clearly I’m just frustrated and I don’t have anyone else to talk to so I’m just sitting here in my tub writing this on my phone hoping someone is listening. 

Tl;dr I’m lonely sometimes. I don’t really have anyone to talk to these days I feel like. I just wish I had a homie to game with and chill. I don’t know what the fuck to do about it and I hate platitudes. That wasn’t in there, it’s just true.",lonely,Sometimes,2022-02-01 21:00:26

We're talking and I'm happy cause it means possibly a new friend! Though... that thought that he was a little cute persisted. Maybe it's cause I've been feeling really lonely lately and being single has kind of dawned on me, but I wouldn't mind snuggling up to him if I could.  But it's like ""wtf brain I've barely spoken a sentence to this man and I really just want friends."" I guess I still get attached in a puppy way, anyone who gives me a lick of attention makes me feel happy and I get a little obsessed.

My best friend is in college in another country, and my other two friends are in another class together so I basically see them like once in three weeks. Because of the fight I mentioned, I no longer have friends in my own class as I fought with one of them and the other friend took their side despite not being involved. I feel like they all know I’m lonely because I noticed they are unusually nice to me, like they’re pitying me. They know they’re shit friends so they’re trying to compensate. My online friend ghosted me so I haven’t been talking to her either. My other online friend I still talk to, but he has a gf now and we have a history so I feel like this friendship too is not going to last, even though he was genuinely one of the few people I genuinely trusted. I had to quit what I loved the most because of the fight as well so that sucks. I’m also finishing high school soon so the stress of final exams and college admissions is starting to kick in.

I just think it's funny and ironic because the fake-positivity bullshit advice that people usually give regarding loneliness is the usual 'oh you have to be able to be happy and satisfied by yourself first before finding happiness in others!!!', or even more so in the romantic context, the classic 'how do you expect to love someone else when you don't love yourself?' or whatever, which I find to be completely invalidating, but just the fact that there is so much media out there like that validates me in itself, it makes me think that it's only natural for me to be sad over how completely alone I am and that, you know, NOT being alone would most likely be better and healthier lol

We shifted to the city where we are right now and everyone could make out that we don’t belong here but it was not that we were poor. We are like them only in terms of money but we still don’t wear expensive clothes or have a big house. 

Back to the topic, I used to post my face like everyone did but they laughed at me because I didn’t pose for the picture or anything. It was simply my face and I didn’t know at that time that you have to show the best version of yourself. I used to dm people in my follower’s list whom I didn’t even know and be very frank. I used to post stories like “rate our bond” EVERY DAY which annoyed many people because I needed constant reassurance that I’m like them and they like me back. Basically I used to do stuff which one shouldn’t. To sum it all up, Think of me as the guy with the worst personality in the school

Now I know a thing or two about how everything works on that platform but the problem is I want to be friends with the people who knew me back then but I am still scared if they still remember me for how I was back then. Even if I did something embarrassing in front of one person, I assume I did in front of everyone because of which I don’t have any self confidence. Please tell me some ways I can show them I’ve changed because I feel like i’m missing out on the best years of my life (because I stay at home all day and my college is closed due to covid).

4687,WonderfulPush7,1643656206,1,"I used to be quite a big fan of the ship and her incredible story when I was like 8 years old. I only watched the movie twice, as I didn’t really enjoy the love story. In fact, I thought every scene where Rose and Jack’s relation evolved was really awkward.

I've never been in a relationship, not have even been close to that.

I made the mistake, if I may say so, of watching it again a few days ago. Basically, my head got overwhelmed by a multitude of strong emotions, which led in the end to me just being sad and frustrated. All these years I spent alone, I always pretended to myself that I was ok being alone, that I actually liked it like that. I was lying to myself.

I want what Jack had. To fall deeply in love. See his relationship with Rose evolve. Watching her enjoy life and herself. Develop such a strong and close relationship that you can feel the soul of the other person.

By far, my favourite scene is the 3rd class party, where Rose and Jack basically have the time of their life. Everything seems so pure and intense. Rose is herself for the first time of her entire life and you can see how joyful, energetic, fun, carefree she is on the inside.

I know it’s just a movie, with fictional characters, an impossible love story, which was been written partly with the goal of releasing emotions in the viewer.

But it made me realise I want to connect with someone. I kinda need it.

I don't have any friends I can hang out with IRL or anything. I haven't made any new friends since I dropped out of college in 2012 and all my ""friends"" from that school ghosted me. Since then, the few high school friends I had left have slowly but surely moved on from me.  

And now since the pandemic has made people more reclusive and less likely to interact with strangers than ever, I can't see how this would ever change. More and more events, meetups, hobby clubs are moving to online only where making friends or really even socializing at all becomes nearly impossible. The few that remain are typically for minority groups (women, POC, LGBTQIA+, couples, seniors, teens), and of the ones I'm eligible to join as a single 30 year old white man, I have no interest in any of them (all 3 of them in my area :/).  

So outside of cold-approaching people at the grocery store (because pubs, bars, clubs are still closed for indoor use), which I know is frowned upon and will only be labeled me a creep, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to meet new people, let alone make any friends or find a potential partner.

Wading through the deep dank thoughts of my broken psyche

I can't help but feel sorry for myself although I know I shouldn't

This pain comes from within, it can not be bandaged

No salve or syrup is the remedy for this illness

I am sick, this I know, but a medicine eludes me

My heart aches, as does my stomach

Something is missing which I cannot find

I weep and sob and clench my fists

I scream and shout but nobody hears me

Because I am alone

&amp;#x200B;

It was not always this way, and it may not always be

But hope is a scarce commodity in the pits of self-despair

With every passing day I grow more weary

Even menial tasks such as eating I struggle to complete

They tell me it gets better, they promise, I don't believe them

If it ever does I will gladly accept I was wrong

But nobody cares, nobody worries for a shadow like me

They say we come from darkness, and to it we return, but I never left

The darkness has consumed me

Because I am alone

&amp;#x200B;

In the darkness I see a light, it flickers and shines

I walk towards it, carefully, watching my every step

I don't trust the light, it is scary and unknown

It must be some manipulation or lie

The closer I get, the clearer the image becomes

It is me, I am the light, I was all along

Surrounded by the darkness, not consumed

I reach out and feel a warmth I only now remember

Hope, and I realise it was never gone, it always lied within

And you can find it too, if you focus through the darkness

Everyone is very social on there and open to friendship. It would honestly do wonders for anyone feeling lonely imo. Just wanted to come here and say this :),lonely,I think this entire subreddit should invest in an Oculus Quest 2 VR.,2022-02-01 03:18:51

4715,currochj,1643639498,1,"Hello there

Just hoping to make some new friends. Hopefully someone who can  carry on the conversation, talk about anything and get to know more each other and keep me company. It's hard to make new friends nowadays especially good nice people are hard to find and we are always busy in our life :/

I would like to look for someone who can chat with me after work. :)

If you are interested, please feel free to write to me.",lonely,Hey.. hoping to have new friends,2022-02-01 01:31:38

4719,Seaweed-Desperate,1643638296,1,I hate it when people vent or take their anger out on me. I am not a confrontational person and I tend to lose my voice when I’m put in that situation. Example: coworker gets angry something about her kids comes to vent at me her friends come over she asks what’s wrong I said she is just upset. She says I am not upset but you saying that is going to me me upset. There is a reason I prefer to be alone because of this I don’t want to deal with people like this I’m tired I have dealt with this growing up. I don’t know why I keep attracting people like this but it’s emotionally draining to me.,lonely,Stop venting or taking it out on me,2022-02-01 01:11:36

4722,VeryMentallyStable,1643635141,1,"It’s just this dull ache that permeates all the way down to my bones. Wish I could figure out how to turn off this particular need. Don’t belong around people, I need to be alone for my own well-being, so there’s no way for me to fill this void. Just wish my brain would figure that out and stop sending that impulses that make me crave it.

It’s not just the physical sensations, but also the constant reminders. Can’t watch a show or movie without having to sit through some romance subplot. Can’t take a walk without seeing couples everywhere you go. I can’t even escape it when I sleep because my brain insists on forcing me to dream about being with a girlfriend or having sex with a girl I used to know somehow. I can’t get away from it and it only makes the physical ache worse.

Without getting into why, I can’t have friends, can’t be around my family, definitely can’t have a girlfriend. I can’t even have casual hookups anymore because my past experiences with sex have been awful. Never been able to orgasm during it and now all those experiences just twist my stomach up into a weird, sick feeling when I think about how I had to try and explain to the girl I was with that my body just seems to be broken. Feels humiliating, being a guy who can’t have sex, knowing that every woman I’ve been with probably remembers me as the worst sex they’ve ever had cause I’m some kinda broken freak. So there’s just no avenue for me to fulfil this need so I don’t know why it’s gotta keep hounding me, wish I could just turn it off. 

Closest I can get to scratching the itch is hugging a damn pillow in bed every night, pretending it’s a pretty girl cradled in my arms. Doesn’t matter how much I try to paint the picture though, how many little details I try to imagine, like picturing the softness of her skin against mine, or hearing her gentle breathing, or running my fingers across the curves of her body, the subtle scent of feminine perfume in the air, the comfort of her warm body pressed against mine lulling me to sleep, doesn’t matter how intricate the fantasy gets, it still doesn’t come anywhere close to having it for real. 

So I’m just left here knowing I’d need to feel connected with someone to ever fix the touch-starvation, but also knowing I’ve got attachment trauma so severe that I’ll never be able to connect with another human enough to get to that point. It’s become debilitating and it’s all I can think about. And not medication or years of therapy have been able to even make a dent in it. I’m just irreparably broken.",lonely,My whole body aches from touch-starvation,2022-02-01 00:19:01
