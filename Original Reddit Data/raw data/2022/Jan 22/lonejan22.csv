But I usually get some serotonin feeling whenever I see a reddit notification in my bar, or one from a dating app. It's always especially a pleasant surprise if it's a DM, or on discord if it's a mentioning of my username. 

It's honestly probably a problem and unhealthy. Sometimes I even *save* certain notifications for later. Like if I see i got a DM I may wait a bit to open it. Like if I wake up in the morning and have a lot, ill save a dm or dating app message for last.

41,PigsEatWaffles,1643604756,1,"I’m  btw. I’ve felt lonely for a while, lost my friends, hate how I look. I held a knife to my throat 3 weeks ago, mad at myself for the way that I am, but I pussied out. I saw that she kept on trying to follow me on Instagram. I went ahead and directed my anger towards her in a self-deprecative type way asking what the hell she wanted to do with me. 

She knew I was hurting. Kept trying to get me to open up, tell her what’s wrong. The thing is it’s hard to trust people when you think everyone’s against you. I opened up some, she says she’ll be there for me, that she can hold me. Said she knows what I’m going through, the loneliness and the hopelessness. 

I was gonna hang out with her today at the park. Her mom was mad at her for coming home late last night so that didn’t happen. 

I hate the way I think:
I wanna fully trust her like she says I can but I don’t. I think she’s lying to me. I think she’s trying to get at me to embarrass me. It annoys me that she takes for ever to respond when I have all the time in the world to respond fast. I feel like she doesn’t have a enough time for me. I’m afraid that I’ll do or say one thing and that’s it. I’m scared I’m uninteresting or boring. I think I’m gonna lose her again. But it’s bs and I know it’s not true but I just have trouble believing it. 

I know we have a lot in common. Love the same music, have similar dreams, share similar hobbies. I texted her on and off during online school in 2020 and 2021. Then we drifted away from each other. I’m here now thinking what the hell does she want to do with some lonely freak like me. She has a mass of great friends, and she decides to dedicate some of her time to a waste of space like me. 

I want to improve my social skills. I have trouble saying hi, at least she always does it first in school for me. I wish we hung out more but I just don’t know how to ask without seeming like a creep. I do have a crush on her, but Ik that’s just born out of my lack of human interaction. I just don’t want to lose her making mistakes and I want to keep her as a friend even if I am a mess.",lonely,I started talking to a friend again recently but I feel just as shitty as before,2022-01-31 15:52:36

54,rabbidbeare,1643600204,1,"Let me give a little bit of background - So I’m 22, and I recently moved all the way from one coast of the U.S to the other (not kidding) to escape my toxic mother and try to scrape together a life for myself. I’m trying to finish my bachelors degree, and I’m living at school in the dorms. My father, my best friend and support system, died a little over a year ago. I have a brother, but we’ve never been super close. I’ve always kind of been an island of a girl, even when I was receiving serious medical treatments for a couple years in my late teens. I never asked for help, even when I really needed it. Never asked for pain meds, or water, I didn’t want to bother anyone. I learned over time that my mothers manipulation and emotional abuse shut me down and forced me to be as low maintenance as possible. But this also means I’m terrible at making friends, because I almost never make the first move on anything. I watch others, and then jump in when I feel confident enough to try, and that’s how I’ve done most things in my life. Hell, making an account on Reddit, a social platform, to try and reach out to anyone is really scary for me. 
 
But I have this weird pull in my heart. I want to be in love. I want to find love of some kind. Crazy right? I don’t even know how to make proper friends! I’m kinda shy and keep to myself, but I do know that I’m at least kind and patient with others because I always try my best to be! People tell me I’m beautiful, perfect strangers even, and that’s been true for years, so I can’t be too terrible to look at. 

So I guess what I’m looking for is a myriad of things. Has anyone else felt like this, or been in a similar situation? How do I start to find people to be friends with in a place I’ve never been to before? How do I find love of some kind, without accidentally walking into a disaster because I’m looking for it so hard and so willingly? I can’t drive because I was under my mothers thumb for so long, she was reluctant to let me have any independence. People are kind of cold and distant here, so it’s really scary to think of approaching anyone. And the masks make it so hard to tell what anyone else is thinking, I can’t see smiles or the little expressions we all make that say so much about our moods.  So nobody even looks approachable. I just hide in my dorm all day or go to the gym. 

I’m desperate to find some advice. I want to have a life, I want to find warmth in a mans arms and laugh with friends. I don’t want to fail and end up on my mothers doorstep.",lonely,Young and lonely,2022-01-31 14:36:44

60,skeptical_phoenix,1643598412,1,"So, I am pretty much at rock bottom right now.  I'm not even sure writing this is the right choice since having someone who doesn't know me reach out to me really doesn't counteract the fact that the people who know me best don't offer to talk or truly listen, but I feel it may be healthy to vent here.

I've suffered with chronic illness, both physical and mental for over a decade and currently have chronic pain and severe insomnia.  I live with my parents still because of it, I have no job since we moved across state a few months ago, I have no friends, and I have to start from scratch in every way imaginable but barely have the energy to function daily.  On top of it, my long-distance long-term relationship with someone I loved deeply ended last month.  

We understood each other beyond what words can say, and we would talk and support each other in healthy ways daily.  I wanted to still be his friend after the breakup since the relationship ended due to logistical factors beyond our control, but he finds it too hard to be my friend because of his romantic love for me.  So, I am respecting that and I am not contacting him as per his wish.  

In the meantime, I have tried to get myself and my life together, but my support system has been lacking.  At first, when the breakup occurred my family was receptive and supportive with letting me talk through my struggles and feelings, but that's went by the wayside.  When I mention that I have a day I'm struggling, there's never a ""Would you like to talk?"" from them.  This has been a recurring dynamic throughout my life despite me repeatedly telling them that I would like for them to offer to talk to me on days I am struggling.  I even flat-out said today I needed that, and yet still no offer.  I just don't understand.

Also, my therapist, who I've been seeing for two years, has shown that she is really not listening or invested in what I have to say or in my case in general.  This has also been a recurring theme

I am not an overbearing person, and most of the time I keep my problems to myself and just try to distract myself.  It's not often that I need to vent.

I just don't know what to do anymore.  It seems I've lost the one person who I was close to who cared enough to talk with me and help me get through life in a healthy way.  I'm not sure what I'm even looking for in posting this, but I thank anyone who has taken the time to read it.",lonely,"To the point where nobody close to me (33M, gay) wants to really listen",2022-01-31 14:06:52

My brothers don't care, they are living their best lives and don't even want to spend some time with me while I'm here.

I wasn't insanely popular but I got along with a few people and even tried to ask my first crush out.... Skip to the end of school when I was 19, I was heartbroken but thanks to an online chatroom I found a few irl friends to talk to and even got over my heart ache... Now queue a few years forward to when I'm about to be 23 in a week... I haven't had a single relationship and most friends I've had have gotten into relationships and they're distant... But there were a few friends left still... Now during the new years eve I lied to my parents about spending time with friends while one of my best friends went off to celebrate with my other friend and another one of my best friends said she wanted to be alone but I ended up seeing her partying with people... Skip a few weeks into 2022 and it's her birthday coming up, since we haven't met for half a year then I figured I'd ask her out and we'd just see each other and talk and I even planned on getting her a few roses since she likes flowers, we have known each other for 4 years now and I've always been extremely supportive of her and always ready to listen.... She said she has no plans but said let's see when the day comes.... Well then that day came and she didn't even open up my messages despite sending snaps to me and when I was about to go to sleep I saw that she's with a guy she met a week ago ... It broke my heart and despite her saying we're still friends and she wants to meet she never makes an effort on her side and whenever I try to meet up she gives an uncertain answer... Now I feel like my one friend group doesn't want to hang around with me outside of gaming (people I met irl) and one of my best friends who I've always supported and at some point really made me feel like she cares about me, has also gotten tired of me and is trying to make me leave her alone despite my best effort trying to be there for her... I recently moved on my own too because my mum left for America and even though she sometimes writes to me she quickly starts sending me thumbs up emojis as if she wants me to leave her alone instead of trying to talk to me... At this point I don't know what to do and tbh I'd like to punch anyone who says ""treat others like you want to be treated"" because it's the most bullshit thing ever",lonely,I came out of my lonely corner but it seems like I'm slowly going back into it....,2022-01-31 10:09:35

At the start of this school year however i got to know a girl, she's in my class. She's always been very friendly with me and we chatted here and there, she always seemed very genuine and it always made me happy to talk to her. She noticed that i wasn't doing well mentally and checked up on me. As small as that might sound, it was a huge deal for me. She was the first person in years to really make me feel somewhat cared about except for my parents.
Because I'm a dumbass i started liking her on more than just a platonical level. Around christmas time we texted here and there and once again, it always felt genuine. However now that school started again i feel like we are drifting apart. Some friends of her know that i like her and even made some hints she might like me back but i just can't seem to approach her recently. I truly like her and she often told me about how she relates to some of my struggles but on the other hand seems so unreachable. She's got plans for after school, good grades, friends..
I know very well that if i just ""wait for something to happen"", nothing will happen. I'll stay miserable by myself.

At some point I realized that no one was ever going to reach out to me because of my own way of being and if I wanted people in my life I would have to reach out and make friends.

Not everyone can be the kind of person that gets reached out to, some people need to do the reaching out. And I feel like that’s the people who are lonely.

I used to be too anxious to ask for help, too anxious to meet people. But by doing things that made me really uncomfortable and working on myself day by day. I’ve become a person that doesn’t hesitate to say what I need to say. I’ve been happy with my aloneness.

If you need help, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Everyone has a unique path, but I’ve reached the end of my loneliness.",lonely,My experience,2022-01-31 04:06:06

I've graduated from an engineering degree just over six months ago and with the pandemic impacting my degree length, i've moved back home to my parents. I was initially meant to be on a placement year in 2020/21 but we all know what happened.

Apart from my family, I have little relations here. I'm not from a very well connected city and jobs within my studied field are not anywhere close by. All my college friends have moved out of town or are still in university elsewhere. 

I'm currently working at an electrical engineering firm to get some experience and apart from that, I have no real desire to go out anywhere. I feel so out of place in my job as I've been away from home for education/university and everyone there is from the local area. I feel I have nothing in common with my coworkers. I'm lonely all the time and I feel as if I'm stagnating in life and my career. I wake up and don't feel bothered to go to work but I need the money so I come home and do the same routine every night. I want to move out of town but I want to do so when I have a job / place to live lined up you know?

All my life I felt doomed.
-As a child, my family used me for money in ways I can only discuss with a therapist.. but y'all can probably guess what went on. 
-when they couldn't do that anymore after we moved to a rich town, they all ""mysteriously"" started to hate me
-living in a racist part of town, I wasn't allowed to play with other kids because I'm ""too dark skin"", but my brother with lighter skin was allowed to play with whoever.
-bullied in school thru elementary to highschool
-kicked out after I came out as gay
-when my family wasn't inappropriately telling friends in my life all these lies about me it was people who bullied me
-young adult life, someone who said he was obsessed with me in HS unfortunately became my neighbor &amp; after a year, I was forced to move far away and get a restraining order.

-his rumors and family's rumors destroyed my life and every single one of my friendships.

I have agoraphobia now. All of 2021 I refused to go outside and spent the entire year in isolation. The few times I did go outside, people I haven't talked to in years still had strong hateful reactions to seeing me.

Any attempt I made to befriend ppl in the past and these others would threaten to put them in danger just to get them to stop talking to me.

What do you even do about all this? I keep telling myself I should just live life and ignore the hate, but when EVERYONE'S become as violent as that previous ""neighbor"" of mine, it's hard. 

I don't want to be this lonely anymore. But there's literally no one left. I have no one to turn to. I'm getting life back together financially, but it doesn't feel worth it if everyone in town has fully rejected me. If these people say I'm not allowed to LIVE around here, unless I wanna risk my safety and my life... Then what the fuck do I do?

This subreddit is so sad. So many people are lonely and want affection yet they don’t show it to their fellow lonely individuals here.

I honestly am not lonely anymore, but have been on here for a long time reading many posts, but change within myself had to come into effect before someone else could come in.

The answer to what you need is to change your diet!

Quit eating fast food, smoking, drinking, doing drugs, and do not waste your life not trying to do these things I am telling you.

I was 237 lbs! That is heavy for 5’10!

I did the KETO and “intermittent fasting” and am happier, healthier, and more good looking than I was in HIGH SCHOOL. I am 35!

What do you need to do?

I did this as the CHEAPEST AND EASY ROUTE!

2 meals a day! Yes you will save a ton of money! Quit drinking pop, beer or liquor!

I don’t cook! perfect. Buy SPINACH, Ham, Califlower, Brocholi! And eat that with a dressing (if you want… I am not eating it all plain!)

Buy OIKOS Vanilla Yogurt
Buy PREMIER PROTEIN SHAKES (Chocolate or whatever flavor you want) 

One Salad
One Yogurt
One Shake

as much water as you want!

Do that twice a day! I lost 47 lbs! in one year! I look phenomenal! And I don’t want to hear “I can’t do it. My body is not built to be thin.” YES IT IS! I was you, and now I want you to be where I am!

You can do it! Man or woman! Adult or up and comer! Fuck what other people label you as! You are special and whether you believe in God or not, we are designed (in my faith) by God to be in the Image of God. So if we can do all things through Christ, (Phillipians 4:13) then we need to act like it. Yes I sin, yes I am not perfect, but I am rooting for you! I didn’t die on a cross for you, and I am not God, but I do know science and what worked for me can work for you!

If you want to be a better person, all you have to do is trust what I am telling you. I had a friend who was there for me, and I want you to know you are made for better things than this.

Satan (the evil one) dangles drugs, mediocre sex (trust me I plowed a lot of mediocre pussy) (yes I said bible stuff and pussy in the same post), And I have had many of the devil’s opportunities, but he never delivers. He is a slot machine of mediocre sales pitches that never live up to the highs that I imagine after the sin is done. Throw the cigarettes out, dump the alcohol, subscribe to DR.

Although I try to have the mindset that if you are a human being and a decent one at best, I will gladly talk to you and try to connect with you. But most people I have tried to talk to feel so fake. Either they care way too much about what others think of them or they seem to only care about themselves.
Although I understand humans are flawed and we can all have moments like this, I find it so irritating sometimes. Most likely because I so desperately crave to have a friend that is looking for a deep connection, which most people my age (17-18) don’t seem to care for. I just feel like I’m too mature for my age group.. but I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

I do have people who I know but I don't have any friends. I have reached at the point I sometimes cry out of loneliness. 

I have been mistreated by many so called friends in the past, even after I didn't do anything wrong. I was diagnosed with depression few years ago, and I was taking medicines and therapy but had to discontinue due to some issues in family.

At this point, I doubt myself that am I even worthy of Love and friendship? There was this one colleague at my workplace who I was once talking to, and I casually mentioned about an another girl that she's hot and I should ask her out. She laughed obnoxiously at my face and said have you looked at yourself, she is totally outta your league. Needless to say, I was hurt even though I'm not sure if she was joking. I know that because of my low self-esteem, I would never have dared to ask her out, but that bluntness hurt me. 

I tend to overwork on weekdays and rarely leave my room (Currently Work from home going since last 2 years). I dread weekends because I don't have anything to do then and I often cry on weekends.

I don't know what should I do.

All those dark 13 years of my life dealing with severe depression, really bad social anxiety, and non-existent self esteem came flooding back. I was also suicidal, but tried to hide it as much as possible. A void in my life that I'll never get back, from 14 to 27 years of age. Most of my youth, now gone. At 27 years old, I was filled with a terrible fear and dread that I can hardly describe. Now that I had recovered from depression, what the hell do I do now? 'What now?' was the real question. I was aimless at that moment and full of fear.

A few years later, I'm finally making some real progress after working some shitty job I absolutely hated to my bones. The stress at that job was unbelievable. I used to have strange numbing sensations on the left side of my neck. It felt like I was gonna have a stroke and the anger made it worse. Now, thankfully, I'm working towards a career in tech, so there's some light of positivity in my life. Still, I've been cripplingly lonely for years and do have bouts of self-loathing, so I do belong here haha. It's so strange to me though, being so lonely to the point of insanity but not having depression anymore. I've been lonely for so long, my body is numb to the pain sometimes. The loneliness is eating away at my mind while I sacrifice and study.

The loneliness becomes almost unbearable some days that I can hardly stand it. I don't plan to give up though, I've sacrificed way too much to throw it all away. FUUUUCK THAT SHIT. No fucking way am I throwing all my hard work away. I've met some lazy, entitled coworkers and shit managers after I had recovered from my depression. And I used to think I was lazy and worthless all those years ago during my depression phase.Those losers can fuck off and die for all I care. Getting promotions they didn't deserve. Entitled pieces of shit, rarely or never helping others. They are lazy, entitled garbage who I will surpass and be more successful than they are. The more I think about those assholes, the more determined I am to succeed.

I've already been sad for years in the past and achieved little. I'd much rather be angry and determined instead. I NEVER want to feel humiliated at work again and I never want to feel helpless again. Fuck that shit. Is it healthy to be like this? No, of course not. I'm not blind and I'll deal with my frustrations at a later time. Right now, all I want is a career and the deliverance it will bring. I'm so fucking tired of struggling and being financially insecure. Just one more fucking mountain to climb...",lonely,"Oh man, this sub is depressing",2022-01-30 13:35:43

I’m stuck at home, with the only people I see being my mum and on the weekends my dad. I am keeping in touch with my friends but I’m having more frequent feelings of loneliness. I also think I’m loosing out on personal development since by the time I’m better I will have been robbed of so many months of the prime of my life.

278,Monk_Shaolin,1643498435,1,"I'm 19M. Before 18 I didn't really think about friends, I had them, but I never really ""cared"" if you know what I mean, I enjoyed my own company. I had 2 or 3 friends when I was 18, one I used to smoke weed with but stopped hanging around because I didn't want to smoke anymore, one that I could tell everything to, but overdosed. And one that I met at the pub. I've still been meeting the one friend at the pub a few times, but I feel like he has so many friends that I'm just one, I'm not really his ""friend"" anymore, more someone that used to be his friend.

&amp;#x200B;

After 18, I began to go out with my friend who I go to the pub with sometimes, but I only went sometimes, but I enjoyed going out, the only thing is I rely on my friend. If he's not available, if he got too drunk and has a bad hangover, what can I do? I ask him beforehand if he's available on the weekend, and he goes out the night before instead, with his real friends. So, I began to feel jealous.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't met my friend since New Year's Eve, and we didn't fall out, but he kept saying he couldn't meet. Now recently I've started to feel really weird when I see people enjoying themselves with friends, anyone, people I don't even know. I feel on the verge of a breakdown, and I don't even know what a breakdown feels like. My heart feels unhealthy, weak, and broken but broken because of myself. My confidence has deteriorated, I feel like a loser, a weirdo. I'm not even a socially awkward person, I just feel like people aren't wanting to speak to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope something can change because I shouldn't be feeling like this. I've changed as a person, I'm a good person and I know good people probably shouldn't say that at all, but in terms of sympathy, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, I even reached out to a God I don't believe, I do good things and get nothing back.

288,sanity20,1643496625,1,"This might be long so i apologize. 

Wanted to post on here to get some things off my chest. I dont feel like anyone in my life currently would understand or take me seriously, even though i do have some people in my life who care its just going to either make things awkward, set off alarm bells, or worst of all i will be blown off and told im overthinking. Venting into the internet void seems like the better option. 

I feel lonely and despite that keep pushing people away, i don't take chances when i should and fear rejection more than loneliness. I see the years passing by and realize i may have missed my chance. At this point people have accepted the status quo and i am a known quantity. 

I guess i should start at the beginning, there's a lot of things that have worked against me in my life and despite that i have done well for myself, in my opinion at least. I was born with congenital heart defects and had open heart surgery when i was four, im lucky in that i remember very little from those times and the doctors say im doing well considering all that. 

Im lucky, but i dont feel lucky. Growing up with all of that on my mind and into adulthood is stressful and my parents though i do love them always downplayed my fears. Shits scary, and yea its bad to sit and think on it but when your bored and the mind wanders it tends to go that way. Nowadays im still doing ok but supposedly my heart is damaging my liver and obviously that is fucking bad. Again though its a weird waiting game because the doctors have no idea how long it will last, could be 20 years, but its like i have a clock over my head counting down with each passing year. Transplant likely mean a heart and liver when i do get that bad. They dont really talk about it because its likely years down the line.

All that along with a tough time in school growing up has left me super-introverted and makes me hard to get out of my shell. I never really dated and have no real close friends anymore after slowly crawling deeper and deeper into my hole. I need to open up more but living in a rural area and not having many close friends has made that near impossible. Work runs yea down and when you do have time its hard to be social, and in a rural setting its hard to meet people outside bars or people you already know. It could be worse though, i do have enough common-sense to try and better myself even if i have to have a panic attack to push me over the edge. 

Every once in a while i take a small leap forward when this shit really starts to scare me, a few years ago when i turned 30 i realized if i didn't get out of my parents soon i was defiantly done for. My parents are good to me but they hate each other so i fucking hated living there but again leaving scared the shit out of me. Eventually though my anxiety pushed me over the edge and I found the cheapest apartment i could and even though i lived in solitude the freedom of my own place was the best feeling in the world. 

Then in September of last year i bought my first house and love it, i worked so hard to get it and that rural area that has been so bad for my social life repaid me in kind with a house i can afford that i really like and coupled with the current low interest rates im trying to pay that off ASAP. I feel lucky to have my own home when so many people cant afford the crazy prices right now. Its not all bad. 

Despite that though i still have trouble pushing myself into a actual relationship. I know im a decent person but i feel like i come with too much baggage and how do you even explain all this to someone? It seems unfair to even get into a relationship when my life seems so uncertain, and yes i know all our lifes could end at any time but its more complicated then normal. Will my health prevent me from working? When will things get worse? Do i have the self confidence to even have a real relationship or even close friends at this point? I guess i have too many question and no good answers. Im doing good but feel like the clock is ticking again. 

Going to stop there as i risk repeating myself, if you read all this i appreciate it. Felt good to type it out even if it doesn't help in the long run. Im not much of a writer and my grammar sucks so sorry for the crap english! Have a good one!",lonely,I feel like im living in a world by myself,2022-01-30 09:50:25

317,No_Street502,1643484499,1,"I’m in a situation where I feel like I’ve always been an outcast. I’m an ethnic minority that grew up mainly around white kids. I’m an only child and only really have my mum as family so was alone a lot as a child. I had quite a visible disability up until I was 14/15. I had surgery to correct it but I feel like this still impacts how I interact with people because for the majority of my childhood I knew people saw my disability before they saw me and would either avoid me or speak to me out of pity. I also missed three years of secondary school for the surgery.

So I came to another city for university and became aware pretty quickly that I was one of the only working class people in pretty much every circle I’ve found myself in. 

I try to be social but I just find it very uncomfortable the majority of the time and feel like all of the above contribute to this. 

This is even causing issues in my relationship because my boyfriend thinks I don’t like his family because I’m often really quiet when we’re at family events even though I’m trying my best to be as social as possible and I’m pretty sure it’s becoming a dealbreaker for him. I just feel like there’s this distance because out lives are vastly different.

I haven’t always thought this was the case I just thought I was shy and needed to come out of my shell and have tried to get myself to do this so many times in the past. I have tried therapy for social anxiety and after completing the whole course at one point I still just can’t seem to shake that awkward feeling around people. I don’t think it helps that I’m naturally introverted as well.

I’ve thought about moving cities to try and start over because maybe I’m just not around the right people but part of me just feels like all the qualities that make me up as a person are so different from everyone/the majority of people. So do I just need to try to working on maintaining these relationships even with the awkwardness?

I'm a nurse and they just lifted quite a few covid lockdown restrictions. I see how everyone is very excited and I am... Just so very tired. I don't have much friends to do things with. I have a boyfriend who's busy doing his own thing. I have a childhood friend who's busy being a mom. I have a handful of acquaintances but I don't really feel connected with them. Before covid I had quite a few years of being depressed. I had emdr and therapy and got on meds. I was just starting to make get a social life when covid happened.
I always worked in nursing homes but made the switch to the hospital last year as that was my dream. I started at a lung ward and when they accepted me, they said I probably wouldn't have to work at the covid ward. Sadly, after two weeks, I started taking care of post ICU covid patients and worked shifts at a non invasive breathing assistance unit.
Because of my job, I've lost contact with a lot of people that I wanted to become friends with. Most said they didn't believe in covid, that it was a flu, etc, while I was taking care of people dying. I will never forget rushing a little kid out of his room while his dad had to be reanimated. I am so bitter. Cynical. People complaining about masks while I was dressed during the summer in full PPe gear sweating buckets. 
I feel a disconnect from my coworkers. They all started at the covid ward together and have been friends for a long time. They didn't invite me to a few events and talk about group chats that I am not in. I'm not a typical girl, I'm childfree by choice and can't talk mom business.

347,Akashi07,1643457796,1," Hi, Hi 

It’s been a while since I’ve been here. Almost a year... what a year. Started with covid, lost a month of my life to it. Then went straight to workaholic work - nice 300h/month, over time not paid... ended up below minimal hourly wage in my country (yay me!). Then they’ve fired me without a word... went to company base for some shit and get ppl to my site. 

Was greated by HR with termination letter on wednsday with mandatory days off to take so friday was my last day of work. Then boss didn’t pay me over half of delegation fees, but oh well. I’ve got home that last day and drunkedly procastinated weekend. 

Luckly my job hunt lasted less than, a week. Got like +1/3 salary and after 3 months with extension after “trial” time another +16% raise. So after 3 months of getting fired I’m at +55% $$, less work time and some nice benefits! Just when I’ve got that sorted out... 

I’ve got letter from uni that I’m getting kicked out again. For not putting up thesis on time... and it’s final this time. I’ve appealed, it got rejected. Appealed again, last possible time. It went throught! Dean gave me deadline on 24th that I have to put up thesis by 30th or get approval on paper from supervising doc that he’ll accept it. I’ve read that mail on 27th ;( Got approval mail from doc by 30th... at 23:14. Redirected that to Dean 10min later. Next day Dean accepted and gave some conditions to allow me to finish! 24th January was THE DAY - thesis defence with 3question exam! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I’ve passed! Now I don’t know what to do.

 Last thing that was weighing me is gone. 

But what now?! 

Work is left. My ‘hobbies’ are glorified procastination acctivites.

366,glandulartittiesdoc,1643438477,1,"Hello. Just to clarify: I'm not here to smugly cry about hating being academically gifted, I'm here to cry about why that's the only thing I'm good at and ""gets me 0 bitches"" or friends.

So, when I () was younger, around 15, I graduated highschool and decided to re-join again last year September. This is because my highschool experience was absolutely horrible. I was an alcoholic/substance-abuser, and I went through gross amount of sexual trauma. My grades also made no sense in combination with the subjects I chose, so... I decided that going backwards would actually be a step forward for me. I'm three years sober.

Anyway, I improved a LOT. My overall average seems to stick between 94%-100%, and I think I'm pretty smart, but not smart enough to warrant the reactions I'm getting at school by my classmates. Mind you, I had NEVER focused in my previous highschool, so everything I'm learning is relatively new. If I'm not being asked for academic advice, to help someone cheat or getting copious amount of hostile praise for my work, I'm literally just sitting all alone, doing nothing or scrolling through my phone. At first, it didn't bother me much because I am a new student, but after a while, I began to notice that even my Maths teacher intentionally avoided allowing me to participate in class activities, and is beginning to get more hostile or dismissive with my participation, though she always is KIND to everybody and goes on &amp; on about how much she loves our class. It took me a while to notice that when she says ""class,"" she means everyone but me. I've loved her as a teacher, and I don't believe I ever over-stepped any boundaries with anybody in this school to cause this reaction. I am not arrogant. I humble myself to the extent that it begins to pain my pride, and I don't talk about things that clash with our culture here. I keep up with social media and celebrity drama. I listen to some pop music. I dress like everyone else. I am not too proper, and I am not too slant. This has caused me to feel like that something is severely wrong with me, like I am fucked up or give ""school shooter"" vibes, when I know myself that I am perfectly fine, and I am actually an incredible fuckin' catch. My self-esteem is not in ruins... yet. The only weird thing about me is that I am an articulate English speaker, and in school, I get so anxious that I speak very formally, but I'm trying to break that down and introduce some more slang or my first language or whatever.

So why do I feel so extremely lonely? What can I do to battle this? I feel like the more I put my heart into my projects and presentations, the more it pushes everybody away. I feel like a pushover. In my fifth week of school, some kid spread a rumor about me, saying that I took a pregnancy test at the toilet (I obviously did NOT) and they based their argument on the fact that I'm 18. In one breath, this is hilarious, and in another, this just makes me want to disappear.

Fat, ugly, pseudo-intellectual with below-average IQ, quick to anger, emotional and unpredictable, unempathetic and cruel, the list goes on. I truly don't have a positive trait in my body. I'm too analytical, not at all creative, and I have 0 social skills. I have no friends. All I do all day, every day, is either work, or play video games. That's it.  

The only thing that I've ever wanted was a relationship, but I've never had a romantic relationship or even so much as a single woman interested in me in my entire life. I haven't had even a single match in online dating in almost 8 years. And why should I? Like I said, I have 0 positive traits. And unlike most human beings, my worst quality by far is that I am incapable of change.  

Medications and psychedelics don't do anything for me, and therapy doesn't work on me. If I'm not instantly good at something I lose all interest in it, and as a result I have no interest in any hobby I've ever tried (and I've tried a ton - 10 years of 0 friends and lots of free time will do that to you).  

So now, after trying everything every doctor, psychiatrist, therapist, counselor, and redditor has told me to try, I'm left with a choice. Either live this miserable ""life"" (if you can call it that) until I die naturally, alone and unloved, or end it early. That's not really a choice, though. The real choice is ""how early."" Right now, that's looking like a matter of a day or two. But no one cares, and no one should.

I failed early in life to settle down fast, then there were family issues to take care of, it crippled my confidence, changed my world view forever, I don't find anything interesting these days, my life just revolves around earning, paying bills, single child, taking care of mother &amp; tolerate my father.

2. Despite my best efforts I am unable to acquire friendships/relationships

395,reignnote42,1643428047,1,"Hi everyone. I am going through a tough time with my parents right now and if anyone has any guidance and support, I would greatly appreciate it.

I am 22 for reference. I am finishing my final semester of my undergraduate degree, and I am currently in the graduate application stage. I have a full ride (plus a 20k additional scholarship) to my current program, and I work 4 jobs while making almost $2k a month on my own. While not being fully financially independent yet (I don't pay for health, car insurance, etc). I have a full time job offer set up for next year, so I will be making more by that time. I have not asked or needed money from my parents in a long time. I study two areas and I am trying to do my absolute best to make accomplishments and please them.

But it never has been enough. Every time I bring up going out of state, it ends in them yelling at me and saying that I am selfish and only think for myself. They are very over protective of me. I currently live 3 hours away from them for college (in-state) and that was a huge stretch for them. My mom recently told me that if it was up to her, I'd be commuting at home with a closer college.

My field of study that I prefer requires for me to travel many places and be independent, which is something I told them 4 years ago before starting my undergraduate degree. And either way, no matter what field of study I choose to work in, I have been passionate about moving something new for my own career and life choice.

I recently got into a bad car accident which totaled my car (not my fault) and my parents are using that as an incentive for me not to travel out of state, because if something like that were to happen they wouldn't be there to help. The thing is, I handled the insurance myself and also took care of everything with my car. The insurance company even messed up some information and I got it fixed when my dad couldn't, and in return he just yelled at me for taking matters into my own hands.

Right now my parents are approaching my grad school dream as a ""if THEY approve of it"" outlook. They only seem to support me if I want to stay in my home city. Tonight I was told that if I don't get free tuition, they won't ""let me"" go and they also won't let me take a gap year to work for it again. There is 30k in college savings funds that I didn't need for my undergrad since I got a full ride that I currently have. Even so, I offered to fully take out loans and pay for everything myself. Even if I wanted to stay local, it would never be enough for them. I would never make them fully happy.

I have hit a very stressful bump in the road. I don't know what to do or think anymore, and I feel incredibly unmotivated due to the stress the situation is causing me. I REALLY want to move out and be on my own, and I know I can do it. I get told I'm selfish every single day, and I'm so scared right now about my future. My friends, teachers, and colleagues have been highly encouraging, saying that this is my decision and I should not hold back. But while my parents say otherwise everyday and that they can decide my future, I have thoughts in my head now telling me that.

If my parents say no to graduate school, can I still take out my own loans, commit to the school, and go?",lonely,please help. parents unsupportive while I'm financially making my own decisions.,2022-01-29 14:47:27
396,gluy_ps,1643427917,1," and have been alone for quite a while, I have a few friends that I don't see much anymore (I am very grateful for though), but I have never had anything close to a relationship.


A few months I started college and slowly realised that I didn't have any friends with me. I spend everyday alone, most days not 1 word is said to me. I thought I could handle independence and didn't mind this, however the other day my headphones broke and I realized how alone I was. The music was just a facade that blemished an overwhelming void of loneliness, that nearly brought me to tears.

I was surrounded by people at my high school that I considered friends, but I now realise that I meant nothing to any of them. I was just used to laugh at and pick on, i've only realised recently, that it wasn't banter and I just used to let them walk all over me, unknowly. None of them speak to me anymore.

I see couples walk past - holding hands and leaning on each other. I want to feel happy for them, but that is overshadowed by jealousy, guilt and self hatred; I can't help but feel like they are showing off and rubbing it in my face, like they know how much it pains me to see. But they don't.

I'm not suicidal, but everyday keeps on getting harder and harder. I know it's my fault that I'm alone but I don't have the confidence to speak up to anyone and the few times I do, I feel like I get laughed off. I'm stuck in this cycle of lack of self esteem, rejection and guilt. Forever forced to run on this treadmill of shame.

I've been bottling this for a while as I don't think I deserve this pitty, so many more people live harder lives and I'm whining about not having enough attention, anyways...

415,Dry-Worldliness-4861,1643422190,1,"Hello all. I am 20F. I am dealing with self hatred. It started in middle school. I got bullied a lot for my weight and appearance. Because of this I was suicidal and angry as a teenager. I had friends in middle school, but I would reach out to them and tell them what I was feeling and they told me to stop and just kill myself because they didn’t care. After that I stopped taking my problems to them. Still getting bullied, I isolated myself because it was safer. I left the school eventually because I couldn’t take it anymore. The first year at the new school was amazing. The change felt needed. I met a friend on my second day, she was cool. She was the first person in four years to be nice to me other than family. She help me meet a lot of people but I don’t know how to react to people being nice to me. It just makes me uncomfortable. Skip to 11th grade. The friend got kicked out of the school for having sex with students and I was alone for a while but I eventually made friends again. That year the school was being shut down, teachers weren’t getting paid, and everyone was unhappy and there was a lot of racial tension. I’m black by the way so it’s just uncomfortable all the time for me. My depression got out of control being there and I began to isolate, lash out, and didn’t show up to school. Because of that, I lost a lot of friends. I had unhealed problems coming back and I didn’t know how to deal with him and how to stop it. I hated myself for it. I hate myself for what I did to people. I hate myself for not trying harder to push back my problems and fake it. I would have friends around me if I faked it. At home, my mother was getting abused by my Half sisters father. My mother also has an immune disease that causes her body to attack itself. This is usually aggravated by stress so I never bothered to tell her much was going on. So I had to help her but I didn’t want her to help me. My mother also has depression from when my father died and also childhood trauma that she is getting through with the therapist today. I don’t want to burden her. After all of this, I have a lot of self hatred. I hate the way I look. I hate to think about my body. I hate that I want to be with friends but I don’t think I deserve them. The reason I’m still alive is that I love helping people. I love walking the elderly to their car after grocery shopping. I love helping kids with their homework. I think I would even pull someone out of a burning car . Helping people is the only reason why I am alive. It just keeps me going I’ll always have somebody to help. And my mother. If I killed myself, that would be the most selfish thing I could ever do to my mother. She tells me I’m worth it but I don’t believe her. She reminds me of all the amazing things I’ve done for people but I just shrug it off. I want to love myself but I don’t know where to begin and why I should. If I go to a therapist which I have recently, all they told me was to get out side and do things that I like. But it feels like I’m wasting my time. Right now, I am a college student. I do things online because I’m afraid of going to school and looking and feeling like this. But I also want to do some thing for the community because I’ve never been part of a community.

444,Shejku92,1643407905,1,"It took me a while to start writing this, but today my internal pain grew much stronger, I need to vent at least a little bit altrough I usually hide everything inside..

When I was 20 yo, I had quite a lot of friends, some of them were my childhood friends and we were hanging out together for years. Altrough I wasn't a party-type guy, I enjoyed little house parties, hangouts in house of one of us, local pubs, going to cinema, etc. Typical things that young adults usually do. 

Then I met my wife, Aleksandra (We're from Poland BTW). We were dating for about year, and got married. Well, typical couple: we had some bad moments and good moments, but we stayed nearly always together, and we're still together.

Problems started when our first kid was born. As a fresh father, I couldn't spend that much time with friends. I always tried to divide my time between my new family, work and social life. Well, I tried, that's a key word. Time passed and my friends slowly stopped inviting me, messaging me, even responding to my messages. Through all this time, more and more friends forgot about me, just like I've become someone not worth hanging out with, because I had some important responsibilities.

And here we are. Now I'm 29 yo, I'll be 30 in the middle of december, and I have no one to talk, no one to meet with or even drink one fkn beer with. The only person that's still with me is my wife. Now I have problems with meeting anyone new, I gained some weight so people tend to avert their eyes when I try to talk to them, I think I got some kind of heavy depression cause sometimes my mood goes straight down below ground and I tend to cry a lot when it happens (just to remind, 29M - that must look pretty lame). I'm just overwhelmed by all my bad thoughts, my sad memories, my social loneliness - I'm trying to endure everything and stay strong when needed (I was even able to deliver my 4th baby when it was too late for my wife to get to the hospital, don't ask how I managed to do that without any help) but all of this feelings and memories that accumulated through years, it's starting to seriously damage my heart and head. Even to the point of getting physical pain in my chest when I'm so down..

I'm starting to lose against my loneliness, I miss my friends, I wish I could see them again, I wish I could meet someone new, I don't know how what to do, I feel like I have no strenght to do it, nor confidence or determination.. the other thing is, I have to work a lot to provide my family safety, food and everything that they need, so It's hard for me to take some time for myself, for regaining my social life. My wife is studying at weekends on medical university in Warsaw, 200km from our home, so I have to keep an eye for our kids. We got no one to stay with them, so I could go out sometimes. My wife's mom lives quite far away feom our home, and my parents...ehh, nevermind. They're too lazy to do it, always making excuses..

I don't know if anyone will understand my story a little..
Maybe someone will laugh at me, and it won't be a first time, but as I said, I had to let some off me..

This evening is terrible, and I'm criying again..",lonely,Forgotten..,2022-01-29 09:11:45

447,Change_sets05,1643406639,1,"I'm 26 yo and I found myself in a weird situation. Because I've been craving romantic love for a long time and miss the chance to know someone, go to dates and slowly evolve step by step. I only go to work, then home and everything begins on the next day. I've been introvert in my whole life, so it's not new. I don't meet new people and I don't find anyone in the near I feel attracted to and see something in them.
I know a girl a few minutes away from work, we even meet sometimes because their place belongs to us a bit and we can meet sometimes. She's a few years older than me.

It's interesting because she's not my type but I can't avoid thinking on her in the last 1-2 weeks.
I may even find her more attractive how time goes. I basically like her style and she seems kind, smart and she's honestly way better than my past crush who was not this good. I mean I feel her a better person. I even said when I was in love with my crush she seemed like a bad person, althought I loved her but I used my heart to see the real person. But this girl seems much greater, that's why I like to be around her.

Lately, I visited her place often like 5-6 times. I had to go there for the first 2-3 times but I intentionally visited the place since then. Even her colleague said I recently go there quite much. Her other colleague told me that who I meet everytime there and we know each other since I started working here a few years ago...
She makes comments about it nowadays like today I was there and the girl was away. She said ""admit it, you thought she was gonna be here"". Or when she gave me some cookies she cooked at home the previous day. She didn't know if I was gonna go there or which day but I hit the day when she had homemade cookies at work and I ate some. And I told her colleague she didn't know that I wanted to go there, so she didn't cooked them for that. She said there are no accidents. Or how to say... everything happens for a reason.
There are lots of comments by her like these and I think she sees more in this thing than it really has.

I'm sure this happens because I'm lonely and I didn't want anything serious because I got enough bad in the past and I was praying for not getting into trouble again.",lonely,I'm feeling strange,2022-01-29 08:50:39

456,iarisscal,1643400123,1,"Hello guys. Im 16 years old, have had the same friend group for about three years, we were very close, would do ANYTHING together but the group is slowly falling apart. It all started from a fight I had with one of them, at first it wasn't anything too bad but eventually it got worse and worse until we just stopped talking to each other. A few of weeks ago we ""solved"" the argument and decided to just move on and forgive eachother.
The thing is: in the meanwhile the fighting and all ruined the friend group and slowly some people created a smaller group and others got left out. I was one of those who got left out. I thought that once we had sorted things out it would have gotten better but it didn't. 
Now we just text very sporadically and see eachother just on the weekends and tbh I don't even have fun like I used to. My therapist suggested me to keep seeing them even if it's not as I want it to be, because it's better than completely isolating myself. 
Honestly yeah, it's definitely better, but I still feel alone. I don't have anyone to talk to about the random stuff that happens to me, I dont have anyone I can text when I feel sad and need someone to vent to, I don't feel close to anyone anymore and sometimes I wish I could just disappear.

461,olls_9,1643396916,1,"I’m a 21 year old guy from the UK, and it’s sad to admit, but I don’t have any friends. I’ve never exactly had the best record when it comes to friendships. I can’t say I’ve ever had a best friend, or even a close friend. I’m becoming really lonely but I’m struggling to make any new friends. I moved to a new city in September last year and I hoped things would get better. I come from a small rural place, so I thought there would be plenty of opportunities to make friends, but I’ve had no luck yet.

So I’m a trans guy, meaning I was born a female but identify as male. It’s definitely not something I go around shouting about, but it’s something that really holds me back, and is part of the reason I seem to have problems making friends. In terms of my appearance, I look like a guy, but as soon as I open my mouth, my voice is so high, and it just gives it away. Even though I look like a guy from my appearance, I look way younger than most guys my age. I can’t transition yet due to family issues so I’m just stuck in this awkward in between. I feel uncomfortable around my family because I don’t feel they care about me if I’m being who I am. For the family members who’d don’t know I’m trans, I doubt they will want to associate with me when they do find out. Yes, I know I’m 21, and I can technically do what I like, but it’s not as easy as that when I’m financially dependent on them. As a result of all this, I have absolutely zero confidence, and I’m finding it more and more difficult to leave the house. I’ve always been shy and introverted so this doesn’t help.

I don’t really seem to fit in with LGBT people or non-LGBT people. A lot of LGBT people I have met were very vocal about their identity and were somewhere on the gender spectrum, rather than the binary male or female with how they identified. I by no means have a problem with that, but I’m someone who just wants to get on with life as a guy and be able to fit in with people. I guess the problem is that other people like me might not necessarily hang out in specific LGBT spaces. I did end up going to a trans youth group in the city which was both a blessing and a curse. It was cool to meet other people like me, but they’ve all been able to transition and get on with their lives, while I’m just stuck. I found it hard to socialise with them because they had things going on in their lives, where I just feel like I’m not going anywhere or doing anything. I’m not only trying to make friends with LGBT people, but I can tell sometimes that people don’t know whether I’m a boy or girl, and I feel like I make people feel awkward. I’ve also tried making friends on social media, but most people have their own friends and don’t need anymore, so they sometimes reply for a bit or not at all. I feel a bit pathetic, because I have a bit more confidence online, but still people don’t want to talk to me. 

I don’t feel like I can move forward in life, because with anything I try to do, I’m having to explain I’m trans to people as soon as I meet them or otherwise I just stick out. The way I’m living my life at the minute seems to be for other people’s benefit and not my own. I feel like I’m falling behind and just wasting my life, because I’m stuck in my room thinking of goals and dreams that seem unachievable. I’m living in my head a lot, dreaming about the future and being surrounded by people who care. As time passes, I seem to have less control over this loneliness, as I’m running out of ways to try and meet new people, and I don’t know if things will ever change. No one seems to speak to me unless I initiate the conversation. I feel I’m not even seen a lot of the time or just forgotten about in the background. Everyone I meet seems to have a significant other or at least one friend, so I’m not exactly anyone’s priority. This loneliness is really starting to get to me and I never have anyone to talk to, because I can’t even relate to people who are vaguely similar to me, and there doesn’t seem to be anyone out there in a situation like mine.

Honestly, it would just simply be cool to have a friend. I’m not saying they’d have to be trans, because it’s not something I fixate on or talk about a lot. I know this post shows the exact opposite, but it’s just causing me a lot of problems at the moment. Just someone who would just accept me for who I am and then we could get on with doing fun stuff as mates. Whenever I go out and see people hanging out together, I think I’d love to have someone I could go to the cinema or the beach with, anything really. I’m not even asking for a group of mates, just one person would be amazing. I’m sort of hopeful there may be someone on here in somewhat of the same position, but at the same time I hope no one is feeling the same way I do. I just needed to vent this somewhere, and sorry it’s so long, but if anyone wants or needs someone to talk to, please feel free to message me.

For the past couple of months, my friends have been hanging out a lot without me and I keep seeing them together. I have developed a bad habit of checking their locations and seeing them together, which only makes me feel worse about myself. I don’t think they’re doing it on purpose, but ever since knowing that they do all these things together, I’ve been feeling really sad and lonely even in the presence of others. I feel like my mental health is deteriorating and I keep thinking about feeling left out and unappreciated and as if they wouldn’t even care if I was a part of the group or not.

468,MyriadOfClouds,1643393896,1,"I was going through old pics to find my old job password to get my w2. There’s a lot of pictures with my ex, whom I loved, or thought I did, idk. She dumped me out of nowhere, she was cheating and never told me but I found out anyways. A tall guy sponsored by Yamaha, then they broke up a year later and she matched with my friend (he didn’t know it was my ex, he didn’t message back), he’s a good friend. I don’t know if I’ll ever be that happy again. Ever since we broke up I’ve been a shell of a person. She was a narcissist. 

I haven’t tried dating in 2 years. I have no confidence. I live at my moms. I don’t make enough money to live on my own. I did try dating after the breakup, but people weren’t interested after I told them my height or living condition. So it made me feel even worse. For the past two years I’ve been coasting. I don’t feel love anymore, I’m not attracted to anyone. I’m hopeless about the future. I know whoever I do date will either cheat or find someone better, because it happens again and again. 

Now I’m taking 3 medications. Bupropion, mertazapine so I can eat, and lithium so my mind isn’t going insane every day. I wish I could be happy, but I can’t. I’m so alone, and lonely, even if I’m surrounded by people. I no longer allow myself to be vulnerable because that’s the worst pain (mental and physical) I’ve ever been through. I literally start shaking if I allow myself to be vulnerable, I subconsciously protect myself and I can’t change it. 

I’ve been in the military, prison, and graduated college. I feel like life has chewed me up, swallowed me, shit me out, ate it again and vomited and buried it with dirt. 

I’ve been thinking of suicide for a long time now. It comes and goes. I’ve tried everything. I used to be a gym rat, now I’m like what’s the point. I get tattoos because it makes me feel alive somewhat, I just got my armpit tattoo’d, it hurt but felt good. 

I’m just venting, I post here sometimes. I don’t answer dm’s because it’s just people trying to take advantage of others. Comments are usually nice. I know a lot of people here are just like me. 

Not even sure what I’m doing. I’m tired man. I’m so tired. My grandma is 86, battling cancer and I’m amazed she’s still alive. Meanwhile here I am 27, and ready to die. But I can’t, because if I do my dogs won’t know where I went and my brother passed away, so I’m the only son my mom has left.

We started talking on a daily basis and we kind of hit it off. For the first time in my life, I wake up each day with a smile because of her txts. She's cool and funny and smart, she makes me happy and what I like the most about her is how she takes care of the people she love. 

I was starting to fall in love but we live in different countries, so it's hard to keep up with each other. I try to connect with her as much as I can, I would initiate phone calls, conversations, anything that would help us make it work because I know I really like her. 

Since I don't know a lot of things about her (yes, she only wants to talk about me), I started to think that there's something going on with her. I stalked her profile and saw some evidences that she might be living with another man. I think she's married or at least have a boyfriend. I don't know how to take it all in because my mental health is really deteriorating. I cried about it but never had the chance to confront her about it. It hurts so bad but I don't wanna lose her. 

Please tell me what to do. At least help me, please.

First, thanks to the people that either reply with something positive or disagree respectfully without argue.

You know very good what it's like to feel lonely,  depressed and all the other bad things in life and also know how hard is to wake up everyday and push yourself to keep going..... yep, fucking  damn hard!! 
I'm a person that likes to try my best to be positive even though the world is falling apart, i can be giving advice on how to solve problems and my life be on fire, so when i have my good days i take advantage to do the most i can , enjoy things i like, eat my favorite food and make plans and obviously hop in here to share positive comments with other that feel down because maybe i can cheer up someone  else and share a smile while i still have a good mood.... 
then comes the people that laugh at the comments and tell me that being positive is a Fucking waste of time and life sucks and will always suck and everyone is horrible and we all will die alone.... why the fuck you want to crush others like that??!! Knowing how it feels to be put down from others why would you come here shaming someone for having hope and trying to cheer others, it's such a hypocrisy bullying others like that then come here complaining why people don't talk to you or doesn't want to answer dms and how selfish everyone in this sub is because they're  not looking for the same things as you.
well I'm  sorry but not everyone have the same problems or is looking for the same things in here, i like to read others , i dont look for friends or talk to people but i join this because you can always relate to how others feel and find support, if i don't  like something i just don't read it, if i read it and i have nothing to say or nothing useful to add then i just don't  say anything and if i think i can help or cheer up then i comment, but whatever my action is i shouldn't be shamed for do or don't,  we're all here because we're lonely for some reason and want to vent and look for support not being  judged on top of that......
Honestly i just became angry because i read a post from a 14 yo looking for sympathy and people in the comments saying stuff like ""yeah the world is shit and it wouldn't get better, oh wait until high-school"" and stuff like that... when you were little didn't you wished support love and someone that gives you hope? Didn't you lack of it?? There's a different between being realistic and kill others hope, and i get it, trust me i do know  how you feel when nothing has ever go right in your life and everything seems pointless and horrible but i don't  believe, at least in my case,  my bad experiences will be an excuse to put others down, i know how all of this feels and i never wish to anyone to feel like this, and i like even when someone is in a dark place other person feel the same and they conect because of the same feeling/experience amd that exactly is the purpose of this group, I'm  usually a person  that respect other's opinions but in this subject if you're going to add a bad comment please don't, you're  entitled to your opinion  but think it twice, you never know how can you affect others just with your words and honesty it hurts when you're put down by the people that share the same pain, thanks for reading.",lonely,For all the hope killer people here FU,2022-01-28 20:06:54

I told him about starting a race team and he was interested.  Fast forward I send him my business Sunday and he basically said “I don’t mean to blow you off but I am blowing you off”.  Sad this is that he is going to the NASCAR exhibition race in DTLA as am I and I wanted to meet up with him there.  But I guess since he doesn’t want to work with me he saw no value in meeting up with me and doesn’t want to hear a pitch.

Then of course COVID struck and made it even harder to meet new people, as my middle age just keeps ticking by... The state of the world is definitely contributing to my isolation; I can't stand what's happening right now (the pitting of us against each other through politics and the media, the takeover of our country and our livelihoods by corporations and the elite, etc) and even though I've tried to seek out people like myself in a variety of places, I have been so far unsuccessful in finding someone that wasn't standing firmly on one side with a pitchfork and a hatred for anyone who dares show compassion. (For the record, I do NOT believe that compassion and kindness are weakness; I believe them to be strengths that are very unappreciated these days). I guess I'm here as a last ditch effort to try to make genuine connections with others. Regarding platonic friendships, gender and race are irrelevant. I'm a straight female and definitely open to meeting a love connection also. Age is somewhat relevant, as I have a harder time connecting with anyone too much younger than me.

I can’t let my walls down and let love in, not that anyone cares enough to love me. It never gets better, and at this point my depression is too far gone that things can’t change.

The smallest tasks seem impossible and I can’t get out of bed. I don’t want to do anything, can’t imagine having ambitions or hobbies.

My perception is distorted and I’m constantly having flashbacks to each and every awkward social interaction and feeling incredibly guilty. I feel unworthy of life or attention but I just wanna be seen for once. I’m always extremely lonely and I can’t take it. 

I’m broken and I can’t even console myself. I have no self-compassion, my thoughts are so cruel and I’m doing this to myself. I grew up with a narcissist parent and now I’m *that* cruel to my own self. That’s a bully you can’t escape; one that’s in your own head. 

It doesn’t get better it never does. I’m 17 and I first wrote a suicide note at the age of 7 sooo I’ve felt this way for a while now. It’s not sadness, it’s deep despair. There’s no hope in conventional mental health treatment. I’ve never truly gotten better. It’s sad bc I try to convince myself that life is improving but fuck no.

567,melancholyoctopus8,1643323876,1,"Hi,

I guess I just need a place to write as my mind is buzzing right now.

My social skills have always been shockingly poor and so has my perception of women. I found porn really young and I guess got addicted. Along with being bullied at school with multiple comments about my appearance. That probably creates a me; a walking pile of insecurities.

In my late teens I could barely talk to women and kinda saw them as 'objects to fuck' inside of people. I also thought everyone was judging me for any action I did. As a result I became reserved and bland so there was literally nothing to call me out on, nothing to make me stand out. I also started going down a bit of an incel route becoming resentful of most people, especially other girls I was around. Also around this time I hated myself the most and was suicidal.

I did notice this and didn't like what I was becoming. I saw a fresh start as I was off to university. I tried to socialise as much as possible always just bring friendly and nice. That works temporarily but it felt ingenuine and I think people kinda knew I felt a bit off. Over the 4 years I kept at it slowly getting better I found you can still be nice but to you need the banter, a bit of roasting now and then. I felt much more comfortable and more genuine. I started working on myself, physically and mentally. Trying not to care what people thought and being more out going. But one thing that still remained was my insecurities around girls. I could make friends easily enough hand hold conversations which were great, but anything more than that is a hard no.

I'm so concerned not to be a creep or to be inoffensive that I am just bland again. And it is something I do want to work on but don't really know how.

After uni I moved to a new city for work and I'm in a house share with a couple of people, one of which is another girl that is also a recent graduate. I go into this situation like I approach all situations now, just relaxed and with the thinking 'what ever happens, happens' as in don't force anything (personally wise). Over the next few weeks we're talking and getting on quite well, I don't see her as an object and I really like her company and being around here. We've spent a weekend exploring the new city and another weekend going to a museum as friends, even watched a few movies together in the house.

I rarely feel this way about anyone this is probably the third girl I've liked in this way. The first two I was too afraid to say anything and ruin the friendship, of course I leave it too long and they end up getting boyfriends, but that's cool and does help reduce my feelings for them. This new girl I've known for about a month now and I don't want the same thing to happen again and be filled with regret. I spent nearly 2 weeks working up the courage and trying to pick a good time. Tonight after dinner I asked if she enjoyed the time we spent at the museum together, she replied she did. So kinda stammering a bit I asked if you wanted to do the same this weekend with as a date, maybe get some lunch as well. She looked a bit surprised and said 'we'll see'. I said cool have a good night then to which she said the same and now you're caught up to the present.

I mean it's not looking promising and that's ok I'm glad I did it because it was eating away at me that I hadn't, just like the times before. There's no resentment which is nice, I hope we can still be friends and it isn't too awkward.

That's pretty much it I just wanted to get my thoughts our there tbh. I'm still very much a WIP still occasionally have bouts of depression but not longer see women as objects. Just wanted to share, thanks :)",lonely,Asked a girl out for the first time (23m),2022-01-28 09:51:16

2.  Watch a movie you’ve always wanted to see but never had the time or motivation to. Pair it with some snacks, and maybe take some chances and see if a random person online would wanna watch it with you lmao

3. Cuddling services. Ok. I have never done this and am not in a position to, but totally would if I could. You can pay by the hour for someone to come over and cuddle and even watch the movie with you.

4. Don’t seek sympathy from anybody or feel too pitiful about it. Birthdays are kind of a weird thing that not everybody celebrates anyway. Nobody really cares if you’re lonely or feel unloved generally because they feel like it’s normal, even if they have the friends and relationships  that we could only dream of.

I thought things would be fine and would go back to normal but I've never really been the same since. She sometimes talks about finding people to talk to on dating apps and going to meetups to meet new people, all of this is cool and I'm happy for her but it just makes me feel bad when she keeps mentioning it. It makes me feel lonely. I told her last night and today she replied saying she won't being that stuff up anymore but she doesn't really like hiding stuff from me. I know my feelings for her don't matter whatsoever and I just need to get over it, but it's really difficult when she's my only friend.

582,BriNeedsSleep,1643315021,1,"I know you are lonely. I know that every day you wake up is a struggle because you feel so alone. But in this world, you are not alone. There is someone out there who is like you, who feels the same way you do. Someone who is longing for company, cuddles, laughs, friendship, romance, and just doesn't know how to get it. They're out there.

I think in the dredges of loneliness it's easy to lose hope. It's easy to feel like you're an island in a sea of people. I know meeting people is scary, I know a lot of us are introverts, and I know it seems hopeless at times. But there is someone out there like you, who is lonely too, who likes what you like, who would be so happy to see you. 

My advice? Start feeding the pieces inside of you that are yearning for a good time. Yearning to be happy. Feed them scraps if that's all you have. Just get them some nutrition. Any. You like to read and haven't in a while? Read for five minutes every other day. You want to get to the gym? Go for a ten minute run once a week. You want to draw? Doodle one thing every day. You want to be happy? Give what you can to that piece of you that hungers for that.

Your confidence is key. And the road to confidence is through self actualization. Treat yourself kindly and feed the fun side of you, feed the side of you that yearns to do things. And go do them, just a little at a time. Your confidence will build, and you'll feel more comfortable interacting with others because you'll know that no matter the outcome of the situation, you're okay with who you are and you will be okay. 

Then, you can start searching for that person. That lonely, sweet person who is like you. You'll start the hunt, and don't be scared! Sometimes it doesn't work out, that's nothing against you. There are so many people on this Earth, not all of them will like you. That's fine, you don't have to like everybody either. 

But there is someone out there like you. You are not alone in this world, no matter how lonely you are. Feed that which fuels your joy and work up from there, and keep hope. There's someone out there like you, someone who cries themselves to sleep because they just want a friend, a relationship, some hope in this lonely world, and *they'll like you*. You all, each and every one of you, have an opportunity to find this person. It's hard. But it's worth it. And you all are strong people, otherwise you wouldn't keep going in the face of such an overwhelming emotion such as loneliness. So don't give up. There's hope for you. There's someone out there *just like you* and as long as you keep fighting for your happiness, there's hope you'll meet them.

My love goes out to you all, and wish me luck too! I know loneliness hurts. But that doesn't mean it's forever, and that doesn't mean it's hopeless. You are not alone in this world. You are lonely, but you are not alone.",lonely,You are not alone in this world.,2022-01-28 07:23:41

Hearing that made me realize just what I had forsaken, not through the divorce but by being a huge asshole for the first 5-7 years of our marriage (which in turn led to her being equal but opposite after we both agreed to reconcile rather than divorce in '15).   


To put it bluntly, she was everything I ever wanted and more than I deserved - I was just an immature prick. I ruined my dream of growing old with one person. She's not without fault mind you, but at least she *had a reason* to destroy me. I was just an emotionally unavailable/hurtful douchebag because I don't know why in hindsight.

Even when I tell the truth people try to deny it or say “no your family loves you” or other selfish crap to make themselves feel better and not actually have to show real empathy. I got sexually assaulted and abused multiple times in a mental hospital so I no longer trust mental health facilities. So even though I feel incredibly suicidal I have nowhere to turn to. I’m honestly planning to end things soon because this is such a pathetic way to live and bad luck is all I can blame.
I’m apparently beautiful kind charming and likable but people abandon me the moment they find out I’m a real person with real trauma and not some stupid fantasy in their head. People have always used me to feel better about themselves and do not treat me like an actual person. And when my very justified anger and hurt comes out I get accused of being negative or scary or too intense and dumped. I’m sick of everything and everyone. I literally don’t know where to find anyone to live with, I’m estranged from community, and if I continue this old hermit existence I’ve been forced into that caused me to lose my mind, I’m ending it :(",lonely,I have literally nobody in my life and I’m going through the darkest time.,2022-01-28 02:47:38

I spend absolutely all day/night sleeping and listening to music to think about something else, even during class I sleep and it's severely killing my grades because next year I have my degree...

I was told that seeing a psy is a good idea (even a high school psy) but after asking around I found out that they call the parents if my situation is serious (it is) and I would absolutely not want my family to know about my situation... I've already disappointed them too much, they have enough problems, I don't want them to see me as the failed child of the family tree, I try to pretend that everything is fine, even if at the moment I seem to be more and more tired and they have noticed it 

I really need to see a psy but that's what's stopping me...

So i'm a 32 year old guy. I'm not a virgin but its been a few years since I had sex. I'm not the type that goes to bars and pick up girls easily, i'm too shy/introverted for it.

So I tried online dating. But the problem with dating apps is that its one huge picture contest. The girls are showing their makeup and curves, and the dudes are showing their muscles at the gym, cars, and holiday pictures. I HATE pictures, I don't have any good ones. So what now?

Search for an erotic advert site that doesn't force you to add pictures, you can just add a topic title and text. Its a kind of erotic craigslist/Reddit I suppose. So search for a free site like this in your area.

So in this ad, I posed as a 29 year old virgin who wants to lose his virginity. It turns out that some women (not a lot of them, but some) find this cute or interesting. I got some messages in my mailbox, most of them were from hookers but 1 or 2 from normal women. I gave her my tel number and we started chatting for a short while and exchanged pictures. She was a hot looking single mom who had this hidden kink of sleeping with someone who doesn't have any experience.

We set a date and I went to her house last saturday, and spent the night there. We watched a movie and then we started kissing and went upstairs to her room, we took of our clothes and she started to suck on my dick for a short while and ofcourse then came ""the big moment"". I wasn't a virgin ofcourse but I needed to pose as one so when she gently guided my dick in her (without condom) I came like a fountain deep inside her. Great relief after years of not getting laid. The next morning I kissed her and thanked her and went back home.

So I'm sharing this with you because, if it works for me (and i'm a really introverted and shy guy), it can for you. If you are a virgin, and you are affraid to approach women the normal way, this might work. Or if you are not a virgin like me, and don't like hookers that much, this is a good tactic to get laid as well.

So good luck, give it a shot, and keep safe. :)",lonely,I discovered the best way to lose your virginity or get laid easily.,2022-01-27 20:00:29

Yet when I was feeling low or depressed (admittedly not reach the depths that she did), I would get only the briefest attention.

As I've said, I've known this friend for 4 years yet we never did anything together outside of our place (we lived together in social housing before I moved out recently). We never went to the pub to have a drink or chill out somewhere even though I asked numerous times. Either something came up like a family appointment or she wasn't feeling up to it. Yet whenever she needed something from the shop, wanted money for her nefarious habits or wanted her supposed best friend to be with her, I would always be there. Yet I could never get her to go with me for a drink. I made sure I never persisted and I would only ever gently nudge her. She'd tell me how she wanted to go, that it was overdue.

Anyway, my frustrations towards our friendship came out the other day and I don't her exactly what I thought of her. And I also told her to fuck off before blocking her number.

I've come to the conclusion I'm going to be stuck alone and as such might as well enjoy myself by soley focusing on my hobbies and things I enjoy. But in reality they seem more of just distractions. When they are done I feel empty, a sense of extreme loneliness returns and everything feels pointless and wasted if it isn't a shared moment.

Is it the depression? OCD intrusive thoughts/feelings? Or do I just not like the things I used to love? Why do I have this erge to need someone? Don't people keep saying focus on yourself, love yourself, focus on making money/completing goals/being successful? I mean, I don't really have the opportunities at the moment but I always try to keep going with my goals whenever possible. I just feel whats the point? I've never particularly cared about money, I'd be happy homeless if I was with someone I loved and who loved me. I mean that, I obviously wouldn't want to stay homeless but that sort of connection means far more to me than any ammount of money ever would. But why?
Everyone I've ever met seems to care more about money.

It's been the same with everything. What they can get out of me. About what I can give them in terms of anything and what's out there that's better than I can offer, so that I can be replaced after they get fed up or bored of me.
They seem happy. I got told several times I'd meet someone eventually who wants me for me. It's never them of course and it still hasn't happened yet and doubtfully ever will. But when people are like that, when I've been constantly hurt, nearly killed by 3 people and told I'm just being melodramatic because that was years ago and I'm a man so should just get over it, and when I've been involved in trying to solve people's dramas at their request many times in the past, and seen the things people do to each other. The risks of dating and constant rejection or outright ignoring of my existence, why on Earth do I still feel lonely and want someone? Am I stupid?

I know not everyone is bad, but I don't fit in anywhere, and don't really feel welcomed for long either. I'm not perfect and I never pretend to be. I've tried to work on myself, my therapist even said I was ""hyper self aware"", and I've ask people how I am and how to improve and so on. I've been more than accepting and open for others. I'm not a doormat either or unable to talk to people, but no one stays for long and I've often found I enjoyed my own company. But that feeling never goes. Even in my sleep or when I wake. It feels like I'm being punished for something. Why do I have all these, hobbies, goals, and aspirations if they don't really mean anything to me in the end and then at the same time I long for love and a relationship even though I know it can't happen no matter how I try, (yet I still try), and have been hurt so much before to the point I don't trust anyone and prefer my own company.
Am I crazy? Stupid? Or am I missing something?

I know no one can answer this directly, but I wonder if I'm alone, or if anyone has insight. I've had existential dread many times before, so prehaps it's related to that, I don't know. I guess this is a cry for help, because I really don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to be trapped in this situation forever.

I guess what makes me feel this way, is that i always see my friends and more specifically 2 of my close friends always with new girls every other day and always matching with people on tinder and always going to girls places. It just makes me wonder why they are able to do it so easily, like i even think i’m more attractive then one and i still just barely get any matches on tinder, meet new girls, etc. I just don’t get it or understand why that i can’t get lucky or get something. I also know however i shouldn’t even be comparing myself to others but recently just intrusive thoughts makes this all just 10x worse.

Which at the end of the day just makes me feel more self conscious that i’m not attractive, people don’t want to talk to me, etc. And i quite frankly don’t know exactly what to do.

How have you ""managed"" it or changed it (etc)?

I've moved cities quite a lot growing up, I lived and was schooled in 4 countries and had 6 schools and 2 universities. 

Because of this there was a lot of ""always the new kid"" time happening - being the new kid, developing connections, having to move on, trying to keep connections that don't last, start again.

I found that almost always the reason (as far as I'm aware) that the friendship/connections didn't last when I'd moved away was that it's so much easier to maintain a relationship with someone that you see in person regularly and have big/small interactions with, than with someone who you need to send emails to/facetime - it's almost like the extra effort is too much in comparison to everyone else that's still there around you and you can see in person - a situation of out of sight out of mind.

I've been in the same location now for 5 years and have made fleeting friendship and aquiantances, but I can't seem to dredge up the emotions in me to put great effort into keeping up regular contact to deepen the relationship, or to dredge up the energy/desire to try to enter new friendships from people that I meet. I don't know if I'm trying to be subconsciously self-protective, or have slid into seeing people as just transient now. I would love to have the deep connections that you hear about or see online (etc), but at the moment I just feel largely unmoored from everyone.

Because this is not exactly the type of topic that you would enter into at a dinner party or find someone easily who quite understands or has been through something similar, then I don't know whether this is something that others have felt before, or whether it is something that I have developed by myself alone.",lonely,Anyone else?

669,Skuiken666,1643253573,1,"Hi everybody. Im a 29 years old woman from southamerica just really going through it. I’ll keep it simple: App. 6 months ago my boyfriend for 7 years (and close friend for almost 15 years, since middle school) broke up with me. We had a home and 2 cats. It was very sudden. I didn’t expected it, so it truly hit me very, very hard.
I cryed a lot, i suffered a lot. It was the most difficult time of my life. I’ve never experienced loss like this before, even considering that i lost my dad on 2020, just for reference. It was absolutly heartbreaking for me. 
anyways, it’s been 6 months and i’m doing pretty fine. I’ve overcome the crisis. I’m a functional human being again. I laugh, i party, i work, i do sports, i act like myself. My ex and i even decided to keep our friendship as long as it was possible, mostly because we share a good amount of friends and it was easier for both of us to try to keep our lifes going as usual. 
I dont regret this, i really like our friendship, probably because i knew him first as friends (we started dating after almost 10 years of friendship). I really like and appreciate his friendship. 
Anyways, that’s the background. The reason i’m posting this today is this: i,ve come to the realization that he has moved one; he’s starting to date again, to be interested in other women (which is 100% normal, dont get me wrong), that he has decided to move forward with his life. And i’ve not. And i feel lonely, really lonely.
I’ts a very strange scenario: i’m young, i’m fairly good looking, i’m a lawyer, i’m really funny. I dont have major issues, i’m doing pretty well for my age, i’m smart, blablabla.
But, even knowing that, i can’t help but feeling like i’m not worth it, like everyone is destined to meet someone but me, like i’’ not pretty enough, that i should loose weight, that no one is going go really, really like me.
I just feel hopeless.
I know that i’m in a good position,everyone tells me that, that i’ll meet someone, that i’m just lost. Maybe i am. Mayb you are right.
But i can’t help but feeling absolutely lost and devastated as i walk home crying, no seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I’m not worth it. Everybody is going forward with their lifes but me. 
I’m stuck.
I’m lost. 
I’m really having a hard time.",lonely,Grown up woma trying to feel less like a teenager,2022-01-27 14:19:33

I have had issues due to my childhood trauma and recently being SA 2 years ago. I guess he had enough of it and I don't blame him. We are deeply in love with one another and I wish this hadn't happened. He blocked me on imessages, unfollowed me on instagram, and still follows me on twitter.  He had taken everything on his social media of us. I still have everything up on my page and don't have the heart to delete them. does anyone think he will come back? I let him know I'm still deeply in love with him before blocking me, I know deep down he still loves me but I just want him back. I know I need to better myself but I can't function properly because of how sad I am. I had a manic episode which led to him breaking up with me. I just started therapy 4 months ago and have been dealing with my issues for about 5 years now. I Want to talk to him so bad because iI ruined everything good in my life. I truly have no one to go to right now and am feeling really suicidal. He was all I Had good left. and I completely fucked it up. I know I cant rely on one person for happiness but I'm completely miserable without him. Does anyone think he'll contact me again?

She walked in, saw him, talked for a minute and *immediately* began flirting. They talked for a solid twenty minutes at least before walking off with his number and they began texting the whole night


Come to find out, last night he had sex with her -- despite him being married. I don't want to get into too much of the details in the one in a million chance of him somehow seeing this post but it just baffles me how easy it is for some people 



I think the worst part of it all, though, was when the guys at work were talking about it earlier today and one of my coworkers said ""damn, this guy's pulling bitches. Psalm, what's your excuse for not finding someone?"" 


So I said it, without missing a beat actually. ""Sorry, you must be *this* tall to find someone"" and proceeded to put my hand over my head, palm down. It's not a lie -- I don't get taken seriously by literally anyone because of my height. I'm the butt of everyone's jokes and that by itself would've been fine, but **now** people started saying stupid shit like ""WelL I kNOw a GuY THAt's oNlY 5'1 aND He FouNd someoNe!!ONe!!1!!

735,Akio_Taki,1643219573,1,"Well, I just want to tell my story since it's been bothering me for like 2 and a half years or so. But it still going to bother me even after telling someone but I just want some of the burden to get off my shoulders. So 3 years before, in the year of 2019, there was still no covid. Still had school and stuff. And for the 2nd time, I had a relationship with someone who's older than me again (sorry, I just really like girls that are older than me but smaller than me). She was 2 years older than me and I was 14 at the time, 2nd year junior high school student. We really had great times, well great is an understatement. The thing that I really like about her is, she's a really simple worth it girl. And I also really like when she gets angry or moody sometimes because it's like looking at a kirby that's holding a knife, that's how cute she is when she gets angry but anyway.. We always ate streetfood (If you're Filipino you'll get what I mean), always had fun in the most simple ways. Every day/night having video calls, talking with her and sometimes when her little sister caught her having a video call with me, we'll have a very fun conversation. It was one of the best moments in my highschool life. I realized that I loved her more than my 1st girlfriend. But one day, I introduced her to my mom but not physically at first because... it's complicated. I'll go simplify it. ""I don't like her looks, go find someone else who looks better). But don't hate my mom, please. After she knew what my girlfriend looked like, everything got complicated. I was being forced to break up with her, But I didn't tell my girlfriend because I don't want her to get hurt as well as be angry at my mom. So after a week or so, I get blackmailed again and again just so that I would break up with my girlfriend. I got grounded again and again. Blackmail after blackmail. Everyday after school, me and my mom will argue. She didn't even let me hangout with my friends outside anymore. And after a month, I got tired. I made the hardest decision I ever made that time. I called my girlfriend at night, it was by 9pm or 10pm maybe. I told her that we should breakup. Then our friend joined the call after my girlfriend told her what's happening. They both asked me why but I didn't told them. I wanted to protect my mom. My girlfriend.. I watched her cry, I listened to her asking me again and again why I was breaking up with her. I pretended to cry that time because I thought, she would think it's real. Then she asked me to let her see my face if I was really crying, but I didn't do it. I just said ""I'm sorry"" then left the call.
I didn't feel anything that night, I was just staring at my ceiling thinking ""Did I do the right thing?"" Again and again and again until I fell asleep. The following days were really akward. Her friends kept on staring at me like they were going to kill me. We broke up in march. I was happy for a few months. But right when july hit, I suddenly felt this sense of guilt. July 2, my birthday, I felt kinda happy but mostly down. July-december I felt so guilty because of what I did to my her (my ex-girlfriend). Then the whole year of 2020 until to this day. January 27, 2022... I still feel the guilt. I feel so bad, I feel so angry at myself for doing that to her. Everytime I attempt to talk to a new girl, I don't feel happy or satisfied. I still love my ex-girlfriend. I know it's kinda wrong because I was the one who broks up with her, but it was forced. But I can't do anything now, she may be happy with someone else or she may be having her best days of her life now. I don't want to bother her anymore because I don't want her to be sad again. But I guess that's life, we always regret in the end. Thank you guys for reading my story and maybe, just maybe if she's able to see this. I just want to say I am really sorry, and well here's the explanation that you were asking for.. sorry it took almost 3 years.. Love you always and take care and live the best life that you could ever have. Again, thank you guys so much. It means alot to me.

I remember during the first year we met there was this interesting quote. It stated that if your friendship lasts 7 years then you with will be life long friends. We said we would reach this goal one day. 

Happy 7th year. 
Sorry we failed at year 6. 
Things got complicated when we fell in love in year 1. 
Broke up in year 2.
Tried to reconcile in year 3-4. Sorry I wanted to move on with someone new. How you left me hanging after I hurt you and apologized scarred me. I apologize now because I know that we both were just reacting. I had so much anger in me those years. But you still made me smile.

Year 5 I got married even though I shouldn’t have. That was the year you wanted to be serious. I apologize for not telling you that I was going back to her. She was a safe decision. I was scared to task a risk with you. I know now that you don’t cut as much or the dark thoughts aren’t there. I realize that for some reason I’m the one who made them worse. 

Year 6 we almost had an affair. We decided to leave each other alone after that moment. You even got a new man. It hurt but I was happy that you were happy. 
Year 6 was also the year you came back for friendship. I wish you didn’t. Because I fucked it all up being unable to move on from you. I’m a despicable person. I reminded you of your past that you wanted to do better from. I guess I am just toxic.

Honestly, I don’t even know why these moods come and go so much for me. It’s been a year since we last spoke. I know you consider me a manipulative user.

I probably was. Something about that alcohol and you on my mind. It just made a horrible concoction and I hurt you because of it. I told you we couldn’t be friends anymore. I didn’t choose you. I chose her. 
I know we almost went down that taboo road after I got married.

I’m regretfully happy we didn’t. 
You found another man to love which I even gave you advice on. That was suppose to be it. 

Why the hell did you come back, offering an olive branch!? And now look at us! You allowed me a chance to fuck everything up!Damn it! I never told you I was drunk that night when I asked a question that I shouldn’t have. I was also tipsy when I sent that long winded complaint text message. I didn’t even remember it in the morning.

We were suppose to leave all that behind us and I brought it back up again because I couldn’t deal with the pit that I was in and I needed you there again to lean on like old times.
Yea…I was toxic and manipulative. I knew I shouldn’t tried to be your friend again. I knew I wasn’t healthy yet. But I said yes because I can’t ever deny you. But you left me. You left everything behind to strive on for a better future and I’m proud of you for that.

But I hate you. You couldn’t even tell me you forgave me after I apologized profusely. 6 years of love and friendship and you left me cold in the streets. Sometimes I forget how much is bitch you can be. I should have never forgiven you of your toxic behavior. Of your lies and deceit. But that’s my mistake.

And now as always I’m the one picking up the pieces and can’t face you again because of my pride. How I was the fuck up. 
So here’s my last damn apology. I apologize for giving a damn. I apologize for not fucking you over. 
I apologize for not leaving you broken when you were depressed and suicidal.
I apologize for stopping myself from screwing you in the car when I had the chance. 
I apologize for always giving you my time and tears and this fucking heart.
I apologize for all the advice I gave.
I apologize for ever loving you.

My dad and brother couldn't go to the game due to it being in the mid week, they said I can just bring a friend along. I couldn't, I can't. I have one friend who made an excuse instead of saying he just didn't want to, and that's all. At 19, I couldn't think of anyone because I can't. I went to the football game by myself, got a pint by myself. And I enjoyed it for a time, but when I looked around and saw people laughing with their friends it just hits rock bottom.

It reminds me of my old friend who passed away every time, it makes me think ""what would we be doing? Would we go for a pint now that we're adults? Would we still have fun and go to the woods to make random shit like we used to? And most of all, would we tell each other everything like we used to, instead of hiding everything inside for myself to slowly break apart?""

I find it disturbing that my hands curl up in disgust whenever they get close to touching you.
I just don’t know what the source of this emotion is…
Is it me? Because they recognize that I cannot measure up to my previous self?
The raw passion I had…
Trying to hide myself from the world, right between your borders.
Or maybe they are disgusted with you?
How you handicapped me and lured me in with a promise of sanctuary…
A place where everyone is equal, ugly, twisted, dark, afraid…
Understanding of the scars we all have on us…A family I guess..

I think I lost my key…
I think the paradise became too small
I mean we all out grow apartments or houses…or if you have new additions to the family…
I mean we all have to move on right?

Ha! Who I am kidding, 
But for some reason I needed to leave you…
Pathetic right?
Trust me I still laugh today…
I laugh…
I keep the blanket over the mirror
I tell myself I’m getting better without you

Am I?

Okay yes earlier I lied and said I lost the key… 
Yea I still have the key…remember? Yup the pencil with chew marks on it and no eraser.
I believed I should never erase what I released inside your lines…
I needed to look at myself…with every Iota revealing another Centimeter of my character….

Sadly….well lately I’ve woken up most of the mornings and never looking in the Mirror to see who I am.

Actually….I threw the mirror out the window….

Every poem, journal entry, memory, tears, misspelled word…every inch of me….

Gone….
I just wanted to say hello, you know for the longest I hated you…I hated her…I hated this amalgamation….

I wanted to watch it all burn….
And I did. 
But I think I’m worse off because of that decision.
Forgetting who I was...was the dumbest mistake I ever made

Because now I don’t even know what my innocence used to look like…

had in common. she never made me pay for anything.
even gave me money that i didn't at all ask for. i would
clean her apartment but she never asked me to i just
did it. I would always cook for her &amp; sometimes have

My grandma who helped raised me was also emotionally abusive.  She always felt that women should be seen and not heard and should be in the kitchen and I’m a huge activist so you can imagine how that went… for example she caused abandonment issues in me telling me my mom should have been home from work by now and she probably left me and my brother and she didn’t blame her.  She’d call me fat even though I was very fit since I was a dancer etc.  Now I’m starting to feel my mom only acts like she cares and I’m realizing there was a lot of emotional abuse there too but more emotional neglect than anything.  She let the men in her life talk down to me and say whatever they wanted and then behind their backs say it wasn’t right.  She also won’t talk to me if I come with my concerns to her.  She will never say sorry if she’s wrong either.

Ultimately, I’ve never known a normal relationship.  All of this was highlights as I have my own struggles including ptsd, ocd, major depression disorder and anxiety.. 

My ex continues to be abusive by using our kids as tools, my brother is still in my ear even tho he just got out of prison and I have his child in my custody and my mom is still doing the same as always.  I have no friends as my friendships never last.  

I’m at the point that if I didn’t have my kids I would have killed myself a long time ago.

All I want to do is take my kids and abandon everything and leave everything behind but I know more problems will wait for me as it is the people I attract and am attracted to..or back to maybe that’s how people really are.

I have days where I am feeling pretty down on myself and depressed at times and I do not know why. Things are not bad per say currently I help manage a hotel (which is a hour from current main home and the city) the hotel is owned by my foreign parents, they are pretty loving and I usually spend 2-3 days out of the week at the hotel assisting my parents while my parents are there all week(they also live on the property). The hotel has been a little difficult for my parents to manage because of the language barrier and technology barrier now since they are older but all in all they still manage, but me being there definitely makes things a lot easier for them. Managing hotels has always been the family business and something they have done for 30 years, while I love being able to help my parents and be there for them, I myself hate managing a hotel but I know my parents need my help for the time being. My parents also pay me decent for my time. Outside of the hotel I do photography which I do in the city, I am currently on a hiatus trying to rebrand my photography business but I have been struggling to find the motivation for it, many days I feel depressed and low and I do not get any work done. I get all in my head. I really want to advance in my career and find a path but I don't know how at times. I feel stuck.

Im also in a loving relationship and she is doing wonderful in her career something I would never say to her because I always support her and want the best for her but I do internally feel jealous at times at the amount of money she is making because its a good bit more than me and how she has a clear pathway for her but besides that I love her very much. I guess I just want to be on a good path like her, I get scared sometimes she will think I am a bum and leave me. I also struggle with also achieving my personal goals like working out, reading more etc.

Many days I have had thoughts of killing myself which sucks because I know I'm in a good position in life and I am still very young. I know my life isn't bad and there a lot of things to feel positive about but everyday when I wake up i think i want to do better. I want to do better in my career and get back to doing photography consistently and not struggling to work, I want to be a better boyfriend and son, I want to do better for myself. I struggle with staying focused and disciplined. So many days i feel lost and I do not know where i am going. I also find myself in the cycle of comparing to others.

Like if I’d hypothetically kill myself I don’t think anyone would **really** care enough besides my parents. Not one some fake psudeo activist, suicide September month when in reality you don’t give a damn about mens mental health.

Mann this shit sucks because this is supposed to be a “carefree time period”.

God all I do is come home from school, stay home on weekdays, weekends, and go back to school

Not even holidays, guess what I’m still stuck at home, it’s like solitary confinement

Yes, I have friends and I socialize as much as I can (lately less because of the challenges of Covid, which doesn't make things better for me). But I have a constant, nagging need for romantic companionship. I'm 28 year olds and I've never been in a relationship. I have a need for a deep, romantic connection and I have tried very hard to address this need. I have gone out on a number of dates and I've put myself out there, and they've never lead anywhere. A recent one ended poorly for me.

In what other area of life does someone communicate, ""I have a need that's not being met"" and the response is: ""Learn to live without it""? I'm so tired of this bullshit. I am constantly told, learn to be happy with being single, you don't need a partner to be happy, not everyone gets partners, etc. Great. I've had plenty of time to exist without a partner. I have my own apartment, my own car, two cats. I pay my own bills. I don't have someone to help me carry up heavy groceries to my apartment, I don't have someone to help me take out the trash -- I never get any help with basic things. I'm single and expected to be fully independent and capable of doing things that partnered people get help with on a consistent basis. I'm so sick of this. I don't want to be independent anymore. I want someone who cares about me, loves me, provides me with companionship, and helps me out as I do them.

&amp;#x200B;

But when you’re really alone you skip all that, because the only thing you’ll ever really do is die. And besides the empty distractions, you know it, it’s like being terminally ill, morbid sadness as your life passes by like scenery behind a car window. Your death will be a story in itself, your life will be reduced and objectified by how you died, how it was sad for the people who knew you, or failing that for the people who found you, or the paramedics who couldn’t save you, who’d forget about you the next day when someone else dies, someone who lost more, who will be missed more, because there’s nothing to miss of a lonely life. Lonely people are worthless collections of uninteresting sad days. The only thing they’ll ever do worth mentioning is die.",lonely,Dying is the only thing lonely people ever do,2022-01-26 01:37:43

I’m one of those people where making others laugh makes me happy or just spending time with people makes me happy. Due to the pandemic i lost touch with basically all my friends and on a day to day basis it gets really challenging. I’ve also put on a lot of weight from being fit in the beginning of quarantine and i’m working on myself as in mentally and physically but every night i breakdown because i feel as though i’m never doing enough. I’ve been training ever single day and dieting just to at least be happy with when i look in the mirror and i’ve been seeing progress yet i still don’t feel happy. I told myself after my last breakup (a month ago) i’m not getting into any relationships or dating in general. However i managed to start talking to one of my old friends and we began flirting and it went on for like a couple of  days and i finally began to feel appreciated and loved again. I know people are gonna say love yourself before you love someone else i’ve gotten every speech and and advice ever. I just wanna share my story and not be judged like everyone else. Anyways i definitely thought there was a spark and even though it was just a few days, someone who’s been not even being able to smile whenever we’d even just text i couldn’t take that smile off of my face. Last night she told me she can tell i need to heal still from my previous relationship and that “we shouldn’t be doing this” i understand she cares about my well being and stuff which is good in the bigger picture but to me i just lost the one person who was pulling me out of the dark. I know i’m just 16 and im fairly young compared to the people here but i’ve experienced a lot and been through a lot. I try on a day to day basis to message people and just have some sort of interaction to make me happy knowing they’re okay but most of the time i don’t even get a reply. I don’t expect anyone to message me or check up on me because the people that knew me knew this is how i am they’d be shocked. I’m usually the life of the party and always smiling and laughing.  I guess i’ll just keep on training and staying in my corner because i’ve never been this scared to be hurt again and last night was tough especially because we were flirting for the whole night and then she hit me that she’s a good girl and at the end of the day she’s right plus she deserves better anyways if you’ve made it this far thanks for listening to my story ♥️.",lonely,16M Struggling with getting my stuff together,2022-01-26 01:24:29

One has been my friend for almost 2 years and a while after we started talking more mid-2021, he doesn’t say much back when I text him but he’s explained it’s because he’s an introvert and just doesn’t have much to say. But it’s still frustrating telling him a life problem he used to comfort me about but he just likes the message. Or I talk about my day and he says nothing back. I’ve been pretty lonely since adulthood began and it’s very frustrating and affects my mood when I either have no one to talk to about my day or I tell someone but they don’t say anything back. My other friend is more of a talking stage and we were talking a lot, I liked him back and he says he really likes me and would date me but he now takes half a day - days to text me back. He explained he just isolates himself when he’s going through something and isn’t used to texting anyone but it just makes me feel very lonely to not have someone to message about my life or anything. I hate that I’m an extrovert and this is my brain and I need to talk to people who I like to be happy. Social anxiety has also made making friends super hard and makes it all hell because I need so much social interaction, I don’t get nearly enough and then I’m scared of social interaction with new people.

I had washed my key fob Sunday on accident and couldn't find the other keys.  I hadn't left all day and her friend picked her up and our daughter to hang out. I had left the house to actually go and my key fob wouldn't starty car. The alarm went off.  It took me over an hour to find my other key. The Court house was closed by than.  No big deal do it tomorrow.  I went and picked them up because they had no ride.  She asked did you get them and I told her what happened. She accused me of lying and got quiet. Now she's.nuts sometimes.  We get home I start making food. Everything is fine. Than she's watching TV and her mom calls.  She gets really angry and says no I'm not ok and turns to me who's behind her in the dining room and I say ummm what did I do?  She says fuck.you stay out of my life.  Than goes to the room slams the door. She does all this in front of our child.  I can hear her mom say why don't you stay with him he's always been good to you she says out loud. I'm not gay I've never been gay we've been together for 15 years ! She's full of shit.   I got up went and knocked on th door and she went nuts.  She opened it said I'm a liar I'm a piece of shit.

It feels like that should be WEIRD, shouldn't it? I'm a twenty-something woman, sweet as hell and not particularly strange, but I have NO friends.

Scratch that I've got all of three friends, all of which have — a lot more friends to hang out with than me. And I'd feel so, so bad trying to demand some more attention like a best. So I've been trying to make some new friends, y'know? Discord servers, subreddits, etc.

I just — can't do it for some reason. It's not like there's anything wrong with me — I've got people that really try with me, but I'm so anxious all the time. I don't even know why. I want to hang out, laugh, have some fun — I just want to CHILL. But people make me clam up and before I can even step out of my shell they're too tired of waiting and give up, it seems.

Christ's sake, the past couple of Discord servers I REALLY loved the people in them. I felt bold and spoke with them a little (even if I was too shy to VC, which sucks 'cos I feel like I haven't had a conversation with anyone outside of my family in ages), then I woke up and suddenly want to leave as quietly as I can. For what reason? That doesn't even make sense, it just IS and I hate it.

It's so miserable. I want to socialize so badly, but I feel completely incapable of managing it.

I want LEADERS as friends. Because I'm not one. I'm too shy to even really be called a follower. I'm more like a lurker waiting for someone to just magically know I'm there and want to talk. But that's a ridiculous expectation. It isn't friendship if everyone involved isn't BEING involved, but for some reason I can't even do that.

God, I'm so bored and I'm so tired and I wish I had what other people had. I want random friends that text me while I sleep and just call me while I'm making dinner, that'll play games with me and watch the latest trendy anime with me, teach me how to play DND, just make me feel like I'm on someone's mind and give me a reason to want to see stupid memes and send them because, ""Oh, ___ would get a kick out of this."" 

Nobody's ever patient enough with me to let me get there, though, and it sucks. I can't help being shy. I really wish I wasn't. I'm so lonely all of the time because of it. But it feels like there's nothing I can do about it at all.",lonely,Sucks having so few friends and such terrible anxiety towards making new ones when you're constantly craving company.,2022-01-25 17:21:49

984,dhfi4nb34,1643087436,1,"I'm a  and I feel like everyone I meet hates me. For some reason no one wants to talk to me. I occasionally have small-talk with people, but its mostly just brief discussions about school. Even the people who I've previously considered friends don't talk to me about much aside from this now.

I can only assume it's a problem with me, as everyone else seems to socialize fine. I don't know what I'm doing wrong though. I don't think I'm that socially awkward--when people try talking to me I don't avoid the conversation and I try to be interesting. I don't think my personality is that bad too: I'm not rude/mean to anyone. I don't really talk to new people unless they initiate a conversation with me first, through--out of fear that they don't want to talk to me. Multiple times just in the past year when I have asked someone new something they ignored me.

I only have 1 person I consider a ""real"" friend now, as in he seems to be the only person who actually wants to talk/listen to me. Then again, our conversations aren't very ""deep"", just about a few mutual interests. I just wish I had someone to open up to and have personal conversations with, but I don't feel comfortable sharing with any of the people I know. If most people don't even want to even talk to me, why would they want to hear this? The one person I opened up to in my entire life was an online friend, who's since stopped talking to me, unfortunately.

I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to open up more and get more social. I feel like its too late for my current situation, as I'm graduating high-school soon. Hopefully I'll improve by the time I start university.",lonely,I feel like everyone hates me,2022-01-25 16:10:36

It's a constant nagging sadness, sleepless nights of shameful tears and clutching until I manage to fall asleep. With no one to really turn to else I feel that... I don't know. This all goes, hand in hand with other feelings I've had these past few weeks that have come to a head tonight.

I've never really made these posts before... or reached out in this sense, so i apologize.

I don't really have anyone online, i don't have anyone in person, I don't feel like what I do have is... well, available or willing to help. As I mentioned, like I'm stumbling alone... waiting to fall.

I’ve really tried and even went out and did things alone if I didn’t have anyone to go with but at the end of the day. I feel like it’s just coping and being alone makes you want people around you more. My favorite thing to do is to take long walks at the beach. I’ve done it alone many times and every single time I wished someone was there with me. I really tried to like being alone but I know I’m just pretending to like it. I always tell myself I’m better off alone but I know that’s a lie deep down. But that’s just me.

I'm almost 27 and I've been horribly depressed and lonely most of my life, but in the past 2 months, I've finally found a local community of weirdos like me and have probably been the happiest I've ever been. What sucks is I'll be moving 800 miles away in May, and the town I'll be living in is way out in the middle of nowhere. Like, it's a 15-20 minute drive to go to the grocery store, not to mention there's barely anyone my age around, and what few there are definitely not really my kind of people. On top of that, even when I was at my worst where I live now, I at least had some concerts and events to look forward to, but where I'll be moving to, everything like that will be 3 or 4 hours away; it's just a weirdly located remote place where any major cities are super far away.

I have no choice in the matter either because I'm currently living with my dad and can't afford my own place, probably not even with roommates, and it's got me totally unsure of what to do. All I can think of is to try and emotionally brace myself for taking 30 steps backward socially.

1058,anonymouslooker461,1643049830,1,"As most of you know, loneliness is a big issue in the world. The United States and Japan are both labeled as some of the most lonely countries in the world. For a while now, I've been trying to figure out why is this the case. Why isn't working enough? Why is finding social activities that benefit our interests so hard? Why are we scared of talking to someone we don't know very well while in high school we could've known over 50 people and not scared to talk to any of them? I believe the solution to this situation can be found within the public school system. 

School is a lot like work in a way. Kids are expected to go from one class to the next to learn things that should be beneficial to their lives...But there's just one thing sticking out. Children are given double the opportunities to socialize than adults in the workplace. Due to the many clubs, they could join down to the most important thing in my opinion...The lunch break.

Working is like school with the expectation to be in class and follow rules all day. Sometimes without a break. This causes people to become distant from others because imagine how hard it was trying to socialize with your fellow students while class started. That is working for more than 8 hours a day. 

Now how do we fix this? We must understand that this situation cannot be systemically fixed through people's advice online on ""how to be confident enough to make friends with your coworkers."" It sure wasn't like that in high school. And you know it. It was a lot easier to talk to someone because what else were you going to do when you weren't pressured into listening to what a teacher said or doing a pop quiz. At work, they expect you to do outside of what you're supposed to do just to keep you from ""wasting your boss' clock."" That's why your relationships with your coworkers are so much more divided than it was with your classmates. And to fix this, it won't take the kindness of your manager or the hope that the CEO of the company you're working for will give in to the loneliness epidemic in your country...But a simple law was passed by the government to make things better.

It starts with something simple. I dub it, the ""lunch break act."" This act will require companies making a certain amount of money to shut down for a certain time for their workers to eat in peace without their breaks being cut short because they're needed in a certain area. Food would be provided for free or very inexpensive. Now you may be asking, what is the point of this? When you were on break at school you were kind of forced to talk to people to break whatever awkward silence there was when eating. This caused people to find their social groups where they fit in and grow closer with their classmates. And the same effect should happen in the workplace. I believe work tricks people into thinking that they don't want friends by making it so hard to make friends. But when allowed to do so, I believe these ""work-focused"" types will break down and socialize in the same way as the ""academically focused student"" does.

This act is only an idea for now but I believe this would be a strong way of fighting back the loneliness problem we currently have in the world.",lonely,"Fixing loneliness through the implantation of a ""lunch break act""",2022-01-25 05:43:50

Wait, that came out wrong ngl. Sorry to all of the men on here, your mental health is truly important to me and you have the right to open up when you’re ready.

Anyway i spent most of my days off-work alone in my appartment geeking.

So it's a little bit edgy and cringy but since my social life outside of work has become close to non-existant, i've started to often asked myself that question : 

If i happen to die (ex : heart attack), how much time would pass before someone would be looking for me and knok on my door and who would that person be beside my boss ?

I honestly am too affraid to find the answer and yet i still think about it a lot as dark as it is.

Today was one of those days where my mom and I got into it because I didn’t want to pursue medicine

She kept on telling me why I didn’t want to do it?

I said it was never in me, never had a passion for people, I never had a say with what I wanted to do anyways.

I also said that no one in my immediate/extended family are doctors anyways.

I keep on telling her the pros of what I want to do. And if that doesnt work I’d just pursue music.

She interrupted me saying that I’m too hardheaded and I never listen

Your choice of friends? Look at you now you literally have no friends

A job? Look at where you are now?

Driving early (without a permit)? Couldn’t do that

Hobbies? You’re literally pathetic and on Reddit 24/7 if not that you’re always stuck in your room or watching porn 

You want to do computer science? When you can’t even naturally interact with others…good luck with that

And if not music again, your choice

Majority of these artists are poor and stuck into crappy labels. 

You just don’t fucking listen do you?

That’s why YOU FAILED ME

In my head I was like, I could never please her

Let’s say I finally take the premed route but choose another specialization they’ll still be conflict would I still be happy?

I mean everything she said isn’t wrong either, it’s not like I have anything going for me either

I essentially feel blind to my own intuition as every mistake I make, not even mistake but every choice I make is always comes out as shitty and bad.

It started back in 2014-15 when was growing up (you know  the adolescent age).
My school was far from home (it was a posh one) but it was never fun! As a result after lockdown the interaction with my only 3 friends stoped!
My parents had that old ideologies where it's better to beat your kids to death when they start showing personality traits or asking for privacy so they never tried to support me mentally (mental support isn't a thing according to them) more on that I am a failure to them.
That's not it I have a sister too who loves to bully, shout or yell at me for unnecessary reasons (I'm like a punching bag to her)
I haven't talked properly to my father since I was like 14 two years later I stopped talking to mother too, cause was like those side taking beings who like to take side and corner the other.
And from the last 2 years I living like a rental guy in my own parents house. Gonna move out and never gonna look back again. Over these years I had stoped giving shit about things, stoped being bothered, I am more on the selfish side of the spectrum.
I had never felt loved all I have felt is alone!

27F Back in Dec, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs. We were in contact via Instagram messages. Later in wk we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie. Eventually I asked he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. I was not as bubbly at movies compared to when we first met up, I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. When we first met, we ended with a hug. When we spoke on phone, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but at movies it was odd, he sent a message after saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. Flash fwd to yesterday, he sends a message on IG with a reference to Xbox exclusives, we used to be back &amp; forth about console wars. He continued to follow me on IG but I removed him when he called it quits, yet he unmatched me on the dating app. While I would have stopped talking to him regardless, why is it so hard to find connection?

So yeah I’m kinda drained right now. Me and this guy are getting along, he says he treats his friends as his “precious little treasures” and I can talk to him about anything any time. He says he’s really chill with anything and he just wants to support others and make them feel special.

I message him today and he’s going on about how he wishes his close friends were in the same time zone so they can play together. I suggest we play together. He suggests a moba that we both played. I tell him that mobas tend to get people really tilted and it might not be a good idea. He reassured me that he just wants to have fun with friends. I tell him okay then let’s go standard because I don’t play ranked. To which he says he doesn’t like standard because of how hard it is to find good players. I just tell him that it’s standard so there’s nothing to lose and so no reason to get tilted but he won’t go for it. Here’s the full conversation afterwards.

Him: “oof I’d help you climb but I probably can’t match with you”
Me: “I mean climbing isn’t the problem I just don’t want to play ranked”
Him: “fair enough, I don’t really blame you for not wanting to” (I assume this is his way of trying to say I’m trash for not playing ranked)
Me: “alright guess that’s off the table then”
Him: “well I play standard but only with friends so...”

I’m kinda scared where I live from past problems with my neighbors so I spend all my downtime home alone worrying I’m unsafe. Anyways, I got off work today around 3 and was so sad I was going to have to go sit in my apartment alone for the rest of the night. To my surprise, a coworker asked me to go shopping and watch a movie at her place. I had never hung out with this coworker before but she’s always been so nice to me at work. I had a great time, I never shop for clothes as I’m anxious to go alone so I was so excited to go. I even spoiled myself and bought a couple outfits for clinicals. I had sm fun but as soon as I left I got pulled over plugging my phone in bc it “looked like I was on my phone”. I pulled directly into the arbys besides where I was pulled over to buy dinner before going home, My heart was beating so hard from getting pulled over and I was shaking. During my panick attack I hit the curb. I destroyed my tire (I bought 4 months ago) I destroyed my rim, and scuffed my paint. Now I’m in bed crying myself to sleep bc I don’t understand why I can’t ever just be happy? I had a fantastic night and this is how it ended?

1150,earthquakejake03,1642996552,1," currently in college. 

In my whole first semester of college I have made 0 friends and now in my second semester, I have on average 1 conversation every 2 weeks with my therapist. It’s incredibly lonely and I struggle with so much self doubt and anxiety and this contributed to the fact I have no friends in college. 

I have friends back home from high school, but I am the least social one and I realized I was always the left out one at parties and things and it only got worse as I got older. I would leave functions by myself just to excessively punch myself in the head because I felt like I couldn’t fit in with them and I hated myself for it. 

I thought college was going to bring me a fresh start and it did, but I have just become a loner. I am always by myself, I do everything alone. All my friends from high school notice too because I would tweet depressing things about how I was lonely (regret that btw). I hated myself so much i started cutting because I lost control in the loneliness
 
Fast forward to now, nothings changed about my environment, still a loner, but I just keep myself motivated by telling myself keep doing these good things (working out every day, eating healthy, finishing all assignments) and good things will happen eventually. 

Its just so 
Fucking

Start from the starting - i used to be a very shy socially awkward guy with little to no talents - My parents never let me as a kid to step out and my whole pre teen years i was pretty much locked up alone in home (without TV) so i used to read books - and slowly i got studious - Straight 10 and became ranker


In class 5th i saw a girl (maybe noticed for the first time) - liked her - But she didn't care enough to talk - I tried to start talking (random stuff - school work and cartoons - i didn't know what and how to talk to girls) but i was the loser so obviously she never even responded (not even courtesy)

6th class - we all sections got mixed up - i saw the opportunity- became the most loud, flamboyant boy i could - Started getting great response - immediately scoring chicks - i went by fake it till you make it attitude - just started playing cool and everyone want to be my friend (sounds dumb but worked back then)

6-8th i had my blast -  fun fun and fun - everything happening around me - i was the hotshot

9th - I started getting higher ambitions - made new friends - older and more influential- moved upwards - still hanged around school friends but my new social group was the main one - parties and adventure- meanwhile in school i had a fight (very major - almost rusticated) so since then i realised school dudes are bunch of dumfucks - i absolutely didn't care to be a part of anything - my life was beyond school - with my new rich kid gang (FYI I'm not rich , I'm not even middle class - Straight poor with extremely strict parents)

10th - One of the rich kids girlfriend got attracted to me - i tried my best not to indulge , but things piled up and all those rich kids ganged up and beat me to pulp - barely left me alive , it was a task to not let this come to my parents - and i didn't have any influencial plugs or money to pull anything on my own since all rich friends ganged up on me (and the girl was given a clean chit even though she was at fault - she almost raped me - cent per cent)

11th and 12th i told myself to focus on studies and not indulge in anything - Even my school group reshuffled in 11th and i was all alone without a single friend - Made some acquaintances (they were so dumb but still i needed atleast someone in the class for homework and stuff)
I put all my energies , deleted all social handles , absolutely cutoff from the remaining good friends to focus on studies so i could land a good college and hopefully a reboot in social life

End of school -  didn't get a good college - Absolutely no social circle (i mean it - I dont have a single person to talk to - sometimes it gets weeks or months without me talking to anyone except teachers and my own parents)

Covid came in 1st yr of college - Now I'm about to graduate - i don't have any friend circle - I'm not the dumb kid (i swear - whosoever talks to me - I hit it off pretty well) - During covid i tried my level best to catchup with the school friends but they simply didn't want me back ; Cabt try to catchup with the rich kids cause they might be still dangerous and violent (i hope not since it has been 5 years but they are literal goons fucking politician kids so i dont want to take any chances)

Made some friends in college (like 2 3) but due to covid we never got to meet- They all have their own social circles and beyond assignments we never discuss anything else 

Back in 6th to 10th i used to be the king in my School - even when i didn't cared enough , everything and everyone use to be on my fingers 
Now if i die tonight - Nobody would care enough to give a flying fuck
I have been for them whenever they needed, I'm a good person , even when i didn't wanted to be a part of school drama - i always protected them from externalities.

Now i have a group of dumb school mates (only those are willing to take me in) - And recently i fucked up my face even worse - i got braces

I also have soooo much family issues and abuse - which lead to pent up angerr soo deep - even when i try to be most sweet - My voice comes out to be the rudest and meanest of all - even when i say things in love- sounds like Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley all the time

I can't get girls , dont have friends, didn't get any major academic achievements (i invested alotttttt of time on that with hopes that It'll pay off well and atleast it will first of all make me financially independent- so i can crawl out of my hellhole house and abusive parents - and give me a status to bring back some social life and fun in life ; but even that didn't panned out as it was supposed to be)

1192,FormilGal,1642974836,1,"I would like to hear your opinions.
I have been asking myself this for years. This all comes from my situation, I'm a very shy guy who had to change university after the first year and because of both things, did not friends the first year, and neither the following ones because you know, most university connections are made on first year or generate from that ones..
So, now I'm in a city where I have nothing near to a close one, but the thing is... I still have a little group of guys from school that I'm very friend with. I love them, but you know, they are now in other places meeting new people and we only see each other and almost only talk when we come back to the city we grew up and, to be honest, I've changed a lot and sometimes I wish we had more things in common 


I feel very lonely sometimes, it hits me hard the fact that it's been literally 4 years of making nothing near a friend, makes me doubt of myself. I have obviously spoke with people, but all of the conversations are about university work.

Is it bad to feel lonely when I have that group of friends that really makes me feel great, but only in certain periods? 
I sometimes feel bad because I've never told then how I feel for them to change how or relation works but it's hard to change that hard the way our group works, and also, I don't want to just have them, I want new connections and the lack of that makes me feel alone but because of having this little friendship I think I don't end up to gather courage to try harder... Because you know ""I guess I have something"".

1193,LiveForToday-2022,1642974807,1,"Every few weeks when I have another Friday or Saturday night stretching ahead of me with no plans, I say screw it, and go to a local bar by myself. Sometimes that means a couple of hours drinking alone and then I go home; but I’m a relatively young and somewhat attractive woman so more than half the time, it means some random mix of loser/creepo dudes hitting on me. (It’s never the good ones, they’re there with friends and girlfriends.)


Because I’m lonely I usually entertain the conversation and then at least some of the time end up taking them home, mostly just so I won’t be alone. And then we have meaningless sex which is rarely good because they’re drunk, or I go down on them because honestly, it’s just easier. And then they go home the next morning, I never talk to them again, and just ultimately feel worse about myself.


Anyone else do anything like this? I know the ‘smart’ answer is to find healthy meetups (like literally through meetup), but those have a whole lot more pressure and anxiety attached.",lonely,Does anyone else act recklessly just to not be alone for a little while?,2022-01-24 08:53:27

Have medical condition that is treated with abusible meds (opiods, medical marijuana etc) which i began abusing a few years ago. 

As the meds affected my decision making, i sought some help from church elders who decided instead that i ought to be expelled, excommunicated. Family sided with the church - their choice. Everyone i know disappear from my life back 8 months or so ago as no one is allowed to speak with an expelled ex-nember.

Quit the meds, in pain often but clear headed. My life was full - so many things always happening and to look forward to. Now, between COVID and this, i haven't spoken to a soul in over 5 months except for phone contact with MD or banking. 

Completely alone now,  I'm a guy in his late 40's prime looking for an affectionate relationship with maybe a married woman who is also very alone. I have a lot to offer, have no job, no commitments on my time, can meet up, can afford weekend's to play in NYC with you... or here discreetly in NJ.

Would love to just get to know someone who is interesting, mature, lonely but not desperate, not ashamed of her looks or body, interested in getting to know a potential soul mate and is open to a  potentially physical relationship. I long for touch, cuddling, laying around in bed undressed, laughing... wasting days just being together. Fucking is on the table too if we are both in agreement. The table, the floor or a bed.

And let me tell you, it's not anyone's fault. They have the chance to go with the flow and live happily, in their own bubble, they don't suffer like we do, so why would I blame people for ignoring me? But we, the lonely, are doomed to misery. We are the last step in society. Not a single soul looks at us, marginalized and miserable, that's how we live.

And the normal people still have the guts to give advice. They told me to have hobbiers, excersice, balanced diet, set goals. It was a fucking lie.

What else do I fucking need to be happy? I did everything they told me, and for some time I deluded myself into happines, but the illusion broke down, I'm left with the ruins of a once happy person. But I'm lucky, I have friends and a loving family, but even then, the same misery as always. 

I wish I could go back to the summer of 2019, when I was blissfuly ignorant of my sourroundings, I felt extremely loved, and everything was fine, but looking back, people were just laughing at me. I even thought a girl was in lov with me, but of course, no. 

It's always no, it's always something wrong, it doesn't matter when I do, I can't stop being lonely. Please i just want a hug, I just want to hear ""you're my best friend, I love you"" once more please i don't want this life, please, life, fool me again into happines.

Also, I'm really ugly, sometimes people look at me and laugh, I have froggy looking eyes, I'm balding and I'm extremely disproportionate.

Im so excited to be on reddit. Its like the most fun place ever. You get to meet all kinds of cool people. 

I guess my only probz is why am I not meeting cool people like you in real life ?? 😅


So I moved back to my hometown after college. And got a job here. I had some friends here growing up - but some of them were really toxic (involved pulling some really bad shit on me, involved theft, blackmail, bullying etc) - so I cut them off and the other friends, I tried to get back in touch w them, we hung out a couple of times but they were reallllllyyyyyy boring. I got really bored lmao. 

I have a cool place where I live.  Its a huge community. Lots of people my age. Lots of amenities like squash courts, basketball ball, library, a pool … But I guess I dont know how to befriend people ? I srsly dont know how go make friends and im fckn 24 - I know thats a lame ass thing to accept, but Ive just got to accept it lmfao.

Everything else is illusion.,lonely,Just my opinion,2022-01-23 19:29:32
1255,QuarkGoldork,1642926280,1,"Hi I'm new to Reddit. I'm 23 (M) and I've generally been quiet my whole life. I think this stems from my autism and social anxiety, but I've come to accept those things. Since the pandemic, however, I've been obsessed with the fact that I don't have any deep connections with others. While I do have a few acquaintances online via Discord, I don't find those connections very deep and I feel like I'm missing out on ones that could be better. 

My main issue is that I've been increasingly reluctant to make new friends. Doing so irl is proving to difficult because I am still trying to protect myself and my mother who is also a cancer survivor (we still live together). Online, however, I feel like it's increasingly hard to find anyone I fit in with. Unlike most of my peers, I don't invest time in online gaming, social media or interest-specific things that bring people together. I've occasionally tried getting into new discord servers and introduced myself, only to feel uncomfortable and end up leaving the server before anyone could really notice me (I've kept myself away from the ones that tried to initiate conversation with me).

My past experience with friends has been... mixed. Like I said I have a few acquaintances online whom I get along with, but I've had closer ""friendships"" in the past that ended up being toxic and harmful to me. I've pulled out from those, but I have a hard time trusting new people. 

There is plenty I could do to branch out more, but I find myself questioning whether it's worth it. I generally find socializing draining and an obstacle to things that are more important to me, like learning to code and getting a job that suits my interests. On the flipside, my brain is making me feel bad for not having a social circle and functioning like a ""normal"" human being. I don't know why I get caught up in that because deep down I know I don't mind being an outsider. I try to convince myself that maybe I won't feel so lonely if I just follow my dreams and let the rest sort itself out, but what if I'm wrong? Am I a weirdo for putting myself in a ""lonely"" position before I've even set out on the things I want to do?",lonely,Feeling lonely by choice?,2022-01-23 19:24:40
1256,killedharmony,1642924368,1,"I know I'm not. I have freedom to make choices but I feel so stuck in life right now that I just can't seem to make progress. I lay in bed, switching through the same few apps, pining and obssessing over someone who only kind of likes me back. They know I like them a lot, but they don't know how deep it runs. I check my phone constantly for messages from them. I check their social media a dozen times a day. I can't bring myself to message them first too often or I feel like I'm coming across as annoying or too clingy. I have a few friends, and I enjoy their company a lot, but I feel so lonely still.

 It's gotten to the point that I feel suicidal. I began self harming. The person I love knows I did it once, and made me promise to tell them if I did it again, but I did it for the second time recently and I can't bring myself to tell them. I'm scared it's going to make them pull away more. I know they'd be upset if they found out I did it without reaching out. 

Yesterday I blocked them on Discord, I told them I meant nothing mean of it and I just needed to do it, because I really did need to - I couldn't stop myself from checking their profile every half an hour to see what they were playing or listening to. I still have other ways they could contact me if they needed to, like through the phone, because I didn't want to lose all contact, I just needed to stop myself from basically cyber-stalking them.

I just want to be their main focus, like I used to be when we were together. I know that isn't healthy, but I can't stop this.",lonely,I feel like a caged animal.,2022-01-23 18:52:48

1264,throwaway_poop_1997,1642921083,1,"I was a very timid shy and lonely boy as a child and got scared easily. In my high school there was a time i wanted to go poop, but did not dare admit because everyday there was a fat guy going there, and people used to make fun of him. I asked the teacher if I can go for a piss, and she said no you can wait, so i sat down. But I couldn't control and asked her loudly again but she shouted at me this time angrily that it was an important topic and my piss can wait. So i got afrain and sat down, and tried to control it as much as I can, but I couldn't. And it came out. I was so embarassed i didn't even move. When my classmates noticed some of them laughed and other made disgusted noises and ran out of the class. As it is i was a lonely guy trying whatever I could to fit in with the class because till high school I never had friends. By that time i was already the class clown, doing whatever I can for their acknowledgement. And after this incident shit hit the fan, and bullying got worse. My parents and sister were disgusted. I did not come out of my room for more than a month, and even after I never spoke with anyone and never made friends. I became paranoid and always think people make fun of me. Like, literally everyone. Everytime i meet new people i ask where they are from and what age are they just so i could estimate if there is a chance they might have this incident, and know about me. Even if it is unlikely they know it, i feel like somehow they will know it, and whatever impression i try to make in front of them now, will be overridden by what I did in high school. I had a girl propose to me at a later point, and even though I loved her ( like really really love her and i still think about her, even though she is in a different country and has a boyfriend ) i rejected her because I thought if she knows about this incident, she will think less of me. I was into self harm a lot and there are huge marks on my hands and thighs. I feel bad about how I look and how i talk. I have huge insecurities and inferiority complex. Everytime i accidentally make eye contact with a woman, i feel like they are disgusted at me for some reason, and i get an urge to go to them , say sorry and tell them I'm not eye-raping them. I go out of my way to avoid any eye contact with random women, and that makes it even more odd, but I can't help. I don't ask any hike or promotion from my manager even though I know i put in more work that any of my co-workers ( 13 14 hours daily sometimes around 18 hours ) because i feel like maybe I'm not doing any quality work. Even though I know thats not true. In my heart I'm still the same guy as i was in high school who want to meet people and make friends. I'm not this loner who likes to stay alone and spend time on my own as everyone thinks. I would really like to make friends and talk to them about the movies and series i see, the songs i listened to, and the books i read. There is so much, so much i think and sometime even at the expense of my sleep. Sometimes when i read any philosophically heavy books, they just make stay up all night and finish it, and when I'm done, I'm hit with this immense clarity towards life, and just want to share it with other people, talk to them, ask what their opinion is, and just spend some time together, just talking. I don't get any happy birthday messages or have some small talk texting relation with people, but occasionally when i get a message from someone i barely know, that just makes up my day. I forget everything and I'm happy. But for the love of God, i can't make any friends because i will end up thinking they think bad about me, and as an adult it's especially hard to make friends anyway. After all these years when i think about it, i think i might be depressed. And i don't know what to do about it, other than just accept my fate as a sad guy, give up on life, and just go whereever it takes me.",lonely,Pooped in my pant inhigh school,2022-01-23 17:58:03

I hope this doesn’t sound too weird but, I like the personal attention ones a lot because I rarely get positive attention from others. It feels nice to get compliments and feel valued, also the tingles from asmr are super relaxing. Most of the time it puts me right to sleep which is where my safe place is. I also like the videos where the person asks questions or ones that are specifically made for soothing someone. It sounds weird but I always talk with the person in the video in my head. 

I know it’s probably not the healthiest or a good long term solution but it can really help me cope when I can’t get to sleep, am stuck inside my own mind, or on those days I feel truly desolate.

1277,YellowMabry,1642915493,1,"All my life I feel as if I have been treated like I just don't matter, like I am a joke, like my feelings don't matter,etc. I was never anybodys first choice, etc. 

Even from a young age I was always excluded from stuff and made to feel like an outcast. People would do this to me on purpose. 

Then whenever I got older as in like middle school age I was heavily bullied. I was never invited to anything by anybody in school. I never really had any lasting friendships either. People would regularly do stuff to me to get a laugh at my expense, etc. But if I ever tried to speak up or defend myself I was "" crazy"", "" stupid"" etc. 

This went on all throughout school. I literally just came to school, got bullied, went home, etc. Then I graduated. I tried my luck at online dating. Let's just say I failed. It's basically like I'm a ghost no matter what app I use. I never get any responses or the rare few times I do its literally me trying to put all the effort into talking to these people and them leaving me on read and barely replying so i just give up. 

Now the only people in my life thus far who treated me like anything are family members. My mother and father were literally the only friends I had for multiple years. They both died shortly after I graduated from high school. 

Here I was literally 23 years old with no parents. I finally come across a guy online some months later. He actually tried to talk to me. We literally talked for months and then we finally met and it was amazing. Things were finally looking up for me I thought. Key word thought. 

We ended up moving in together and things went great for a while. Then he would purposely put his other friends first who he barely even saw, he let them be rude to me and did nothing about it and of course whenever I said anything about it, just like before ""oh you're crazy"" 

So basically I have endured over two years of mental and emotional abuse from him after that, along with cheating and sometimes physical abuse. But every now and then he will be nice to me. 

I can literally find no one else to talk to me. I've discussed how him treating me as made me feel, especially the cheating and he once straight up told me "" either deal with it or be alone like you were before "" 

So here I am 26, no friends, no parents, just one person in my life who treats me horribly. I am scared to leave him as there have been times when I actually have. Or he has left me, etc but we always get back together. And during those times when we are apart, literally NO ONE but my grandmother will talk to me. No one. I literally can not stand to be alone or ignored any more because that's basically been my whole life. 

Actually a few months ago whenever me and my guy friend I mentioned were apart, I met this other guy and we talked for a while, we met up and he acted all super interested in me, etc. Well he ended up pressuring me into giving him oral sex. I did and then after that he pretended he wasn't feeling well and left. I havnt heard from him since and I don't want to. He claimed we were gonna meet up for dinner and to watch a movie.  Before he left he literally told me "" here's $20 buy yourself a dinner "" UGH

1290,redshoes666,1642910396,1,"I feel so incredibly disposable. In the last few years since 2018 I have been (seemingly) randomly ghosted blocked by basically all of my closest friends. First, I was going through a major mental breakdown (I have suffered with severe mental illness all my life) and a group of my best girlfriends alienated me during that period of time. I take responsibility for some of that, because I know that it can be difficult to know what to do with someone who won’t help themself, but I thought these girls were friends for life no matter what. I never did anything directly to hurt them or our relationship. Then I had a couple of other friends ghost me, one of whom told me that they were in a very bad place mentally and then when I asked around to try and make sure she was okay she told people that I was stalking her. My husband and I separated shortly afterwards and I lost even more friends, even a few who initially praised me for leaving but who would go on to later randomly block me and re-friend my ex. Then I discovered one of my very last irl friends had blocked me without any indication as to why, and that strangely she had apparently asked several of her friends who I didn’t even have a relationship with to block me as well. And most recently my last long-term (10+ years) close irl friend stopped responding to or even reading my messages. She never blocked me or deleted me, but she just pretends I don’t exist? I have tried a couple of times to contact her to figure out what’s going on and have given up at this point. I genuinely feel so lost and confused after all of this. I feel like the accessibility of people on social media and apps has made friendships extremely disposable. The block button is easier to push than talking it out or even just saying “I can’t do this anymore”. Since all of this, I have been incredibly desperate for friendship, but I find myself incredibly closed off to meeting new people. I’m friendly and nice, but I assume that literally everyone will one day decide to block me and move on, so I don’t put genuine effort into getting to know anyone beyond a superficial level. I can’t identify the common thread behind why this keeps happening and I’m sick of banging my head against the wall trying to figure out what I did wrong or how I can take the blame. I even reached out to a couple of the girls from my past this last year just to apologize for whatever happened and let them know that I cared about them deeply, but i only got a generic thanks response from one person (and another one blocked me). I don’t feel like friendship is worth the effort anymore and that’s a fucking sad way to live. One of my old friends once told me right before she cut me out of her life I am going to die alone because of my mental illness and I’m fucking heartbroken that she’s probably right.

Over the last few weeks my mental health has taken a nose dive, I really want a relationship. I don't really have an interest in sex, I value the emotional connection and having someone to love far more. I have a thing for a girl at college at the moment, and I still miss my ex. I find myself late at night looking at their social medias, which usually ends with me feeling even worse about my pathetic self, and saps me of all motivation to change my life for the better.

The girl I like at my college has pretty much everything I'm looking for. She's intelligent enough to make me challenge my views on things, which I think is great because it makes me a better person. She and I have the same sense of humour, making each other laugh is like a button we can press, and of course I also find her very attractive. I dropped her several flirty hints and she hasn't once played back. Sadly I think I'm not in the running. She's talked about her interest in another lad a couple of times recently, and I see her text him constantly. It is what it is.

Tonight my ex posted a photo of herself with her new bf. We didn't break up because of relationship problems it was long distance and Covid straight up killed it, so I still very much have feelings for her. He seams like a nice guy so I am genuinely happy for them. She's a great girl and I hope she's happy, but I can't say it didn't hurt to see them together and the guy even looks a little like me. I don't know if I should say this but I spent the next hour researching the least painful suicide methods just so I know my options if things get worse.

When i'm alone, i experience nostalgia for certain people that i've never met. 

For example, last summer i saw this girl on a street corner near where i live and i found her very interesting.

Something about her mannerisms, poised posture, relaxed gait, and melodic voice was captivating. She wasn't a very attractive girl, but she seemed ""different"".

The best way that i can put it is that she made the average person seem like a poorly manufactured chucky cheese robot - gangly and with limited mobility.

I have a lot of daydreams about such people, and then i feel an intense desire to be around them and experience what in my mind is a cinematic level of peace and excitement. I even have certain music to go along with my daydreams - like pumped up kicks and xx intro. Everything is perfect in my daydreams. Time is slowed down. The colors are so vivid that you can smell them. The air is like a warm vacuum. The sense of cosmic significance and anticipation is quite alive. Every interaction is completely fluid.

But then, when i'm around other people, i want to be alone.

1361,0atmilkespresso,1642879875,1,"I feel like shit everyday…. I feel so misunderstood. I am a woman in my mid 20s. I grew up in an immigrant family. I am 3rd generation. My mom had me and my brother young. They would abuse each other a lot and use us as children to get back at each other. My dad was only around my younger years. He no longer speaks to me. He has children with my step mom. My other brother got diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 19. He’s the only person I’ve been through stuff with but he has a mental illness. I feel like he’s not him anymore. My little brother and other siblings are too young to understand. They don’t know anything about how I feel or what I’ve been through. I have depression and anxiety. I self sabotage a lot. I am a friendly quiet person. I am very loving and caring. I don’t have any friends. Any friends that I make never last long and I am trying not to blame myself but I feel like their is something wrong with me as to why I don’t have friends or why I have family that doesn’t talk to me. I am the black sheep of my family. I have moved to so many states and cities all of my life on my own. I feel broken. I feel like there is a reason why I feel so alone and misunderstood. I’ve done p0rn for a little bit, I’ve been a st1pper before for a little bit. I’ve been SA more than once. I’ve had men mostly use me and women despise me. I am actually a people pleaser. I don’t know why people hate me so much or think I am strange. I have a bf who I feel like doesn’t understand me. He says he does but I don’t think he does. I am now sitting parked in my car at a park feeling the most alone I’ve felt in awhile. I turn 27 this year. I didn’t think I would make it this far. I planned my suicide at age 13 and again at age 16. I almost did it again at 24 but I think god called my family to my house because they showed up unannounced. 

Me sitting in this park is the most peace I have felt in forever. I feel like dying everyday. I don’t think my bf understands the pain I feel each day. I see life so differently than others. I just don’t want to exist anymore but my anxiety makes me keep going because I always wonder how far could I have gone if I kept going. And I’m still going. I know that most of what I’m saying probably doesn’t make sense. I just don’t wanna feel alone anymore…. 

Will I ever get better? If you relate to me… will we ever get better? I want to pray for us all…. I feel so sad today. The scariest feeling I’ve ever felt is the feeling of nothing. Emptiness scares me.",lonely,"Feeling very depressed, helpless, misunderstood, no friends",2022-01-23 06:31:15

1371,thrwawy98000,1642875220,1,"
It has been a nearly 2 years since I met anybody new. My social circle for the last two years has been just my parents and my two friends. So I decided that today I was going to meet somebody new and have atleast one conversation outside of the four people in my life.

I went to a park near my place but when I tried to approach someone it felt like it was impossible to talk to anybody. Everybody had their airpods on, counting their steps, checking their fitbits. The only people there talking were talking on their phone or they were with someone already. I felt like I just couldn't talk to random people, I felt like giving up and went to go sit in my favourite spot in the park. I was sitting there for like half an hour watching Netflix, thinking how I couldn't even make conversation at the park. I felt so stupid and decided that it was time to go home. So I got up to leave but as I was about to climb down the stairs I saw this girl from the corner of my eye, I had seen her a few times before and I thought I should say hi and ask her name. 

I climbed down the stairs and got on the walking track but I was a little ahead of her on the track, and there were quite a few people walking, and I felt awkward going in the opposite direction just to say hi to a girl I didn't know. So I walked around the park to a different sitting area, thought I would wait till she catches up and notices me, then I can go to talk to her.

 But no, when she came around, I just couldn't, I froze on the spot, my heart was beating super fast. I sat down trying to calm myself. I always thought I could talk to anybody, I have no problem talking to strangers at work, or at the store, or in the metro, or anywhere for that matter. I was sitting there wondering what was wrong with me, I hadn't said anything, I hadn't done anything, I was feeling so bad, I had a mini panic attack by just trying to talk to somebody at the park.

Once I had calmed down, I realised I had freaked out over nothing, nobody saw me, nobody knew that I was freaking out. I thought, since I had already had a mini panic attack, I had nothing to lose, I might as well go talk to her. 

Oh I couldn't have been more wrong.

I walked up to her all nervous and said, ""hi"" she flinched, took a step back and got so scared. It felt like everybody was looking at me and now I was having another mini panic attack I was mumbling and I said ""I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you, I just thought you were cute and I wanted to come say hi"". She spurted out nervously ""okay"". Now I thought the difficult part was over I introduced myself and tried to get the conversation going by asking her ""what do you like about the park?"" to which she said, very hesitantly, ""it's my first time coming here"", which I knew it wasn't. Seeing as she was so reluctant to talk, I said ""I'm sorry if you are not comfortable talking to me, I can leave if you are not comfortable"" and she replied ""I don't know"", I said ""it's best if I leave"" and I bolted out the park and ran till I was out of breath.

Now I can't go back to the park and sit in my favourite spot for a while or until I grow my hair and beard out and become a completely different person.",lonely,I screwed up and I feel like I lost my favourite spot in the park.,2022-01-23 05:13:40

Ever since both my fiance and grandma passed away from Covid I feel like i've been crippled forever, it's like I can't breathe. I have no-one left, I look at this empty house and all I feel is like I am dead already too. They were my everything, my only family and friends. Damn covid, it took everything from me! I don't know what to do, how do you cope with the loneliness, the fact that the persons you loved the most are gone forever and you'll never hear their voices again? I don't know what to do, I just want to join them, feel their touch once again! 

After my fiance died I had a mental breakdown, was admitted in a psych ward for 2 month, after that I was in no shape to go to work, nor was in any shape to socialize or even leave the house. I ended up pushing all my friends away, isolating myself from everyone and everything, it was like all sorts of bonds I had lost their meaning.

I survive because I was put on welfare, so I make some 215 USD (minimum wage in my country) a month, half my usual salary. It's barely enough for my meds, therapy and food, but not for rent and stuff, so i'm being forced to leave the house in the next 8 days. It's hard, probably gonna become homeless again. 

I have a severe difficulty in socializing because of my depression, social anxiety and bipolar disorders, it was suggested to me that I should try make some online acquaintances, this is the point of this post, I see a lot of lonely people in this sub that could use some friendly chats, so, DM me, please!",lonely,"I've lost everything, I don't know what to do next and I have no-one",2022-01-23 03:17:03

It's not there's anything radically wrong with me. I consider myself a decent human being, who has his own style, passions, and goals. I am not 'ugly'. I have no problem talking with people (in general) (for the most part). Both men and women.

But this lack of romance hurts me a lot. I would love to have a girlfriend/relationship. I am working on other aspects of my life (career, education, health, goals, etc) but for this particular aspect, I have literally nothing to show.

I have the greatest fear ever of asking a girl out. Firstly, I feel like she will think of me as a creep and desperate. Secondly, I just cringe at the thought of it. And most importantly, no girl has ever shown me that level of interest, that made it obvious to me that she likes me. Trust me, if a girl even hinted that she likes me, I would definitely try to gather the courage to ask her out. But that has never ever happened throughout my life. I also feel that by asking out a girl, I 'm disrespecting her in a way.

I feel jealous of guys who have girlfriends/relationships. I crave that too. I would love to have a romantic partner. I sometimes feel 'lesser' due to my lack of love life.

I have tried dating apps, but I've found no success there. And as I said, asking a girl out is a big big fear for me. I really don't even know how it works, and how you are supposed to 'romance'.

I am really sad due to this. Almost everyone my age has been in a romantic relationship up till now and has experienced love.

P.S. Before anyone says this, I already work on myself and my self-improvement constantly. I already have my own education, career, and passions. And no, I do not identify as an 'incel'. I do not hate women, or blame them for my problems. This is just me venting out my true genuine feelings.",lonely,Has anyone else here NEVER asked a girl out?,2022-01-23 01:49:30

I'm not an ugly or bad looking guy at all. Quite the contrary actually and even then I've been compared to Robin Williams and Jim Carrey personality type wise and I believe they're both ENFJ lol but that's besides the point 

I think or feel me being extra is what causes women to not want to continue dating me or seeing me

All my life I've always been told I was extra as fuck
I never understood why until it clicked that what I do or say at times can be extra in a petty way or loving way or in any way tbh it'll always be extra with me

Ex: I hold the door open for people walking from the pumps instead of the one or 2 getting out of their car near the entrance like that's extra as fuck 

But even then my ideologies and how I perceive life can be a little *wtf m8* kinda moment because I've always had an obscure way of thinking. I don't think like majority of people do. I fancy the odd and weird possibilities of how this world is and how it came to be and all that other good stuff but most already have embedded in their login noggin that God is why we're here and he's our purpose like YUCK NO GROTESQUE-- how dare you limit yourself to the endless possibilities of our existence and meaning.

1432,exotyliez,1642830116,1,"I really have nobody to talk to, it sucks knowing that everyone i know has such good lives which im glad they do but how awful mine is. My mom had me at 15 so her entire life she was working to support me and my siblings. I am now 17 and have moved out of my moms house due to problems in the past and now am living with my dad. I never really received attention like all my other siblings, i was always forgotten. My siblings are half siblings and having a step dad really messed me up. I grew up wondering why i was treated so differently than all my other siblings. They'd get new shoes new clothes, toys, and anything they could've wanted but my stepdad never treated me like that. He would always call me names and make fun of me whenever i would mess up or show any sort of emotion which makes it hard for me to ever express how i feel which is why im here. Until i was about 8 i found out my stepdad wasnt my real dad and everything started making sense. I used to be a good kid in school and always do my work and such and get good grades until my stepdad and mom split. I was always surrounded by abuse constantly as my mom would always end up with some abusive boyfriends. I got so tired of it and eventually moved out and with my dad, and can i say it was the worst decision of my life. I had a bestfriend at the time and he was the best. I never had many friends as i always was the annoying kid and very poor so was always made fun of. His family loved me and i loved them and felt at home with them. After moving in with my dad a couple weeks later he passes out and is rushed to the hospital. They found out he had internal head bleeding and said he would be lucky if he lived another 24 hours. I cried for days and couldn't eat or id throw up. My dad would always get frustrated because of how i was acting and would call me names and tell me to stop acting like a girl or little bitch. I repressed my feelings so much i changed completely. Now 4 years later i see how much it affected me and wished i always had supportive parents as i see in so many videos. I still am very poor and dont have my own room, ive been working and never has my dad bought me anything. I buy my own food, clothes, and even bought my own car. No matter how hard i try its like im never enough. My dad didnt even seem proud at all. He threatens to take it all the time. He always disrespects me but if i show any disrespect to him he threatens me. He claims to be such a good parents but never does anything for me. Im never home and i still keep in touch with my moms side of the family. After so long i see my mom finally doing what i wish she did for me. She supports my siblings, goes to their games and cheers them on. She supports them no matter what but whenever i tried telling them how i wanna pursue something they dont even seem like they care. I have a couple friends but i feel like im always just a back up whenever someone else cant make it. I sit in my car all day because i have nobody to talk to. How do i tell someone how i feel without scaring them off or just make them think im just so messed up. I just wish i had someone care about me. I work and try so hard and wish someone was atleast proud of me but i constantly am reminded about how lame i am to everyone. Im so alone.",lonely,parents,2022-01-22 16:41:56

1435,throwawayblue900ss,1642828609,1," Why live? Why go on? I just want my suffering to end!

I was never enough, but more was always expected of me.

I was never loved, but that is all that I wanted, and it was always denied to me.

For several years now, I have tried and tried to form romantic relationships, but I can never get there.

I can flirt, make women laugh, even break the touch barrier, and have them touch me back as well.

But,  when the rubber meets the road, I can't get a girlfriend. Tons of  people want FWB, but I'm not about that life! Why can't I have someone  to love and love me back?! Why does this always escape me, no matter  what I do?!

The answer is obvious: I am not enough. I am not enough to be caressed, kissed, cared about.

I don't want yet another ""friend"", and that is all I get. ""Friends""!

They  love flirting with me. They love touching and being touched by me. They  love looking into my eyes while we talk. They love to smile at me. They  love my company. They love to snoop on my life as if they have any  designs on making me a boyfriend. They love getting my hopes up (even if  it is unintentional!). They love shattering my hope for a love into  countless pieces.

Well, I can't  put these pieces back together anymore, and I am tired of sleeping  alone. I am tired of never getting any texts asking how I am! I am tired  of not being missed, needed, made love to! I have no one to give  birthday gifts or receive gifts from!

Valentine's  Day is coming up, and you know, as always, I will be alone, unloved,  single, cold, and full of hatred. My anger and hatred for myself and my  situation is the only thing keeping me alive! My hope is gone! I will  never know what love is! I will never be a loving husband and father!

I  wish I could just sleep and never wake up again! I just want to go  somewhere warm where I can finally feel love, touch, acceptance.

I just want to be human.

Why,  why, why does my life involve a never-ending series of disappointments  and rejections?! Why am I to live? What is the point? Who gains from  this misery and isolation?!

Someone  give me the same advice I have followed all my life. Please tell me  that self-improvement, not looking for love, making tons of friends,  having an active social life like in the movies is going to solve all my  problems and wrap a giant red bow on top and bring me what I have  always wanted, what I have always needed, what I am apparently unworthy  of!

Hello friend, I'm a 19 year old dude from Germany.
I'm dealing with loneliness for about four years and it's partially driving me crazy. I have some days where I'm completely fine, the beginning of this week was one of the best times in a long time, I'm about to tell you why.

I confessed my love to my crush on a Thursday (last weekend). After texting a bit, she didn't answer for almost two days. And then suddenly she showed up at my work and asked if I would like to go walking with her after work, that would be around 10pm.

I said yes, we talked and walked around, it was beautiful.

She had a crush on me one year ago, but she hasn't the same feelings now. She said that she really likes me and that we have a special connection.....

Fun fact: We started texting each other in June 2021, and we literally just met for the first time a few days ago.
When we started talking to each other back then, we both felt that special connection, we exchanged the most intimate stuff. But as I said, that was a year ago...
We also had a little break in between, I think October was the month of silence, she said we needed a little distance. 

Present: Well, we are talking to each other and yeah I confessed my love to her. We met, we still are talking,...
 I think. I asked her yesterday how her day was, she didn't answer (she does this often). We haven't talked today, the whole fucking day, it's driving me crazy.

I know I have to give her time, she has her own problems, everyone does. And I also don't want to destroy out connection or relationship. That's why I'm not texting her again, even though she didn't answer. 

And now the problem is back again: loneliness

I hope it's not chronic loneliness lol.
I feel like I'm losing touch to everyone. I know I have my parents, my siblings and friends.
But that's what loneliness is, right? You still feel lonely af, isolated af even though there are people around you.

I haven't met friends, besides university, since New years eve

A contact, someone I can be intimate with, someone that's understanding me, someone I can talk to, someone I can hug and cry in her arms.

I just want someone to hug.

That's just a little episode of my live and my current state of mind, it may not sound that extreme but I think it is. At least my heart pounding doesn't start that often.


Thanks for listening friend, love you.",lonely,"Hello friend, I'm lonely, my crush is not answering, etc",2022-01-22 09:26:04

But since starting my new job. working 8-4:30 mon-fri with the youngest person being 13 years older than me. I just feel so fucking alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got one real friend irl who is always busy so I don't even get to go out with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Gaming and the gym is my only escape. I've got tons of online friends that I speak to. They give me a reason to not feel so alone but then reality hits. I've started going to the gym recently and when I'm there I feel relieved. I feel free. Then I come home and once again reality hits.

&amp;#x200B;

Over christmas I met a girl. I asked her out January 1st and since talking to her I felt so happy. I had a text to go to bed to. a text to wake up to. Facetime calls with someone who cared about me. She made me the happiest I had been in so many years.

&amp;#x200B;

But she broke up with me on Monday. It was a short relationship but my first real one. She made me so happy and now I'm back to being so sad and so alone. Luckily I had my online friends who actually took my mind of her. And still are. It's still early days into the breakup but I know I'll get better.

&amp;#x200B;

But I had no one to go to in real life. I spoke to my one friend and my brother. That was it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just praying to stick to the gym. To stop being lanky because I'm 6'4. I want to be able to go out this summer. Even if it's by myself. Go to the beach and not be insecure and make friends. I'm wasting the best years of my life.

The point of this post was the sabatoge I feel internally. Being alone makes me not as trusting. A big part of me hopes that her reaching out is a sign she misses the friendship, wether or not more is or would be on the table is irrelevant. My not trusting side has me thinking she reached out to try to get a client back.

I don’t even know how to proceed, so I might book a beard trim and get my head shaved and see how it goes. Would it be safe to assume that if by the end of the cut things aren’t looking like she missed me as a person and friend that it was in fact the missed customer thing? Is that stupid?

1555,Hooty_for_booty,1642754495,1,"As the title suggest, December 2020 was the last time I had total control of my life. I had a medical emergency that left me partially paralyzed in my right leg and unable to walk. For months and months the only thing I’ve ever been able to do is lay in bed while I recovered. 

Previously I was a healthy 24M and had no issues with my health. I’ve always been independent and free spirited. So suddenly I was living with my parents again, lost all my money, had to sell my possessions and assets, and most importantly my ability to walk and the freedom that comes with it. During the last year I’ve lost nearly everyone I cared about. I didn’t lose them because they weren’t around or didn’t care, instead I pushed them away. I’m angry, I’m depressed, I’m anxious, I’m everything under the sun but happy. Between spending months in and out of the hospital, then to being isolated at my parents house away from friends I finally had enough and I broke down about a month ago. 

I’m so tired of living like this. I rely on my parents for so much now. I’m so incredibly grateful to have them be here for me, but fuck me… I can’t do anything because they’re so overbearing. They refuse to allow anyone over because they’re deathly afraid of Covid. Anything they deem as “risky” like using the microwave above the stove is off limits or getting in the shower. What few things I can control are still out of reach for me due to nerve pain and limitations on mobility. I can no longer sit at my computer to play games with my friends on discord, even laying in bed with a laptop ends up being painful. 

I miss my old life, I miss being able to do laundry, I miss driving, I miss work, I miss my friends, and I really miss the little things we take for granted. I don’t even know when this is all over if I’ll ever get back to my old self, I feel so far removed from everything and everyone that it’s impossible to reintegrate back into my own life. 

I’m so lost. 


TLDR: I suffered a medical emergency that crippled me. I ultimately developed severe body dysmorphia to the point I pushed everyone out of my life for fear of who I had become. Now I’m stuck living with my parents again and suffer from extreme PTSD anxiety attacks and depression.",lonely,December 2020 was the last time I was in control,2022-01-21 19:41:35

1557,Aggressive_Natalie,1642753954,1,"One of my ex friends of 3 years (online) created drama, was upset when we didnt want to do what he wanted all the time



 (we switch main games. we would go out of our way to play the same game and then switch to another game and he would refuse to play even if he owned it)




and decided to burn bridges with me and say some fucked up things. I never would have shared his message if he did not BRAG about it to others in a group call he made. I was APPROACHED and asked if it was true he ""sent me a really nasty message"".




others were very unhappy with what he said. he met these friends through me (that shouldn't matter) but many do not like his actions and what he said. 






this friend reached out wanting back into the group, but others have said if hes welcomed back, the potential for drama is too high, and they would leave if he was welcomed back.






this friend, unaware I think of what's going on, wanted a mediation. we attempted to talk but he shut down and wouldn't acknowledge his message and saying that message didnt matter he wants back in.





we are all in our 20s btw.




I suggested he take a few mins to gather his thoughts, and he asked for a few days to try again. I agreed.






THREE days later he contacts a mutual friend of mine that he HATES and tries to pull some more drama, even telling him very unbelievable lies.





its been 4 weeks since he said he wanted to do a mediation, and radio silence from him.




he actually has a habit of removing people, people who haven't even done anything to him too, when hes feeling bad.





apparently he has been extremely lonely, not even his other friends outside this group have been talking to him.






and no, I can NOT reach out to him. its cruel to text him when I know 1. he is not welcomed into the group, 2. I know I cant balance a friendship with him bc of what hes done and that I'm always with this group 3. I'm super unhappy about the lie and how soon it was after wanting a mediation.






I have another friend who... I wont go into what he did but it was bad and the last straw for a different friend group. hes lonely, I try to chat with him but we dont play shared games anymore. hes not doing too well either but has gotten used to being alone and plays alone now. he wont change his behavior and at this point doesn't think what he did was wrong either.

1583,hdjdhdbdndms,1642741194,1,"Basically, I am lonely and I want to talk to my friend but I feel like I annoy him because he takes several hours (sometimes an entire day) just to open my message, and usually he doesn't reply and just leaves me on read, or if he does reply he gives the driest responses. 

He wasn't really much of a texter before this anyways but I thought that was just because we saw each other every day in person at school,  and we are much more communicative in person. But now that we aren't seeing each other I feel extremely lonely and I was hoping we would start texting a little more to compensate, and possibly make plans to hang out outside of school. I offered to drive to his house so we could hang out but he never took me up on my offer. Okay, maybe he is just really busy. I get that. He is a busy person usually. We don't have to hang out but I would at least just like to text him. I don't think I'm asking for much. To just take like five minutes out of his day to text me once in a while on his free time is all I'm asking. Just saying hi, letting me know what's up, and asking me how I'm doing. That would make all the difference, just knowing that I still have my friend. 

I feel like if I tell my friend how I feel or I express my emotions he will think I'm like a negative Nancy and get even more annoyed with me. I also feel like I'm being selfish and clingy for wanting attention from my friend. I'm kinda known for like being chill and not really getting sad like that, so I am worried that if he sees this side of me he won't want to be friends anymore. 

I am in a very bad depression right now. I hate being alone. I feel really isolated and lonely. I hate not talking to my friend and not being around others. I need to talk to someone so bad. I feel so lonely and I can't take it anymore. School, literally the one thing I ever had to look forward to, has been taken away from me. Yeah, my life is so boring and lonely that I literally look forward to going to school. It's the only time I ever get out and have a social life.

I think im not depressed, is what im trying to say. Instead, i just feel like im the loneliest person alive^((not even remotely close)) and that it completely destroys me to the point where im hopping on r/SuicideWatch daily to realize i have it better than most and move on with my day.  
There is more to this: im a very goal oriented person^((hopefully thats a thing)) and i did not have a long term goal for 3 years now. Which means for the past 3 years ive literally been running on autopilot to the point where im looking at youtube videos from 5 years ago and im expecting them to be from 2015.

I had an amazing start to 2021 but all im going to say is that it was not a blessing; it was a curse. I became thirsty for touch so much that ever since 11 months ago all i think about is hugs and cuddles.  
I jerk off thinking about how much better it would be just to sit next to a loved one and just *cuddle*.

I am probably the pickiest motherfucker on the planet earth.

How fun everyone must seem to be having as I struggle to find a reason to live, not that I want to kill myself but truly, what is the point of living? My only motivations are to graduate and begin to help my single mom who doesn’t deserve the struggles she sometimes faces but still, is that all there is to me?

God why am I so fucking boring?

I feel like I ruin my chances of making friends when talking to straight guys around me as a little bit of attention is enough for me to fantasize about them and to create false hopes, but I can’t blame them wtf thats so wrong

I had to move for uni, so I pretty much lost all the friends i made till now. My first semester was right when Covid began, so I had like 8 months of pure ""online college"" stuff.

So technically this is my first semester of ""real college"", going to uni, meeting people etc.

I  literally made 0 friends in over a year living here (except small talk with my neighbors), and slowly its really depressing me. Every weekend I hear people outside my dorm throwing parties, while I play games, do late night uni-work or think about how pathetically lonely I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I also became very introverted and got used to all that isolation over the past months, which makes it so hard to ""break free"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The only force driving me forward right now, is the thought of my ""future-diploma"" being worth it all and blah blah blah.... not being able to share anything in your life with a friend / girlfriend is such a terrible feeling. Sometimes I feel worthless as shit, usually I dont leave my tiny room anymore because going outside just becomes a real ""obstacle"" sometimes.

Am I not respectful to everyone I meet?

None of my 3 roommates, who I thought were my best friends, have even thought to check in on me or ask how I’m doing. One of the girls was around him with me for more than 24 hours and is being treated as if she had never seen him.

The only things they have said to me is that I need to work on staying out of our common areas(which I have only been in for maybe one hour total to heat food and use the bathroom) so that they were more comfortable.

They haven’t even stopped to think how I might be feeling considering I am the one who is sick and isolated. The last time a roommate had to isolate we sat outside her door and talked to her. They haven’t even sent a text to me.

I feel like social media was taking a heavy toll on my mental health considering I had just gotten out of a toxic relationship of 3.5 years and was drinking quite heavily along with using weed every night. I’ve come to the conclusion that I can’t keep staring at a fucking screen about all the couples doing cute shit, inspirational posts and all that when I’m aware I’m not taking any steps to better myself. And also being an ex addict with a couple mental illnesses already (agoraphobia/SA/MDD) it’s hard trying to get out of negative thought loops. So I took two weeks off. Tapered off the alc. haven’t had a drink in 3 nights so far. And finally decided I’m gonna quit weed which is a strange one for me. Weed doesn’t actually hurt me it makes my anxiety go away and makes me feel comfy in my own skin but I have to come to terms with the fact it’s killing my motivation and keeping me from my goals. My big plan next is to go full sober (: step 1. Step 2- take time self healing and finally seek therapy. Step 3- Alresdy got a gym membership so finally commit to going every day (natural release of endorphins yay!!!) And step 4- hopefully within 5-7 months I’ll be in a much better place, not so hard on myself, having better sleep (usual is 3-4hours around 4am), better mental health and coping methods and lastly feeling ready to start dating again. I feel like this previous relationship fucked me up so bad I didn’t stop to think I was just self loathing and downing my pain with substances and was seeking out rebounds but I realize my mistake now and just can’t till I feel ready. I was talki to one girl and I feel so bad for telling her I need to work on myself (I sent a whole essay just so she knows how much I can’t rn and why:( but yeah gonna try my best here to grow and become an even better person than before my ex so when the right person/people come along I have the skills to just walk away pain-free or be able to tell if it’s toxic (red flags) early on.

I miss the feeling of having a relationship. I miss having friends that gave a shit about me. I miss the feeling of a “whole” family (as whole as my family was at least) I have about 3 friends that I consider family that genuinely care about me and appreciate me.

I called a couple friends the other day to check up on them. They appreciated the gesture and thanked me. Then I realized, no one really checks up on me. 

People only notice that something’s wrong with me when they physically see it. No one ever cares to stop and ask “Oh how is ‘OP’ doing? Maybe we should hit him up to check on him.” 

I care and genuinely have love for the people around me and the people that I want to do good. I’m starting something up and want to bring people up with me, but I don’t want to bring those up that only want to use me. 

I just wish “normal” people noticed that lonely people feel shit, and a simple check up will do them some good. Honestly if it wasn’t for my Evil Twin, Hermano, and Primo, I would be worse off right now.

Then Corona struck and made it even worse.

You know normal things. But I didnt. Everyone has their own friends, and we dont have the same interests. Im very social and Im good with all of them and its not the problem that we dont like the same things, I can talk about anything, but they are just..not intrested..

Im trying to occupy my mind by drawing, reading books (I have just read Demian by Hesse, it's about loneliness and finding your own identity, recommend!!) watching movies, playing video games, taking long walks and talking to myself.. But sometimes I just dont want to do these things anymore, I just want to have someone to talk to. Its overwhelming. Im worried nothing will change in college, since in primary school I thought my loneliness will change in HS, but it didnt.

I've got into this new school around Aug 2021 and I wanted to socialize with people unlike how I was in my old school (I used to be very shy and didn't have friends). Fortunately, I made some friends and the first 3 months in my new school were amazing. Until now, we came back to school from winter break and I don't know why but no one in my friend group has been texting me. I know they're good people, you can see it but I think I did something that kind of pushed them away from me or something. I want to know what it is but I also know that if I ever talk about that stuff they're gonna get weirded out and get further away from me. I always get tired in school trying to get closer to them, I have to force myself to try and form a conversation. They don't say it but I can feel that they're bored of me. I'm not the most hyper type but I try to be loud and energetic around them. I fucking hate that I think about them and my friendship 24/7 and I think I focus too much on being in their lives than being genuinely close with them. I used to have a close friend that I probably wouldn't call my best friend but she also doesn't text me as much anymore and when she does it sounds like she often wants to just get my shit out of the way. It was recently my birthday before we came back to school and all of my friends hasn't given me a birthday present nor had told me happy birthday in person until one of them did a week later. At that time, it was already almost 10 days after my birthday, when on her birthday I gave her a birthday present and gifted her something that I wanted to get her. I'm thankful for having friends who give me gifts and everything but if she didn't want to do that then what's the purpose of it if you know what I mean. I honestly don't even know if they care about me. I sent all of them a text yesterday and none of them responded to it. If I go on Whatsapp I'm left on read on all of my recent conversations. I'm not gonna find a new friend group or leave the friend group I'm in now because I don't fit in anywhere else. I fucking hate life.

I'm 17 M and spend most of the year in boarding school. I've  always had trouble making friends, so when i heard about boarding school where they teach about planes , i was very hopeful. It turned out that even in this place i cannot find somebody like me. I'm... just... different? I listen to diffrent music, i have diffrent interests ( not motorization) , and just other style of being. To be fair, Im not alienated, only everybody just wants to be friends and nothing more. I just cant find anyone to talk about light stuff. But there is one more thing that i hate most, everytime i think about talking with someone, and being friends, makes my head (hurts?(just a very bad feeling)). I just want to throw myself into somebody hands (but it will be a dead sentence).

I had 9months holidays before the uni opens but I mostly spent my time alone. Before my first semester completed, Covid broke out and got to stay at home. A month later, I saw my grandma who was living with me died in front of me. From then, I've been living alone. I tried to live with the hope of things getting back together after the pandemic. Then, on 2nd Feb, a coup happened and I don't see any hope anymore. Meanwhile rich friends of mine can easily flee to other countries and continue their life journey. Things just getting worse here. At one point, I just can't control my sleep schedules and meal schedules anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in a prison.

Today, I slept at 5AM, woke up at 5:40PM and had only one meal till now. I feel empty and lonely looking towards ceiling. I have no energy to do something. Sometimes, I just don't want to eat or sleep in spite of necessities. This has been happening for several months and I want to end this loop.

I’m constantly reminded of how amazing I am. I take care of the needs of the people and the building. I keep it stocked. I fix problems I give hugs,advice and I greet everyone with all the warmth and love I have to my name. Nobody knows how much these hugs mean to me. Or how sad and lonely I am.

If my ex needs a ride home from work I’ll go pick her up because her husband can’t make it. At the end of the day I throw something in the microwave and talk to my cat. I can cook quite well but why bother when it’s just me. I go to bed early, my bed empty and disheveled. I’m exhausted I go to sleep knowing nobody wants me. I go out to my local bar and make friends no problem. Dating sites I have no likes no messages. People I send great messages to just ignore me.

another idea is to write a blues about being forever alone khhv virgin xDD

I moved to a new town and lost touch with friends. Started working more and grew distant from my parents who are my only family. 

It has changed me greatly in many good ways. It also hurts a lot because simply I have almost nobody to open up to about anything. I have quite a few problems in my life. A couple serious. You wouldnt suspect this though if you knew me. The few people in my life don’t care. I understand why and I’m ok with it. Sometimes I try to be open and honest about anything but they almost never do the same. It hurts when no empathy is shown. So I keep to my self more.

1862,Bugzappagal,1642572072,1,"Hi everyone. I’m posting this because I had a few people reach out to me regarding comments I left on someone else’s post on this subreddit. The advice I shared with them seemed to be appreciated so I compiled it for anyone who wants it. It was given to lonely guys looking to meet girls, but I don’t see why girls couldn’t use most of it too. 

The first pieces of advice are pretty general in nature:

After online dating for 10 years, I thought okcupid was the best site. I went on probably a hundred dates, got hurt a lot, but ultimately found the one.

Looks are highly relative to girls. In my experience, confidence is key and sense of humor is also pretty important. 

Keep an open mind and low expectations. Unfortunately, dating is often a numbers game and who the fuck has the energy for it? You will be into people who are not into you and it will hurt. But keep reaching out and try to be genuinely interested in hearing about other people’s lives.

People love bonding over common interests. Find something specific and fake interest if you have to. 

Ok, so the other advice pertains to going to a bar to meet girls. Every situation is different though so take it with a big chunk of salt. This advice is more about building confidence than getting laid, though I wish you luck for both!

Find a place to go to that looks chill, not intimidating, crowded with lots of different kinds of people. Set a small goal for yourself—like talk to one girl, that’s it. Verbally communicate with a female.

The place has to be quiet enough to talk—no loud clubs where you can't hear the person next to you. However, it’s best to go where there is live music or karaoke or something to watch.

Go in with the intention of spending 30 minutes there, no more. That way it doesn’t feel like you are just hanging around drinking by yourself like a creep.

Go to the bar and get a drink. It doesn’t have to be alcohol but you need something in your hand, something to do. Not just looking down at your phone.

You are unwinding with a drink after work enjoying some live music like a perfectly normal adult…THIS IS YOUR MINDSET.

When you feel chill, make eye contact with someone nearby. Someone near, you don't want to walk straight up from across the room or follow them. Ease yourself closer, if need be. FYI, it’s tricky approaching a girl in a group. Best to wait for the right moment when she’s on her own for a moment (checking out the band, ordering a drink).

Have couple of questions in your back pocket that relate to the environment/situation. ie: do you know the name of this band? And a follow up question: have you seen them before? OR do you know if there’s another band coming on after? Super easy questions that are more informative. She should have no real clue you are interested.

If you pick up on signals that she’s receptive, only then do you start flirting (and that’s a whole other story) 

One opening question, one follow up question and that’s it unless you get signals. After that, you run the risk of pestering her. If she’s not interested after a couple questions, she probably won’t be, period.

If she’s not into it and you want to keep practicing, repeat all steps with someone else (not in her group) AFTER 15 MINUTES. 

I hope this helps someone. Feel free to contact me with questions or if your situation is different and you think I can help. Have a good day friends!",lonely,Just putting this out there,2022-01-19 17:01:12

My whole life I never had anyone for really anything. When I was 10 my parents got divorced and before that they pretty much got into a screaming match every night. At 12 my dad got into a motorcycle accident that put him in the hospital with a coma. He was in the coma for about 2 months during that time My oldest brother stole all of his money and cut off all contact with me my brother and my mom. My mom and my brother were a mess so I had to step up and become the ""man"" of the house. At 12 I taught myself to clean, cook, do laundry and try to hold what was left of my family together. After about 2 months of sitting in a coma I had to tell the doctor that the best decision is to pull the plug on him cause we really couldn't afford to keep him in the hospital and that's just no way to live.

I started working at 15 mainly to bring in extra money and start paying for my own food and rent to my mom plus my phone bill. She was pretty much never home cause she was always working and my brother got a girlfriend so it was just kinda me left to figure everything else out.

When I got to high-school I never really had any friends I would try alot and invite the ""friends"" to do things all the time but no one was ever able to. Then the same night I would see pictures on snapchat or Instagram of all of them doing what my plans were without me. (Going to the movies, ice skating, camping etc.) 


I have had a few girlfriends but it never works out for one reason or another usually my fault I guess.

Last year I moved from New York to down south to become a police officer. I love helping people cause even though things are shit for me I can help someone else in life. In the academy I did a shit ton of work of trying to meet people and become friends, during work hours we got along amazing but again I would try to set things up and it would never work out and they would go do stuff without me.

I graduate and am a cop now and overall it's awesome I genuinely get to help people. I've talked kids out of suicide, saved multiple people who overdosed, a kid who drowned, got people who severely needed mental help the correct help they need etc. But that's all work.

When I go home it's just me like usual I never have any plans no one wants to do anything. I'm unable to find a girlfriend down here. I'm not good looking by any means maybe a 5/10 at best and I've had quite a few matches but nothing ever really comes of it. 

I had one girl i was talking to for a couple months and things were going great like really great for the first time ever I was in the honey moon phase which I've never felt before. And out of nowhere one night were hanging out she tells me she has no romantic connection to me and breaks things off. It was pretty crushing but not much I can do it's her choice and you can't force sonthing that's not there. 

At the same time as her breaking things off with me what's left of my family has a falling out and completely fall apart no one is talking to anyone else and I'm just kind of the middle man with no dog in the race again trying to fix things but it's not gonna work this time.

I've always had a very positive outlook on life of ""things can always get worse right?"" But at this point honestly I'm one bad day away from swallowing the barrel of my gun.

I have no family left, no friends, no romantic partner, I'm living paycheck to paycheck not knowing if I'm actually going to be able to pay all my bills or some times just choosing to go a couple days of not eating to pay my bills, and I work one of the most hated professions in the world right now. I'm just tired man and I've been ready to go for a while now. Only reason I haven't genuinely the only reason is because of my niece.

Things have to get better eventually right",lonely,I'm just tired...,2022-01-19 16:58:47

I live in a very old community small town there really isn’t anyone my age here. And with COVID people aren’t very friendly to meeting strangers out and about. Ive gone to bars arcades restaurants and all sorts of places with people and try to engage in conversation but there never really seems like a smooth enough approach.

Getting older all my friends are mostly to far away and work always messes things up.It’s sad I can sit in my room for days without a phone call or knock at the door.
The thing that made me the saddest is seeing my group work photos and different group pics and I’m not there either something happened or just nobody bothered to include me ☹️

It’s sad feeling overlooked or left behind 


Now I’ve turned to online thinking wow there are so many people looking there that it should be easy to find some likemind connections and then the dating apps where Even being very careful have been catfished.
Everyone I find is so sad or angry 😢

“People with philophobia are afraid of loving, hurting and suffering, so they think it is better to avoid love completely”

The part that I really caught my attention the most: 

“The need for emotions in our lives

As a person, you have to feel it. You need to suffer, love, be hurt, be happy and even suffer loss. These are not only events where it is impossible to protect yourself, but they also form part of your experiential learning. In fact, they’ll find out who you are today. You can’t take refuge in an ice castle to keep away those who love you, like Queen Elsa.”

I went to lunch with my mom and sister, and it was the first time I’d sat down in a restaurant in months, and the first time I’d actually made an effort with my appearance in probably over a year. I wore makeup and tied to dress a bit cute. I still felt insecure, though- like I was ugly. I felt like people would look at me and want to laugh, like they’d think “Who does she think she is, why is she even here?” Sometimes making an effort is more embarrassing. 

Lunch was delicious. I was having a nice time and finishing up, when a guy, probably a little younger than me, but just a bit, came in and sat down with his (assumed) friend who was waiting for him. 

As he sat down, he looked in our direction, and I was the only one facing him, so we made eye contact for a moment- I looked away quickly, but he looked at me like I was any other person, and it was really validating. 

It seems pathetic, to just want to be viewed as “any other person”. But, that he didn’t stare, that he didn’t cringe- it made me happy. He didn’t look at me like I was beautiful, but he didn’t look at me like I was grotesque, either.

I was roaming around on Tik Tok the other day (as ya do), and came across this one by @maddiezahms called ""Life of the Fat Funny Friend"". It's a song about being the FFF in a friend group and I...don't think a song has ever resonated with me that much. 

In not only my friend groups but my family, I'm I expected to be the empath with the comic relief, be there for others, be the catcher when someone else drops the ball, and peacekeep. One lyric goes ""Cant be too loud and can't be too busy, If I don't answer now, are they still gonna need me"". That's me.. I'm not allowed opinions even though I have them, I'm not ever the one accommodated or considered. 

My family lives mostly in DFW, and I'm in OKC. My step sister just got married and I realistically helped out a ton on wedding day. I don't know how it happens but like there were these signs that needed greenery draped on them and Id fixed them originally and then every time after that, I was called to re-set it if it got blown over. I was coordinating the timing for the photographer and bartenders to get in and set up because I...look approachable to them? Like I wasn't originally supposed to do that, but it just happened that way...? In addition to all the rest of the bridesmaid duties. And at the end of the night I didn't get any thank you or ""glad you were here"" or anything which is fine, but I also travelled the furthest of anybody for the wedding... 

My other step sister is getting married at a destination wedding which will end up costing $3500 all said and done. And she just told me she wants to do a getogether in Dallas instead of the originally planned OKC and thats gonna be another $300 plus gas for travelling down there and back alone again. 

My other best friend of 20 years, I used to work with her, and I was commuting to DFW from OKC every week for two days for 6 months. I was spending time away from my boyfriend (who I live with) and my circadian rhythm was fucked, so I finished the project initiative I'd started to revamp their project management process and turned in my two weeks. My best friend of 20 years gave me the silent treatment for 6 months after that. She's only just now starting to rekindle. She was going through a lot of mental health things at the time but I have a deep fear if abandonment which she knows and she still left me in a really bad spot. 

The lyrics of Life of the Fat Funny Friend say in another spot: ""Cant be too proud and can't think I'm pretty, do they keep me around so their flaws just seem silly"" and...sometimes I wonder if that's me. If I'm the almost pretty one. The almost skinny one. Kinda expendable and put in pictures and groups so everyone else looks better. I can't help but think I'm kept around because I make others feel better about themselves instead of being an actual positive addition to anybody's life. And honestly...I'm really lonely because of it.",lonely,Fat Funny Friend,2022-01-19 02:08:37

These days I feel so shit ever since December 22nd and ever since April 2020. I feel like a shell of myself. I feel trapped. I feel so broken, so tired, so alone more than ever. I can’t enjoy doing the things I love the most anymore. I feel so miserable, unhappy everyday. I used to be happier prior to the pandemic. I struggled in tenth grade. I almost failed science, I was doing average in English and visual arts and was doing average in civics and careers. I was concerned but happy I had good loyal friends who invited me to her birthday party, they were good friends they got me gifts invited me to their events. For once in my life i felt like i was a part of the high school community cause in middle school i was discriminated and isolated and alienated from my peers and it was a harder environment and a hard time for me. 

At first, being able to stay home was at first fun but it began to get so friggin annoying I felt trapped for 5 months without my cellular device phone during April-late August of the beginning of the decade. I couldn't contact my best friends from high school, I couldn't take any memories of during the early days of the pandemic, I missed out so much what was happening over the internet tik tok trends of the stay at home life, my television time is limited i cant even watch my favorite shows anymore, i don't play vidya games and im not allowed to , I have a short attention span now, I lost interest in reading books since eighth grade. I felt more isolated than anything.

December 22 2021, is a day that will live in infamy for me and is my current state of anger and misery. It bothers me and as a result I lost precious memories and precious times. I don't want to go into detail about what happened on this day but my device will be confiscated forever. This is my last christmas as a teenager, last christmas eve and last new years eve and new years day and last winter break of high school and i have 0 memories. 0 memories. 0 memories.

The thing that always brings me to tears is memories and documentation of my senior year. I will have months of no memories. I will have no photos of my 18th birthday, no prom memories or no high  school graduation and events. 

On December 22 2021, I broke glasses, I cussed and insulted and I threw candle holders down the stairs. I was punished for this and I am still miserable to this day knowingly “I will never get my phone back”. I will never have crucial highschool memories. Coming of age. No memories. Prom. No memories. Graduation has no memories. Last day of highschool forever no memories.

I never got to say merry christmas or happy new year to my best friends. I ghosted them and they feel like i'm being rude to them. Im treating them like shit on a daily basis. MY WHOLE FUKIN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LIFE I WAS LONELY I WAS ALIENATED, ISOLATED AND WAS NEVER INCLUDED AND NOW THAT IM IN HIGH SCHOOL. I HAVE FRIENDS. I HAVE FRIENDS AND IM ISOLATING AND GHOSTING THEM. and i will never forgive the bastard asshole who enforced this punishment upon me. Whos keeping me from my irl high school friends. Parents suck.

They say to keep more positivity in my life. This line angers me the most the fukin most cause its contradictory. My parent dictators  took away all my enjoyments and entertainments in life, they took away my cell phone, they took away the tv remote so i cant watch tv, they took away all my entertainment, i barely go outside.  im a small youtuber and i cannot upload content to that channel cause i used my phone for photo and video editing which can only be accomplished on ios devices apple devices and it just bothers me. One of my goals at the beginning of senior year was to document it cause its my final year of highschool and i cant even. I cant even document my memories. When im older and with my kids ill be looking back at this shi and i will have not enough memories and i will look back at this with fury.

How am i supposed to have more positivity in my life when my parents took away my phone. MY gateway to talk to my irl friends etc.

My mind is not at peace. And it wont be. How is one’s mind supposed to be at peace and positivity when all their pleasures, all their entertainment in life is taken away. All their relationships; my friends are put on pause until June 2022 when i will see them again. I cant ig them i cant snapchat them and it bothers me.   Im missing out on highschool and i feel trapped with these broke ass losers. 

Nowadays all i do is homework all day in twelfth grade. Im stuck sharing a bedroom with my younger sibling whos room i share with. These dictators treat me differently from my younger siblings. My siblings have their devices, they play games all day, they can contact their friends, they can do whatever they want cause they’re more well behaved than me. Im irrational, i act on impulse, i am always angry and miserable in comparison to my younger siblings who have more freedom and are more respectful to my parents than i am. My parents love my younger siblings more than they love me and honestly they deny this shit but its become crystal clear this shit this stupid shit has become more clear. They give them privileges, they let them have more fun in life and more freedom. Im treated like a little kid and im going to university in september 2022. I wanted to go to university to escape this suppression and im not allowed to go to university far away only local universities. These bastards didnt let me choose the school i wanted to go to. These broke ass stupid biches didnt even let me get a residence. Fuck another 4 years of being home with these suppressive dictator assholes. 

My siblings have they’re tablets, they can have contact with their irl friends, they play fnaf and roblox games, they watch tiktok, they have their snapchat and instagram etc. 

I don’t. I feel so isolated. So lonely and so angry.

My parents r ruthless and i have not a smidgen of love for them. They’re ruthless broke dictator biches and i dont love them. They treat me differently than they treat my siblings. They say lines that anger me such as having more positivity in my life when they took away all my entertainment. 

Everyday i find it hard to get up in the morning. Im so fukin miserable each and everyday and listening to and hearing my parents voice angers me. They are only nice and love my siblings. They dont love me they hate me with a passion to isolate me from my friends for 5 months. They leave me out, they made my sisters more happy than me. They call me unforgiveable for breaking 5 cups, for throwing candle holders down the stairs for cussing at them. I call them unforgivable for them ruining my life, for preventing me from contacting my highschool friends. For taking away my tv, for taking away all my entertainment. 

It doesnt feel like homeschooling anymore it feels like im stuck in a cage. A cage where im not allowed to talk to my friends. A cage where i cant watch my favorite television shows anymore, a cage where i cant watch anime anymore, a cage where i cant be myself anymore and its sad.A cage where i can’t do the things i love anymore.

To summarize my situation in one sentence:

I'm at home in someone else’s home. I feel trapped. I feel like I'm locked away from all the things that I love and the irl friends i care about and theyre telling me to stay positive. I lost a part of me,overtime. Im a shell of myself. A hollow shell who only does schoolwork everyday while my younger siblings have fun. Home is supposed to be where your true self is present, where you can be yourself. Im not myself anymore i feel like im being forced into a box and its horrible to me mentally.

My parents cause of death &amp; obituaries are public record so I am prepared for people to say mean things, people just want to make others feel worse than they do so I understand if anyone says anything rude, I forgive you &amp; hope you find happiness one day ✌🏼
 
I'm adopted to start off with so Ive always pretended I didn't have issues with it when really I always never felt good enough but I thought if I didn't recognize those feelings, they weren't there. It was a closed adoption, now that I'm 18 I can go find them but the last I heard they were young &amp; weren't prepared for a kid &amp; with everything that has happened recently in my life I think finding them a little later in life when my life has calmed down a little would be better. So I got adopted into an amazing family who hands down are literally the most amazing, kind, selfless people to ever walk this earth. But one small problem to our adorable little family. My parents were very sick. Even my grandparents &amp; the adoption agency told them they probably shouldn't adopt but they still thought adopting would save me from a worse life, probably in foster care &amp; they had all the love in the world to give me, so why not?? Right? Well, this is what actually happened.. my parents were already in their late thirites when they adopted me, my Mom couldn't convince b/c she had one of the worst cases of Crones in the county &amp; in a few years would develop severe heart disease &amp; a bunch of other health issues. My Dad on the other hand was diagnosed with kidney failure which is when he had his first unsuccessful kidney transplant which later ment my Dad working long hours then being at dialysis all night so I barely saw him. I was always a Daddy's girl so this naturally broke my heart. My Mom almost died from open heart surgery twice when I was just a kid. My Mom worked long hours &amp; most of the time I had no one to pick me up from school so I was always the kid that had no one to pick me up from after care after school because my Mom was still working. She would come home &amp; immediately fall asleep because she was severely anemic &amp; couldn't absorb nutrients so she only weighed around 90lbs at all times. So hard to look at now that I'm older and understand what sickness looks like. I ended up mostly having to raise myself, I was an only child as well so I didn't even have anyone else to tell me this wasn't normal. I never was able to ride a bike with my parents b/c my Mom's pace maker &amp; she always had to watch her heart rate &amp; my Dad was always drained from dialysis. Never got to go swimming as a kid b/c my parents couldn't get wet. My parents were always drained &amp; I was an only child so I never went anywhere or did anything fun. If my parents weren't working or in the hospital I was at home making them lunch while they were in bed resting. Never the less my parents were my best fucking friends. We never fought, they always accepted me, I was the reason they kept fighting through all their health issues &amp; the reason they woke up every morning to go to work so they could provide a roof over my head. I'm crying right now writing this thinking how selfless my parents were, I wish I told them more how grateful I was but as a kid I thought this was normal. I was adopted into a really Jewish family &amp; my parents pretty much knew if they adopted me, they would be essentially shunned from my family since my ""blood wasn't technically Jewish"" so I never had a family outside my Grandparents. My Grandparents we're some of the most amazing people as well too, like I seriously got so lucky especially being adopted you never know what situation your gonna get adopted into. So in 2012 I woke up one day &amp; my Mom was at work &amp; I don't have siblings so I'm home alone &amp; me n Dad were supposed to go golfing. I couldn't find him anywhere but his car was still in the garage, so I called my Mom &amp; she told me to check the house again, that's when I walked to the other side of the bed &amp; found basically my Dad's body facedown on the ground, with blood &amp; brain matter all over the walls &amp; ground &amp; bed. What I didn't know but found out later is his head basically exploded from a really bad aneurysm relating to not getting checked b/c ppl with kidney disease are more susceptible to aneurysm, so even tho I always think what if I woke up sooner or didn't sleep in till 9 I could have been there for him or done something but in reality it would have been more traumatic for me to witness all of that happen when I was still a kid, so I've come to terms with that as best as I can. Then a few months later my Grandpa died. That one I was just numb for so I handled that the best I could, Grandparents you at least know it's coming at some point but with my Dad it's something a child should never have to prepare for. Moving on to a few years ago. My Mom was literally my BEST FRIEND, we got really really close &amp; I became her caretaker when she retired after my Dad &amp; Grandpa passed. She really needed to be in a home with a full time caretaker b/c at that point she had a bad fall &amp; was in a walker with a broken hip they tried to do surgery on but from her OI &amp; the fact she was too weak to go under they couldn't fix her hip so she basically just had to live like that until she passed which was HEARTBREAKING to have to witness on a daily basis, she would fall trying to get to the bathroom in a hurry from her crones but always tried to act independent &amp; would get really mad if anyone tried to help her because I'm still a kid so she knows I shouldn't have to witness this or worry but she's my only parent, how could I feel okay going out and living my life not worrying about her!!! So I never wanted to leave or go out with my friends when all my other friends were experiencing things every kid should experience b/c I couldn't let her be alone, I came home to her on the floor one time, she fell and was like that for hours, still too caught up in her own pride to call me b/c she didn't want to bother me &amp; wanted me to enjoy going out for once. That literally broke my heart 😭 that's my bestfriend right there before she's my mother so it hurt twice as much watching her go through all this. So come to a few years ago &amp; she ended up suddenly becoming unconscious one day so I called the paramedics &amp; I was still a kid so I don't understand everything that happened but she essentially was about to die from heart failure &amp; her doctor literally said to me she's fought all these years b/c of me, she honestly should have passed a long time ago, so when he put it like that I understood that she had fought this fight long enough &amp; she deserves to be out of pain after being in pain literally her whole life. She was on hospice for a week before she passed &amp; I wouldn't leave her side, her own family only came in one day for 30 minutes &amp; left. I was only 17 with no other family or siblings. You would think an adult or even tho my family was kinda estranged, someone would take me under their wing or something.  I even had to wait an extra 3 hours, with my Mom's dead body at 3 am after she died b/c my ""family' was ""grieving too much"" to be there so I had to wait for the Coroner to come collect my Mom's dead body which I had to sign for. Fucking bullshit. So then I get home around 5, finally tried to lay down after literally being awake at my Mom's bedside all week, then around 8 I get woken up by a text from my estranged aunt that says "" Just so you know Grandma passed away this morning, we just got the call from the nursing home "" and then they blocked me since the only family that they talked to was now dead ( My Mom &amp; Grandma ) so I had to see them at the funerals a few days later &amp; they refused to even talk to me. Fucked up. All because I'm adopted, was going to college for music &amp; turned out bisexual. Towards the end that's why my Mom wasnt talking to her siblings or family anymore b/c they never accepted me from when I was adopted but then when they found out I was going to school for music not becoming a doctor or lawyer like the rest of my family &amp; when they got the wind I was bisexual they said some really mean things &amp; my Mom that's when my Mom put down her foot. But here I am still a child, with the only family I had in my life both pass away essentially on the same day, well not technically the same day since my Mom passed right before midnight but they died literally within 6 hours of each other, which am I the only one that find this creepy or ironic?!?! My Mom &amp; Grandma were super close so I understand. My Mom was my Grandma's favorite &amp; I was both their favorite 😉 just something that made me always chuckle especially since we always looked alike although I was adopted, my Grandparents we're the only ones that saw me as not being adopted which always touched my heart 💓 anyway, I was working a side job so I had a little money stuffed away, only a few hundred dollars because we all trust that our parents know what's best for us &amp; always have everything figured out. But that's when fucking reality hit.... My Dad made his part of the Will but my Mom was still in the process of finishing the Will. So come to find out I at 17, had nothing to my name. Nothing. I'm still fighting for what my parents worked so hard for in court because the will wasn't finished. My Mom's siblings were supposed to take care of me if something ever happened, which is did, but they gave up their rights literally the minute they found out my Mom died. Which this wasn't sorted out before is beyond me especially when my Mom's siblings were lawyers. But because of their own ego they wouldn't talk to my Mom so when my Mom &amp; Grandma both passed suddenly, nothing was sorted out or put in place. So right now I'm currently just fighting to prove who I am. When my Mom passed I went through everything in the house but I couldn't find my birth certificate, social security card, or anything like that &amp; the only ID I had was expired. Then COVID hit &amp; everywhere closed so trying to go to the courthouse to try to get documents or the DMV or Social Security was all closed in person &amp; I didn't have any of the documents I needed over the phone. So right now that things are slowly reopening &amp; now closing again,  I'm still just trying to prove who I say I am. At 17 I was in a homeless shelter a few months after my family passed b/c I literally had nothing in place &amp; I realized my Mom got too sick months ago &amp; since she didn't see her estranged family no one knew she was seriously dying. I also just never even thought about any of this being a kid. Like as a kid who the fuck thinks they'll ever be in this situation or have to plan for this? 😢 So thank God one of my friends Mom's took me under her wing, who's known me &amp; my family since I was a kid but just never knew what I was going through &amp; dealing with so now she let's me stay at her place to help me have a roof over my head when she can while we all try to ride out COVID again. But she's a single parent who lives in a one bedroom apartment with herself, 2 daughters &amp; me occasionally when she can since things are so tight right now. Especially since it's Winter where I live we just had our first bad snow storm a few months ago so I'm BEYOND grateful to have her &amp; her daughters ( my friends ) in my life right now helping me to get things sorted out with lawyers &amp; the will &amp; getting all my documents to prove who I am &amp; such. Seriously without them I would be homeless not able to get a job right now because I can't even get an ID let alone a social security card. Some of my estranged family has some documents I really need them to hand over because they know I have no way of proving who I am without them so at this point law enforcement said we'll have to bring them to court to get that documentation or go through the system but doing through the system to prove who I am can take YEARS. It just hurts because I feel like I'm an illegal immigrant in my own country 😭 going through everything I've been through these last few years has opened my eyes &amp; helped me empathize with people I never thought I would have anything in common with, but you never know what life will throw at you. If anyone takes the time to read this &amp; stupid as it sounds or even if you think things will never happen to you like I did, PLAN AHEAD, make sure your kids are taken care of even if your a young parent or think none of this will ever happen to you. Also no matter how hard things are, take a moment to appreciate who you have in your lives wether their blood or not. Also BE THANKFUL FOR YOUR FAMILY &amp; PARENTS NO MATTER THE B.S OR HOW ANNOYING THEY GET. I see so many kids my age treat their parents like shit &amp; it makes me angry 😡 So all in all, this is like the 3rd birthday &amp; Hanukkah/ Christmas ive had to go through without any family or gifts or a home cooked meal 😔 last birthday &amp; Christmas I was in a homeless shelter so to even have a warm apartment right now to be in no matter how cramped we are right now &amp; no matter that we can't even afford to make a cake or anything for my birthday, I'm just grateful for just having a pillow to lay my head down on tonight. If anyone can help make my birthday / late holidays à little better, I'd love to meet some new people to talk to &amp; make some new friends off this post 😊 if any kind people can donate, I know times are insanely hard right now so I don't expect anything at all, but it someone could donate it would seriously be the best gift I've gotten in YEARS 🙏🏽 this post has been the first time I've opened up about my situation online to anyone so please keep the comments kind &amp; I don't judge you &amp; forgive you already for any insensitive or ignorant comments.

I cant believe he threw me away like this. he wanted me to be dedicated, and I was. perhaps I deserve this treatment.

2016,hungryandsad98,1642508016,1,"I [M23] was recently seeing this girl [F23] from Hinge. First date 2 weeks ago, which was a museum and cafe. There was a lot of chemistry and we had fun. I gave her my number and we pretty much were texting every day after that. 

We went out again this Saturday to an art gallery and then she invited me to her place. We were gonna watch a movie but ended up having sex. 

The sex was good and she even said “I’m gonna cum”, and her legs were shaking. We hung out for another 1.5 hour after. 

But since then she’s ghosted me all of a sudden. We texted Sunday night and I asked her a question but she hasn’t responded. It’s only been 2 days but she’s never ignored a text before. 

I’m sad. I thought she quite liked me. She complimented me a lot, laughed at my jokes, double texted me when I took a while to respond, and her mum even viewed my LinkedIn profile, so obviously she’d been telling people about me. Even the way she looked at me on our dates was full of substance. 

As I say, it wasn’t a long fling, so I’ll get over it. But I’m really sad. I feel a little insecure as if the sex was bad, because it happened right after, I feel kind of used too, and inadequate, and also quite lonely.",lonely,Ghosted after sex,2022-01-18 23:13:36

I've never had this. Even in the one relationship I've had, I was never her number one priority. I'm no one's priority and it sucks. I'm going through quarantine right now and my loneliness has ramped up. When I posted I was covid positive, most people replied saying get well and all that. But that's really all. After that first day, didn't really get much in the way of messages.

Before i caught covid, I had gone out after work with a few coworkers. We just went to eat, but I had a good time and we had planned to have a poker night the next night. And I got excited because it's rare I get invited to anything these days. I offered to bring poker chips and was so excited! 

The main guy texted me the next day, asking if I was still down, I said yeah, I just might be there an hour after they were planning to get started. He said it was all good. So, I text him when I'm ready.

Nothing.

Ah whatever, he might just be busy, I'll give him a few minutes. 

10 minutes.

20 minutes.

45 minutes.

He's posting about the poker party while ignoring me. I just drove around and tried to ignore it. I already took my dad's poker chips, and I didn't want to come home and embarrass myself by bringing them home after being gone 20 minutes. 

I never got a text back. I just saw all the pictures and videos posted. Fucking everyone from my work was there except me.

I was almost happy I caught covid cause it gave me a reason to just stay home and shut off for a few days. 

But now I'm here, in quarantine, with no one to talk to. And feeling like no one wants to talk to me. I just don't know what to do.

2050,immortalvikinghero,1642485869,1,"Surrounded by people, nobody to talk to, no clue why i get in these moods, everything basically lacks a satisfaction factor. I feel like i'm losing in every aspect of my life and rationally i can argue that down but the feeling remains. It gets even stranger though when i realize i'm gravitating towards people i have no interest in. It'll be like i know this chick is boring but she's hella easy and slutty so i'll be like heyyy and tbh i just want to use them to distract myself so i recoil back and away so nothing actually happens. My woman is being an utter bitch lately and if i try to explain how off putting her behavior is it turns into me making shit up etc etc. I just want to enjoy life and feel like i'm making progress in some form or another but the universe has decided to be all like hey fuck that guy which is a shame, i've always put others first because i'm prone to a sociopath's mind/skill set. Being self aware that i need to do something because of something is basically how i maintain sanity. Like i'm very much capable of just being a heartless asshole who gets everything he wants but I ellect to instead try to be a better person by taking the longer roads in life but here i sit in this loathesome pot of regret holding a sign that says no hope no future because of decisions i made years ago and i just feel like i'm out of time. I keep my thoughts in such a complex state i feel as if nobody can understand me, it's like yeah i know how to get what i want but i made commitments that have turned into moral obligation and i can't convince myself to just be like fuck it as she has no where else to go, to sick to work etc, and then i fucked around and got dogs again so there's no moving to a cheaper residence without them and i'm not going to abandon the lives dependant on me just to have more magical paper. I'm legitimately about to just have a mental breakdown i'm just tired of doing everything and everything that pisses me off is basically just self inflicted. I can't afford good old fashioned drugs to help me cope atm either, just weed fr, i'm prone to addiction so i avoid anything crazy. For years i just coped by just basically being a sex addict, unfortunately a hole is not just a hole, i need a reason and currently have nobody to invoke that reasoning. Even if i could afford therapy, wouldn't help. I once had the idea of becoming one myself and fundamentally the only change i can make to better my situation is beyond what i'm willing to allow. The one conversation i had with an ancient retired therapist, back when i was still in highschool he basically told me the problems that i have from back then were that i became self aware to soon. Had i not discovered that i could compete academically at the national level at such a young age i likely wouldn't have learned how to control everything in such detail, that i'm among the scariest type of personality as the literal moment someone arrives in my circle I'll begin influencing their opinions of myself towards a purpose i'm not even aware of. Some kids my age half alpha complex or essentially the desire to be perceived as greater than they actually are, meanwhile i've already gone beyond that effectively becoming whatever it is i desired. That was approximately how i remember all of that, i was forced into anger management as a child but nothing he did or said triggered a response. Instead he said i felt forced into liking me for almost no reason. After explaining myself in each and every situation I was in that called for this requirement thats basically when he laid it out. I wasn't an overly angry child, i had already rationalized how to get what i want in the shortest amount of time possible. I'm actually enjoying writing this as it provides a moment to reflect on myself and how i'm just making my life more difficult for sport. Fr i think i just need a fwb to knock up at this point in my life. To old to be on this depression kick and to smart to let it influence me negatively. It's that the feeling persosts that it becomes a bother as i can deny my own feelings and they will go away in time. 

Tl:dr i know exactly how to get what i want but i refuse to as it's in opposition of personal morals and obligations, ask questions if you like.",lonely,Probably just entering depression again lol,2022-01-18 17:04:29
2051,Nature-Royal,1642485813,1,"Yep I’ve been single for about 3 years now and honestly I can’t see myself dating again. It’s simply draining to have to care about someone’s opinions, emotions, etc. I think what makes dating so hard these days is that we are overstimulated and women can literally choose their mate in 5 seconds. It’s sad because everywhere you look they are teaching women that love is about happiness lol. Anyway as a guy I don’t have time for the stupid games, I’m a stay at home type of person so I don’t need parties and constant adventure to feel joy. The biggest turn off about dating to me is the compromising, I genuinely hate having to give up something I like to please someone else and also the uncertainty of your partner is terrifying because that person could have desires that you will never be able to fulfill. If I were to ever date again my lover would have to enjoy living simple. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind going on trips and going to the movies but I can’t stand dating someone with so many needs. Being alone really isn’t that bad but it does suck that you will never be someone’s top priority and it feels like nobody will be there for you when you need them because they will have their own families and lovers to attend to.

It's really hard. Every time you open instagram, BOOM there's a happy couple, people who are just fucking, friends going on trips, there's girls shaking their asses and earning millions. 

Every time I go outside, there's people kissing or holding hands. People discussing about the next sleepover, moving in together, being happy.

Every time I fucking breathe, I feel like I'm just a rock in the middle of the fucking road who everyone's ignoring.
Girls talk to me out of politeness and then never call back. That has happened thrice in the last two days.
I don't know why it's affecting me so much.

The best part of all this is I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm a 20 year old student. I do freelance and I think I can get a job anytime I want. I'm 6'4"" and I'm not fat at all. I don't go to the gym but I take care of my health. I go running every evening for about 3km.
My face isn't that good looking but it's not that bad either. I'm a little socially awkward but I can make a decent conversation.

I know there are plenty of things apart from sexual intimacy which can make life beautiful but you cannot deny the part which a romantic companion plays.
I'm not able to even comprehend when people say things like ""we're in an open relationship"" or ""We're just having sex"" and ""I'm not ready for a relationship right now"" I mean, you're already having sex, doesn't that mean that you have feelings for each other? it's so confusing.

2072,im2lazy1,1642476551,1,"So as the title already says I'm a 26yo (m) and I've never had a (romantic)relationship, this never really bothered me as I always thought ""next year it will happen"" but it hasn't.

Now 4 months ago I moved into an appartment, after living with my mom, now at the beginning it was awesome,Freedom, doing whatever I want it felt so good.

But recently this feeling changed, I have alot of friends and we do things IRL and we play games online alot but most of them have a partner or have purely sexual partners. And they cancel plans because they are doing things with said partners.
As is expected at our age ofcourse.

But everytime this happens it feels like it takes a bit of my soul, because I feel I'm left behind and that I missed out on so much love and happiness because I've been alone my whole life.

This feeling has been building up alot recently and it has even gotten worse because the only female I regularly talked to and a had romantic interest for, also got a partner because I didn't have the confidence to ask her out.

Now I'm not the best looking guy and I'm a bit overweight so I'm also not very popular on dating apps, and because of my non existing self-esteem I'm to afraid to talk to woman IRL, though I have been working out recently and worked on my appearance, it seems like I'm all doing it for nothing and I'm just sinking deeper and deeper in this pit of self hate and I'm really afraid it will end up in a depression.

Has anyone had a similar life experience, and have any tips how to get out of this mind set because it's really destroying my mental state.",lonely,"26 y old, never had a relationship, just moved in my own appartment and loneliness is kicking in hard.",2022-01-18 14:29:11

My parents cause of death &amp; obituaries are public record so I am prepared for people to say mean things, people just want to make others feel worse than they do so I understand if anyone says anything rude, I forgive you &amp; hope you find happiness one day ✌🏼
 
I'm adopted to start off with so Ive always pretended I didn't have issues with it when really I always never felt good enough but I thought if I didn't recognize those feelings, they weren't there. It was a closed adoption, now that I'm 18 I can go find them but the last I heard they were young &amp; weren't prepared for a kid &amp; with everything that has happened recently in my life I think finding them a little later in life when my life has calmed down a little would be better. So I got adopted into an amazing family who hands down are literally the most amazing, kind, selfless people to ever walk this earth. But one small problem to our adorable little family. My parents were very sick. Even my grandparents &amp; the adoption agency told them they probably shouldn't adopt but they still thought adopting would save me from a worse life, probably in foster care &amp; they had all the love in the world to give me, so why not?? Right? Well, this is what actually happened.. my parents were already in their late thirites when they adopted me, my Mom couldn't convince b/c she had one of the worst cases of Crones in the county &amp; in a few years would develop severe heart disease &amp; a bunch of other health issues. My Dad on the other hand was diagnosed with kidney failure which is when he had his first unsuccessful kidney transplant which later ment my Dad working long hours then being at dialysis all night so I barely saw him. I was always a Daddy's girl so this naturally broke my heart. My Mom almost died from open heart surgery twice when I was just a kid. My Mom worked long hours &amp; most of the time I had no one to pick me up from school so I was always the kid that had no one to pick me up from after care after school because my Mom was still working. She would come home &amp; immediately fall asleep because she was severely anemic &amp; couldn't absorb nutrients so she only weighed around 90lbs at all times. So hard to look at now that I'm older and understand what sickness looks like. I ended up mostly having to raise myself, I was an only child as well so I didn't even have anyone else to tell me this wasn't normal. I never was able to ride a bike with my parents b/c my Mom's pace maker &amp; she always had to watch her heart rate &amp; my Dad was always drained from dialysis. Never got to go swimming as a kid b/c my parents couldn't get wet. My parents were always drained &amp; I was an only child so I never went anywhere or did anything fun. If my parents weren't working or in the hospital I was at home making them lunch while they were in bed resting. Never the less my parents were my best fucking friends. We never fought, they always accepted me, I was the reason they kept fighting through all their health issues &amp; the reason they woke up every morning to go to work so they could provide a roof over my head. I'm crying right now writing this thinking how selfless my parents were, I wish I told them more how grateful I was but as a kid I thought this was normal. I was adopted into a really Jewish family &amp; my parents pretty much knew if they adopted me, they would be essentially shunned from my family since my ""blood wasn't technically Jewish"" so I never had a family outside my Grandparents. My Grandparents we're some of the most amazing people as well too, like I seriously got so lucky especially being adopted you never know what situation your gonna get adopted into. So in 2012 I woke up one day &amp; my Mom was at work &amp; I don't have siblings so I'm home alone &amp; me n Dad were supposed to go golfing. I couldn't find him anywhere but his car was still in the garage, so I called my Mom &amp; she told me to check the house again, that's when I walked to the other side of the bed &amp; found basically my Dad's body facedown on the ground, with blood &amp; brain matter all over the walls &amp; ground &amp; bed. What I didn't know but found out later is his head basically exploded from a really bad aneurysm relating to not getting checked b/c ppl with kidney disease are more susceptible to aneurysm, so even tho I always think what if I woke up sooner or didn't sleep in till 9 I could have been there for him or done something but in reality it would have been more traumatic for me to witness all of that happen when I was still a kid, so I've come to terms with that as best as I can. Then a few months later my Grandpa died. That one I was just numb for so I handled that the best I could, Grandparents you at least know it's coming at some point but with my Dad it's something a child should never have to prepare for. Moving on to a few years ago. My Mom was literally my BEST FRIEND, we got really really close &amp; I became her caretaker when she retired after my Dad &amp; Grandpa passed. She really needed to be in a home with a full time caretaker b/c at that point she had a bad fall &amp; was in a walker with a broken hip they tried to do surgery on but from her OI &amp; the fact she was too weak to go under they couldn't fix her hip so she basically just had to live like that until she passed which was HEARTBREAKING to have to witness on a daily basis, she would fall trying to get to the bathroom in a hurry from her crones but always tried to act independent &amp; would get really mad if anyone tried to help her because I'm still a kid so she knows I shouldn't have to witness this or worry but she's my only parent, how could I feel okay going out and living my life not worrying about her!!! So I never wanted to leave or go out with my friends when all my other friends were experiencing things every kid should experience b/c I couldn't let her be alone, I came home to her on the floor one time, she fell and was like that for hours, still too caught up in her own pride to call me b/c she didn't want to bother me &amp; wanted me to enjoy going out for once. That literally broke my heart 😭 that's my bestfriend right there before she's my mother so it hurt twice as much watching her go through all this. So come to a few years ago &amp; she ended up suddenly becoming unconscious one day so I called the paramedics &amp; I was still a kid so I don't understand everything that happened but she essentially was about to die from heart failure &amp; her doctor literally said to me she's fought all these years b/c of me, she honestly should have passed a long time ago, so when he put it like that I understood that she had fought this fight long enough &amp; she deserves to be out of pain after being in pain literally her whole life. She was on hospice for a week before she passed &amp; I wouldn't leave her side, her own family only came in one day for 30 minutes &amp; left. I was only 17 with no other family or siblings. You would think an adult or even tho my family was kinda estranged, someone would take me under their wing or something.  I even had to wait an extra 3 hours, with my Mom's dead body at 3 am after she died b/c my ""family' was ""grieving too much"" to be there so I had to wait for the Coroner to come collect my Mom's dead body which I had to sign for. Fucking bullshit. So then I get home around 5, finally tried to lay down after literally being awake at my Mom's bedside all week, then around 8 I get woken up by a text from my estranged aunt that says "" Just so you know Grandma passed away this morning, we just got the call from the nursing home "" and then they blocked me since the only family that they talked to was now dead ( My Mom &amp; Grandma ) so I had to see them at the funerals a few days later &amp; they refused to even talk to me. Fucked up. All because I'm adopted, was going to college for music &amp; turned out bisexual. Towards the end that's why my Mom wasnt talking to her siblings or family anymore b/c they never accepted me from when I was adopted but then when they found out I was going to school for music not becoming a doctor or lawyer like the rest of my family &amp; when they got the wind I was bisexual they said some really mean things &amp; my Mom that's when my Mom put down her foot. But here I am still a child, with the only family I had in my life both pass away essentially on the same day, well not technically the same day since my Mom passed right before midnight but they died literally within 6 hours of each other, which am I the only one that find this creepy or ironic?!?! My Mom &amp; Grandma were super close so I understand. My Mom was my Grandma's favorite &amp; I was both their favorite 😉 just something that made me always chuckle especially since we always looked alike although I was adopted, my Grandparents we're the only ones that saw me as not being adopted which always touched my heart 💓 anyway, I was working a side job so I had a little money stuffed away, only a few hundred dollars because we all trust that our parents know what's best for us &amp; always have everything figured out. But that's when fucking reality hit.... My Dad made his part of the Will but my Mom was still in the process of finishing the Will. So come to find out I at 17, had nothing to my name. Nothing. I'm still fighting for what my parents worked so hard for in court because the will wasn't finished. My Mom's siblings were supposed to take care of me if something ever happened, which is did, but they gave up their rights literally the minute they found out my Mom died. Which this wasn't sorted out before is beyond me especially when my Mom's siblings were lawyers. But because of their own ego they wouldn't talk to my Mom so when my Mom &amp; Grandma both passed suddenly, nothing was sorted out or put in place. So right now I'm currently just fighting to prove who I am. When my Mom passed I went through everything in the house but I couldn't find my birth certificate, social security card, or anything like that &amp; the only ID I had was expired. Then COVID hit &amp; everywhere closed so trying to go to the courthouse to try to get documents or the DMV or Social Security was all closed in person &amp; I didn't have any of the documents I needed over the phone. So right now that things are slowly reopening &amp; now closing again,  I'm still just trying to prove who I say I am. At 17 I was in a homeless shelter a few months after my family passed b/c I literally had nothing in place &amp; I realized my Mom got too sick months ago &amp; since she didn't see her estranged family no one knew she was seriously dying. I also just never even thought about any of this being a kid. Like as a kid who the fuck thinks they'll ever be in this situation or have to plan for this? 😢 So thank God one of my friends Mom's took me under her wing, who's known me &amp; my family since I was a kid but just never knew what I was going through &amp; dealing with so now she let's me stay at her place to help me have a roof over my head when she can while we all try to ride out COVID again. But she's a single parent who lives in a one bedroom apartment with herself, 2 daughters &amp; me occasionally when she can since things are so tight right now. Especially since it's Winter where I live we just had our first bad snow storm a few months ago so I'm BEYOND grateful to have her &amp; her daughters ( my friends ) in my life right now helping me to get things sorted out with lawyers &amp; the will &amp; getting all my documents to prove who I am &amp; such. Seriously without them I would be homeless not able to get a job right now because I can't even get an ID let alone a social security card. Some of my estranged family has some documents I really need them to hand over because they know I have no way of proving who I am without them so at this point law enforcement said we'll have to bring them to court to get that documentation or go through the system but doing through the system to prove who I am can take YEARS. It just hurts because I feel like I'm an illegal immigrant in my own country 😭 going through everything I've been through these last few years has opened my eyes &amp; helped me empathize with people I never thought I would have anything in common with, but you never know what life will throw at you. If anyone takes the time to read this &amp; stupid as it sounds or even if you think things will never happen to you like I did, PLAN AHEAD, make sure your kids are taken care of even if your a young parent or think none of this will ever happen to you. Also no matter how hard things are, take a moment to appreciate who you have in your lives wether their blood or not. Also BE THANKFUL FOR YOUR FAMILY &amp; PARENTS NO MATTER THE B.S OR HOW ANNOYING THEY GET. I see so many kids my age treat their parents like shit &amp; it makes me angry 😡 So all in all, this is like the 3rd birthday &amp; Hanukkah/ Christmas ive had to go through without any family or gifts or a home cooked meal 😔 last birthday &amp; Christmas I was in a homeless shelter so to even have a warm apartment right now to be in no matter how cramped we are right now &amp; no matter that we can't even afford to make a cake or anything for my birthday, I'm just grateful for just having a pillow to lay my head down on tonight. If anyone can help make my birthday / late holidays à little better, I'd love to meet some new people to talk to &amp; make some new friends off this post 😊 if any kind people can donate, I know times are insanely hard right now so I don't expect anything at all, but it someone could donate it would seriously be the best gift I've gotten in YEARS 🙏🏽 this post has been the first time I've opened up about my situation online to anyone so please keep the comments kind &amp; I don't judge you &amp; forgive you already for any insensitive or ignorant comments. I've been crying the whole time I've been writing this post so I apologize for any misspelled words or anything that doesn't make sense 😭  I'll do my best to answer any questions, I'm an open book!  📚 

tldr; I'm adopted, my family passed away when I was young &amp; haven't been able to celebrate my birthday or holidays with anyone &amp; been in homeless shelters the last few years, If anyone can donate or just be a kind person so I have someone to talk to so I don't feel as alone that would mean the fucking world to me 🌎🙏🏽😭",lonely,My birthday is in one day....,2022-01-18 11:22:06

I like to go to the beach to watch the sunset, drive a yacht out fishing, go to the wild barbecue to enjoy the food, running sports to make me forget, golf and customers for business communication, watch international news to let me pay attention to what is happening in the world every day, looking for a mature and stable man with a world view and a story, your age can not be smaller than mine, I hope you send me a text message the first sentence is to tell me your age.

2104,Italktothewind197,1642463979,1,"Where to start? haven't we all been there before? You know somethings wrong but just can't explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

I function like a robot. Nothing I do has any emotional relevance at all. I have no friends and don't care to make any at this point. I've never dated and will not try. 

&amp;#x200B;

While watching a tv show I realized that dating is so alien to me. I don't know how people could be all touchy with each other. I could never tell someone that I love them. I will never do it. I have never told anyone that I even care about them either. There is no drive for me. Say I go on a date, I won't speak. There is nothing for me to say. I don't care for what they have to say. I just can't do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school I believe I was picked on and that it affected me significantly psychologically. I had no friends. I was bullied by people in several ways. No one ever invited me to a single thing. No one and I mean no one cared for me. I have a deep seated hatred of people in society. I do not trust them at all. A teacher even bullied me. In his words I was very dumb and that it appeared as if I were ""there physically however not mentally."" (Your tax dollars at work) The people there insulted me. They had to make a concerted effort to tell me I was inferior. I had to attend the prom (if that's what it is called?) to record the attention seeking people in big dresses who I have hated my entire life. I wore normal clothing. No suit or tie. I did not like being there. I didn't want to be there. I would get kicked out of desks so that other students with better social status could have the seat. No teacher intervention but I did anything I would surely be punished. The good people made my life hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there is more to life but not for me. Everyday I am alone and I stay that way. I don't relate to people. Living a life which involves all of these friends and dating is completely alien to me. I haven't spoken to someone in days and I don't have actual conversations for about a month at a time (I really only talk to my parents.) 

&amp;#x200B;

If someone were to ask what did over the weekend I would tell them that I did school work, ate food, and slept because that's all I do. If someone asked how I felt I would state that I exist. Happiness is odd. I had a 4.00 gpa which only a fraction of the people at my college had and yet I did not care to get it. I do not care for anything. Nothing brings me excitement. 

&amp;#x200B;

The emotionally displays of some people I know are not something I partake in. Hugging is not something I do. Kissing either.

2119,Spiritual_Okra_5228,1642458015,1,"After countless rejections, I was lucky enough to be in my first relationship two years ago, but I had to call it off even though I still really loved her. I only saw her once and I couldn't bare the burden of the distance anymore when it began affecting my mental well-being.

I would describe myself as someone who prioritizes the character and personality traits of a person over their physical appearance or the bodily proportions they possess. I just want someone who wants me and likes me, like I them. 


I turned 22 recently and the amount of times I've been turned down this past year alone just makes me feel depressed. It's always the same pattern. 
I go on a date or start writing with someone I recently met, we get along well, they show a little interest, I overcommit and become clingy, then they just want to stay friends, and that's the last I hear of them. 
When I try my best to play it cool, I get nothing from them that might insinuate them wanting anything more than another friendship where you just like their Instagram posts and ask questions about their stories from time to time.
Whenever I'm lucky enough to eventually find someone who actively pays a decent amount of attention, like hitting me up first on a regular or not taking days to respond, they stop immediately I try to make a move. I literally get no form of nonplatonic attention from the opposite sex in any manner.

My roommate of ca. 2 years recently went on vacation and it made me realize how much lonelier I would even be when he eventually moves out. I have this big apartment to myself and enough things to keep me entertained for brief moments before I realize I have nobody to share them with and how lonely I truly am. Sure I could distract myself some more with hours of work, mingling with friends or vigorous exercising, but it doesn't change the fact that I still deeply crave intimacy and warmth, something more than a ""friend"" could give.
I want it so bad and I don't understand why it has been so difficult to find it.

It always brings me down when I know I try my very best every day at becoming a better individual. Picking up new skills, trying out new fashion style, watching videos to better my rhetorics and wittiness with the ladies, meeting new people outside my circle of interest in hopes of it one day being enough to attract a lady, but knowing very well that it has never been enough. On the other hand, my friends who put in the bare minimum, can effortlessly get the lady they want. I don't get it.

Nobody wants to be with me and I'm exhausted by the thought of it every single day 😔

I don’t want to go into too much detail as to where those feelings come from but all of my life, people treated me as if I have no right to exist, or exist according to their preconceived expectations. And obviously since how I live isn’t bound by what others expect of me, I’m punished by those same people, which unfortunately seem to be the majority of people I come across is my life. It makes forming connections with people in general difficult and a burden.

If people won’t change their premature perception of me regardless of what I do then I’ll ignore it and do what I want anyway.

(I have some health conditions, some of which mean I have to be careful about what I eat, and I don't drink alcohol) I didn't want my issues to interfere with arrangements, so I made it really clear, I was happy to do anything or go anywhere.
I was messaged to say there would be a lunch at a nice hotel. Great. Except I've since found out there is also a dinner, with other family members invited and everyone is staying the night.
I have not been invited to this at all. I thought at first it could be because they didn't want to invite my child, as it would be boozy, but then they know I could easily get child care so it can't be that.
It's left me feeling really sad and left out.
I'm not going to bring it up as it'll turn into a whole thing, and I don't want that. I'm not invited and I accept that, it just feels really horrible. There hasn't been a falling out, and we've always got on well etc.",lonely,Feeling excluded by family.,2022-01-17 19:42:40

2205,lifeonvibes,1642399476,1,"The name of the book is bhagwat geeta/bhagwaad Gita! 

What's this is the question and answer session between lord Krishna! And Arjun

Who r these two people?
Lord Krishna is a god and Arjun is a warrior who is in a between of a battle and is questioning everything! 
Like why to fight this battle and what if I win this what's next? And purpose of life? And such questions which somewhere we r also asking our self and seeking answers too! 

The reason of his sudden doubt is because his opponents in the battle are none other then his own brothers! Yea now how did he ended up in that situation to know that entire story u need to read/watch/ research about 'Mahabharat'  Mahabharat is world's longest epic! And has a story of the betrayal and trust and friendship, and almost the emotions are shown in this epic! 

U can kinda concider it game of thrones but way more sensible and to the point with a better story!  
Now let's get back to Bhagwaad Gita.

It's a book with answers thats all I wanna say....I would suggest it reading in its original language Sanskrit, or Hindi would be great too! Or marathi, tamil, telugu, or so many religional Indian languages.

 But I would suggest keep the English translation as the last option! Because English doesn't have so many words to actually translate the true meaning and essence of the book I hope u completely understand what I m trying to say by taking the example of dub anime and sub anime! 


Thanks for reading this much from ur valuable time my intention was to help u guys fight through the lonleyness ur in and side effects realated to it! 

Also I know what ever information I gave about the book is less, and doesn't really sells my idea! But my intention was never to sell it! My intention is to help u! 

Hope u have a really beautiful and lovely day! And life! 🙏

2214,Mad_Season_1994,1642396750,1,"I can honestly say that I did not have a happy life growing up. I have happy memories from my childhood, of course. But I can't ever recall being truly happy and carefree and all that. My home life wasn't always great as my parents fought like cats and dogs a lot. Nothing abusive or anything of the sort, just the tiniest things would set them off and I'd always have to be in earshot of it. My school life was also, of course, not great either. I was (and still am) a loner who only really had friends in elementary school. But from middle school onwards, I was on my own. No birthday parties to go to, no summer breaks spent with friends, not even any romantic relationships. Just me, myself and I.

But, I did find some small measure of comfort in books and movies. And I found the most comfort, and safety, in the Harry Potter series. I was never really imaginative, but found myself sucked in every time I opened one of the books or watched the movies. At the very least, they were a break from reality for me and gave me entertainment, joy and happiness when I needed it most.

So, I decided to give the Return to Hogwarts documentary a watch and thought it was great. Seeing the people I practically grew up with all back together again, having that same level of love and affection for each other was heartwarming. But, upon reflection, I found myself feeling depressed because it reminded me of so many of the things I never had growing up and what I missed out on, all because of my shyness and inability to connect with people. I knew that if Hogwarts was real, I'd have no place in it. If anything, I'd probably turn out like Tom Riddle, minus the being evil and having a desire for world domination, of course.

I've never told anyone this but had an urge to get it all out and off my chest.

Usually when I’m working on projects I don’t feel too bad, I don’t know how to explain how I feel. I feel numb most of the time, I can’t smile or laugh anymore genuinely. Shows don’t make me laugh at all, jokes don’t make me laugh. Honestly almost nothing brings me joy. I do not want to harm myself though, I just randomly feel like there is no purpose to anything and I sometimes get scared out of nowhere because life creeps me out. How do I explain this??? I guess the best way to explain is that life is so weird and sometimes idk how to deal with it and there is just too much going on. I also have a lot of intrusive thoughts and I hate myself for it. I can’t stop them though, sometimes when people talk to me, my mind goes somewhere else and I pretend to listen, I don’t mean to do this but it just happens. I think of random words or stupid shit over and over and almost everyday I think about dumb things I’ve done or said in the past and it’s like a loop and I try to forgive myself but I just can’t and start thinking about how stupid I was. Because of everything I’m now extremely quiet and I remember how in my childhood I used to be so outgoing and happy and had friends and was easy to make them. Now I’m just feeling like crap because I just want to go back to how I was but I can’t because I can’t move on from 14 years of being socially anxious since I got bullied when I moved to another country. I just feel ugly and worthless and I genuinely just wish I could be outgoing and I want people to love me but since I’m known as a quiet person I fear I can never go back to that, it’s like a stain that can’t be removed anymore or that it’s too late and now i am alone and i can’t even get the guts to talk to people or message old friends and my cousins don’t like me I think. And i know for a little i did dumb things and acted childish because I wanted attention and validation. Now I’m away from home with my husband but I don’t have any friends and I fear I never will again even tho I wanna try, I just feel like puking when I have to interact with people and I know how bad I was at by old job, everyone talking while I almost never said a word, I just can’t get close to people.

Within the span of eight months, I got sober, found a new career path that I love, went back to school, am saving money to put down on a mortgage for a house, and am constantly bettering myself each and every day.

One month from now will be the anniversary of me not being in a relationship for two years now. I have so much to give yet no one wants to receive it. I don't really care that much about sex or anything like that. I just want to hold someone in my arms again and know what it feels like to be loved.

What's the point of having all these things and making all these strides in my career/personal life, if there isn't anyone around to share that joy with?

The only women I seem to attract want the complete opposite of what I do. I am either not attracted to them, they want dick, a free meal, or a combination of the three. I know it sounds lame af, but I want to find someone who is my everything and I can't take this loneliness anymore.

2257,InfiniteBurger799,1642379360,1,"I used to be somewhat popular, and I had enough friends that I was happy.  Then near the end of my Sophomore year I started dating someone who was very manipulative. They made block everyone so they could have me for themselves. They also monitored me with life360, and would get pissed if I was social. Worst part is that I went along with it. I didn't stand up for myself and they steamrolled my social life. By the time I dumped them I had a singular friend left. It was also the middle of the pandemic when I dumped them, so I couldn't exactly go make new friends easily. 

I attempted to fix things with my old friend group. That started to go pretty well. For a few months things were heading back to normal. I had my friends back, and I was relearning how to be social after not doing it for a while. I even started seeing someone else. It all crumbled down though. I drifted slightly from the group again because of my partner and a job I had just gotten. Slightly turned into more and more until I only had two real friends and my partner left. Somewhere around this time I started smoking pot. 

Pot is great. It numbed my loneliness. Eventually my best friend pulled a huge dick move. He stole my partner, and he stole $80 dollars of pot from me. Naturally he was no longer my best friend. Because my Partner and my best friend were both out of my life so suddenly, and all I had left was a single friend, I got rather depressed. I just started going through a ton of pot. 

My friend, thankfully, is a very good one. He introduced me to his friend group of stoners. They're good people, and I like that I'm their friend now. Before I knew it senior year started. Everything I had had in my previous years at school was gone. All my old friends weren't really my friends anymore because of my new stoner reputation. I had gained a reputation as someone who smokes a lot of pot, so nobody really likes me now because of that (Conservative Midwest small town).  Also as a senior the only new faces around are too young for me to really get along with. 

Socially speaking all I really have is about 6 people I smoke with regularly as a friend group. I don't have anyone to talk to at school. When we're not getting together to smoke I don't speak to the friend group all that much either. Its a very lonely life. I can't wait to get out of this town and have a chance to meet a new population of students in college. That's still 7 months away though. And in those seven months I will be largely alone. I can't even try things like r/r4r or dating apps to meet people because I haven't turned 18 yet. 

At this point my life is just hanging out in my room, working out and watching anime. Then I have to go to school for four hours every weekday, but I often skip due to being too depressed. I still go out and smoke with the boys, but that's kind of all we do. Its a lonely waiting game. 

I have the desire for a meaningful and social life, but people ruined my odds at having that here. I just have to wait until I'm an adult who doesn't live here anymore. Its like my life is on pause, and I hate it.",lonely,Waiting for high school to end,2022-01-17 11:29:20

The story starts with my exgirlfriend breaking up with me about 3-4 years from now. She was my best friend and showed me how toxic my ""friends"" act towards me at the time. She was basically my only real friend. I struggled in the beginning to overcome the breakup but after i joined the army I had other thoughts and I found new people, new friends and all the hardtime in the military helped me to finally close this chapter, well i thought so....

After I left the military a lot of friends moved back to their home cities and i was basically alone again but it didnt really bother me in the beginning. I had a job, worked out and life was doing okay. ""Covid entered the chat"" The Lockdown started and i thought to myself I can cope with it no problems. In fact it destroyed me mentally. All the hours in the gym or at work helped me to not overthink everything.

2 weeks ago my exgirlfriend contacted me she told me she missed me as a friend, stupid and lonely as I am I replied with ""YEEEES me too lets meet!"" She asked me if this all platonic and I thought so. Yesterday she told me about a guy she met at her work. I felt in a deep hole I couldnt sleep last night. I threw up today and I dont know what to do. I dont want to be lonely again but I think if i keep this relationship going I am literally going insane.

2299,Cheese19s,1642358625,1,"I had friends... it was some time ago, i can't point the exact moment where it stop being that way. 

I was a teen, i remember, i played a lot of games, watched a lot of anime. I had friends to talk about the things i loved, and they loved them too, we played together. I remember when we played minecraft or played pokemon altogether. Sometimes I would stay days inside home playing when I had a new videogame, but at the end of the day, when I paused it, they were always there for me, and I was always there for them too.

Maybe... It al started when they started smoking, drinking and partying. I didn't like that things, when we meet, my cloths always would end up smelling like smoke, when we played, they were always high. 

So I started to become distant. Everything would be fine. I still had some online friends and i have my videogames. What could go wrong?

Online friends... there good, but there not as good. We meet up one day during holidays, it's all fun, but... They only there to play. Sometimes we speak about life, and so on, but... This winter holidays I stopped playing and starting conversations since i got to town to visit my parents. 

Ding, Dong, make the bell declaring the new year 2022. My phone got out of battery, so i couldn't say happy year to anybody. I remember last new year, i send a lot of custom ""happy new year"" for each of them, they all responded and where happy. This year i couldn't, so i thought that it would be okay to wish them happy new year when my phone is charged up in the morning. 

So waked on 1st January, time to respond... to one person... My D&amp;D GameMaster wished me a happy new year, we aren't even close friends, we're more tabletop play friends. I felt so abandoned at that moment. 

I thought i was a little more close with my online friends, because, after all, we played a lot, know some thing about each other and meet irl. After that, i realized, that I'm the one that always started the conversation, and speak about life, they are not bad people, I'm just not as important to them as they were to me. 

Now, Sunday night, with 25 years. Playing video-games isn't that exciting anymore. Playing a entire day is just not possible anymore because I am an adult now. An adult, with some friends to play games, but not friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now is when i realize, that i can't vent to anybody, nobody for who I cared, cares about my feelings. The few things I can do is just to vent here. I feel like an empty jar that don't get love, don't get honest friendship... I have only myself. And if you are reading this, is most likely you only  have yourself too.

I rarely leave my apartment, maybe once a week to go get groceries or go to the same bookstore I always go to. I work remotely, so I don’t see anyone. And I’ve gone months without saying a word to anyone. 

I know part of this is just me, even as a kid I would rather be by myself than with other people. Also being an artist probably doesn’t help (2 degrees eheh) we’re all a bunch of social weirdos. I’ve found that after school you don’t really meet any new people within your age group. Artist groups don’t really exist anymore either, or if they do they’re so politically driven it’s nauseous. 

But the older I get the more I want to have some sort of connection. It’s hard to meet people in person now more than ever. I think it’s even harder to be a lesbian, too. I tried dating apps before but they never led anywhere, and I’m not really interested in people whose only personality trait is their sexuality (no judgement if you’re on those, just not for me).

It doesn’t make any sense that we’ll get together. We aren’t in contact, they’ve dated multiple people ever since. I haven’t seen them ever since as they moved away. They didn’t text me on my birthday although I texted on theirs. They didn’t text on the holidays.

But we’re still on each other’s socials. But don’t interact other than viewing each other’s snap stories/ig stories.

There was a time when I was happy and thought to get over it. I was seeing someone else in that time. But then they broke it off. And I’ve gone back to miss the ex.

I really try to meet new people, but I haven’t met anyone I’m slightly interested in. Nobody left that spark in me again. I’ve seen hot people, people that are share common interests and those who are entirely different. But I just don’t feel anyone anymore.

Kafka told her to meet him there the next day and they would come back to look for her.
The next day, when they had not yet found the doll, Kafka gave the girl a letter ""written"" by the doll saying ""please don't cry. I took a trip to see the world. I will write to you about my adventures.""
Thus began a story which continued until the end of Kafka's life.
During their meetings, Kafka read the letters of the doll carefully written with adventures and conversations that the girl found adorable.
Finally, Kafka brought back the doll (he bought one) that had returned to Berlin.
""It doesn't look like my doll at all,"" said the girl.
Kafka handed her another letter in which the doll wrote: ""my travels have changed me."" the little girl hugged the new doll and brought her happy home.

2373,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1642316029,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 26th!  ( Just one semester left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! I'm also open to voice chat as well but there's certainly no expectation. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. It would be great to find some good company.

2383,DakotaAshley,1642312944,1,"First time ever posting on here let alone posting my feelings that are so personal out to the universe. Super nervous but here goes nothing...I'm going to be 40 next month and by far the most alone I have felt in my life. A little over a year ago I fled a very toxic relationship and moved 400 miles away from the life I was building. It's been a very hard year. I've been mainly focused on self love and becoming the best version of myself. However, it's has been the loneliest journey. All of my so called friends from back home, maybe less then a handful will check in periodically. A lot of people I had to remove from my life because it was a toxic friendship or self serving on their part. My best friend of ten years suddenly stopped speaking to me without any explanation. My own family has yet to ask how I'm managing after such a traumatic experience with the ex. Went through the hardest year seemingly alone. I literally process all of my thoughts and feelings internally because I have no one to share them with. No one that cares at least. Family doesn't ask how I'm doing. I don't have a safe space to vent. If I do open my mouth I'm dismissed or told to move on. Even the simplest things that have no relation to the hell I went through, literally no one cares. I just feel like I care so much about my family and the few people I occasionally speak to back home but no one takes the time to truly give that same energy in return. I'm not ready to date and I certainly won't date because I'm lonely. It's difficult to have male friendships because everything becomes something I don't want it too so then I have to avoid that. I work at home which I love but I literally have one coworker with minimal interaction, weeks go by before we speak. I live in a town where I only know my mom. Legit nothing to do nearby, everything close to an hour away and then the pandemic on top of it. Most importantly I'm scared to invest time and energy into building another friendship for them to just vanish for no good reason. Not one single person active in my life has any idea how I am feeling. If I say how I feel I'm being dramatic. So why say how I feel to them. Internalizing everything to the point when I respond to others it's in my own head.  My dad doesn't participate in my day to day life and is very selfish. If I bring up anything relating to any emotions to my mom it's just dismissed. Especially if I'm not handling them how she sees fit. Majority of what I say goes in one ear or out the other or is judged. My brother only cares about himself and not once has he asked me how I am doing in a whole year. And the only friends I thought I had turned out just to be people I knew in passing or share the same hobbies with. Not anyone has even wondered where the hell I am and I would see them 2-3x a week. The few who check in to say hi, I can't really speak to them about how I really am doing.  It's just me and my furbabies. Whom I love with all of my soul. They are great listeners at least. They love me and support me through it all. I just wish I had someone I could talk to about the ins and outs of life. Sharing the simpler things and all the complexities of being an adult. Paint colors and world bullshit. Someone to actually ask how I am and really genuinely care about the answer.  I know I'm not alone in the fact that so many other people feel how I do in this given moment but in my imagination it feels like no one sees me or even knows I exist. To top it off the more I grow and heal, the more I love myself and set healthier boundaries, the farther away my family becomes emotionally. It's even harder to make friendships when healing. To make matters worse I just feel anxious and down and don't feel like trying to rebuild my hobbies here so then it is counterproductive to meeting people and not being lonely. Sigh. I protect my peace at all costs but does that really mean complete and utter loneliness all time? I know everything will be okay, I'm grateful for my life, it's just so hard sometimes. I know the healing journey is worth it but no one talks about how hard, painful, and lonely it can be.",lonely,"Healing Alone...thoughts, feelings, goals, dreams, everything internalized",2022-01-16 17:02:24

2396,Dkw2dsadhours,1642308378,1,"Hi everyone. I’m not sure if anyone will read this, but it’s worth a try right? This post is going to be pretty long. Thank you in advance if you read till the end. Basically, I have to friends, I have no best friend, no one who I can go to. Weirdly, my whole life I never was able to hold on to friends and make lasting friendships. I really tried middle school, high school, college, etc. I’ve had friends each stage of my life, but they all ended up becoming acquaintances or I’ve lost all contact with them.

That happened to my last friend in high school. My HS friend let’s call her L. I met L senior yr HS and we clicked so fast and got along pretty well. We called each other our ride or die. We also said we’d be friends till the day we die. That’s how close we were. Eventually, we went to different colleges. We still kept in touch and hit each other up when we both came back to our hometown for breaks. However, txting became more of me hitting L up first. Eventually, L ghosted on me and blocked me on social media?... which I don’t even know y. 

I graduated college back in May 2021 and I had probably 2 people I became close with when I lived around there. We’ve had deep convos and told each other we’d stay in touch. Long story short it’s months after, we found jobs and we messaged each other every now and then. But now, again, I won’t get messages unless I text first. They also live at least 1.5 hrs away from me. I asked them if we can meet up and usually it would go like “I’ll let u know when I’m free” and I never get a reply or a “I’m busy” but I see them going out on weekends. Now, I’m 23 my day consists of working M-F 40 hrs a week, goes to gym after work, eat dinner, get ready for the next day/bed, watch TikTok and sleep. That cycle repeats everyday. I have no one to talk to, no one to go to when I feel lonely. I’m actually an extrovert, subtle introvert. Most of my friends have been introverts though and it’s hard, but I make sure to make accommodations because they’re meaningful to me. Also, I live with my parents, which we all know is already hell itself, but hey I’m saving money, right? 

I joined Reddit to find a community and not feel alone. Embarrassingly, I’ve even tried that friend option on bumble, but no match around me. I miss going out so much. I stopped going on my social media because it’s hard watching people have fun even if it’s just chilling with their friends. I long for that and I’m jealous. 

Thank you for reading again. I could go on and on about this, but Ik it’s already too long. I don’t need any questions answered, but starting a conversation or telling me suggestions or others having similar issues would be nice. :)",lonely,23 with absolutely no friends,2022-01-16 15:46:18

2398,TheBratOG,1642307206,1,"I'm a bi male in my early 20s and I'm feeling alone as shit.

3 or 4 months ago I dumped my IRL friends because i felt extremely detached from the social group as a whole. I met most of them back in school and for the most part I really enjoyed hanging out with them. However some of my friends' friends didn't like me. 

I explicitly remember one time where they were all gathered in one dude's house who didn't get along with me, I asked if I could come over too, but they all said ""oh, it's too crowded and the flat was small"" I've seen the flat since I had helped them move new year's groceries in to the apartment and while it wasn't the biggest 5-6 people could easily fit a 7th in there. I just said ""that's cool, but do you guys wanna come outside real quick to smoke up before I head home?"" trying not to let it get to me, but they declined. So i just smoked alone and went on home. 

I tried not to think too much of it, but it really hurt me even recalling it gets me a little teary eyed.

Several months after that I still hung around with them, but always felt like I didn't fit anymore. When we were walking around the sidewalks or through parks or whatever I was always the one to be walking right behind everyone else. The group didn't like the music I like to listen to, so I never got to play any and had to just listen to what everyone else wanted.

I once invited them all to come over to my house and smoke up, chill and laugh at random shit or whatever but literally only 1 girl showed up. (We still had a great time though, nothing sexual or anything).

But what really made me break up with my friend group was playing PC games together: I had asked them to come play Terraria with me, but instead they thought it was boring so Don't Starve was suggested instead, I agreed if they would play Terraria with me after that sometime, and they agreed.
So we played that for a bit even though I didn't like it that much. Everytime Terraria was on sale i would literally beg them to come play even offering them to buy the 4 player bundle just so that we can play together. And got rejected every time...

All these little things culminated in me dumping all of them from my social circle. 

Some time after that i saw them on steam playing Terraria and they even messaged me there saying ""you were right this game is awesome, we should play it sometime"" I joined the discord when they invited me to play, but lo and behold they were playing League and didn't want to go play Terraria with me even though they knew I hated League. I left the discord and have been ignoring them ever since.


Right now I feel lonely as shit, I shave 2-3 times a month, havent had a haircut in several months, I get up at 14:00-15:00, stay up all night, eat 2 times a day on a good day, I shower once every 3 days and I haven't done any excercise in months. Im underweight, groom myself infrequently and don't even have the willpower to do much of anything all day.

Right now the only friends I have are from my guild in WoW and even that is putting it generously since we haven't met and only talk about the game and only when we are playing it.

I'm kinda introverted and don't even have the willpower to chat up my matches on Tinder/Badoo.

I guess no friends are better than bad friends, but fuck me If I don't feel sad as shit.


TL DR: I dumped my friend circle cause I felt like I didn't belong and constantly felt hurt from interacting with them. The only friends I have now are from my WoW guild and even that is putting it generously. I feel extremely alone and sad, I'm underweight, I don't eat properly, don't groom frequently, almost never excercise, stay up and get up late and I can't motivate myself to pick myself up and do anything about it.

2400,No_Number8666,1642306507,1,"The pain, the longing is still there. I miss him so much. I just had to learn to live without him. It's mainly because I am alone and still feel alone in every way is why I haven't gotten over him. I miss him, he was my best friend. The realest closest connection I've ever had. He was everything I wanted, he was everything I needed. He was everything to me. I don't need or want anyone or anything else. I was the happiest with him. Even the worst moments with him are better than the best moments with anyone else. It's been so long since we've been in contact and I still feel this way. I've accepted that I'm always going to miss him. He will always be in my heart. My only hope is that I can meet someone special soon and build a life with that person, something that I could never do with him. I'm getting impatient, I don't want to keep feeling this way. Any little mishap in my life can trigger this feeling of mourning the loss of him. I'm tired of grieving. I've tried everything I could to get over him. Focused on myself, tried new hobbies, made new friends, travelled to new places. I did all of the self reflecting and self help BS that everyone advises one to move on from a past relationship, yet here I am. These were all wasted attempts. I look back and realize what a waste my life has been. It doesn't matter what I do, my life is still empty, lonely, boring, and unfulfilling because I don't have this person in my life. I'm sorry if I sound codependent or like I am making an idol of this person but I can't help how I feel. Believe me, I've tried. I don't have a meaningful connection with anyone. He was the first and seemingly the last. I just wish I spent more time with him to have more memories and know more about his life. I couldn't even have that, the love affair was too short lived. It's hard for me to accept because I am a hopeless romantic, but it is clear I am unlucky in love and every other type of relationship there is. I will just have to continue this lonely lifestyle until the day I die. I am not afraid of death because it will be a release from this painful sorrowful existence. My only hope is that I ascend to heaven when I die. That's the only reason I'm holding on to this life, reluctantly so.",lonely,Still miss my ex,2022-01-16 15:15:07

2410,Original_Username36,1642304947,1,"I had a close group of friends that I talked with often. We would talk to each other about things going on in our lives. We called this our ""rant sessions"" or ""story time"". I was in a relationship with one of those friends so I always had someone to talk to everyday. We broke up about 10 months ago, but we remained friends. We would still talk every now and then, but my friend group began to feel distant. My friends would often ignore anything I had to say. There was another time where they made plans to go out in front of me without inviting me. They added some people they met online to our group chat; at this point my voice felt more drowned out than ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point I stopped trying to talk to them. Eventually I ended up leaving the group chat we were in. Things seemed okay for me at the time. There was this friend that I met at the Target I used to work at. She became the person that I talked to the most. Things fizzled out with her, but that was okay for me. I just kept myself busy with school work. Things changed when I graduated this last Fall (2021). I realized I didn't have anyone to talk to. I had no work to keep me busy. I was struggling to apply to jobs in my field. To make matters worse, I stopped working at Target a few months ago to focus on school. I felt stuck at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I would try online dating at this point. Probably the worst idea I've had. I'm an introvert by nature so I don't really have any pictures of myself in social settings. It doesn't help that my self esteem isn't the greatest. I took some pictures of myself and made my profile. A week went by. I didn't get a single match. I tried a different platform (Tinder this time as opposed to Bumble). Still nothing. After, a few days I finally got a like. I felt so validated at the time. I sent her a message, but she never replied. I figured she accidentally swiped right on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the days went by I kept checking daily to see whether I missed any notifications on my dating profiles, but nothing. It was pure silence. I used to think of myself as average looking, but this made me look down on myself even more. In a way, it was funny that I couldn't attract bots either let alone a real person. I figured this would make for a funny story. Of course, I would change the wording to not make it seem as self-deprecating as this post. So I reached out to my ex. The following was our conversation (M = Me, E= Ex):

M: ""Hey do you have time for vc later tonight? I want to rant about something"" 12:54 PM

E: ""A 'hello' would have been nice. Would have responded earlier but was on a date.

Kinda busy with work to have a rant session, ever."" 7:57 PM

M: ""No worries then"" 7:58 PM

This broke me. We both had to move on eventually, and I know that. That's not what made me sad.  We were good friends before we started dating. I wanted to talk to her as a friend, not a potential romantic interest. Perhaps I was in the wrong to reach out to her. Our friend group would be busy at times, but we would always make time to talk to each other or play some games. Hearing a friend, I was close to tell me that they don't have time for me was very heartbreaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rant I wanted to talk to her about was a version of this post. I know that this post is long so to anyone that took the time to read it, thank you. Even if no one reads this, getting this out in the open feels liberating. I'll be okay. I may stumble from time to time, but I know I will always pick myself back up again.",lonely,I just need to vent,2022-01-16 14:49:07

I work at a gun shop and her grandmother came in to buy something with her. After talking back and forth for a while I figured it was worth a shot, pun intended. I gave her my business card with my phone number on the back and said ""if you ever need help learning how to shoot that gun, gimme a call sometime.

But because i was self-conscious about my situation because of perpetual intermittent seizures my life had been in stasis for years  , where i couldnt work or even function so i lied about my age and told her i was 36. Silly and trivial but i was so consumed with how i was perceived, she discovered my dishonesty and promptly broke up with me. She ceased all communications which was devastating as she was my regular confidant and source of conversations. All my other friends seem to be occupied with families or involved in a particular ecosystem (different cities, towns) away from me. I constantly ponder about her and ruminate about my deception which i am truly repentant. It just solidifies my disconnect from other people. I rarely find people to interact with that i find engaging, so it makes even more tragic. I just feel trapped in my pocket nightmare dimension unable to reach out and craft a rapport with others.

Probably best if you are more on the mature, older side of the age range. I can careless if you’re married, single, divorced, with a 100 kids, I just want to a decent chat and possibly a friend, at some point. Who knows! 
Not that it matters, I’m 6’1 tall, black hair, greenish eyes, natural tan/olive skin, and been told handsome. Also, I still think GOT is one of the best shows ever made, regardless of the season finale lol

I’m soon to be 19 and have been noticing more than ever this looming presence of loneliness. I have a loving family and great friends to be thankful for but I still find myself at times being lonely. I’m on a gap year right now and leaving for college in August; most of my friends have already started. I’ve never had a long term relationship; and the two women I’ve been with have only been for a night, nothing more. Sometimes I wish I had someone that I could be intimate with and express my feelings. I lay awake at night thinking about all the things I don’t share with anyone because I don’t believe myself to have anyone like that. I guess I’m wondering what you guys did to stop feeling lonely.

2446,MYSTIK_MINX,1642291534,1,"Trigger warning for mentions of abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost 2 years ago, I finally escaped an abusive relationship. He had me trapped for almost 3 years, and I sustained a lot of trauma. My view on relationships/intimacy has been warped since then. 

Before he came along, I was fine with others. I could get into relationships, have one night stands, friends with benefits, etc. I used to have fun, sleep around, enjoy myself (safely.) 

But his abuse has totally damaged all of that. 

I hate talking to people. I hate intimacy. I hate affection. I can count the amount of times I've had sex in the last 2 years on one hand. 

On the rare occasion, I do enjoy a kiss and a cuddle here and there, and I do enjoy sex when I receive it, but I've stopped searching for it. I can't do one night stands, I can't have friends with benefits. I turn down everybody who approaches me, even if they're attractive. I just don't like being around people.

Yet I still crave it. I'll have moments, like now, when I'm dying to be in the arms of another, but I can't bring myself to actually do it.

All of this damage because some guy decided to lock me away for a few years. And to think, he's out there with no issues. He's out there with a girlfriend, having fun, enjoying himself, acting as if he's not a piece of shit who abused somebody for years on end.

It sucks. I'm lonely, but I don't want to be around others.",lonely,[F23] I haven't had affection/intimacy for so long that I'm now terrified of it,2022-01-16 11:05:34

She was such supportive and would help me in whatever way she could, rarely that didt work for me. We spoke weekly about my studies but I think I benefitted emotionally more by venting out.

But after my exam is done and now when Im about to begin college, she is ghosting me. I am not not a fan of such professionalism. How can I just forget her. And I didnt even do anything, that is very unexplainable.

This made me realise how bad it must feel to be ghosted. So then I apologised to my other forgotten friend. And wrote another email to my cousin about how I feel. I told her that I wont call now and that I will write emails like these, to which she is free not to reply.

I’m a really useless and difficult person, not like it’s necessary or that anyone cares but I’m 16 and both of my parents and my older brother work.
My mom just recently started working a few months ago, and I encouraged her to take the job so we’d have more money 

But now I’m exhausted and stressed out because I have to school myself and my younger sister and take care of a 5 person household (plus many, many animals)

It’s not like I do everything myself, my dad normally cooks and helps with house work on his days off, and so does my mom

I wish I could have at least a break one day but then I feel guilty because if I take a day off whenever they(parents) are home it takes away from their day off

I’m not sure if my brothers done any work since he started working a few years ago, and my mom is normally tired when she gets home and does nothing except her own personal work(she had and has a part time, stay-at-home job) while my dad cooks and does stuff once he gets home

Me and my mom seem to have ahead a rough relationship, I hate it but I’ve always held a little bit of hurt towards her, I could talk about our history and ways she’s hurt me but that would just sound dumb and pointless

I feel like no one in my family “cares” about my mental health, my brother has adhd and that’s all that’s ever mentioned with the topic of mental health, if I ever brought up the fact I probably have depression and possibly an Ed, despite the fact thereare multiple signs of it I think it would be laughed at and dismissed

I don’t know anymore, I could probably talk about my issues and stuff for hours but it’s too difficult to gather my thoughts to type it out and typing it out makes me realizes how trivial and dumb these things are :/",lonely,I guess I am depressed,2022-01-16 05:25:47

2497,YummyBunny52,1642264206,1,"24M, healthy guy, introvert.

I have been trying to hit on girls since a long time, they don't like me, in simple words. I somehow turn into a cringe warlord, my anxiety and my memory like, turns against me thats why. 

The last girl i tried to hit on was a major failed attempt. The day she entered the classroom in my uni, i fell in love, a girl with beautiful eyes, like an ocean you can fall into and never come back. Always smiling, spreading good vibes, good hair, good accessories, just perfectttt. Somehow i replied to one of her comments in the class's snapchat group, the next day she sat behind me (she was late, that was the only empty seat). Somehow i managed to start a conversation and boom! I turned into a cringe warlord and blew my chance, she talked to me for the next day too but soon it turned out she knew this guy is an asshole. She didn't talk to me after that and found a better group with much better people than me. Soon she got a boyfriend and i was heartbroken.

After this incident, i decided that my self esteem is becoming a sacrifice in this procedure. I decided to make my mindset stronger, like creating an iron wall to stop this process on hitting on girls. I grew stronger with this mindset cuz i didn't give a fuck now, like about girls. Its been four years since this, and this mindset has ran flawless but now i am unable to maintain this mindset. I am becoming so desperate to even talk to a girl, like just chat etc. This is the fall of iron wall. I don't know if the society failed me or i failed society.

I cant afford therapy either so it's like I'm stuck to fix my own mess but I just don't know what to do. Two of my closest friends have left me recently mostly because I was insecure. I felt left out when they would meet up without me which is fine but they would hide it from me. I feel sad when they do that so I stopped talking to them for a while. I couldn't physically bring myself to talk to them. But now after the silence from me they havent reached out to me either so just like that the friendship is over. Just like that. I don't make friends easily so this really stung. I've been friends with them for over 13 years. I want to go back but I'm afraid they will do the same thing again which will upset me again and the cycle will repeat. I don't want to be so insecure.

Was very transparent that I am not looking for dating, swapping dick pics, or anything inappropriate, as I am in a LT relationship with someone but just feel like I’m lacking in the best friend department. I hit it off with another really awesome guy (I’m a gay guy so that makes it hard to find connections for wholesome genuine friendship on here in the first place) and pretty much were instant besties as we shared so much in common and got along great…like better then great. Then I go to message him tonight and realized I was suddenly blocked. Nothing had happened between then and the last convo we had where I wished him good night last night… we had gone to bed with things in a seemingly really fantastic place and I was super excited about the prospect of forming this new friendship with the type of guy I got along with sooooooo great and shared so many interests with. I don’t have many friends, none of them close these days, as I lost most of my friends after going through a really hard time in my life recently. Unfortunately, getting ghosted from the one friendship that meant something to me in a long time spiraled my depression out of control and has put me in a really bad head space and idk what to do. If I try to find a friend on here all over again there’s the possibility I’ll get ghosted again and I just don’t think I can go through this again. If I don’t try again, I’m guaranteed to be lonely forever.

Is there a better site than Reddit with a lower Ghosting rate (i.e. a site with less trashy people who have more class) to look for strictly a long term friendship? A gay guy looking for another gay guy for friendship limits the choices even more.

Hell… as long as I’m already on here venting about ghosting, if there’s any gay dudes age 18+ out there looking to develop a close platonic friendship with another gay dude (34m) then please DM or chat with me! I’m very kind (apparently too kind), open-minded, non-judgmental (only judge mental if you ghost me!), with a slightly off-color sense of humor. I have a big heart and empathy for others which unfortunately gets used against me often, especially on Reddit now so it seems. I’m highly educated with a Masters Degree and I enjoy the arts—theater, music, movies, and reading—of many various genres. I love being out in nature and love animals, especially have a soft spot for dogs. Location doesn’t matter, either online anywhere for chat or near me in the Midwes if you perhaps don’t live far and would be interested in eventually meeting. Looking for platonic long-term friendship with other gay men only. Looking for someone to share my interests and talk about my life with, but NOT to share dick pics LOL.

The only friend that I have is my mom, and we do almost everything together to the point that I get super anxious when she's not around. I've been in therapy for years, but despite this I've never been able to hold a friendship. I tried making friends online, but I stop talking to them for months and then they've moved on. I tried getting into relationships, but then i get bored texting them and end up unmatching them. It doesn't help that I'm obese and can hardly take care of myself. My doctor suggested weight loss surgery, and I've been looking into it but I don't know how much I'd change afterwards. I don't have a job because I've been put on disability due to my uncontrolled bipolar disorder (though I was going to the wrong psychiatrist and he had taken me off of all my necessary medications), and obesity. 

Every time I try to make friends I think ""Who would want to hang out with someone who looks like me?"" or ""Who would want to be friends with a fat person? Who would want to date someone my size?""

I've tried every single diet in the world (keto, 1200 calories, calorie restriction, vegan, etc), and those didn't work and now I can barely walk without it feeling like my back is going to snap in half. 

The only things I do every day is eat, play the Sims, or scroll through social media or watch youtube videos. I live in a small town with nothing to do besides eat fast food, go grocery shopping, or go to Walmart. I was in college but after gaining weight I couldn't walk across campus and my anxiety was at an all time high. 

I've just given up on myself, and I don't know what to do. I want to be happier, healthier, and have friends who I can spend time with and talk to, but I think I've ruined my life. Do you guys have any advice?",lonely,I've given up on myself and I don't know what to do...,2022-01-15 19:11:26

2534,NotMe28-0,1642231459,1,"[M/22] One day like today but 6 years ago, my father died due to cancer, the person I admired the most and inspired me to get involved in my actual career, just suddenly became a memory. Video games where my only escape from those times, playing so much that I sometimes forgot that I had high school classes to assist, and it was so much that I simply didn’t helped my old man when he needed the most. I’m always trying to look things the positive way but many of the bad memories I have are tattooed deep inside my brain, tattoos that have no shape or color.
From a toxic relationship that led me to almost kill myself, to be separated from all my friends by constantly moving out from city to city or by my own ex telling lies and stories of our relationship that benefited her side only. Or even to not being able to get a single date for a lot of time because “I have extra weight” or something of my physical appearance that makes me feel like I’m never going to be able to love someone the way I want to love nor to feel the love that I so much wish to experience.
Living by my own hasn’t helped either since I often wander on my memories overthinking of what I did wrong even if I try to get my attention on other things. 
I know I have a life in front of me, and I know I have to keep my head up but I can’t help to find myself feeling a hopeless, hollow heart and keep staring to the ceiling like if I were watching the stars as I ask “why can’t I cry no more?”.",lonely,Blank staring to the galaxy of memories we call ceiling,2022-01-15 18:24:19

2558,numberjuan10,1642224709,1,"Hi, this is my first post after quite a while of just reading posts and comments. 

Like the title says, I'm just kind of tired. 
Tired of always feeling like a third wheel. 
Tired of always feeling like a backup friend. 
Tired of always just listening to others talk, and not really being part of the conversation. 
And I'm tired of never having anyone 

Now, I'm not hopeless or bitter. I'm constantly trying to better myself. See myself how others might see me and understand where my flaws are. 
Not for the sake of others to change myself, but just to be a better person overall. 
And I do still believe there is someone out there for me. And friends who will feel as close to me as I feel to them. 
But it's been 20 years, 21 by April, and I don't see a change happening any time soon. 

But idk. It just feels like today's society isn't meant for people like me. I'm not outgoing. I'm not into hookup culture. I'm not into drinking or smoking or any of those things people do when hanging out. 
I was raised in a Christian family, and I guess I'm just more traditional. Not just because of my religious beliefs, but just because it suits my introverted nature. 
I want to meet someone and get to know them. Talk to them, and make a connection. Become friends while falling in love. Making sure to always talk things out and put each other first. 

And I want to make friends that I can listen to, and who'll listen to me too. Friends who can just enjoy our own company. Friends who don't need to go drink or smoke to hang out. Friends who can be friends for the sake of being friends, who care about each other and genuinely just enjoy being around each other without strings attached. Just friendship. 

But it's so hard to find people right now who want the same thing romanticslly, or who grt along like that naturally. Or at least it's hard to find people who are like minded.
Especially when I already find it hard to meet new people. 

But oh well. 
I don't know what the future has in store for me. 
I don't know if I'll ever find what I'm looking for. 
But at least I can hope. 
Until then, I'm fine with just listening and watching from a distance. Observing, until life let's me join in too",lonely,Kinda tired,2022-01-15 16:31:49

Yes I said it, I want the attention of men on a daily basis or else I don’t feel worthy enough.  The reason why I want this validation so much is because I’m seeing a lot of other girls getting it without trying while I actually have to try multiple times to get one guy that I like to respond.  It’s really annoying, and this really started kicking in after I started dating someone.  What worse is that I’m trying to restrain myself from saying anything to my date because of family issues and I don’t want to be an asshole.  I am also considering suicide again because of this and the lack of attention makes me feel insecure about myself about what went wrong.  What’s even worse is that I’m seeing my friends in happy relationships while I am struggling to make one.  This thing overall just increased my depression, anxiety, and insecurity.

Haven't had a girlfriend in over 6 years. Had 1 or 2 actual friends in high-school &amp; university, but with covid and living overseas obviously they have fizzled out.

No friends where I currently live. No motivation. Tried online dating. Tried going to meetups to make friends. No luck. I'm just tired. I have an internet addiction I've identified for years and I can't shake it. Anxious, depressed. Poor health. I want to have friends, an intimate partner. That's like, one of the few things keeping me going.

But I don't have them. I'm only getting older, and likely more depressed. I'm a sad, cynical, lazy individual. Pathetic, really. Too tired these days.

I feel like im being more alone than ever. I have a lonely lonely heart and im being mentally in pain and a punish myself. Everyday i feel horrible. Im in a house where i dont feel like family anymore. I DONT TRUST MY PARENTS ANYMORE they always ummage through my stuff they dont believe me anymore.** 

**please im in desperate need of help i need someone who i can talk to.**

I have 0% love for my parents. I dont love them theyre a bunch of dictators, a bunch of ruthless authority figures with zero heart and im not a close to them as i was before. I dont remeber the last time i hugged them. Their actions are completley unforgiveable and i dont give a smidgen of love or regard them as parents. They made my mental health go to nothing. Im so miserable everyday. 

In December of 2021 like early 20s I was angry at my dad cause i was failing chemistry i asked for a tutor; couldnt afford a tutor. The next day that morning, i was still angry cause instead of studying chemistry i was told to go clean my room and i called my sisters bitches and he got angry at me and my mom was shocked. 

Then he demanded my phone he wanted my phone to take it away from me and he said i was never gonna get it back. I refused and he kept fist hitting me grabbing me by my wrists, demanding it like a madman and i still refused and he kept beating me and my wrists started hurting me. I hid my phone somewhere secret and he stopped and the bastard had to go to work. 

So that evening i slept with my phone and he took it from me. I was angry.

So on december 23, he told me to clean my room for christmas eve and i started swearing at him calling him insults calling him slurs and he got angry at me under this facade of happiness. Then when he said i was never gonna get my phone back which means i was never gonna talk to my best friend let call her Melana. Melana i wont talk to her ever again and she was my best friend since 6 grade. \]

the last time he took my phone from me was 5 months in the beginnign of the decade i was locked away i couldnt talk to Melana for 5 months April-end of august. 

I got very angry i grabbed the candlesticks throw them down the stairwell, i went to the kitchen and broke glass like about 5 glasses cups. And i got the worst beating out of 2021 which ruined my christmas eve, my christmas new years, rest of winter break.

The physical punishment was brutal on a scale 1-10 a 6 and a half. He sneaked me from the back when i was walking out of the kitchen he made a fist and started hammering me, he started to twists my arms making them swore he started betaing me hitting my arms legs and back. The worst part was he hit me on my ear in a fist multiple of times so many times i started to hear ringing my ears started to ring i couldnt hear in my left hear for a while like up to 30 seconds. He pulled down my pants and started to spank me with his hand 15 times  on my bare ass and my thighs. I was in a pool of tears i pool of misery, shock, i felt like nobody loves my anymore. I couldnt breathe i was in shock i ran to my room and started crying and balling. 

I missed out christmas eve, christmas, new years i couldnt say merry christmas or happy new years to my irl friends and it bothers me. No family members i couldnt say merry christmas. 

I am suffering mentally in depression or close to. I feel violated them going through my personal belongings in my room and device. My parents do a room search they dont trust me i dont trust them.

Maybe some guys think that's the life and envy me, just having casual sex with no strings attached but I don't think it's for me. 

The absolute worst part about it, each and every time, is that usually right after we're done they quickly move onto to someone else like I never meant anything to them. And I likely didn't. All 3 of them quickly got into committed relationships with other people and 2 of them are engaged/married to that same guy.

2668,senko1_,1642158384,1,"I REALLY miss them, I think about them every day for years, its making me sad and anxious. After they left I did all sort of things to be someone to them, to be something to them, to seem interesting. Like going to the gym, learning musical instruments, Art, doing something related to their hobbies. No , they didn't tell me to do those things, we had really fun when the last time we saw each other, I just want to be someone or something in their eyes. They didn't say or show signs that they hate me or that they didn't like me, I just felt like Im not enough for them. Now Im just afraid that maybe they have forgotten about me. That Im doing all those things for them and turns out that thet forgot about me or just don't care about me. They rarely reply to messages, but they like my Instagram and Facebook posts. I understand that they have their own lives and other things to do, it just makes me really sad. I also don't want to annoy them, I don't want them to think im annoying.

What if they did really forget about me. I don't know what to do. I don't want them to forget about me, but I feel like Im not enough for them. I feel like "" Who am I to be part of their lives?

I do still live with my mom. We have a healthy relationship but she works until Evening. So our time together is very limited. I am looking for a Job and already have a few promising offers. The problem is they're all starting at the end of Summer 2022. so basically I will be alone without much to do, for another 2/3 of a year. Im already feeling like im at my limit. I had serious Depressions over 5 Years. Now im kind of scared. I dont feel depressed, just lonely all the time. I think its because I have nothing to do, and just think all the time. I wanna have a GF but just can't even get in a situation where I can meet other people.

I really have no idea what im supposed to do about this feeling. Its in the back of my head all the time. 

I started to cook more complex things. I started to play with my cats a lot more. I started to clean the whole house. Still I feel miserable all the time.

2678,Mani0770,1642150681,1,"It’s been so long and I was sure I’d have recovered by now. I was sure after so long I’d forget that the only person with whom I’ve ever been in love, the only person to whom I felt a sense of belonging, my home and comfort. But it never got easier. Maybe it’s because of my lack of enthusiasm about life, but after that ended all my other relationships suffered. One by one I isolated myself from other friends, other people who I previously considered my casual friends, those who I didn’t appreciate and never truly respected because I’d felt they didn’t deserve my time and attention as much as my one and only person did. But where did that take me? To be honest, I’m grateful for everything that happened, every sweet moment of lovely embrace will forever remain locked in my memory. But I’ve lost it now, without any warnings I’ve lost it. I never anticipated this day. When I’d say, my addiction, my carelessness and my passivity have cost me my only real meaning in this life. And it doesn’t matter what I do, I can’t accept it. I have tried to better myself, but it my every attempt proves futile, as I no longer have a reason to improve, to do anything, really. I gained everything I’d ever wanted, I saw the gates of paradise, but I was in the end despite my every attempt not good enough for it. And maybe, someday, I can remember our talks, our hugs, her comforting and warm words, the secure feeling of belonging and being unconditionally loved, without tearing up every time my mind pictures her figure again, every times slightly more distorted until someday her memory becomes so old that the only true source of meaning that’s ever presented itself to me in my life - Her - will turn into nothing more than blurred associations to a warmth that will I will for the rest of eternity seek again, and never received, for only that sacred source was capable of providing the light of purpose for me, and her lighthouse has abandon my begging and turned dark forever.

I talk to a person online the one time and I am left wanting to talk more even if I am a stranger to them. I don't know I just want to feel close to someone.

2728,Speakels,1642126861,1,"Hi so I (21f) just transferred to a University across the country where I know absolutely nobody. Thought it would be a brand new start and it is but I am crying everyday because I’m so lonely. I want to meet people and new friends and have a friend group so badly I just don’t know how.  I knew it was going to be hard not knowing anyone here but damn I didn’t know it would be this difficult. 
 
I’m a very extroverted person and if I’m alone for too long get super depressed. That’s why when I looked for housing I looked for people I thought I’d get along with well because I knew I’d anchor on them for social interaction and to branch while I’m adjusting to all of this. We live in this student housing apartment off of campus. One goes to my college and the other 2 do not and I don’t see them as often cause they work a lot. My 4 other roommates are incredibly sweet but I am afraid I might be annoying them with my need to always be with someone. I’m always chilling in the common room like either on my phone or on my laptop just to talk to someone and they always talk to me if they are out of their rooms but they mostly stay in their rooms if they aren’t out. I just feel so pathetic.

I just want to go out once in awhile and have fun on the weekends but feel like it’s really difficult for me cause I don’t have anyone or a means of transportation. One of my roommates like to go out a lot and I kind of want to ask her if I could come with sometime so I can meet new people. Im just scared that it would sound weird or I’ll come off as needy. I just really want to meet people and have fun.

I have really really bad anxiety that I am medicated for but it is still a daily struggle. I feel like my social anxiety is covering up my real bubbly charming and making me awkward because I don’t know any of these people and I’m just so scared and it shows. I just wish people could see and like the real me. I have just had a hard time connecting people. 

There is a bus that takes me to and from school but it only runs on constrictive hours so I admittedly haven’t been to campus much (hybrid classes). I want to go more because I’ve just been chilling at my apartment most of the time. Which is fine it’s a lovely place I just want to have friends and be with people and have fun like everyone else seems to be. I really want to try and join clubs but I’m having trouble finding them because they never had any sort of activities fair at the beginning of the semester and orientation was moved online. I’m even thinking about rushing a sorority maybe but I’m not sure if I’d have the finances to or if they would even accept me in.

I’m also incredibly homesick. I miss my friends, family, and boyfriend ALOT. I feel horrible for being upset because this is what I’ve wanted for forever and They have all made sacrifices to help me get here. I feel like if I let them know how down I’m feeling they would be really let down and upset. I’m trying to fake a smile when I call them but it’s getting harder. I feel awful for being in such a nice place and just being depressed as fuck all because I feel lonely.  I just don’t know what to do…

2742,SpiteDifferent7606,1642120693,1,"Hi guys. I just need general advice.

I'm a bit of a noob to reddit, I'm not sure where to put but I just need you guys to help.

I'm a male, 19, never kissed a girl, never had sex, never had a girlfriend. People say I'm reasonably attractive, but I know that's not true, it's just for my confidence. I'm 5'6, getting teased by women at work is not exactly confidence-boosting, actually sucks anything left out of my confidence. 

I workout a lot (as does every other 5'6 male on Earth), but it doesn't interrupt my daily routine or anything. I just wanna list a couple of my conflicts my brain goes through on a constant basis. 

Wanna start by saying I fucking hate my own personality. I will be screaming at myself in my head 'DONT BE FUCKING NERVOUS SAY SOMETHING' in almost all scenarios. But then obviously, it comes out that way because its just not natural. In pub situations I am confident but in serious situations or where I am intimidated in some way (hot girl, smart people etc.) I overthink what I'm saying. But what happens? Stoic/serious? People tease me for being moody or miserable, and take the piss saying I look 'cute' and actually laugh at me when they think I visibly look unhappy. Joking having a laugh? What are you laughing at you dope? I try to stay as healthy as I can diet-wise, get perfect sleep every night, yet I can be standing there and my brain and my mind will be in such a way where I can't bring or force myself to speak normally despite me screaming at my own mind to do so. Just feel out of it. Its horrible. People obviously tease me for that but its my own brain it just won't let me function. 

Insecurities. I'm massively insecure, about a few things. I'm short, and it never stops getting mentioned to me, first thing people usually ask me is 'how short are you?!'. Any time I'm outside walking, inside talking, I'm always hyper-aware of how short I am next to whoevers next to me. This makes nightlife terrible as well. I can't enjoy it because I am towered over by most women there. Let alone men. I have no chance. My teeth, which I clean twice a day, are persistently yellow. So I never open my mouth, leading me to mumble a lot. This obviously affects the way people perceive me. I have a 'large head' or whatever, people mock me about that a lot (nicknames galore). All this obviously leads to me disliking my exterior appearance too. It's horrible to be honest. I've had moderate acne for 9 years, no treatment has actually permanently got rid of it. Add onto that I WILL NEVER take off my t-shirt to anyone, let alone my shorts (lol), I'm white as anything and am extremely anxious of any future sexual encounter from how inexperienced I am now because of all this shit. My own family haven't seen me with my shirt off for years. I have an outie bellybutton which is probably the worst I've seen of anyone ever. But surgery costs 1.5k-2.5k. How tf am I gonna get this money? I'm a student. BUT I'LL NEVER EVER TRY AND GET IN BED WITH A GIRL UNTIL ITS FIXED. EVER. I just can't, don't say to 'get over it' 'don't complain' 'take pride in what you've got'. It'll freak any girl out, period. 

Then its the conflict. Maybe I should just 'man up and be confident'. Doesn't that shit drain you? I try I try and I try but the amount of times I get shot down. No one will accept me like this but I can't do anything about it. Girls don't take a fucking single look at me. And I know 'don't put your self-worth on other people or women'. No, I definitely will, I want to get a girl. But yet I see everywhere people who are my height, worst looking who get girls. Yet clearly I've never had romantic interest off any girl, never been taken seriously by any girl. So it must be my personality. I see girls sometimes call me weird, or whatever, but the way I respond to shit comes out this way because I'm overthinking so much and I'm not natural. But I don't know the alternative way I'd act even if I wasn't...

People call me funny, call me nice, I try as much as I can to be humble. I'm reasonably stoic, so not like in my opinion it's a problem with seriousness, people say they prefer me when I'm not...but then why can't I be taken seriously by any girls? I try to never be corny, I'd never chase after a girl, I play the game right...

And I'm likable to guys. I'm somewhere probably 'leaning right from centre' if furthest right is macho and left is pure feminine, and I get along with the most macho guys and can also get along with the most feminine guys, flexible in that regard. But my personality just seems to repel women. 

Should I act more macho? Or more empathetic? Women say men should be more open and empathetic etc. but love masculine men. Want a 'protector' bollocks. They'll cry about mens mental health on instagram but put you down for not be masculine enough (realistically, women go after tall, dark, big blokes, try and deny it you know its true). You try and be confident when every girl you speak to immediately mentions your height. Its hard dude. 

Am I a sociopath or something? Wtf? Surely I'm ill...but realistically a lad like me can't say shit like that to people....because what happens in your head and how people treat you in real life is completely different. People ignore shit thats going on with you because you can't go round acting like a walking mental illness all the time, although, pretty much, thats what I am. Constantly not concentrating as a result. But people won't speak to me as if I have because its uncomfortable. But half the time I'm so bummed out I don't wanna speak to anyone, just let me get on with my day if I'm having a bad one. But no, I gotta interact socially and come off weird or impolite.  

I'm always thinking in my head all day, that I gotta be a warrior. I've got to battle. I'm naturally lazy asf because most of the time I don't have a reason to even wanna get out of bed in the morning and have a shower, clean my room or anything. And if I do have the displeasure of being awake, I'd rather numb myself out and play a game or something. But nah dude, *be productive bro, keep up the grindset.* So with me having no confidence in physical appearance or my own personality and subconscious actions, I also gotta put in the work so I survive and *Bro, Healthy body healthy mind, have a cold shower bro*, *make your bed first thing to instil discipline.* 

This is my riddle. So, I can't change my physical appearance, which is objectively average if not below (despite me doing everything fashion and lookswise to change that), I can't change my personality or behaviour (which I have tried desperately hard to do, both consciously for 5+ years through exposure therapy methods and just meditation etc. to think about how to change and then acting on that throughout the day, as well as asking people), I can't change my horrible voice. 

THIS SHIT ISN'T OPINION ITS FACT AND HARD TO CHANGE. The only thing I can do is accept it. This shits objectively true, so any advice to 'own your flaws' isn't worth saying. When people give you deliberate negative reinforcement to your own normal traits and physical appearance why would I be happy with that? I know myself its not good so theres no point pretending and suppressing this shit acting as if I can change the world with my own outlook. 

yet even with the most open-minded, healthy body, and every other form of ATTEMPTED REINFORCEMENT TO MAKE MY LIFE OVERALL BETTER doesn't help me in the slightest. And with all that mentioned above on my shoulders I am meant to try and focus on the discipline of my life? I haven't got a rhyme or reason to even get up in the morning. I can't help myself, no one else wants to help me, and I got no one else to want to live for anyway. On top of that I study law at a good Uni. Why am I doing this? I'd rather be in the ground than getting up. If you want to know my resolve, the fact I still get to the gym 5 times a week and attend all my lectures/seminars can show you. Despite the fact I hate every part of myself and my life I manage to do some shit. But going to the gym isn't going to change all this shit that I burden myself with everyday. I know I'm not suitable or good enough for nar enough anyone, based on past experience with the high high majority of everyone I know. 

I drink every now and then, less than the average person, I smoke about 4 times a year, managed to keep myself on the straight and narrow for the most part even with my stupid dumbass brain trying to tell me otherwise. I do everything I can that is good for myself. That Dr Jekyll part inside of me tells me not to do anything bad. The same 'nah' in my head that tells me to not do drugs is the only thing left stopping me from taking my own life. I've got no one, and nothing, not even myself, to live for anymore. 

Any advice apart from 'seek help now'?",lonely,"Confused, alone and overwhelmed",2022-01-14 11:38:13

We were in an Air Force rescue raft bound for a sunken ship a few miles off the coast. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and dragged out to sea. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the splashing of a porpoise.. also a sickening odor like that of a dead fish. The noise got closer to the raft and it was then we heard a loud hissing sound.

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a long pole, about ten feet high, sticking straight up out of the water. On top was a bulb like structure. It appeared several more times, getting closer to the raft. The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. We panicked. All five of us put on our fins and went into the water.. 'Keep together and try for the ship!' I yelled.

After we were in the water, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. I got a closer look at the thing just before my last friend went under. The neck was about 12 feet long, brownish-green and smooth looking. The head was like that of a sea-turtle, except more elongated with teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a dorsal fin when it dove under for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were green with oval pupils.

I finally made it to the ship, the top of which protruded from the water, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I swam to shore and was found by the rescue unit. I know that thing was real because my friends are dead. My comrades were Eric Ruyle, Warren Salley, Larry Bill, and Bradford Rice. I live in Jacksonville now, but this happened when I lived in Fort Walton Beach. The encounter took place a few miles off the Pensacola coast. I spent a great deal of time at the Mental Health Resource Centre which is in Jacksonville. I also dealt with drug addiction and alcoholism due to the depression I've endured from people not believing me. I've had so many nervous breakdowns because I'm desperate for anyone to believe me that I've lost count. The Beany and Cecil cartoon finished airing in June of the year my friends were killed. I had a long lasting nervous breakdown that lasted for three months, until that godforsaken show finally met its end.

2782,pudding_obliterator,1642103974,1,"It's been eighteen winters since I was born. I will not go through another winter of cold and cold loneliness.

I have accepted myself as a loner for several years now. I thought it was the perfect lifestyle. I didn't choose to be a loner, though I accepted it nonetheless. It's not like I had a choice. Attention was absent whenever I spoke; a combination of low volume speech and stuttering wasn't exactly the most attractive; if anything, it probably was the most repulsive. Eye contact was impossible due to the enormous magnet my nose was; a big nose isn't attractive in most cases. I also want to mention that having social anxiety isn't the most helpful.

Still, being a loner was my fault. I always stood *there,* the truly neutral spot in any sort of relationship. I never had true friends. I was always afraid of getting too close, hurting myself and others in the process; I was always afraid of being too far, because if one lingers there for long, they are no longer relevant. I considered risks to be always stupid, so I played it safe as I always have. However, it is worth mentioning that a blade cannot be forged with insufficient heat. A smith would either bring hellish into his forge, or simply not bother with making it in the first place. Unlike my case, a smith would never forge his sword using a microwave.

Also, a true blade cannot be forged by an amateur regardless of the quality of the materials or the heat of the forge. That's when I decided to create Rubie.

Of course, I'm not a god. I cannot physically create *someone*. However, I could always lie down, close my eyes, and listen to nothing but nothing.

That's when she manifested in front of me.

""She."" I wondered why I'd chosen her to be female. Gender shouldn't matter, no? I merely wanted a friend, no? Perhaps I didn't just want a friend, I wanted a soulmate. What's up with the name, too? Why ""Rubie?"" Well, I don't know why; I had to pick a name. She had ruby-red hair and she smelled of lavender. Honestly, mental images don't have a scent; I don't even know what lavender smells like, I merely assumed she smelled nice.

I would talk to her *a lot*, though I would use telepathy to speak to her when there are others in the vicinity so they don't think I'm crazy (at this point, it's only fair.) One day, I was shopping and my eyes landed on a certain discount on pillows. I bought a pillow with a black-and-white checkered cover (the ruby ones were not on sale.) At night, I would pretend that Rubie is the pillow, and I would hug her so tightly. I would only have the best of dreams.

Rubie understands me. She knows and accepts all about me: my stuttering, the fact that I have social anxiety, my favorite books, my favorite videogames, my childhood crush, the betrayal of my former best friend, the fact that my heart aches whenever I see a group of friends laughing, and the fact that I'm trying my best. She knows that I am a very clever and interesting person; she always reminds me of my top grades and accomplishments and how it's everyone's loss for not being friends with me.

I wished she was real.

There was a thought I hated: What if she finally breaks free of my curse? I mean, I did create her only for my sake. What If she breaks free and materializes right in front of me; a human of flesh, bones, and free will? I would rather be always and always alone instead of receiving affection by someone who's forced into giving it. Silly me. She’s. Not. Real.

Goodbye, Rubie.",lonely,Meet Rubie,2022-01-14 06:59:34

It’s a lot more tame than other posts on this subreddit but I really just wanted to say it you know? I just feel awful, waves and waves of self doubt and worthlessness just keep hitting me, doesn’t matter if I’m at school, home, work or even out with my mates. I got bullied when I was younger and stayed quiet to avoid being a target and now I have close to no social skills with people I’m not familiar with. There’s so many things I want to do but I don’t have the confidence to do them alone and none of my friends are interested. For a moment this month I was messaging this girl from my class and I thought it was actually going well, she was liking my messages and laughing at my jokes and I actually felt happy for a bit, a lot more hopeful about myself and I already liked her. Then she suddenly just stopped adding to the conversation, she started completely ignoring me at school too, wouldn’t even look my way. I didn’t say anything off I’m sure of that so I’m guessing she just got bored of me. It really stings and I just feel so shit about it all now.

However *physically* is completely different. I crave touch, I want to hold someone and to be held. I don't know why, it doesn't really make sense given that I have 0 desire to make friends. Also for some reason I feel uncomfortable hugging my family members, I think I'm afraid of being vulnerable to them due to some stuff that happened when I was younger.

2867,MiggyQ54,1642040412,1,"Hey guys. I just wanted to try and get my feelings out there and see if anyone has felt the same because I feel like I’m the only one.

So, I’m a 20 year old guy whose love language is physical touch. That means I love cuddles and hugs and basically any sort of physical affection/touch from my partner. The thing is, I haven’t had any of that romantic physical touch from a girl/woman since I was 14 which even then was just my gf at the time laying her head on my chest for a bit. I have been constantly wanting any form of physical affection all these years but I just can’t seem to find women that want the same thing. 

My inability to get any physical touch from a woman in the past 6 almost 7 years has taken a very big emotional toll on me. I’ve been finding myself crying a lot more when I almost never cry, being less motivated to do stuff, and just all around lonely. It’s like I can physically feel the pain in my heart grow over the years because I just really want to find a woman who is looking for something serious instead of just having sex or smoking. Don’t get me wrong I want to have sex, because I’m a virgin, but it’s not the only thing I want to do. I want to build a relationship with a woman and love her as much as I can and she loves me as much as she can. It’s just women don’t really want that anymore.

For example, I recently met this girl through a mutual friend and we started hanging out as a group. As we all started talking I realized I had a LOT in common with her. She’s been feeling lonely and wanting physical affection from a man and I’ve been feeling lonely and wanting physical affection from a woman. She likes to stay home and watch movies or shows and cuddle and I love doing that as well. One of her favorite shows is Criminal Minds and that’s one of my favorites as well. We both aren’t too good at just randomly talking to people because we are worried about what they may think of us. Basically she’s me as a woman. 

So, I tried initiating things and asking if she wants to cuddle and watch Criminal Minds because I know she’s been saying she wants cuddles so badly and so have I, so I thought it would be perfect and a great way for us to get to know each other even more. However, I believe I just found out that shes trying to do something with my other roommate who wasn’t the one that introduced me to her in the first place. Mind you this other roommate, who is a virgin as well, has said that he just wants to fuck and they have almost nothing in common. Yet she’s choosing him over me as someone she wants to do something with. 

I just don’t get it. I know I’m not the best looking person in the world but you think someone would compromise a bit of looks to find someone who is very similar to you and is looking for the same things as well as looking to possibly build a really good relationship with you. I know I would absolutely compromise a girls looks if it meant that she was a really nice person and someone that I could see myself growing with and having an amazing relationship. 

I just find myself unable to get woman to see me romantically instead of seeing my kindness as a friends kindness and that really hurts my heart because I then see them go off with a guy who doesn’t give a fuck about them and is only there for their body and not to care for them and love them and I know I could provide that love and care that they have said they want but never actually act on it simply because I’m not the best looking guy.

If anyone can relate on any level to anything I just said, please tell me what you have done to change this.",lonely,Feeling really lonely,2022-01-13 13:20:12

I have zero friends from school, high school or university. They stopped talking to me as soon as they could after we left school. What about work? Yes, i had ""work friends"", none of them respond after i left the jobs. I had a job where i thought i had several friends, small company. I quit to pursue another job, a few years later i applied for a job there. Got rejected as they didnt think my personality fit in. 50% of them were my old co-workers.

What about girlfriends? First two dumped me once they realized what a piece of shit i am, no i didnt cheat. This last one however, i have never loved anyone that much in my entire life but because i'm such a piece of shit, when she was trying to tell me she loved me, i pushed her away and dumped her. I already loved her then but was too scared to show any emotions.

Few months later, we get together again, i try to be more open, but again when she tries to tell me she loves me, i do the same fucking thing. My head is fucked up. This is now 1.5 years ago, she still talks to me but i can tell she has zero trust for me but i badly want her back and i want to bash my head in for being this way. I dont want to hurt her. She's the only one in my entire life where it ever felt like someone actually loved me. And i loved and still love her. I actually sent her a letter apologizing and telling her so. She said it was nice, but i can tell she's not going to be interested in anything.

So here's my deal. I've walked around on this earth for roughly 35 years alone, noones ever really cared about me until this girl. And i killed it. Life is meaningless at this point.

I might just end it. Did i mention my parents abused me my entire childhood and neither give a shit today? No, not sexually.

2903,BluePrint1985,1642019587,1,"I don't know what to do anymore. Now that at least my country (Sweden) moves towards further lockdowns, the chance for me to find anyone to hang out with deteriorates. I just feel that I'll never have the chance to hang out with people again. It's not like I was not already lonely before.

Also, I feel so totally worthless. I have not had a girlfriend for 12 years. In that time I've been on like two dates total. I know that I am the most uninteresting, boring, stupid person there is but I don't know why I had to be dealt this card. I am also very short (for a guy), quite overweight, and not ethnically Swedish, something that is not positive when it comes to the dating scene here.

It was also 12 years ago since I had sex. I know that it's a ridiculous thing to measure anything on. But for me it has more and more become something I value myself from. It feels so stupid to do that. But during those 12 years, I was active in my student union and in the student life for more than 5 years, and even though I tried getting dates, one night stands and what not, I was always the one who went home alone.

Now, a long time after I ended my studies and my engagement in the student life, I also have realised that a lot of people really really disliked me in general. I can now see many many reasons to why that would have been and I guess that it's a big part of my loneliness now. For example, one thing that I have heard a lot of times, but maybe not really realised, is that I'm way too self absorbed and egoistic, that I'm a bad listener and that I don't care about others. I never thought of myself like that but during the past years I have come to change my view. I'm trying to work on that but I know that I'm not going to succeed.

Another thing that I did very recently, a thing that I now regret, is that I created an ""online board game group"" on Facebook and invited those who still can stand me. I realised that it was a mistake. I don't want people to feel that they have to accept just to be nice when they don't want to. I know myself how hard it is to say no to someone, especially someone who is sad or depressed, even if you really don't have the time to be with that person. Now I just feel that I've forced people into hanging with me, and I know that all these people have their own life and families and don't have place for me in their lives.

I should really just remove myself from everyone's lives so that I don't affect anyone in such a negative way that I always do. It's just that it's so hard to do and I don't know how I can make myself go through with it. I also don't know how to begin? Should I start by removing all my social media accounts? Sometimes I just wish that I had the courage to just end everything, but having had a family member who took her own life I know that it's something that I will never do.

I do have a family (father and step-mother) that I am fairly close to. Many of you here probably have it much worse than me. I do realise that in the big picture I do have so much more than many others and I don't really have any reason to feel lonely. It makes me really feel like a failure to be like this.

I'm sorry for this really long and probably not very coherent or grammatically correct rant. I just had to write a bit somewhere and I didn't know where else to post this.",lonely,Lonely and worthless,2022-01-13 07:33:07

Now, almost 30, I've cut myself from the world and spend my days self-loathing and trying not to end my life.

I'm currently living  in a city and on the rare occasion I have to go out I feel like an alien in a world of ""normal"" people.

It's more like a non-relationship because I don't even try to interact with the people I watch. I just think, ""who am I to just demand their attention as some random stranger on the internet?""

At all angles and through all lenses it seems to me that the easiest thing to do is to just be alone. But it's also not, because humans are social animals. I hate life. I want to be with people but there's also so much to dislike about people lol. There's also a lot to dislike about me too apparently, since I'm not the type of individual that fits the mold. My beliefs are skewed pretty far from what would be called ""the norm"".

The concept of relationships is so weird to me as well. They never make sense to me.

As the title states, this is a different type of lonely. I [29m] get a lot of people here post about their depression, anxiety, and I guess potentially how sad they are. I completely understand why and I can’t say I’ve never been in that situation. 

My post is more to mention that yes, I’m lonely but not in a sad way. I have many hobbies and I feel very in control of my life. I would say it’s more of taking the word “lonely” at face value. I do fine being alone but I can’t say I enjoy the company of someone else just being there. Is anyone else like this? Where maybe you just want to be in the same room as someone you love and/or care for and just enjoy that company. Doesn’t have to be sexual or crazy affectionate. Just the warm presence there with you. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy being affectionate also but as I do things on my own like eat at a restaurant by myself, go on walks, go to events, go to movie theaters, etc, I can’t help but want that other presence around. Sharing those experiences.

Anywho, just curious if others face this type of loneliness as well. Take care everyone",lonely,A different type of lonely,2022-01-12 18:29:23

My name is Ye Qian! I am 29 years old. You got a Scorpio girl here. Hawaii is where I live. I have a big stupid personality. Because I'm more comfortable with it. The age range I am looking for is 30+ men,

What do I look for in a friend you ask. Well, I will tell you below. I really want a friend who loves to text me every day. Vent and talk about life is for sure. We all go through something. We should be able to share. There's some amazing black humor. Can joke and laugh. have some of the same interests. without prejudice,

Things I like Travel, Invest, Diving, etc.

This is a new beginning for me. So please don't send me information about sex or want to get sex from me. You will be blocked. Please ignore the post if not in age group. If you don't make an effort to build your friendship with everything, or you're a ghostly person. So please don't waste my time. I'm tired of being exploited and feel like crap.

to all the people on this subreddit, there is hope, and don't be afraid to ask for help, I know I was afraid to ask but I had that push and I asked and now im going to be getting the help I need, don't let it sit there and build up like I did, it is awful, just ask for help, it may be hard at first but It will be good for you, dont wait years like I did, it is tough I know, but if you need a push dont be afraid to ask a friend or S.O. or whoever you really trust


But anyways I hope everyone is having a good day/night 😊, I hope my advice helps you or someone you care about ❤💙💜",lonely,Hey.,2022-01-12 14:55:59

I didn’t relapse on Stimulants but I slashed my wrists all the way up to my elbow and a little more behind. Idk why I fucking did this. Now I’m in pain and depressed and idk lately every day that passes by I get more and more sucked into a state of non existence almost. Nobody checks in on me. I literally have been sitting on my couch for days only going out for nicotine or Kratom and then I’ll stare at the tv or draw but not even that brings joy anymore idk what to do. I feel like I’m becoming suicidal but I’m hoping I can hold myself back from that. Luckily there’s this one wonderful girl I’m talking to but last night I dialed her drunk and might’ve spilled too much and I could tell she was uncomfortable so I told her I was sorry and I hung up and haven’t talked to her since :/ What the actual fuck am I doing? Why is my mind racing and pushing me down so much I can barely hold a conversation let alone someone to talk to. And ontop of it all my meds don’t even work anymore. I’m a fucking mess and I’m sorry if this sounds like an angry rant I’m just fed up with this. I’ve been depressed since I was 5 or so and become agoraphobic/panic disorder since 15 and my life just gets worse. If anyone can dm me that would be appreciated!

3008,Thorfin_n,1641946711,1,"As the title says. My case may be unique since my general flaws make me undesirable to another level. I was born with a genetic condition that made my teeth brittle ever since I was a child. As a result, I had to get all my teeth extracted at 19 and start wearing removable dentures. By the time I was done with tech school add got my first decent paying job, I was able to afford mini implants but not actual full dental implants (I was quoted 60k) which means I still have to remove my teeth at night even though I can live without my teeth flying out my mouth now and can eat whatever I want.

Not only that, I'm generally short (5'9"") and have generally unattractive facial features despite not being fat. On top of that, I went to tech school and did not pursue a bachelor's degree and education is extremely important and touted as pivotal by all women. I actually have a decent paying job and live alone but at the same time, I only went to tech school. As you can imagine, these issues are some sort of lethal amalgamation that makes my dating pool non existent.

Just to be clear, I don't harbor any hatred or disdain towards women as it's only natural they would not want anything to do with me, romantically. As a result, however, I simply don't see the point of putting an effort into life or going on an endless self improvment journey if I'll always be alone.

It's a beautiful autumn afternoon. The sun is shining, the leaves are a cascade of the usual fall colors, and there's that slight chill in the air that serves as a gentle reminder that winter is indeed coming. You're laying on the couch, having enjoyed a lazy day off from life's many obligations, but now you can't help but count the seconds on the clock as they tick away. It's agonizing and you know it, but still you can't help yourself as your anticipation builds. The time you're waiting for is getting closer… and closer… 

Then you hear the sound of a key in the front door and your ears prick up. The door is pushed open and your heart leaps just as your body does. The love of your life has finally returned after a day that was beginning to feel like it would never end. You crash into each other and both squeeze so hard, you wouldn't be surprised if you pop like one of those stress relief dummies. The hug has probably gone on long enough, but you refuse to let go partially afraid that they might disappear if you aren't holding them. You fight back tears of joy because even though you never thought it was possible, you just know they feel the same way about you.

Finally you pull back just enough in order to kiss them softly, conveying more thoughts and feelings and sheer love for them than words ever could. After a few seconds you let up, unable to fight it any longer. A single rogue tear finally escapes and rolls free down your face. Your heart soars as you see your partner smile, struggling to hold back tears of their own. They were just as enthusiastic to see you. Another tear threatens to escape your confines. ""Don't cry baby, you're gonna make me cry too,'' they say, wiping the tears that had escaped your defenses away. You hold hands and look lovingly into each other's eyes, baring your souls for one another. The two of you weren't normally this sappy, but it seemed to just be one of those days, and damn it, you were glad it was. 

""I couldn't wait for you to get home,"" you tell them, pulling them down to the couch. The two of you shift into your natural cuddling position as you have so many times before. You both sigh and lay there in silence for a while. Eventually, time would demand you get up and do things, but you knew if you had the option, you could lay there with your soul mate for eternity, and be in a state of bliss the entire time. 

""I'm so lucky to have you,"" you say softly, breaching the comfort of silence. ""If I had to do it all over, I'd gladly go through all the heartache again. Because it led me to you; and there's no one else I'd rather give my heart to in the whole wide world,"" they say lovingly. ""I love you,"" you say. ""I love you too,"" they respond. You both adjust and lightly kiss each other again. 

""I am getting hungry however, so how about we make something?"" They suggest. ""That sounds great,"" you reply, entirely on board with the idea. Regardless if you were good at it or not, making something together was a great way to spend time with each other, and that's the only thing you wanted to do after your time apart. ""What should we make, Chicken?"" They ask. ""Not feeling that, Pasta?"" You counter. ""We just had that last night. Oh, I know! How about we be naughty and have cookies for dinner,"" they say, eyebrows raised. You chuckle and boop them on the nose. Just another example of why you love them with all your heart. ""Alright, it's a plan, but I get to use the cookie cutter this time,"" you say as you both get up. ""Nah, first one there gets that honor loser!"" They say, laughing as they sprint into the kitchen. 

You smile and think back to all the days and nights where the loneliness seemed to be too much. You had some dark thoughts those days. Sometimes the darkest one of all. You never thought in a million years you'd find someone who would actually love you as you did them. You were glad you persevered even when you didn't know why you kept going. You thought back to what they had said earlier as you followed them into the kitchen. If you had to do it all again, you gladly would. Because it led you to them, and there was no one you'd rather share your heart with in the whole wide world.

---

Even though it doesn't seem like it will ever happen, it is possible. I'm in the same boat as you. Just keep going and keep trying new things, even if you don't know why you're still fighting. You never know when your life will change for the better.",lonely,A Beautiful Autumn Afternoon,2022-01-12 10:39:31

3022,LightDisappears,1641939630,1,"There is one constant in my life that is as sure as the advancements of time or the expansion of the univerise: Not being missed. I can be the most supportive person who always listens to everyone and tries to spread positivity and compassion like a beacon on whatever ground I walk on, attempt to enrich and improve people's lives, inspire them, cherish them and yet I can be sure that when I'm gone, nobody will bat an eye.

All these posts you can read in /r/relationships or /r/UnsentLetters of people being missed, you can be sure that person will not be me with absolute certainty. Some say life is like a train, and it feels like I'm only ever intended to be a temporary acquittance. It's not like I abaondon people and execpt them to miss me, no that would be very manipulative and desperate. People usually abandon me ""I need a break"" ""I need to focus on myself"" ""I need less online time"" ""I think we should talk less"" ""I'm gonna remove you"" and that's when it all crumbles like it always does. Things are never meant to turn out well for me ultimatively.

And yet there is this spark of hope, that fuel and fire in my heart that yearns to love and be loved back. But it is not to be, time and time again my time will come where I will be dropped, and never be looked at back. I will be fortunate enough to be asked for favours after months but that is it, I am only used for the bare minimum from that point onward.

I am unworthy of love. I do not deserve it. I had the highest hopes and it was my absolute dream to be in a romantic relationship, my biggest wish and desire. I am passionate about loving someone in and out, with all their values and flaws. But it is never meant to be, either destiny summons a global crisis or I just don't have it whatever that is. Do I even exist? Why am I not like the others? Why can't I be missed? Why can't I be valued? What am I missing that makes me not worth to reach out to besides favours?

I'm tired. I've already noticed how I don't love the way I used to. Everytime I'm getting my hopes up all to have them get crushed again, a part of me dies. This accumulation of decades of being cheated on, played with, deluded, being betrayed, not being good enough, being lied to has disillusioned me greatly. I can't do this anymore, it hurts too much please. I just want to rest and find my peace.

But I can't, every time I see you the memories come back and beat me down to my knees again. I pretend I'm fine but I'm really not, I've never have been. I can't find my peace, so I'm lonely. I can't even watch or do anything else, the severity of loneliness weighs down on my soul, leaving me as a soulless human corpse. I exist, I'm alive, my body is working as far as that's concenered. But my soul is dead, there is nothing to look forward to, nothing to be excited for, no one to care for, no one to love, no one to reach out to. Just an endless abyss into a darkness.",lonely,Nothing shouts worthlessness like not being missed,2022-01-12 09:20:30

She gave me so many chances because she was extremely sweet, and kind, and somehow I still managed to mess things up with her. 

It's all my fault. I just want to tell her that I'm sorry, and ask her from the bottom of my heart to forgive me. I was trying to push a relationship with this girl who kept telling me that she only wanted to be friends. It was stupid, I know. I just misunderstood her being nice and friendly as flirting and being interested. I misunderstood what she meant by being friends, as dumb as it sounds. I thought she meant she wanted a relationship, but, just wanted to wait until we transitioned into that stage, or put a label on it. 

I made myself come off as a total creep. I misunderstood her friendly nature as mixed signals and flirting. I think she was interested in me, but wanted to take things slower. But, I was stupid, and kept trying to escalate into relationship, because I just craved that intimacy of being something more. I was a total, complete, idiot. She kept telling me to take things slow, but I kept rushing things and trying to push for relationship. No, I never pushed for sex, it wasn't sex I wanted. I just wanted to lock her down, so to speak, exclusive, so she wasn't talking with other guys. So please don't make it about sex. I never wanted that, I never mentioned that. I just wanted exclusivity faster than she did, if she wanted it at all, ever. Lol.

TL;DR: I misunderstood this girl as being interested in me, she was physically my type, extremely pretty, so I fell extremely hard for her. My heart is bleeding, and I can't heal. She ghosted me on all social media btw, if that wasn't obvious yet, lol. It hurts so much to know what it feels like to get so much attention from a girl, just to have all of that attention turn into radio silence.

3114,Sparkie_Dime,1641892856,1,"See TLDR at end.

So basically, I've got to the point now that I expect people to just leave or not to bother with me. If I try to start a new relationship and on the very rare occasion get noticed at all, in the back of my head I'm just wondering how long it will be until they leave me, ghost me, or grow distant. People will of course say don't be pessimistic, but I'm not. I just accept it as a fact and try to stay ceaselessly hopeful regardless, but I've not once been proven wrong. They all promised and said basically the same things, to the point that I'm starting to wonder if I keep meeting the same few people repeatedly.

But everytime a friend or ex left, I cared less and less. It still affected me of course, but I just feel completely numb and think to myself, ""Time for the next incredibly slow process of finding new people to fill the void."" I've got less picky too, but not desperate, so it's not a matter of standards either. It's more of a feeling that no one will ever keep their word unless saying goodbye. That all the good feelings are fake and merely temporary. It doesn't matter what I say or what I do, if anything at all, the end results are always the same. It doesn't matter how many people from different countries or backgrounds I meet, it doesn't matter what age, or gender they are, they all end up the same. This may get me hate for saying that, but at best, I can only seem to find the sane few groups of people. I don't intentionally categories people into groups, but to miss the patterns you'd have to be completely blind. I'm not claiming to be special or anything, but I simply don't fit. I take time to get to know people, but that makes no difference either. I knew several friends since I was 3 and 4 and they basically abandoned me the same as people I met, say, a week ago.

I ask them if it's me and they never answer. The common response is they are busy. Forevermore it seems, I try to reconnect. They react excitedly most of the time then the day after I'm ignored again. I've done this multiple times with the same people. It's like how it used to be for that 1 moment and then it's gone again, and won't come back for a long time. Then randomly I'll say hi months or even years later and they'll do the exact same thing again. I asked them what they are doing and will say nothing or they are free and bored, but then talk for a bit, and then take 10 mins between replies, then 30 mins, then just vanish for months again. I even have brought this up before to some. The reactions are usually ""Oh sorry mate, I didn't realise"" for most guys, then they do it again. For women it's normally ""I was busy"" i point out they said they weren't and what were they up to and they take an hour to reply with ""idk"" or similar. This started with friends and then relationships. But at least old friends will still rarely reply unlike the 40+ ghoster ex's from over the last decade or so.


TLDR:
Because of my experiences, of which I left out a hell of a lot, I've become completely numb to people leaving or becoming distant. I don't feel nothing at all, but i expect and accept it as a fact of life. It's not a matter of optimism or pessimism. It's been the same before and after I've focused on myself, it's been the same with people around the world of all types. Yet still I'm incredibly lonely. It's weird, because I often used to enjoy my own company.


In conclusion it truly feels like I am stuck in limbo.
Even by the words definition: ""An uncertain situation that you cannot control and in which there is no progress or improvement.""
I'm stuck in this cycle that shrinks each time. I could compare my relationships like the 50,000 year cycles of the Reapers in Mass Effect. By my count, that means I've wasted the equivalent of 2 million years and gotten no where.
Call it cringe, call me a loser, even if not to me directly. It just is what it is. Has anyone else felt the same? Or am I totally alone in this situation? I know literally nothing will change by sharing this or even get any replies, as it'spretty long. But I just wanted to vent, get a break from feeling the dread and despair that I might not even exist.
If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my rambles, I rarely say anything at all these days.",lonely,Is it weird to become so numb?,2022-01-11 20:20:56

it sucks because i met her at my lowest and she helped me through eveything especially when most of my friends left me.  and now i cant do anything to help her because she deleted it permanently. i asked few times about her decision to make sure she's not making impulsive decision. and it hurts me that we become stranger again.

Sorry to bother you all by talking about my feelings and all that jazz, I really hate to do it, but I just need to get my thoughts into words because it's really eating me up and I want to know that I've at least tried something - even if that is just venting to strangers on the internet.

So I don't really know how to do this, I'm just going to write as it comes to me, but my mental state has recently reached a point where it is actually starting to genuinely worry me; it has admittedly been quite poor for several years now, but over the past six months or so it has legitimately got to the point where I am almost constantly thinking about killing myself. 

I haven't had an especially bad life, not compared to some people, but I'm just so crushingly lonely and its fucking with me. I have tried joining clubs, I have tried talking to people at work, but they just brush me off. It also doesn't help that the idea of talking to people actively terrifies me, like I have tried joining discord servers and the like but I just freeze up and panic - I actually cannot bring myself to get involved and talk to people, and then I quickly leave them only to immediately hate myself for doing so. The one person in my life who I talk to is my older brother, and he's amazing, I love him to bits. But I also feel like I can't talk to him; I am bisexual and he is deeply homophobic. I just feel like if I can't even be open about this basic element of myself, I somehow still feel alone even when we chat, which hurts.

Every day I just wake up and lie in bed, but then I start to think and I have to distract myself or I just break down. I also spent Christmas and New Year's alone for the first time ever this year, which certainly hasn't helped. I tried talking to my family but they didn't respond. I just feel apathetic towards everything I do as well, I can't focus at work and I can't focus on my university studies because I just can't work up the motivation to actually do much, which then eats away at me; that I should have done better and that I should have tried harder, which is like a self perpetuating spiral all on its own. 

I know that they say suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems but these are problems which have existed and have been getting worse for what is now a quarter of my life, so they feel pretty goddamn permanent. I don't want to kill myself, but I almost feel like it is inevitable if that makes sense? Like at some point it will just get to a point where I am too caught up in emotion and just end it on a whim. I just want to stop feeling like this.

I'm really sorry to have just gone on about it, and I'm especially sorry if this was the wrong sub entirely for all this, but I needed to just put my thought to paper, so to speak.",lonely,I'm tired,2022-01-11 17:12:06

If it’s a human who has hurt me, I must physically mourn their death and distance myself for as long as I need, even if it’s forever, in order to find peace with the past version of me that needed to die. 

I’m currently going through that shift with one of the people I love in my life. They opened a door we closed a while back and left it open without intention. It’s sad, really, because I thought they were ready to evolve to a new state of consciousness with me. Alas, I deserve the kind of love I’m willing to offer, and they deserve all the space they need to exist in the reality they are creating for themselves. 

For that, I leave my goodbye note to that person here, with all of you. I haven’t physically mourned them yet, but it’s coming. If there is someone you need to mourn as well for the sake of your sanity, know that I’m there with you spiritually. This is a chapter of growth. This is the chapter in which you find yourself. 

Feeling lonely is okay because there are so many adventures to be had! I know this. I know that when I start to love myself, I go to places alone. I connect more deeply with strangers. I welcome new chapters.

I hope this is useful to those who feel like me. 💚",lonely,"When I want to kill myself, I know it’s because a new chapter in my life must come.",2022-01-11 14:54:20

So anyways if you’re still reading….

Not to get too personal but I seemed to have always had issues forming relationships and even just talking I guess.
I was the kind of “undiagnosed anxiety but perceived as mature” kid

But yea, at this point I feel like no one pays attention to me anymore. That sounds really bad and self absorbed but I guess I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t grown to prefer it that way.
It’s not often people have tried to get me to open up or to be more active, but when anyone has I feel like I get kind of panicky and really embarrassed, I don’t like it.

And this has lead me to believe,
maybe I’m meant to be alone
I mean I don’t know, I don’t really want that to be the truth but maybe it is

I feel guilty for this. It feels like I'm exploiting someone for my personal wants, and I feel that I need to find that peace within myself.

3179,WalkingCondomAd,1641869665,1,"I just wanted to give out an open invitation to anybody who needs company.   


Just a brief introduction of myself:  
I'm an awkward guy from Denmark with a messed-up sleeping schedule(it's currently 3:54 AM and woke up around 8 PM, lol). I consider myself a gaming god(exaggerated a bit), with a track record in World of Warcraft and Hearthstone. I've also played a lot of other games, but those have been my go-to for years. I'm not playing much lately though, but I've been trying out a bit of FF14. I also follow the League of Legends scene, but I'm honestly too fragile emotionally for the toxicity, so I don't really dare to play it anymore myself, haha.   


Besides gaming, I'm really into anime. My favorite animes are probably Parasyte, Your Lie In April, Clannad, 3-gatsu no lion, but I've watched and liked a ton of other shows, it's just hard to select a few and rank them all.   

I'm also really into music and playing guitar. I'm primarily into metal and all its subgenres (really into metalcore and prog(Killswitch Engage, Erra, Periphery, Shrezzers, Intervals, etc.)), but I also enjoy some EDM like Porter Robinson and pop tunes(I'm really into 'Lukas Graham - Happy For You (feat. Hanin Dhiya' at the moment, such a beautiful song). I'm really not too narrowminded when it comes to music. If it does something to me, I don't really care what genre it is. Anyway, that's about it for my brief introduction. If we share interests or you find me intriguing, feel free to hit me up! if not, no offense taken, haha.

And I cant afford to get help, maybe that sounds like a excuse, but im still living with my mom, cause of online college and such which is all being paid for through aid and loans I could never pay for that, but its like I need alot of help and im afraid to ask for any, cause I dont want to upset people, and the person I like told me I probably have a chemical imbalance and that I need to see a doctor, but the thing is, I havent seen a doctor in 2 years, the last time I saw one was for the same reason im sitting here now, except at that time I was feeling suicidal, over someone I really liked at the time but then she mentally abused me over the course of us dating, maybe that also has something to do with how im feeling also, idk, sometimes I wish I could just shut off all my stuff like my phone, my iPad, xbox, etc and just disappear, I mean I have friends, and I have the one girl I really like, and my mom, but sometimes I dont want to tell them how I feel in fear of annoying them, even though I know that they care, 

I also wish I could shut off the parts of my brain that make me feel this way, cause it really sucks, I used to be the happy guy, everyone in high school liked me, I feel at least, but even then at that time I was in a abusive relationship, so that was dragging me down, I cried a few times in front of random people and I would tell them im fine, but really I wasn't, I was sad, and I was being manipulated into liking this girl cause she would bribe me with things like food or she would take me out somewhere cause she ""felt bad"" about making me upset, but she would do it again and again, and me being the scared one, I didnt drop it, cause I was afraid to, but then eventually she dropped me, and I guess it worked out in the end, even though I have some sort of trauma from it, and to add to all the BS she did to me, she then 6 months later told a girl I was talking to for a potential relationship, that I hit her when me and her were dating, I would never hurt anyone and the fact that she was throwing that around and her friend was adding to it, really messed me up, so I basically stopped talking with that person cause I couldn't deal with the stress, and to add to the thing about her saying I ""hit"" her she was supposedly sending pics around woth make up on to make it look like I hit her, we haven't spoke to each other in 6 months at the time, but even then too she didn't like it when anyone would try to touch her, no hugging, no kissing, nothing at all, the only times I ever ""laid a hand"" on her was when she wanted me to hug her during those rare times, after I heard all of that crap, I filed a police report on her, cause im not gonna let this person ruin my life,

3231,Dakotasunsets,1641843095,1,"I don't have friends for very long in my life. 

They keep disappearing on me. 

I know how to be a friend. I know what loyalty is. What listening is. Being there for people in need at when they are at their lowest. 

I am the person that people ""tell"" things to...

I think it's those last 2 sentences,  really, that get people. 

For some reason,  after people vent to me and I help pick them back up and their lives start to turn around again,  it's like they feel embarrassed that I know their dark times...or perhaps they associate me with their bad times? 

Idk? 

Whatever it is, I know that I don't fit in well with cliques...I don't tolerate them, and that could also be the problem? I don't conform well and have never tolerated the ""mean girl"" spirit? 

I guess I am having problems because the 2nd person in the last 6 months has gotten married and I found out through Facebook. It's so, so sad.  

I found out, through a former coworker that another person I used to think of as a good friend was fired (she cut me out of her life when I quit, I told her I thought she was going to get fired and to protect herself and try to get ahead of it...we were in a very toxic work environment...but she just thought I was lying. I thought she, too would reach out to me later, but she didn't. She blames me for getting fired, I guess.). 

I just feel so sad, heartbroken, and lonely. 

I do have a few friends. They are good ones. I guess I just thought I would have more? Idk. 

Thanks for reading my disjointed thoughts. 

Keep fighting the good fight. 

Wishing you all peace.",lonely,My friends keep disappearing,2022-01-11 06:31:35

No matter how hard I try, I only seem to attract people who would pretend to be my friend cz they needed something from me or abandon me when they see that they can't get anything from me. I never really had a true friend who cared about me in any real way and there's a significant chance that I will never find anybody like that. I have always overextended myself to my ""friends"" when they needed emotional support and even financial support at times even though I was in need of it myself. And all I ever received in return was abandonment, deceit and lies about how they value our friendship even though they leave within months.

Idk why I have given myself a decade of lifespan from now. I will never find anybody who cares about me. Hell, people put there don't care about the people in this sub, I'm no exception. There is no version of future where I find people who genuinely care about me just like all the other people in the world that pass away without anybody caring.

I’ll sit and try to enjoy myself otherwise like video games, painting, getting out and walking, driving and taking photos but none of it is fulfilling.

25 F
CPTSD, mixed bipolar, ADHD (relevant as to how I deal with my problems.)
Lonely AF (duh.)

Ever since I was in middle school, I would hyperfixate on certain characters of a book, movie, show (anime mostly), or video game (my main medium), and become utterly obsessed with them.
I would even print out tons of pictures and clip them out and stuff them into the fronts and backs on my school binders so I could admire them while I went to class.
I started having folders on my PC dedicated to certain shows and games that contain fan art and some official art if there was any. 

In college I was diagnosed with ADHD, which makes sense as to me being fully invested in some things, and then the next week dropping it for something completely new.
Eventually I got a CPTSD and mixed bipolar diagnosis, which you know, is so fun!
Makes relationships (friends and dating) even harder when you’re so all over the place and essentially unreliable and give everyone mental whiplash.

So I’ve always dipped away into a fantasy world, with my characters. I’d read fan fictions of “reader x (insert character here)”, I’d make up my own scenarios in my head, sometimes I’d draw them myself. I’d imagine what life would be like with them around.

I’ve dabbled in many fandoms.
In middle school it was Naruto and Hellsing (Alucard is…amazing)
High school was Attack on Titan (Levi was my muse)
And after was Undertale (Sans helped me through physical and emotional abuse.)
I even bought a jacket back then that was like Sans’ and would wear it as if he had let me borrow it for comfort.

I also have a lot of fictional lovers from League of legends, and I love Glaz from R6, and right now I’m hyper focused on William Afton from FNAF (I have no idea why, but he’s living rent free in my head. I especially love the graphic novel and Noisx’s fanart of him.)

I’m incredibly depressed and unsatisfied with my life, and I know that has a part to play in it for sure. But I’m so crestfallen that these characters will never be real.
I’ll never meet anyone that looks like them, or acts like them. 

I’ve been trying to get over my agoraphobia and work on eventually meeting new friends via bumble, but I hate it. 
I hate that I can’t even pretend to be interested in talking to any of these people.
Like random NPC’s that have no side quests for you. What’s the point in talking to them? I try to play League with them at first, hoping to get to know them, maybe they’ll be interesting!
No.
They’re not. 
Because they’re not them. They’re not Alucard, they’re not William Afton, they’re not Glaz, they’re not Heisenberg (RE8, not Breaking Bad), they’re not Levi, or Sephiroth, or Illidan.
It makes me so angry with myself.
How fucking pathetic that me, a 25 year old who has no issue hooking in guys, refuses relationships because they aren’t a fictional character.

I simultaneously want to break something and cry at how much of an issue this is for me.
I don’t know if anyone can relate, but if you can, you’re not alone. If you can’t, take some solace in knowing that at least you’re not as deluded as I am.

I’ve recently come across the attachment style test and the result was that I’m the fearful-avoidant type, which is the least common type. I also learned that these attachment styles are almost impossible to change since they’re developed at the age of 1-3(?), I believe. I saw the characteristics and every one of them define me. I feel uncomfortable when someones too distant, yet too close to me. I’m most satisfied when I’m in an ambiguous type of relationship, not too close and not too far.

I have become distant with all my friends because I have always felt like they’re not close to me but they acted like they were, which I’ve come to think of it, they were pretty close to me. I think I just wanted to deny that, I really don’t know. 

I’ve spent the past few years questioning my sanity everyday. I thought I was wise and being enlightened. But the truth was, I’m just as insane as my mother.

You know how some people are just NOT meant for something? Well, this is my one and only answer and solution. I’m just not meant for life. Living does not suit me.

I never intended for this to happen, y'know. I never wanted to move on -- and even when 'I did,' here I am... Still thinking of you. Still hoping one day you'll return and fall back in love. Wishful thinking, I know. When we knew each other, I don't think I was mature enough to understand what we had. I wasn't ready for that kind of responsibility, being with a girl that was... Well... You. You were **everything** to me. My best friend, my love... There are no words in the English language that can properly encapsulate the amount of passionate, intense love I had for you. We spent every waking minute 'together,' despite living states apart. I didn't mind. To me it was like you were always right beside me...



I never cried when you left. I wish I did. I wish I still had tears to cry. Nowadays people come in and leave my life like passing ships, gone in a season and never to be heard from again. You were my safe harbor where I could find sanctuary from the storm that is this wretched life. I had no idea what lonely, cold world I was being cast into after we stopped talking. You were safety. You were peace. It didn't matter what problems I had in the world, no matter how petty they were at the time. I could talk to you and everything would be okay. I could take on the fuckin world with nothing but bare knuckles and with you as the wind beneath my wings... I'd do it. I'd win with a big, toothless smile knowing I had you in my corner. I'd be toothless because, well, there are **A LOT** of people stronger than I am in this world. 


But with you, I was Samson... And all my problems were but ants at my feet. Thank you for giving me such a wonderful reprieve from the stresses of life. Thank you for making me feel like I meant something to someone.

3363,Kundohlence,1641777660,1,"I have never felt feelings so intense before I met this girl. When she laughs I could feel electricity shoot through my entire body. When she would stand close to me I could feel my heart racing and burning within me. The way she smiles from ear to ear when she laughs. That hearty and genuine laugh. Those soul piercing, beautiful, blueish green eyes. Those perfectly straight teeth. 

The way she moves her body when she giggles. I could actually feel butterflies with this girl. Is that weird for a guy to have butterflies over a girl? Lol. I just felt such a strong connection to her, so intense. When she texted me and lit up my phone my heart literally did backflips inside my chest and my stomach would feel hot. I really liked her quite intensely. She has been in every single one of my thoughts since I met her. 

I can not get her out of my mind. It does not matter how much I try. I am constantly replaying interactions we've had, conversations we've had, analyzing and overthinking them over and over again in my head. What if? What could have been? I can not escape the what ifs or what could have beens.

She is an () co-worker that I fell for. She would initiate conversation with me from time to time. She has lots of guy friends; so I was worried and intimidated because I really liked this girl. I was basically scared of all the male attention she was getting, so I told her I had feelings her and wanted more than friends. I was hoping this would ease my fears of her guy friends and male attention. She said we didn't know each other that well, and basically gave me the cold shoulder. Which is understandable, it was too soon. I was just scared to lose her, and wanted to stick out amongst her guy friends. 

I am living in so much regret right now. The regret is unbearable. I am just burdened by thoughts of suicide. I brought this pain on myself, and lost what I wanted the most. Which was her. I just want the pain to go away. I don't know how much more of this regret and replaying these scenarios I can take. I really thought she was highly interested in me, so I opened up my heart nice and wide, and got hurt, and hurt bad. 

I left my heart completely and entirely unguarded and vulnerable to this girl, hoping that would make her like me, and it failed. I quite literally just want to die, honestly. I don't believe in love anymore. I will never experience it, if it does exist. I hate my body. I hate myself. I hate my childhood upbringing. I have terrible anxiety which makes it nearly impossible to make new friends. I guess you could say this girl was my only ever emotional support. She's blocked me on all social media now, because I was a total beta male, desperate, creep, weirdo. Instead of the confident alpha that makes her laugh, doesn't get intimidated by guy friends or male attention, and takes things slow and gradual, getting to know her as a person more. I will never experience love. I just want to take my mind completely off girls, love, and relationships, period. But it's hardwired in my fucking DNA to want intimacy with a beautiful girl. Ehh.

3364,redthrowawayaway,1641776782,1,"I’ve been lonely for a while. But lately in the past month or so, especially the last couple of weeks, it has been hitting me hard. And I know the holidays/this time of year can be hard for a lot of people and they struggle with the same feelings of loneliness that I’m feeling now, but for me personally I’m really struggling. I don’t have many people that I can talk to, which is why I’m posting on here, yes under a throwaway account. I had a conversation recently with someone in my life about loneliness and it just didn’t have the outcome that I wanted it to have. I just wanted someone to be more empathetic to how I was feeling, to just listen. I didn’t go looking for advice or for them to change things, I just wanted comfort. And I didn’t get it. Not really. I mean I did feel better after we talked briefly but then other issues popped up and now they’re upset with me. And I get the reason they are upset, I honestly do, but I’m tired of being kicked when I’m already down. I know this is lacking context but I am just trying to vent. 

This just seems to happen a lot. I mean when I’ve had a bad day, they’ve had a worse one or they have more of a reason to be upset than I do. It is not only this person that does this, a few of my family members do as well when I finally open up to them because I am definitely more of a closed book. But that is from years of opening up and being told that people have it worse or that I’m upset over something that shouldn’t matter as much. The one person that would listen to my troubles without doing this isn’t in my life anymore. She passed away. And I miss her everyday. So much. 

It’s worth noting that I don’t have any friends near me that I can just take off and spend time with, everyone lives far away. I have a couple of people I talk to daily through text, scattered throughout the day but that’s getting where it is not enough anymore. It doesn’t help with the loneliness and they have their own lives to worry about and I just feel pathetic. 

The loneliness is crushing and I just want someone to help relieve the pressure.

I need someone to fixate on to be happy, yet I get horribly depressed as well. Honestly having someone by my side who I know likes me is just the thing I love. I have hobbies but I just don’t do them because they don’t bring me joy. I always find myself looking for someone after a break up after I swear I’ll be single for a while. Welp that never works out.

3381,ExistingSubstance509,1641771374,1,"So, there's a girl I like in my class and she's the first one I'm really comfortable with.

I've known her for almost 1.5 years now but, because of Covid, and because of my personality, I got to actually know her only in the past few months. Earlier, she was often the one to initiate conversation and, even though I like her, I still think I ""owe"" her something.

**I believe a strong friendship is the base to a genuine and durable relationship**, however, I've just learned from one of her friends that she likes another guy outside our class. Of course I respect her choices, but I know I will still have to spend a lot of time with her. We see each other almost every day, if not more. I don't really know what to do.

I don't know what to do because it seems impossible to like someone else as much as I like her; **big part of my mood used to depend on how well our friendship was going, and now I feel so hollow.**

Also, the fact that I didn't know about this until someone else told me has been disheartening, as I realized that I know very little about relationships. In fact, I don't think I have many friends left, other than her.

She probably doesn't know her friend told me; although I've seen some signs, I don't know if she likes me too. Actually, I don't even know if someone can like more people at the same time.

What am I supposed to do? 

* Should I let go everything and pretty much start developing a new mindset that distinguishes friendship from relationship, well knowing I will have to spend a lot of time with her, while also struggling to pass all my classes? 
* Should I do nothing and hope things get better? 
* Should I go all-in and ask her out more often?

To be honest i am not even sure jf i Will end up posting this post,if you are Reading It Means that i choose to do so :)
So i was Reading a post that asked what was the point of  writing your thoughts on the internet like on this subreddit,I think the point Is that you can use this as a diary,but instead of being private Is public,you write your thoughts and you have an external feedback of people that actually understand you because they are in the same situation,and sometimes that ""same here""  or ""feel you"" can be what makes the difference. Don't get me wrong Is pointless to Just complain everyday of how everything Is bad expecting some changes in your life without you actually ever try to change something;but what i see here Is a lot of different posts that pretty much all tell the same things and i can relate to a lot of them and this somehow gives me Hope.In the end we are all humans and we all go through the same highs and lows in Life and sometimes when you are on your lows It might seem like you are the only One in the world because maybe at that specific time in your life you have no one to talk to and/or It May seem like everyone else's Life Is Great except yours,well spoiler,it's not,think about celebrities,singers,actors whose Life look perfect and Amazing and then One day they Say they have depression or worse they kill themselfs.
The strongest weapon we have as humans Is communication, if you think Is pointless because no One Is going to reach for you,well you might be right,but if you don't try,you'll never know.

Now today, I wanted to just play games have a lazy no mind day right?

Till I realized, after all the time i've spent with the relationship and work... I don't really have anyone to play with or anything really. It all hit me like a train, that I have no one in my life. Not a friend, not even a friend to log on to my pc and be like lets go play, - no one. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I am someone who growing up always had friends, best friends, and so on. Especially online, like I use to run guilds on wow, clans on runescape, competitive teams on csgo...even for a short time, till drama ruined it, a fortnite discord with nearly 50 people who were all active and friends of mine. Fast forward now, I don't really play any of those games, I been on warzone and csgo mostly, and warzone has been crap lately and with no one to play with - even worse. csgo is just over played for me atleast, played with randoms all day and the days been dull.

Because of the internet, I’ve been exposed to all kinds of people from the darkest to the brightest. Some who’ve led me out of the darkness and into the light, and some who’ve pulled me back in.

Because of the internet, my views on the world have changed. This is a place where your true personality shows and you get to have a little peak at how most people think.

Because of the internet, I’ve met people that I’d never have without it but here those same people are in a revolving door where you’re either Ghosted or you eventually just stop talking.

Because of the internet, I understand that it has brought us as people tougher just to separate us even further. 

So many people complaining about things that they could change but won’t and so many people upset at each other based on beliefs that were set in stone long before you and I existed. 

Because of the internet, I lost myself and fell into a deep depression. So many people are just here looking for something they can’t find in real life. 

The internet is a place where women have too many options and men have too much time. Love and lust are drugs you should try in real life. The experience that comes with them shape you into better people. 

This place, is very difficult from our world. Where it doesn’t matter who you are, you are accepted somewhere for a little while.

It’s a place where at any moment in time you can hit “New Game” and just like that you’re an entirely different person with new goals and a chance to correct past mistakes. 

Because of the internet, I’ll be deleting my social medias and do some living for once in my life.

3418,Geblaka,1641757997,1,"So I have something to share with everyone who is lonely and would like to meet new people and make new friends and just wish for to be a part of a tribe or a group. 

The thing is, when I lived in my home country I had those wishes because I was lonely AF. I remember the pain of feeling excluded, forgotten etc. And then I decided to move to another country for a gap year. I ended up in a collective with people around me all the time. I would go here and there and meet lots of new people and make a lot of new ""friends"". However, something struck me when I realized that all those interactions were in fact draining me. Why? Because I was constantly trying to be someone else and holding a facade. And you wanna know why? It's because I have a bad relationship with myself.

That hole you're feeling when you're lonely and forgotten comes from the fact that you don't really love yourself and search for that in others. But the thing is, that nobody can fulfill that hole. Nobody. We form connections when we're willing to take off our mask and show people who we really are. And when you accept yourself, people will accept you, and the connections will form naturally. 

TL;DR

If you feel lonely and wish for company, be in a good relationship with yourself first, or else those ""connections"" will be fake and draining, and will just be a waste of time.",lonely,My experiences as a lone wolf among people,2022-01-10 06:53:17

3476,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1641720302,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 26th!  ( Just one left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. I'm currently working on 4 papers for finals week. It would be great to find some good company.

3520,BrokenArrow117,1641700059,1,"As a preface, this maybe a controversial post because I had an affair. I don’t want the discussion to be about how terrible of a person I am. I already know. 

I was married for five years and was surrounded by friends with deep connections. My marriage was failing the last two years. I am going to identify the pitfalls I was unaware I could fall into but I am not making any excuses for my actions. The blame is my own. 

My ex wife had no interest in me in any way. Not physically, emotionally, nor about anything I had a passion for. I wanted to be a part of the things she had passion for but would all have an excuse why I couldn’t be a part of it. I felt unwanted. It is a very lonely feeling to be with someone that doesn’t want to be with you. 

I didn’t know just how unwanted I felt until someone else showed interest in me. She was just a friend at first and it was a slow burn. I never intended it to become the affair it became. I remember it starting to cross the line from friends to more than friends and told her we should stop talking to eachother. That only lasted a month. I was intoxicated by that feeling being understood, of being myself and someone liking me for me. It was more than just that. I was in love with the woman she was. I admired so much about her. 

From there it went into the territory of an emotional affair for 3 months and then I asked my wife for a divorce. Immediately after the separation the affair became physical. This went on for a couple of months and as much as this conflicts me to say it, they were the best moments of my entire life. But the guilt of having an affair was building and it broke me. 

I ended that relationship out of guilt and confessed everything to my ex wife. I asked to work it out and for marriage counseling and she wanted the divorce. What followed was the darkest two years of my life. Right after I went through the divorce, I started a new career and moved 700 miles away. I was trying to run away from my guilt, my shame and myself. I lost all of my close friends because of the affair and rightfully so. Actions have consequences. I lost my support network. I moved away from my family. I was all alone in everything. 

I feel deep into depression and told myself I deserve nothing good in life. I couldn’t sleep because of the pain of regret. Selfishly, I went through one relationship after the other despite knowing I wasn’t in an emotionally stable place. I needed to know I could still be loved. That I was worthy of it. Almost all of those relationships ended in tears because I had an intensity that I wanted out of it early in the relationships. Over-committing too early. (Those that are in the dating world, this should be a red flag). Then I would leave the relationship because it wasn’t actually what I was looking for. I wanted what I had with my affair partner. Someone who knew me at an incredible level. Someone who loved me for me. I found a new reason to hate myself. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. There is just a massive void I was selfishly trying to fill in the wrong was. 

I knew I needed therapy when my thoughts started going dark. I would have these suicidal fantasies about my sacrificing my life to save a stranger. That way it would give my life meaning, stop the my pain, and lessen the pain of my family members that care about me. 

6 months of therapy brought me out of that hole and repaired my sense of self. It has been 3 years to the day since the affair started and I finally stopped hating myself. But the pain of this loneliness will not go away. 

The fucked part about all of this is I never stopped loving the woman of with I had an affair. I broke her heart when I left out of guilt and she moved on and is in a happy relationship. I never moved on. I had to delete her number from my phone to rid the temptations of reaching out and telling her I’m still in love with her. I don’t dare do an action that is akin to cheating. I want no part of that. It destroyed me. I feel like I’m frozen in time. Unable to move forward. Unable to move backwards and the only close relationship I have, is my loneliness.",lonely,Trading everything for pain of regret.,2022-01-09 14:47:39

I just don’t enjoy socializing at all. I don’t really like small talk and I don’t like sitting around chatting with a group of people. Maybe because I have nothing in common with most of them. 

It’s sad, I know I am lonely and I don’t wAnt to be, but the things people do when socializing just don’t interest me. I don’t like board games or talking about the weather, or drinking, or sports. 

I realize now I’m lonely not for lack of having social groups but for lack of being able to enjoy them. Or perhaps I just don’t know anyone else with the same interests.

Is it to seek advice? 

Is it to seek help? 

You make a post explaining how lonely you are, how no one likes you, how hard you have it etc. And what do you get? Couple of upvotes, couple of comments giving you mediocre useless advice, couple of “same here” comments etc. And basically nothing changes, your life continues to remain the same way as it was before you made the post. Or at least this is maybe just my experience who knows…. 

I’ve come to such subreddits time and time again posting the same exact stories over and over again, got the same types of comments, a few upvotes and in the end nothing changed. It’s a vicious cycle.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s totally fine to vent out your frustrations or to try to find your way out of loneliness. I just feel sorry for all you folks here including myself, the fact that people even post here is sad in itself. I hope things get better for me and everybody else here… just wanted to share my thoughts about this as a whole that’s all.",lonely,What’s the point…,2022-01-09 10:23:56
3564,sarahstm,1641684129,1,"I finally could step over my shadow and this is what happened

I immigrated to Turkey when i was 14 , I’m 20 now but i have social anxiety and being in another country trying to talk in their language is hardest thing ever. 
Basically I didn’t have any friends in high school because i was bullied all the time and everyone was so racist to me .
Now as I started college i want to improve myself and step out of my comfort zone and actually make some friends.
Last week i was sitting in cafe and i saw some group of my classmates sitting and they were laughing together I thought to myself I really wanna be friends with them why should I always be alone 
And i went there and I started talking with them about school and classes and they couldn’t speak English really well so they said me they really need me to be their friends because they will move to the US and they can’t speak English 
And I promised them i will teach them 
So they made a WhatsApp group that we can practice english they told me that they are really happy that they meet me and everything they said that they will be always there for me 
And it was the first time in my life that I didn’t feel lonely 
They told me that we should hang out 
I was so exited about it like it was too good to be true , everyone else used to make fun of me and being racist to me

After our final exam was over they started to get abit cold like as i asked them how are they doing they didn’t even answer I thought they are busy 
I texted one of the girls in the group and she said I’m sorry i was out that’s why I couldn’t answer 
And then she posted a picture on Instagram as they were all together having fun without me 
I feel lonelier than ever :(",lonely,I have social anxiety and i have 0 friends,2022-01-09 10:22:09

Being a shy and introverted individual paired with a growing presence of depression and anxiety made it tough to meet new people and develop the necessary social skills in high school. I was able to meet a couple people who accepted me for who I was and eventually developed some very meaningful friendships. 

After I graduated, life took me in a different direction and those friendships grew distant. My friends move away to other states/countries and I lost touch with most of them. Now I’m here two years later at 20 years old with nobody I can talk to or spend time with. No one I can joke around and laugh with. I try to be content with it and focus on myself but loneliness tends to get the better of me. I don’t know how to meet new people. I worry that it won’t be possible again. I reside in my head, swimming in circles with my thoughts day after day. I feel trapped in this cycle that I desperately want to break. This feeling makes me doubt my own self worth.

Whenever I go to bed, I feel like I'm falling into some abyss just waiting to hit the bottom. And I often randomly get light headed too. 

Loneliness could be the issue. But I'm never sure as to why I feel so lonely. I can't make irl friends, it seems like the most difficult, most daunting thing ever! And I don't even know the reason. I'm not the most introverted introvert, and my personality is (although nothing to marvel at) fine.

Sometimes I just feel like giving in to the suicidal thoughts. But at the same time, I feel like my life has just started (I'm just 14 years of age lol). I'm not sure if everybody that's my age has this kind of shit happening to them, but at the same time, I don't even want to know. 

What if this is normal? What if everyone goes through this? That means I'll have to deal with it and won't have a reason for giving up. 
What if it isn't? Then I'll feel guilty for what I've done to myself and I'll get even more unsure of my situations.

I do my best to keep up with best practices and learn about how to properly manage burner accounts and ""disappear"". I'm not doing any illegal and frankly don't have anything to hide other than PII but I just don't like the idea of people I don't know taking a peek into my incredibly boring and mundane life. I also harbor a deep resentment of most people and just generally and genuinely distrust people as a whole. 

That aside I take many steps to ensure my privacy but in doing so I am starting to realize that I have a hard time making and maintaining  meaningful relationships. Not only romantic but also any sort of resemblance of friendships as well. I stay away from mainstream social media and when I do post online I use burner accounts. I do maintain a job but I also don't interact that much and really stay with the ""speak when spoken to"" mentality."" 

I just have no idea how to start making friends or even start a conversation. I'm nearing 30 years old and feel like I've isolated myself to the point of no return.

I say friends, but in real life I don't have many. I have people who I talk to, I have people who I force a smile with, but the entire time I feel awkward and don't connect with them. I'm left out for a lot of group activities they do, not out of malice, but just because we're not that close. I get it and I don't fault them. But I'm sad because those are the closest friends I have. They're the only people I've managed to meet with even the slightest bit of connection. I always knew once I graduated highschool I'd probably never talk to them again save for our group chat. Out of the group the one I was closest with moved away, he was sort of like the middle man. Helped me feel connected to the group more. Now that he's gone what little connection I had is also gone. 

I made friends on discord last year, it was so awesome. I've felt closer to them then I did anyone else in my entire like (as in friends, obviously I'll always be connected to family!)... But then one of my friends got banned. They were kinda a weirdo and immature. I understand why they were banned. The energy of the server started to change after they were banned. But I enjoyed the change, I still made new friends. Now drama has happened, and it's left the server dead. All the people who kept the server alive are leaving because someone left before them ""Since X left the server I'm bored now so I'm leaving bye."" I became server owner, and I've been working hard to keep the server alive, but all for nothing. I truly worked hard and poured so many hours into making this the most welcoming and friendly community I could. I'm losing friends, and it's okay. I'm not angry at them, not trying to hold them hostage, but this was the first time I had made friends that felt real, even if it was a screen. Even when I tried to make online friends in the past, it didn't work out. 

I'm not one of those social media/internet addicts, I barely use social media as is. I'm fine with one day leaving the server if I need to. But then it'll just be the same way things always were. No friends in real life either. I try hard to make friends, but like I'm autistic. I can't talk to people, can't strike up a conversation. I have weird interests nobody my age likes, and I even feel like an alien in the autism community.

3663,Opening-Duck-996,1641643428,1,"basically as if it wasn't bad enough that I was suffering from several mental issues slowly killing me my mom has decided to make it her own personal duty to eliminate me as if the constant mental abuse and torture that i've been suffering from for 2 years now wasn't enough already.

Basically my mom's only good at one thing and it is to panic and start stressing out. No matter how little the situation she'll do that frightened face and start talking in that blood curling voice of extreme panic and make a small issue into something a LOT LOT WORSE.

yesterday I went out with her for a day out because I needed to get some things and here's what happened. 1 She basically stressed me out even before we got out of the house with her incessant whining. 2 over the course of the errand she was constantly talking about irrelevant things causing me to get severely distracted and hindering all my abilities, 3 She just kept asking me things or bringing up things I really don't want to hear basically she wanted to maximise the pressure applied on me. now she already made what could've been a fine day a stressfull nightmare but here's the cherry on the cake.

while we were in the metro I was completely exhausted from her and zoned out completely and paid no attention whatsoever as to where we were because I was trying to recollect my thoughts and just get a breather. When we reached the destination She knew we had reached the destinatiion but she was acting so uncertain and just caused a huge panic which basically caught me in a spin. Thanks to her I also got confused as shit and this ended in me getting slammed between the train doors. Thankfully the thing had a failsafe which basically saved me from extreme body harm but no thanks to her.

Now as if that wasn't  bad enough she's just asking ""are you okay?"" and unlike anyone with a slight respect for someone remaining silent she just kept pestering me all along the way about this and made this whole day a fucking nightmare.

Cherry on the cake though since that event all she's been thinking about is

""What would I have done

""I'm stressed from what happened

""what if something happened to you I would have died

""It made work harder

""i'm tired from work

&amp;#x200B;

ME ME ME ME URGHHHh!!!

After all this shit all she's been talking about is her and herself only today she nearly made me fall from a narrow stool because she was screaming and yelling about a bee because FUcK YEAH The bee is wayyyyy more dangerous than me falling from this height.

She started Whining and bla bla and I LITerALLY said everything I had to and it didn't even faze her she was just like yeah you suck and you're a bad kid because this this this, She just kept bringing up the past about how in her life AHHHHHHHH.

Fuck this shit.

Now it don't stop here. She mentioned about how in a previous incident where I yelled a slur at my N dad he IMMIDIATELY took opportunity of this to try and get my mother to do paperwork and get money on his name. 

because FUCK YEAH Your Kid is showing signs of deppresion and displaying a ton of red flags and just basically gave you a big sign that he needs help and the first thing you think of is let's fuck up his chance to get money.

I have nowhere and no one to run to  and i'm suffering.

I'm Jo, from California; I’m a dad to a totally cute chonker cat named Junior. 

My time is usually divided between work, errands, and being home. I’m a bit of an ambivert, so while I do enjoy going out from time to time, I also very much cherish nights in (I can throw a mean shindig).

The purpose of this post is really just to find people to chat with. It’s a new year (i know some people like to bash on the idea of setting goals/aspirations just because its a new year), and I want to make some friends, maybe even something more.

However, I have little to no expectations here. Most Reddit conversations in the past have never really lasted more than a few days, or I run into total kooks. 

Here are some of my interests and other random factoids:

- tv shows &amp; movies (all kinds &amp; genres; actually just saw Alien vs. Predator tonight)
- listening to music &amp; curating playlists; I also very much enjoy singing/karaoke (not great at it, but singing is fun). I use both Spotify &amp; Apple Music. 
- playing video games on PC; I play all sorts of things but rn it's a rotation of: CoD Vanguard, Rocket League, Bloons TD6, Rage 2, Valorant, and Prince of Persia.
- streaming on Twitch (super small time but it's fun!)
- creating art; i dabble in sketching, painting, screen printing, and clay sculpting.

3712,malanono_,1641612341,1,"Finding people like me online is easy, especially since I can speak english and all (I'm french), it opens doors to new online friendships. But I wish I could find someone like me ***in real life***...

I've had many friends, and currently have just one, but barely any of them were really like me. I think the last time I had friends who really had things in common with me was like ten years ago. It's a bit depressing honestly.

I love my current friend but aside from our introversion and some surface-level stuff, we barely have anything in common. I had a (toxic) best friend a few years ago but even with her we didn't have much in common at all to the point that even our sense of humor was completely different.

Because of depression and other reasons I've been very isolated for the past few years, I haven't met/talked anyone new in real life since 2017, and even then it was a one-time conversation and we never saw each other again. I like being on my own most of the time so it's not too much of a problem most days, especially since I live with my family and have a good relationship with my parents - I'm not completely alone. But still, I wish I could talk to someone my age who really understands me and my hobbies and my taste in music (I love listening to music, it's practically my therapy lol).

Out of boredom earlier today, I looked up people I used to know in high school on Twitter, friends/acquaintances, even the ""mean girls"" because why not. Their sense of humor is so different, and the stuff they talk about, their music taste, their hobbies etc. it's all very mainstream. Nothing wrong with that at all, I like some mainstream stuff too but for the main part, what I like is - for a french person - kinda considered obscure or niche I guess. 

I don't like french music and couldn't care less about any french celebrity, influencer etc. as I'm more invested in american/british media. I like it that way but sometimes I realize that because I'm so detached from any french media (and have been since I was a preteen), it makes me also very ""detached"" from other people in real life especially those my age (early 20s). It doesn't help that I don't like alcohol... and that I'm LGBT. And I don't want to change myself, I just want to find someone with similar interests... maybe they're also hiding in their house like me and so we'll never meet. Lol.

It just gets so lonely, sometimes I daydream about leaving to a whole different place, but then again I think I'd still feel lonely and detached, just in a different way. Wish I could go out and at least try to meet new people in real life but because of Covid I can't (+ other complicated/boring reasons that I'm working on).

I'm just tired of it. I so wish I had a group of friends like I did in middle school, I was so happy then having them around. I felt like I belonged somewhere even if I was getting bullied at school, at least I had my friends. I keep hoping that someday I'll be able to have friends again, like friends who make me laugh back (I make others laugh easily but I haven't found someone who can legit make me laugh, it sucks), friends I can relate to and feel completely comfortable around... I know I'm capable of making friends, but then I have to not only wait until I can go out and meet people, but I also have to find someone who's genuine and shares some of the same interests I do. I feel like my chances to find someone like that are so slim and it makes me feel down.

I try to focus on my current goals, but still sometimes I just stop and feel the loneliness. I wish I had someone to tell about my successes, my failures, my deepest thoughts, someone I could share memes with, play cards with, watch TV with, cuddle with. I don't know, *something* that's more than just small talk, with someone I can actually relate to. Being alone is only fun for so long, you know?

3725,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1641608773,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 26th!  ( Just one left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. I'm currently working on 4 papers for finals week. It would be great to find some good company.

He was constantly lying to me about everything. he always told me what i wanted to hear and gave me just the right amount of attention to string me along. he was so vulnerable around me that i thought he could never lie to me. recently i found out that almost the entire time he was stringing me along, he had a girlfriend. one he saw regularly. one he could be affectionate with. when i connected all of the dots i blocked him on everything. i’m not a confrontational person, so i haven’t had the guts to tell her. i want to really bad but i get filled with so much anxiety that i start to shake and cry.

I just want to know, after everything we’ve been through, after how much time we shared, after the things we told each other in confidence…why would he lie to me like that? i’ve never had anything close to a boyfriend. i went all my life without boys having crushes on me. i’ve never kissed anyone before. he was the closest thing i had to a relationship. what did i do to deserve being manipulated like that? how did he even know i was naïve or gullible enough to be lead on like that? what made me stand out? why did he think that i was the perfect victim? what did i do wrong that she did right? why did she get to be with him? why did i have to be “the other woman”? i have so many questions but i don’t have the courage to ask him for answers. all i wanted was to be a girl that a boy wanted to be with. why did he do that to me?",lonely,why did he do that to me?,2022-01-08 13:12:27

3741,BiancaPerezXOXO,1641602504,1,"
 So lets start off by giving a summary of who I am.

\- I am 27 and graduated last month with my masters in chemistry

\- I have many interests, but my main hobby is gaming (video games, card game and looking to get into tabletop rpg games). Currently playing Destiny 2 a lot but open to suggestions (I may have the game and just don't know lol) and MTG commander is my go to for cards at the moment.

\- I am a kid at heart and still enjoys things like cartoons, animated movies and anime (although I haven't watch any new anime in a bit).

\- I am open to all genre of music although I find that rap and country are my least favorite and that 80-90 rock, alternative and metal are usually my go to's.

\- I am a hyper-sexual, demi-sexual who's love languages are quality time and physical touch.

\- I prefer open and honest communication in all aspects of a relationship rather than playing ""mind games"". I also do not party, drink alcohol or do drugs and will not participate in said activities (I have actually had people respond to my posts trying to convince me that everyone does these and that I can't find a partner if I don't).

\- Since this has come up a few times, I do eventually want to have biological children with my partner.

So with that covered, why am I here? I am looking to find a life partner. I always find that my ideal partner is also one of my closest friends, so starting as friends and seeing where it goes makes the most sense. So, if you are interested in getting to know each other and/or playing video games together then send me a message.",lonely,Who else is always feeling alone,2022-01-08 11:41:44

3752,Throwaway_6117,1641598492,1,"(Don't mind the grammar mistakes, my english isn't perfect) 

I just need to speak a bit. About 4 months ago, I joined high school, and of course with it came the stress of getting to a new place and having to meet new people. It was even harder since I really liked my old class, and none of them were in the same class as me. Now the thing is that, the new people in my class, they get along very well, and I, of course, don't (r/lonely what did you expect). I don't know why, but since summer holidays, I can't socialize, at all. Everytime everybody gathers up for doing something, I'm either not interested or just scared of something, yet probably nothing. It feels so wrong in this class, I feel like I'm the odd one out, and if it continues for 3 years, I might just drop off.

I'm on Holiday right now, and I just got home from a little party with the people of the older class, and just like I feared, I can't keep a conversation with them anymore. I knew I was an introvert, a big one for sure, but I can't even speak with the people I like? The only person I really talked to is my best friend (only friend) which was in the same class as me for the past 5 years, and he's about the same as me, expect that he never really liked the old class except for a few of them (not hating them, just being neutral). So I basically just sat on the stairs and looked at my phone while everybody was having fun.

I know that at my age, a lot will say it's a phase or something like that, but everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY I've known or know isn't as flawed as I am in socializing (except maybe for my friend).

TL;DR Got in a new class, can't speak to anybody, even to the people I like, and my one and only friend is as sad as me except he doesn't hide it. 

Does anybody know why can't I speak to people I like anymore? What can I do to fix it? Also, even if it may be useless to ask, any ideas of where I could potentially meet new people?",lonely,Just need to speak a bit,2022-01-08 10:34:52

3754,Warframe_Immortal,1641597772,1,"... How lonely I feel.

I'm 30 years old man.

I look decent, I don't drink and I don't smoke.

I drive a taxi as a ""job"" even though I have other businesses so I'm well off financially.

The thing is I truly cannot experience love. I'm afraid to show emotions towards women, because every time I did that in the past with a girl I really liked... I was turned down.

The only girls that like me are the ones that I don't like back.

I look decent, I lost weight and all, I dress nice, I do all the ""improve yourself"" stuff,  but the results are absolutely the same as before.

Some girls in the taxi say I'm attractive, but I never push forward because I know in the times we live in I will probably get hurt. 

I feel so lonely at times that I think about ending it (even though I probably would never have the courage to do it). 

I'm afraid to be myself, because I have lots of flaws, I'm afraid to show them to other people. I always wear a mask, always wanting to be perceived as strong and so on. 

Deep down I hurt though... and I don't know what's the point anymore. Loneliness is killing me at times.

I did a lot in my life, I ""improved"" as much as I can at this point.

I don't know if I'm looking for advice, probably not. I just wanted to vent it, and to write it down.",lonely,I just want to share...,2022-01-08 10:22:52

3768,MarchAgainstOrange,1641594065,1,"So we were in this semi-work situation for a  few months, we had great conversations, teasing, playfulness, we told each other a lot of very painful events of our lives, our fears, hopes and dreams. Her body language was very open towards me always. I escalated a bit as in I didn't completely fail to make it a bit flirty.

Wednesday was my last day in this ""job"" and I decided to ask her out. She rejected me, said she didn't have the time for a relationship, even though I know it to be BS. She was just too polite to tell me I'm too ugly for her I think. So I half expected it, I didn't come with any expectations other than maybe to get a bit more experience with opening up and developing the necessary trust in humanity to do so again for the future. I told her it was fine, that I thought there was a spark and that I was just wrong about it. Nothing crazy, this happens a few million times on this planet each day.

I would need to distance myself a bit to kill the unwanted feelings, but would really like to salvage the friendship after that. We agreed, she hugged me and told me I'm a great guy that will make a lucky gal really happy some day blah blah blah jaddah jaddah jaddah.

So now a few days later I shot her a message, explaining myself a bit better, that I suffer from a few mental health issues and that she was my inspiration to try and conquer them again and try trusting people again. I also apologized, not for what I said but because I felt like I was ambushing her a bit. Also that her friendship meant really a lot to me, and that she wasn't judgmental about me and my issues.

So, I notice she is online on the app but seems to be ignoring the 2 messages I sent to her directly completely, hasn't even opened them yet. I also saw she checked one of my status messages. So she must be consciously ignoring me.

Ok a few things about me. I am 35, no relationship since I was 21 (does that go into forever alone territory again?)

Burned myself out badly trying to improve from my dead end job at age 27 because I always felt inadequate thanks to my parents. Been struggling with several lovely mental health ailments since, such as burnout into chronical depression, anxiety, emotional detachment and avoidant personality disorder...

I have surface level friends and know how to talk to people. But basically I can't let anyone in truly due to fear of being found inadequate if I do. This was supposed to be different. I wasn't expecting a relationship but for once I hoped to see my trust rewarded, at least gaining a true, understanding, friend. In 14 years I truly opened myself up once, and all my fears regarding other people were confirmed in the process. If you open up you are screwed, thanks to you, Tam, it's now completely ingrained into my soul.

I honestly don't think I can recover, as in ever open myself up again, relegating me to a life of complete and utter ALONE. We are such a vile species, and I am so tired.",lonely,"Openend up to my crush, yay ghosting",2022-01-08 09:21:05

I want to be a better person, but it's too hard right now. I fail, I ruminate, I hurt, I try again only to repeat the process. I want someone that can hold accountability with me.  


Unconventional - I don't want to meet you. I don't want to see you. I don't want to date you or marry you. To be transparent, I would like for this to be strictly online and something that we can also let go after a year. I want to be partners for a fixed amount of time. I want it this way because this isn't the end, for either of us. This is a chance at a new beginning.

Codependent - I'm clingy. I'm beyond clingy. I try to attach myself to anyone who shows me any sort of affection or ""love"". I'm going to do this to you and I will attach myself and become overly dependent on you to validate my feelings. I want someone who can handle this emotionally. It's hard, incredibly hard to do this. It's hard to be understanding and accepting, but I've met a handful that are able to do this.  


The reason why I want to do it this way is because I want mindfulness and the present to matter more than anything else. I want to be able to support each other. Not tied down by our past, not tied down by a ""bright"" future. I want there to be no judgement, no pressure, no expectations. Patience and acceptance are the key values that we hold.

The last time i celebrated birthday with my friends was back in 2013. Ever since then I've been alone during my birthday. Yes, It's been 8 years without birthday party. After 2014 (which was last year of my school) I started losing contact with most of my friends. I still  got birthday text messages for another 1-2 years, But that was the end. 
I couldn't make any new friends at college. Mainly because I got bullied by few of my classmates during the last year of my school bc of which I developed social anxiety. So i was too scared to connect with new people. bc of which i ended up being alone (Had only about 4-5 friends, Tho we use  to go to college together and all..But we never went for hangout. they were just class buddies)
for 5 years at my college. 


Lol, Now I barely get any text messages from my friends on my birthdays or new years or any other festivals. it's just my family members and my cousins who wish me on my birthday. And my siblings and relatives always ask me 
""what are your plans for your birthday?"" 
I HATE THIS QUESTION ALOT. BECAUSE I'VE GOT NO ANSWER. it makes me feel embarassed that I've zero friends to hangout with.

Everything has been super annoying, but I’m feeling great bc I’m on here sharing it with y’all. And I’m eating cinnamon rolls while the rest of my family that I hate talking to sleeps all around my house and outside my door bc we’re all sick (so far negative Covid tests so that’s nice I guess). I want to move out, but I don’t make that kinda money. I wanna drop out, but there’s so much pressure and expectations on me to do decent (not great bc I’ve lowered everyone’s expectations of me lmao). And it sucks even more bc my family doesn’t even acknowledge adhd and my mom fronts like she supports me and my dad is homophobic so I’m not even really out (since I’m 💅). Like, I don’t have friends bc I’m just incapable of making deep connections bc I’m neurodivergent, and the people I’m surrounded by are draining. When they’re annoyed by my adhd, I can’t tell them that it’s my adhd bc then they’re gonna tell me to try harder so I just take whatever they’re saying. I’m only gay when I like gay memes online bc it’s not like I can be gay in my house when my dad works from home. My social life is just me constantly trying to build it back up to when I was forced to be around people in high school, but it just won’t stay together lmao. There’s just nothing going for me, and I need my family to understand that so I can take a break from my brain shitting on me all the time and get it figured out bc I keep falling and then I get to a point where I think I might be happy for like a few weeks and then I fall again. And I’m at that point where I’m falling again. Oh well. Hopefully, I’ll get more weed to smoke to make me feel better faster.

r/lonely 😂🤦‍♂️ well anyway I kinda just came here to vent. Look; I can’t sit here and say that I’m depressed and lonely and give you all a rundown on how bad my life is. Because I live a life that is so far beyond average. I really love everything I do and I would definitely consider myself moderately successful. Maybe a little below “moderately”, but either way. My life is pretty damn awesome. 

The depressed part.. I’m just not so sure of. Every day I go back and forth with myself if I am depressed or not, and honestly.. Overall I really don’t think I am. But I sure as shit get these terrible feelings. If I am depressed, I subconsciously know what the problem is but simply cannot fix it. Not because I don’t know how to.. which I don’t, but because if i tried to fix it.. I’m not sure if I would have the (moderately) successful abnormal life that I live right now 

Lonely. That I am. Can’t deny that. It’s so easily hidden in plain sight, and I guarantee anyone that I know would never know or even think I am or ever was. 
I don’t know if there’s many people like me out there, but I am so far beyond loyal. Mainly with family but also with friends. And when you have a best friend; That’s family. 

I’ve had disloyal friends, and they’re gone. but when your best friends are disloyal that’s a different animal I believe my “friends” are the reason for either my loneliness or depressed feelings. Or both. But again. If I distance myself from them, I think I’ll be even more lonely and depressed.  

I’ve never wanted a relationship until these feelings came along. Well.. not never, but I just always eventually cut things off between me and whoever I’m with at the time. But that’s because I seriously never wanted a relationship with the person I was with at the time. That’s because I know that whoever I get in a relationship with, I am sticking with them. That’s that loyalty. Anyway.  The last person I cut things off with I actually ended up regretting that and still regret that. It was probably about 2 years ago more or less. I tried to express my feelings about a year ago but those feelings didn’t get reciprocated. That hurt. But it was most definitely my fault. 

Anyway. All in all. I really don’t have anybody to talk to. And can’t seem to find anybody who is genuine. And when it comes to girls Sometimes It’s almost like I’ve forgotten how to socialize. It’s funny. I give and share so much love. Why does it feel disingenuous to ask for some in return?",lonely,Venting here. Take it or leave it,2022-01-07 19:11:27

My college is on the smaller side but the grind culture is kinda crazy (think a typical Ivy League rejects school). I’m not on bad terms with my roommate exactly but I can also physically feel every time he brings people over how conversations don’t really include me, and sometimes when I do interject and make a comment about the topic at hand I can kinda feel with every awkward conversation that people on my floor think I’m strange. I really did put in an effort, especially the first month, this was the chance to start over that I’d waited for my entire life. But with each failed conversation with the people who visited my roommate and others on our floor I started avoiding campus/my dorm more and more and staying at home and then driving to school (even though the commute kinda sucks). I grew tired of feeling like the odd one out that I just decided to give my roommate the dorm. For finals it was completely my roommates, I commuted to classes and stopped by later on to pick up some of my stuff and I was gone. I’m somewhat outgoing I guess, I don’t shut up if you get me talking, but what I say seems to have no weight or meaning.

I could write about this forever but i will try not to. We were only close for about 2 years but we hung out every day and she made me looks at the world with a new perspective, made me feel rlly excited about life. The funniest and coolest person i have ever met and i still cant think of one bad thing abt her. I miss her so much i cry about it all the time. I wish we were frjends again so bad, it feels like im living in a nightmare.

She kind of slowly stopped talking to me and being weird, saying she was busy all the time. and then when i finally really asked her about it she said it was bc i had eating problems and it was too hard to be around (she struggled w eating disorders as well). I do believe that was partof it but ahe was like my beat friend and jt fekt like she tried to ghost me. i fel like she wouldnt do that if i was just aick. also abt a year after that at her sisters birthday party, who im atill friends with, she said ahe wanted to be best friends again and i think she was drunk and i got so excited and when i reached out to make plans ahe was jusy busy again and didnt try to sctually meet up w me. like it just feels like she doesnt even llike me anymore ans a person anymore and it hurts so bad becausee ive always looked up to her and admired her as a person, i always will. its hard to like myself when someone i look up to so much doesnt like me, you know? 

Anyways ive been wanting to text her and just be like hey you can be really mean about think but like why did u never want to be friends again or like what rlly happened? obviously i would make it more eloquent i just dont know if this is rude to do. i loretally cant move on. i got so insecure of myself as a person and frjnd after and i havent made many close frinds since. i used to be really cinfident in my personality. this has honestly made me question mysekf so much and hate myself. pleas e let me know and thanks to anyone who reaponds",lonely,my ex best friend stopped talking to me 3 years ago and i cant move on can someone pls help:(,2022-01-07 17:12:44

Join a club, doesn't matter if you don't like chess/hockey/cooking, etc... you're not there for the hobby. Or don't join a club, you can go up to strangers and just become friends.

all 3 of them have said so much hurtful stuff me, and i often want to just stop talking to them, i think i hate them. but i cant stop talking to them, because then i will be completely alone.
at the start of 2021, i was so excited. i was determined to hang out more with one of my friends, and use her to meet other people. and then the summer came. i spent time with my friend, but, i never really got to meet other people. of course, she offered me if i wanted to hang out with some other people, but my mum is very strict, so i always had to end up saying no, because im not allowed to go out that late.
the highlight of my summer was going to a local festival with that friend, because we accidentally met a bunch of her friends. that was really the only time of the summer, where i felt like i might have a chance of having friends. guess what? i've never seen any of those people again.
on november 27, she asked me if i wanted to hang out with her, another girl i know and then a girl, whos name i had only heard.
omg. thats was literally the best day of 2021.
i was literally crying from happiness when walking home.
on ig i follow a lot of people from my city, im obsessive. i have stalked all of them, i purposefully walk past the places in the city, where they might be. i did it a lot in the summer. i was walking through the skatepark like 10 times a day at one point. 
and i see al those people posting about how they spend their time, and they all have friends and friend groups, and im just so jealous.

Advertise ourselves like Age and gender(22M,24F), Stating our so called needs, and waiting for any single person to DM, or getting overwhelmed with so many Dm's.

I don't even really want to put it on a writing group for some reason. I wrote the final action scene of my book and it was just a really emotional moment for me. It's only the first draft so I'll end up doing plenty of rewrites, but I don't even care. It was like the culmination of a decade of work all summed up in one sentence and I almost started crying because it's been a real struggle. All I have to do now is tie up the ending, then I can edit all three books in one go.

I know there are people in my life who would probably enjoy the news, but it never feels like they actually care unless it's making a profit of some kind. I don't know, maybe it doesn't matter.",lonely,Big milestone,2022-01-07 02:40:00

I know this won’t apply to everyone in this sub but i’m hoping it rings a bell with some of you. I am someone who has never really had any type of close relationship. I have never had a really close friend or a partner of any kind. Usually I am fine and used to it by now but sometimes I look back on my life and I really regret not doing things differently. For example I will never have the opportunity to have a high school girlfriend where we both are inexperienced and discover how a relationship works. Or I will never get to experience dorm life and make friends with the people who live on my floor.

Last year I cut off two of my best friends because of how they didn't have any care for my feelings and didn't understand boundaries plus some other stuff. This was a huge step for me as one of them has been my best friend for 9 years. Now I don't really have anyone I can talk to comfortably. I miss times where I could hang out with my ex best friend in silence. Or just really talk about anything.

It's so hard for me to make new friends because I think that people find me annoying or boring... which I'm aware is not normal at all. I'm planning to see a therapist about this. I can't help but be awkward at work and I really hate how I can't make conversation anymore.

4019,BRS46799,1641469211,1,"Howdy, umm this might be the wrong place to ask, but I need a vent, and maybe someone’s got some sorta nice words. I used to be okay with being “alone” But as a guy who’s been single my whole life, honestly what’s it like being in a relationship? I’ve always had my little fairy tale of someone who can be there for me, and I can do the same for, just to be happier in one another’s presence, to have an intimate connection deeper than just a friend or another aquatinance or coworker or something. What’s it like to have someone wants to spend all their time all cuddled up and stuff, or actually going out on cute dates? What’s it like having a best friend who’s mutually romantically interested? What’s it’s like to know someone’s so exited to see you, and genuinely cares for you? Someone who’s trust it 100% undeniable and someone who confides in me just the same? I hate that it makes me second guess almost every choice I’ve made. I’ve been out on dates and stuff so its not a lack of trying, and I’ve grown more confident with my outside image the past few years. I know I’ve got my fair share of baggage, but who doesn’t. I know a little of what I want in a partner, even with little to no experience, so I don’t understand. I ought to be good at this kinda thing by now, love and sex and the whole nine yards. Surprise I’ve got my v card too, always waiting on that special someone to come along, who just hasn’t yet. And that’s fine, thats not the part I’m too worried about, I know that will come in due time when she does, I’m worried about hugs and kisses and the cute wholesome bs that I’ve been missing out on. No affectionate intimate feelings recieved from another human like ever? It makes me feel like there’s kinda something wrong with me too, all these people I know are just out hooking up and stuff, and I can’t even get any love 🙃 it’s disgusted me quite frankly too how sex driven the world really is bleh. Don’t get me wrong I was a teenage horndog who definitely had my fantasies too but damn. Tbh I want a lil lady I can give some of my attention to, who will snuggle up and comfort me as I want to her, just an extra backbone an extra motivation in someone to feel safe in and to keep things going good, I just want someone to sleep with, again though not the sex, someone who will literally fall asleep on my arm making it go numb, someone who hogs the blankets, and snores a little lol, waking up to the most adorable bedhead, no matter how funky. So i guess really is it worth all what I’ve been putting myself through? My biggest goals in life are to have a home and a family of my own and it’s become so difficult to even know where begin my life’s such a wreck and even if I did find the right one I’m nowhere near financially ready to take the next step towards anything, or even to have a gf rn if I’m honest. It’s been affecting all aspects of my life recently, my family relationships, work, my friends, my sleep, and my spirit itself. the unbearable wight of loneliness is just keeping me so fn stuck.

But the thing about family is, if they’re a good family they probably already care about you.

I’m talking about people who used to be complete strangers, but grew to be best friends, perhaps lovers, soulmates if I may go this far. I just don’t know if I as a person am good enough to have a stranger grow closer to me, to be the first person they think of, to have them perhaps like me, maybe even love me, all around just genuinely want to be around me and spend time with me, and care about me first.

As childish as it sounds, I just want to be special to someone, their favorite, their whole world, instead of basically just being an extra in their life.

I honestly don’t blame anyone for me not being able to have that; after all I’m really not an interesting, unique person and I don’t think I’m too fun to be around. I just wish someone would get me to believe differently about myself; I wanna someone to grow to love and care about me, to feel like I’m family to them… perhaps then I could feel like I’m actually worth something, worth another person’s investment.",lonely,Am I good enough to have someone truly care about me?,2022-01-06 20:08:58

     My mom hit me up a couple months ago and offered for me to move in with her after all these years to take some college class or something to “advance my life” and I really didn’t want to but my grandma convinced me that this is my chance to save and try to level up so I did it. Bad choice for a lot a reasons.
     I didn’t want to take college classes but that was a stipulation for me stay there so I bit the bullet. Taking these classes is the easiest part even though they add nothing to my life. I moved to another state and I’ve never had such a hard time building relationships, I have nothing to do and nowhere to be. I get in my car and drive around the city, get food, watch movies in a parking garage because if i stayed home all the time I’d look like I had no life. I talk to myself enough question my sanity. 
     Living with my parents is the most isolating feeling ever it’s like I can never be alone even if I’m in my room, the privacy doesn’t compare to my own apartment. I sneak around the house so I don’t have to awkwardly bump into them and say “how you doing “  and walk off. But yet still feel so by myself
     I used to be the life of the party now being here I feel like a shell of my former self and it’s like even my communication has deteriorated. I became so adjusted to this isolation that social anxiety takes over my body in public.

'' get a girl '' , '' get friends '' , '' socialize '' ... Ok... but how ? I have had some friends as youngster... even I recently got in touch with one , but I did ghost him... I had to ghost him... hes somewhat married and all hes doing is talking about himself and his wife... the conversation is as one sided as it gets... he didnt bothered once to ask me... '' hey you cool ? you're about to die ? waddap ? '' nothing , Nada... I had to ghost him , my cell phone been ringing for the past days and I cant be fucked to answer... Screw it... In the love department... here comes the death blow... i never had any serious connection with another woman, never had a girlfriend... fuck... i dont think i even been friends with a girl, no woman was bothered to gave me the time of a day despite me trying quite a lot when  i was 19-24 yrs old.... Im getting old , in a couple of years I will be 30... 30 friggin' years old, i have no enthusiasm towards nothing anymore... meeting ladies ? making friends ? why and how ? my example will be over dramatic on this one but... is like being in prison for 29 years and all of a sudden they throw you back in society... how are you suppose to handle that ? i have no idea... someone once told me , the love game is for the young man , and fuck me they were soo right , took me 16 years to find out... when i was young i use to see all my friends getting attention from women, always... acting towards them way more polite than me... i was always the one you throw shit at... was not cool at first but i grew into it so to say.... it just became normal for women to be rude, it just became normal to be aware that , if you live or die no one cares regardless.... i use to think once that being super rich will solve it all , in reality it wont , they all will use you anyway and you will be back square 1.... death on the other hand excites me... i be walking the street thinking that if my heart bursts or a car slides on the sidewalk and makes me a pile of grinded meat ( i am a sack of walking flesh anyway )... it will be totally fine... wont even bother to ask why... i dont know what else should I say... maybe close this vent on a positive note ?  i dont know what nice thing i should say... cheers maybe ? !",lonely,alone,2022-01-06 13:00:14

Almost every conversation about my loneliness leads to this sentence. And that’s the end of the conversation, like it’s a cure or something, without any explanation.

For an unknown reason I built a stereotype right in my head stating that happiness is a lie, is a sign of not thinking deeply about things that happen around you and to you. So, the only people I can trust are the ones who struggle, not the opposite ones.

With this in mind, thinking about the statement makes me confused, because I would preferably love the ones who doesn’t love themselves, because I know that they are real.

Additionally, I think that overcoming the odds together is highly powerful for true relationship.

I've just been out of a 4.5 year relationship and it's getting increasingly unbearable. I've noticed that when I'm hanging out with my friend (he's the only friend I have where I am), I feel so much better and so different than when I'm home alone with my thoughts, but I can't ask him to see me everyday because unlike me he's got a life. I'm currently unemployed, dropped out of my school, so I live with my parents for now. So I spend most of my days doing nothing and trying to stay busy either by watching stupid stuff on TV or sometimes actually being productive to 'ot think about it but it isn't enough... I've seen how my ex is already doing much better and barely thinks of me now just because she gets to see her friends every day in her school and I wish I had that, I wish I could be surrounded by people I like every day, I'm convinced it would help me get over her and get better overall much faster, being with people makes me forget about how ugly my life is and it's so refreshing. 

The thing is I can't go back to school right now because I left where I used to live temporarily to live with my parents as I said for now, to move back (probably not even in the same town) when I feel ready and better. I'm only here for about 4-6 months I think. 

So I was wondering if any of you guys know if there's anything I can do to be around people and have real human interactions every day...

i really just want a friend. nothing more than that. no materialistic things, no social verification, nothing like that. i just want a friend who i can have an actual deep bond with that isn’t superficial or corrupted with high levels of selfishness. i have always tried to be unconditionally kind to others and include others who did not have anyone into fun activities to have someone and in the end, i’ve only been insulted, humiliated, and made to feel like i don’t belong here in return.

i’m tired and i feel hopeless. i’m not suicidal or self harm, however, painlessly disappearing forever would be nice if it were possible. i’m not sure how older people have lived for so long. i can’t even imagine myself being any much older. not even 22. i mean like 50 years old? i would be so bored and dead inside. i hope i don’t seem like a pessimist or a cynical person. i believe in kindness and can see it in those who have been raised in ways that have led them to become ill-intentioned and hurtful without feeling remorse or shame. i’m just not happy right now.

again, just needed to say how i’m feeling at the moment. to anyone struggling, i truly hope something works out for you and if you have no one for help, don’t feel afraid to pm. to those who are happy, i’m happy for you. please appreciate what you have with the most sincerest gratitude and don’t lose sight of it or yourself. there are many who wish they could have what you have. many people have gone through the same efforts, struggles, and setbacks as you but things did not turn out the same for them.

that’s all. to you, whoever is reading, hope you have a good day.",lonely,emotionally drained,2022-01-06 05:33:18

Coming to the point, I don't know how many of you guys watch hololive, or Vtubers for that matter. But I recently watched Houshou Marine's last video, one where the viewer POV rests on her lap as she strokes the viewer's hair. This video made me think about how many lonely peeps might have replayed that video over and over again, just for the feeling of being loved. How many people might be waiting everyday for her (and the other hologirls) to upload their videos or streams, as their only pleasure in an otherwise lonely and monotonous life. This is further evidenced by just how many people donate to the hologirls, some peeps even donating fairly large sums, just to have the girls call out their names. 

This made me think, do the hologirls inadvertently cause more harm than good by being the metaphorical light of their viewer's day? Many people are obsessed with them,  many watch their streams religiously, ignoring their own health. And many might be doing so out of sheer loneliness.

 I just want to hear your takes on this issue. And how the hologirls or the community could help these people.",lonely,Houshou Marine's most recent headpat short,2022-01-06 04:43:29

I was at Walmart with my two kids picking up a few things and she was there with her kids, we ran across each other while shopping and did the polite head-nod acknowledgment we all do. 
Then we ended up at subway together.
It was fun to notice our differences and similarities.
Then when she and her family went to leave, she smiled waved and said goodbye to us.

It was the friendliest interaction I’ve had in years. I think I might have been rude because at first I was surprised she spoke to me. 
For context, I was raised in an abusive family and when I cut them out of my life, I also cut out my friend group. Because when you have been raised in an abusive family, you typically don’t make good friend choices and when you wake up, you wake up to all of it. I haven’t made other friends yet, I’m a stay at home mom. The only social interaction I get is from men who try to sleep with me and my partner isn’t much of a conversationalist.

Clearly I am in dire need of friendships and social interaction.

Ill figure it out.

I'm scared, I don't want to be alone anymore, I often have dreams of being in terrible situations and I'm all alone, no one to help me. I'm not sure what else to say, I'm just hoping someone will reach out and say, you don't have to be scared anymore, you don't have to be afraid.
I had a dream about a month or so ago, and it's stuck with me ever since. It was a terrifying experience, I woke up soaked in piss and sweat, to this day I still can't get more than a few hours of sleep.
I was walking through a park on a bright sunny day, there was no one else there, except for the occasional squirrel or bird chirping, eventually after seeing some ominous signs like a woman in a clown costume following me and burning holes in the back of my head with those big, empty, black eyes, and passing by the same old beggar preaching about the end, I made my way home. I sat down of the couch, with two men I didn't recognize, one was pale with slicked back hair, sunglasses and a business suit, the other was old with long dirty hair and beard and his clothes were dirty and tattered. For the longest time we all sat there, saying nothing staring out the window at the steadily increasing number of people in clown costumes and jester outfits. Eventually I tried to get up, but they both held me down. I tried to speak, ""Am I in hell?"" But it felt like I was trying to speak under water and nothing came out. Neither replied, the continued to hold me down to the couch. I started to panic, eventually the beggar and the clown woman from earlier came in from the back door and the stood in front of me, shouting and screaming, but nothing came out of their mouths, I heard nothing, but the deafening silence, I thought I had gone deaf. I tried screaming for help, but no sound came out. For what felt like ages they tortured me with their silent screams, the the two men let me go and dragged me to the dinner table, where the proceeded to slice me open as if I was a Thanksgiving turkey. The pain was excruciating and I couldn't turn away, I felt every second of it. And all the while, the beggar and the clown were silently shouting and screaming. Then all the clowns from outside flooded in and strated ripping out shreds of my flesh, then I woke up.
That dream scared the fear of God into me, it made me feel helpless, scared and alone. I don't ever want to feel that again, but every time I lay down next to that cold empty spot, I just see those big, empty black eyes.",lonely,Cold Empty Spot,2022-01-05 18:13:37

I am very awkward I can only talk to people if they talk to me first.  I'm  also not very good at keeping the conversation going. So I just stopped trying I stay in my room and only come out when I have to go to the bathroom. I cry a lot ngl lmao because I don't have any friends and that is all I ever wanted for some reason I can't keep friends and I hate that because when I did have friends I was very happy but now I just stay in my room and never come out and I know that's not good but there is nothing else to do when you don't have friends and I don't want to go anywhere by myself because my when I try to my heart starts beating very fast like I'm scared so I asked my dad to go with me I love my dad very much it is like he is my only friend but I want true friends like real ones but it's so hard to make them and keep them and I really fucking wish I was normal and I can do normal things like fucking talk to people I'm shy asf and I hate it because I had a lot of chances to be friends are too get in come up to me I just don't know how to act normal are take compliments because they always comment on my eyes because so if anyone have anything that could make this better please help out because I don't want to keep years of my life because it's going to get worse now that I'm home so I don't have to leave the house at all I just want real friends that are ok with who I am and the thing is I am still trying to find who that is myself that's why it's probably so hard ohh yeah I know that this is a on going sentence I just didn't want to put any periods because I'm ranting and I kinda forgot since I was rushing,lonely,Bruhh my teenage years are getting wasted,2022-01-05 17:33:46

I'm watching The Matrix Reloaded and all it's at the orgy scene in Zion. I was super immersed in the lore by the this point. But when the scene hit, I could see myself being in that same orgy and just standing in a corner by myself feeling like shit.

It's kinda funny tbh. I mean there surely couldn't have been a 1:1 ratio of guys and girls willing to orgy consensually. I wonder what it felt like to be alone in Zion in the last party before (what seemed like) the end of the world. I can almost imagine that last-minute panic.

I was also bullied a lot because of being from a different sort of background so I never felt any guys would be that interested in me anyway so I never bothered to be into that. I never learnt about any of those things either even though I was already a teenager. In college I slowly started talking a little bit, but I was still heavily under my family’s control. Only when I graduated then I finally had the guts to break free and rebel against my family that I want love and romance and to fit in and don’t want to live this way. Well I fell in love twice, both with guys who never dated me and only wanted to bang and then quit, and I obsessed in my mind over them for so long even though they were both terrible because they charmed me at first and made me feel something I never felt before. But I anticipated for so long for either one of them to want me and go out with me and nothing ever happened and they were very demeaning of me. I did a lot of online dating and went on a few dates, but kept attracting either weird guys or guys who didn’t seem to care, much like my dad I suppose, who emotionally neglected me my whole life and continues to. I’ve also been SAd a few times, which has left me with really bad PTSD.

After a broken heart and disappointing date after date, I’ve sort of given up on love, even though I still crave it, and getting older and realizing how messed up I am and how bad patterns and loneliness usually gets worse with age, things look bleak. I have no close enduring relationships other than a couple friends I made in a support group. No family contact, don’t really get invited to anything, and any although I’m told I’m charming and attractive, I cannot find those stable close loving connections I crave with anyone because I think they know secretly there’s something wrong with me and if they find out I’ll be humiliated. I’m living alone too and my health especially mental health is not good but I have literally no idea how to get out of my isolation.

I’m very kind, romantic, creative, passionate and strong under all the darkness, but that is slowly going away and I feel like a shell of a person. Because I can’t use any of that, pourit into anyone or anything.

Hey guys, I’m 16 and junior in high school. Just moved to NC from Jersey, and moving in the middle of high school obviously isn’t ideal. I know absolutely no one and have been at this school since August. I’m not an introverted person, nor do I have social anxiety. I always try to talk to people and spark up conversations with anyone close by. In my old friend group, I was always the one who organized the plans and also usually asked if anyone wanted to hop on cod. But now I’m just burnt out. I drift from class to class with my AirPods in. I probably don’t speak to more than 5 people in a given day, 4 of which being my teachers. Lunch is the most stressful though. The way our seats work is there are a bunch of tables with like 5 built in seats, so you can’t pull any chairs over. Everyday I walk in and all the chairs are instantly full, and one time I tried sitting down at one, but they asked me to leave because I was taking someone’s spot. Now I usually fake a headache so I can sit in the nurses office, do random things on my computer in the library to kill the time, or sit outside on the patio with my head down. I never used to kind school, actually enjoyed it. I had a lot of friends so I would talk to kids in the hall, and in all of my classes I had a lot of friends to talk too. Now, my days are repetitive and boring, with the same thing to expect each and every day. I still talk to my friends though, If I didn’t I wouldn’t know how to manage. It is really sad though when all of them call me on a Friday night at the mall, or movies, and I’m just here. Lying on my bed and listening to mac miller. Every night, it’s the same deal. Some times I cry, sometimes i sleep, and other times I watch Netflix. I’m lost. I joined my local soccer team to attempt to meet people, but still haven’t. I played soccer for about 14 years and looking to play in college. I never labeled myself as depressed because everytime I hear that word I associate it with middle schoolers who want attention. I know it’s not true, but it’s how I look at it. But I do think I am at this point. In addition to all of this, we moved down with my grandma. She was everything to me and had the brightest personality. She was my rock. She always laughed at my jokes, no matter how inappropriate they were. On September 10th, she was walking early in the morning and got hit by a car. She died. This made everything worse. I know it’s a horrible thought, but I put some of the blame on my parents for moving us here. It sucks. I hate it. My aunt told me her biggest worry was me, and how she didn’t know how I would acclimate here. She said that’s all she ever wanted for me, was to be happy, but I don’t know how. I know I’m getting off track, sorry. I don’t know why I’m here. I never usually post on Reddit. Just felt like telling someone. If you’re still here, thank you. Cheers.",lonely,"16, high school junior",2022-01-05 11:03:27

In my old friend group, I was always the one who organized the plans and also usually asked if anyone wanted to hop on cod. But now I’m just burnt out. I drift from class to class with my AirPods in. I probably don’t speak to more than 5 people in a given day, 4 of which being my teachers. Lunch is the most stressful though. The way our seats work is there are a bunch of tables with like 5 built in seats, so you can’t pull any chairs over. Everyday I walk in and all the chairs are instantly full, and one time I tried sitting down at one, but they asked me to leave because I was taking someone’s spot. Now I usually fake a headache so I can sit in the nurses office, do random things on my computer in the library to kill the time, or sit outside on the patio with my head down. I never used to kind school, actually enjoyed it. I had a lot of friends so I would talk to kids in the hall, and in all of my classes I had a lot of friends to talk too. Now, my days are repetitive and boring, with the same thing to expect each and every day. I joined my local soccer team to attempt to meet people, but still haven’t. I played soccer for about 14 years and looking to play in college. I never labeled myself as depressed because everytime I hear that word I associate it with middle schoolers who want attention. I know it’s not true, but it’s how I look at it. But I do think I am at this point. I don’t know why I’m here. I never usually post on Reddit. Just felt like telling some of you cool Reddit people. If you’re still here, thank you. Cheers.",lonely,I don’t even know man,2022-01-05 10:53:44

i will never be enough for a girl. most of these girls be already having a boyfriend, stuck on their ex, or already seeing someone. i went out, i approached girls at my retail job, in public. they always said they had a boyfriend, or when they gave me their number’s they always led me on.

i will always be someone option, or some last. im not enough to be a main. my personality is funny. i always make ppl laugh, and ppl told me im cool to talk to, or vent to. i will never meet someone who is single. i will always be someone option, never someone priority.

I wish people would stop giving false hope messages like ""aww you'll find someone"" or ""it gets better"" because you don't know that. People have been saying that for years and the only thing it has done was give me false hope.

Then you have people give generic ""love yourself first"" when they don't realize some of us never had the tools or grew up in an environment where we were taught proper self love. Some of us are too mentally ill to love ourselves the way some of you guys do. Then you have people say, ""you have to search for love"" while at the same time people will tell you how they found love when they stopped searching. To me it just sounds like people who got lucky and found love just by existing. I simply exist and get ignored. I try to put myself out there, I get rejected.

Just don't lie to me and give me false hope to make me feel better. It's better to accept that no matter how badly I want something in my life, even if it's one of my main lifelong dreams, it won't happen for me. It's better than chasing a carrot on a stick and deluding myself for the rest of my life. 

It hasn't happened and I hate getting hopeful about it to the point that when I get any sense of optimism or hope that it may happen, I have to remind myself to shut it down because of how my optimism and hope never worked for me in the past.

Even when people say, ""there is no such thing as 'the one', you can find love with many people"", to someone that has never felt love and never even had guys talk to them let alone look at them, you might as well say, ""some people are just more loved. Some of us get into multiple relationships (or relationships with multiple people if you're poly) because we're lucky enough to be loved multiple times... 


People say the dumbest things when it comes to love or “finding someone”. I agree with you on that 100%.

Different type of lonely. That's what I am. Kind of. Most of people here are sad that they are lonely. I am quite too, but I already made peace with it. I am almost 31, not good in relationships with girls. I am not able to express my feelings properly and when I do, other half does not feel it the same way. Also I don't speak when I don't need to. That's life. 

As I am getting older, even though I am still young, I can feel that most people of my age already started having family, weddings and all that weird stuff. Which is allright and I am happy for them. Everybody deserves to be happy. Or everybody can taste the other side of it. I don't mind it but I can feel my circle is getting smaller and smaller. 

I like being lonely. For some time. I can even or would like to live in a small cabin, somewhere in the nature for a few months of a year. Maybe one day

Right now, I have well paid job (in my country), have my own flat (mortgage), some money on my accounts and 25-30 paid days free of work. I am not a career chaser. I want to do my job properly, the best I can and that's it. Some management bullshit can suck my balls.

People here. Who are like to be themselves, who like to be alone even they know that future can be rough. What would you or what have you done to fill up your time? Travel? Gave 100% to some hobby? 

This year, when corona shit will go away slightly, I would love to travel with my car and my bike and connect free time, traveling and my hobby to one single experience package. But still, I am bit afraid I'll do it alone. In a different way.

4297,w_a_t_t_e_u,1641324436,1,"For the context, I am a 19yo french man currently in college. I always had up and down in my life, my father died when I was 11, I have been bullied during secondary school but in the last year of highschool, I thought I was over with all this negativity. I wasn't the popular type but I had friends, even a best friend who was like a brother to me. I had ambition, hopes and dreams, even had some romantic relationships during summer. 

But when the pandemic started I began college, everything changed so fast. As you may know we had a bunch of lockdown and since I studied economy in highschool, learning info and electronic in online classes wasn't an easy task. I tried my best but I failed and now I'm still in first year, working hella hard to pass. So I don't go out a lot and when I do, I'm always worried about college. The reason I'm not going out a lot is also because I lost most of my friends from highschool.
When I moved for the college, I tried to stay in touch with everyone. But I most of them already had a new group of friends and the relationships quickly faded. I also made friend in college but since I failed and they passed, we don't talk to each other much. I know they may have more work, but I feel abandoned, since they still see each other everyday.
Now everything would have been fine if I still had my best friend by my side. But we argued over something stupid and now I'm alone.

This is why now more than ever, I feel crushed and empty. I lost all interest in my hobbies. I used to play basketball and videogames but it's not the same anymore. I have been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety but I know that this may be nothing compared to other people in this sub. So I feel more and more shit. Everyday. I tried to get new friend in my classroom, but I don't  have this connection I had with my other friends. So I put my earpods and come back home as the classes are over. Everyday looks the same and I don't think I will hold it any longer. But I'm also worried about my future and what will I become if I drop out. My family will probably reign me and I will never be able to recover I guess. So I live like a nobody, faking the same emotions and having the same days.

I do not intend to behave like ""I'm the worst victim"" and blah blah blah since that is not true and I don't want to make anyone feel like their sufferings are not valid/not as valid as what I may have now. 

So again. I apologise and thank everyone who will read this in advance. Even if not all of this.

So. Argued with my mom cause my roommate (4 in total including me) in the house I rented for university did not understand that I asked her (E) and another roommate of ours (F) to use the shower of the bathroom I use since I will have to work in the hospital for traineeship. My mom wanted me to take care of it. But I hate to do things like these. Every time I say something to get respected I cause a mess and end up misunderstood. Like this time. Since she took it as ""an oppression"" since she thought I could not allow them to bring friends over... one question. WHEN DID I SAY IT? I JUST ASKED ""Please not use the shower I use because it's a personal hygiene local"". In a POLITE WAY. I never said you couldn't go out and/or bring friends over. So there goes the argue

Then I had unease again because I have been experiencing much unease with myself (AMAB) and I want to be a girl (not gonna expand this too much. And it is *not* to create drama. Just saying it to... I guess put everything here).

And remembered that my family is absolutely unsupportive. That the only time my mother barely talked to a specialist about this sensations he said ""It is not about gender, it is more probable than he has autism"". So great. (Again. I sincerely apologise if I am being too childish. I do not want to create drama. I just need to let out some stress😞)

And also remembered that I can't really differentiate friendships from ""Something more"" and have fear that I'll never have a person for me since I can't understand if I have romantic attraction or not. I know it is not a priority or anything... I just feel so alone cause no one in my physical life understands me and the only people I can be sincere with are from other countries and I only talk to them online.

And now I've been closed in the bathroom for more than 30 minutes. Sat down. Talking with people on the phone trying to kill the time. Feeling like I want to die. Love these days😞

I don't want to do this anymore. I got no one to talk to. I envy people who have people close to them to hangout during christmas, new years, for their birthday or even just daily. I been alone my whole life. Just being me and my family. But not anymore. My family is just a piece of shit. Never felt connected and so now I am just left with myself.

 I have been socializing... but it is always me initiating. I keep making plan, keep texting people, being active in servers/group chats but all that effort gets ignored. The moment I stop texting.. the moment I stop reaching out. They all stop talking/hanging out with me. 
Being talking to this person pretty much every day for a good month and a half. Thought things were going good and that I finally found someone who connects with me... but just to test (this might sound horrible) , I stopped texting for a few days. And nothing. Absolutely nothing. And now...heck, I would be glad if I get a reply in a day's time. 

It has always been like this since I was a kid. I pretty much spend summers texting/hanging out with no one. Just me and only me in my room. I had people to talk to in school. But that's it. I just want somebody to be by my side. Somebody to rely on. Somebody who actually puts in the effort and listens. Of course, people say positive shit like "" things will be better,"" "" u will fine somebody,"" "" go to a therapist,"" "" start doing stuff on your own.

It’s 2 AM and I can’t sleep thinking about the guy who ghosted me almost a year ago. I knew him since high school yet I still remember a lot of the things we talked about because I enjoyed talking to him very much. We stopped talking during college and reconnected last year. 

Then one day, he just never responded. I didn’t want to double text him because I have been humiliated by double texting a couple of times before. So I let it be. 

One thing I can say is that he is an amazing guy. The woman who has his heart is sure to be lucky. Too bad he thinks of himself so negatively. He often told me about his self-esteem issues and I did my best to tell him he’s a good-looking guy and an even kinder person. 

Little does he know that he was perfect in my eyes. But what good does it do when I was just another person to him. 

He’s passionate and smart. He loves his family very much. He has so many dreams. He loves seeing the best in everyone except himself. He’s caring. He’s funny and adorable in his own way. And he was the only guy to ever understand me in every way possible; he made me feel seen. Of course, there were disagreements here and there but we often laugh it off.

I just hope he’s happy. I hope life is treating him well and that he fulfills his dreams because he deserves it. I pray for his safety every time I can.

I'd like to make friends to meet eventually, call on the phone, send stuff to, be here for, watch stuff with and game together. In a nutshell to be long term, genuine, real life friends. I've been trying for about a month now on Reddit but I just get used or harassed, and ignored eventually. And no one wants a real relationship/friendship. 

I love Roblox, Minecraft, animal crossing, going under, unpacking, hades, Cuphead, Lego games, Mario Odyssey, Mario party, Wii party, I have 124 Wii games. AND aLL that jazz. 

If you wanna be friends I'd prefer you be 17-20 because of my age, and be from the USA, because of timezones and stuff! Thank you! ♡(&gt; ਊ &lt;)♡",lonely,18F eh ErM,2022-01-05 04:53:04

4315,TheGoatNapoleon,1641314971,1,"Hi everyone, and happy new year!

Because social anxiety can trigger loneliness and isolation, and as someone who is lonely because of my own social anxiety as well, I wanted to share my post with this community.

About a month ago, I had announced that some fellow redditors and I would be starting a Social Anxiety Anonymous virtual support group; and we’ve done it! After a couple of months of hard work, we’ve managed to bring together a supportive community dedicated to helping one another overcome social anxiety.

To do so, my group and I meet virtually, once weekly, for an hour, over Zoom, where we discuss helpful tools to manage the stress and symptoms of social anxiety and our own experiences and struggles with it. Personally, I’ve felt that listening to my fellow group members describe their experiences has been incredibly beneficial; it helped me realize that I’m not alone in my struggles. Others have found that the materials we share are beneficial to them; saying that utilizing these tools daily has made a significant impact on their social anxiety. Whatever it is that’s working, it’s working! That is why I’m excited to share that we are re-opening the group to new members.

Originally, when the group started, there were about 20 people interested in joining. So, we made the discord server and voted on a weekly time and day that works best for most people to host our virtual meetings. We found that Saturdays at 9am (EST) worked for a very small majority of the group, but it was the best option we had. Unfortunately, because everyone’s schedules vary greatly, a lot of people couldn’t make these Saturday meetings work and we ended up losing a good chunk of members. That is why we’re re-opening the group. 

We believe that the more active members we have, the more support we can give to each other. So, right now we have \~4 active members who attend our weekly meetings and we’re looking to bump up that number. 

There is a limit to the number of people who can join, unfortunately. Because a large portion of the weekly meeting is spent asking questions and sharing our experiences, we can’t have too many active members or the meetings would run wayyyy too long. So, we’ve agreed to cap the group at 15 active members total. So, if you’re interested, I’ve included a link to our discord server below where you can come and check us out. 

It’s important to know that there is no pressure to talk whatsoever during weekly meetings; some people benefit simply from taking in what others have to say. Also, to protect our member's privacy, when you first join the discord, you won’t be able to see any of the channels until I change your status to “Member” which I will do in 24hrs or less. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

Cheers!",lonely,Virtual Social Anxiety Anonymous; open again to new members,2022-01-05 03:49:31

4324,TiaTigress,1641306632,1,"So, to start I randomly meet a guy about eight years ago at a concert. Gave me his number but I lost it. I was so mad at myself. We had such a great time. Cliché as it is, I knew I wanted to be close to him as soon as I met him. My friend had hung out with his friend that night and also exchanged numbers. I was totally bummed about losing his number. I felt some strong connection. Turns out he got mine from his friend so it all worked out!

We chatted, fucked, hung out many times for years. It was always so easy and flawless. Everything was like a dream. Granted we never established a relationship so it was always just mutual. Due to distance I never got to try and have a relationship with him, but my heart aches for his company. I always felt that we belonged together. I was always afraid he was too good for me, due to my lack of self esteem. 

I had spent some time in the hospital unexpectedly and lost all his information and no way to contact him. Unintentionally ghosting. (I was in a coma.) Once I got well again, I was longing for his company and then there he was again. Always there whenever I needed or wanted him. Always showing up at the right times. We both saw other people (obviously) over the years. I always had a feeling we would be together eventually. 

Now for the fun part. Even though we both are seeing other people, we talk everyday. The connection made my heart race (amongst other things.) I was looking at his social media and there it was. His name tagged. My heart shattered as I saw it. A million perfect memories, perfectly ruined. A baby announcement. 

Today, I found out that he is having a baby. 

I don’t really know what I am wanting from this post. Maybe just to vent, say it to myself, try to not feel the insane heart wrenching emptiness that I’m feeling. 

I’m a 33 year old female that knows much better. He never wanted me or else why wouldn’t he have said so. This is the end of something I’ve been holding onto with hope for years.

This person definitely thinks your hideous. They would rather do anything else than talk to you. Get out of this, NOW! You can’t know this person because then they’ll know you and then they’ll hate you because you’re a horrible person. You would add absolutely nothing to this person’s life and guess what, they definitely know it, too. Their life would be so much better if you just left them alone. Notice how no one ever approaches you and asks you how your day was unless they felt obligated to?” I try to block these thoughts, but they make their way through any sort of mental firewall. I have probably one good friend and even they don’t reach out to me unless they need something. I’m not even 20 yet, but at this rate, it doesn’t look too good. How could I have gotten this far in life and not once has someone besides a relative reached out to me just to talk or check in or even just say “hi”? I don’t deserve friends or love because I know I’m trash, but even trash is another person’s treasure. I’m whatever is less than trash, the thing that nobody wants anything to do with.",lonely,What’s less than trash?,2022-01-04 19:41:53

They have had a difficult past, experienced loss and many devastating things that really break my heart. Sometimes my habits, like drinking or smoking, trigger them. It’s not an addiction, I don’t do it excessively, but I still do because of my depression (they don’t know about it). I feel so selfish for being in a relationship, because I feel like I’m going to be the cause of us breaking up. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts for almost two years and recently started to self harm again, I don’t have anyone to talk to about this because I don’t want to trigger, upset and honestly bother anyone.

4373,EtherealHemp,1641278071,1,"Hey, life long loner here. I'm in my early 20s, moved around a lot ever since I was a kid so ever maintained any actual friendships. 2 years is about the longest I've known someone and could consider them a friend (thought that person and I no longer speak and even then there was a period where we didn't talk for an extended period of time before reconnecting, due to issues). 

I've tried making friends online several times, but I've sadly noticed that most people cannot maintain a proper flowing conversation and they seem to lack the drive required to put in effort. Therefore, most the time it felt like I was doing all of the work when it came to communicating. Either that, or I was always the one reaching out first to begin with. It was like this for damn near everyone I've been acquainted with. If I don't reach out first, they'll never check on me (save for a select few), and we'll essentially never be talking. I got tired of seeing my ""friends"" online, wondering when they'll message me to see what's up or have a nice chat. They rarely did. I got tired of feeling like no one gave a rats dick about my existence. I got tired of keeping around these ""friends"" that I never speak to. Friends that essentially, reinforce my feelings of loneliness x100. 

So I deleted all social media. All I have is Reddit now. I don't have anyone that I talk to irl nor online. I'm not close to anyone. I do my own things, keep myself company, enjoy my hobbies, eat whatever I want whenever I want, sleep whenever I want for as long as I want, and just generally live my life the way I want to without being worried about other people's opinions or what other people are doing, or wondering why they never reach out to speak to me. 

Point being, I don't feel lonely when I'm completely alone. In fact, I feel like I've been able to grow more as a person this way.",lonely,I only feel lonely when there's other people in my life,2022-01-04 17:34:31

I'm the last single friend of all 3 of my main friend groups and although I am absolutely ecstatic that my friends are happy, it's hard. We all used to hangout almost daily but as they got into relationships, their priorities shifted (understandably so) and their lives began to surround their boyfriends and they completely forgot about me.

Hanging out with them is either them going on a double date with me 5th wheeling, and if we decide to have a girls night out all they do is talk about their boyfriends or call them. We still have normal conversations, but there is no escaping the fact that I feel lonely in every crowded room. I recently went to a new years eve party and I must admit that the countdown was a reminder of how lonely I am.

I don't have the best luck with guys and they approach everyone in my group except me- it just hurts.

I've talked to them about it, and they are sympathetic and try to make me feel better, but the truth still remains: there's no way I'm getting them back unless I, myself, get a boyfriend OR keep agreeing to being an unwanted tag along while everyone sucks each others faces off.

I had many thoughts go through my head some about who I actually am, what I want, and all I know is I don't want to be lonely. Yes, I have friend and family but I still end up feeling lonely at times. Its not just someone being there that makes you not feel lonely, its more than that. Its the emotional aspect. Being there, listening, connecting, and caring for each other. I might need to just get out of my shell and do what I want for a while. Maybe I need to travel and live somewhere different. Maybe I just need a change of pace is all. I just want to feel like I'm needed and wanted on a deep emotional level with someone. I've been lonely this way far too long and it's just recently getting to me. I hate crying and It just keeps happening over and over tonight. Maybe I needed this much of an emotional crash to realize what I'm missing. Hopefully it passes with time and I realize what I need and want.

I'm sorry if this got you emotional it wasn't meant for that. It was a way to help myself and others realize that things will eventually get better.

4378,Celerchel,1641274263,1,"The last two years have been very rough.  


My personal life consists of going to work every day and then coming home, doing fuck all until I sleep and go to work the next day.  


I don't really take enjoyment from my old hobbies anymore. I used to love to fish, do other stuff outdoors, things like that.  


The only thing I take real pleasure from anymore is roleplaying on tabletop and discord. The high adventure stuff is fun, but lately I've just been craving the slice of life kind of stuff, because I can play someone who has value, is in a relationship, has stuff going in their life, someone who is loved and is able to give it without being a socially awkward weirdo. It's something I crave so, so much that even this form of getting it by proxy is just satisfying. Up until I take a moment to realize that it's all ficitonal, and then I just end up feeling empty inside again.  


I have friends and family, and they are supportive, but I feel like a burden. They are all moving forward and getting all of the good things in life. I don't really like parties or the bar scene like they do, so the only time I get real social interaction is on game night. They treat it as a hobby, but it's become essential to me for the reasons above, and it's the only time I get social interaction too.  


When I'm not being a nerd and wasting countless hours on the internet, I watch romance movies now too, because I want that so much.  


I just hope there is either something after this life, maybe someway to experience some of the stories I've created first hand, or some sort of reincarnation. I hate my life, I want to get off this ride, but I don't want to be even more of a burden and cause the few people I do care about pain if I leave early.

4397,Kundohlence,1641267291,1,"Got bullied growing up in school. I have never had any friends. The bullying was so bad I dropped out of public school to become homeschooled. I was bullied because of a birthmark I had as a young child, I had a birthmark on the neck that was large in size and made me an easy target for the other children. I grew up hating myself and what I looked like, so I was forced to leave public schools.   
My family was always very poor growing up, so I never had money to go out and meet people. My parents were also naturally homebodies, always using money or health reasons as an excuse to never leave the house. I have just been isolated from social circles for my entire life. I will be turning 23 next month, and I have barely ever had a girlfriend. I kissed a girl when I was 16, we dated for like a month, and then she broke up with me shortly thereafter. The relationship was not great anyways, I was clearly the more invested one, she didn't like me that much, or, at least, wasn't mature enough to know how to communicate that interest. It should probably be noted or mentioned, as I got older, this birthmark faded away, and is no longer even visible. It just vanished with time. So this is no longer any issue, whatsoever.  


I do not have any social skills. None, period. I would not consider myself an introvert, I am very, highly, extroverted. I love meeting new people, and I love going out. It's just the environment that I have been raised in and been brought up, has made it difficult to meet new people and going out. I have lived an extremely sheltered life; talk about having no life experiences or memories. Honestly, I just want a girlfriend. I have been wanting a girlfriend for quite some time now. Of course, I have no idea how to interact with girls I like, as I have never talked or interacted with girls before. I met this girl at work recently that I REALLY liked, I mean, REALLY, REALLY, liked. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever met before in my life. I was extremely stupid, and idiotic, and pretty much had some sort of love at first sight infatuation with this girl, where I was just awestruck by her beauty and her outgoing persona. She was everything I was not, good social skills, charming, able to hold a conversation.  
I ended up telling this girl how I felt about her too quickly, too soon, which resulted in her telling me that she was creeped out by me. But I did feel like she sent me a lot of mixed signals; she told me I was a very intelligent guy, that I was sweet, and handsome, etc. She would always joke and play with me, playful, teasing banter, and, I would, of course, take this as flirting, on top of all the other things that she said, I did ask her if she was interested in a relationship, to which she said no. I was really stupid, and had this no really means try again ideology. I would always mistake her just being nice to me as her flirting with me, or being romantically interested. I felt like the mixed signals were very present, or perhaps, I just misinterpreted her being nice and friendly as being romantically interested.  
This resulted in her blocking me and causing me A LOT of problems at work, where she had spread through the workplace that I was a creep, desperate, weirdo, and didn't take ""no"" for an answer.  


It was never my intention to harass her, I just genuinely misunderstood her mixed fucking signals.  
Calling me sweet, handsome, and intelligent? And it was her idea to add me on snapchat, and instagram, so we could exchange photos to each other and get to know each other more. Mind you, this was her fucking idea. Talk about some goddamned mixed signals. Shit pisses me off. Makes me so damn angry when people can't just give you a simple yes or fucking no, it's like they are halfway yes, and halfway no. Just give me a simple fucking answer, and I will be at rest. Shit. Then she proceeds to tell everyone at work that I am the problem, that I was some stalker crazed weirdo that wouldn't take no for an answer. Like, no, it was your mixed fucking signals driving me up a fucking wall. Like, can you really not see that?  


I am isolated from social groups, and being made into a total fucking outcast at my workplace now, because of this whole shitty situation. I am extremely alone, no friends, no social groups, haven't had a girlfriend in seven fucking years, still a virgin, obviously. I try so fucking hard to be a good guy to this girl and she goes and treats me like this. I'm probably going to lose my job over this shit as well on top of it. That is really what makes me the most angry. You can reject me, FINE. But don't cause me problems at my fucking workplace of all places and cause me to get fired, just because I was interested in you, and misinterpreted a few of your mixed goddamned signals.",lonely,"Extreme, crippling, isolation (22M)",2022-01-04 14:34:51

4405,figurativelyfree,1641264795,1,"Hello reddit! Hope y'all are having a much better time than me, either in action or in thoughts; and a big hug to all of you (for those who don't like hugs, I hope fist bumps will suffice), and I ultimately hope you all a fantastic new year.

This is a venting exercise that I hope will at least unload some feelings I have that has been eating at me for quite some time, and in doing so, I believe should make me feel slightly better. Selfish reasons, I know. 🤷🏼‍♂️

I will try to keep this as short as possible (update: I failed 😔).

I am a 35 year-old human male, with almost no friends, no relationships (or dating) history, no past sexual/intimate experiences at all, almost zero outdoor experiences (started hiking last year with a total of two hikes), and with a severe crippling depression, which lately started to turn into a soul crushing beast that tries to suffocate the living shit out of me, which can be a little bit inconvenient.

I find it difficult to connect to people; which led me to currently having 4 close friends, three of them I share nothing with. They are still good friends and everything, but apart from sharing similar sense of humor, we don't really connect in almost anything and we don't really understand what the other goes through when we vent to each other. But we make do, and we manage to come up with enough understanding and distraction to serve the purpose.

Also the people I seem to connect with fade away in the long term, and as such I didn't manage to maintain a friendship with people I connected with for more than a year, which is also a little bit inconvenient and feeds my overthinking and insecurities in a strongly negative way.

In addition to all of this, my life was greatly affected by a religious transformation I had to go through on my own over the past five years, something that had held me back in life, have kept me away from my friends and family^((\*)) and was the main reason why I struggled to find people to connect with or have relationships in general. This transformation reshaped my character in many different ways, and changed so much of my views about life.

It has also led me to an important fact: that life is full of possibilities \*gasps\*, and these possibilities include meeting someone you connect with, fulfilling a lifelong dream, continuously live life one day at a time, or be alone. I have also come to terms with the fact that there is nothing wrong with any of these possibilities, as long as you know what you want out of life and learn to make the most out of it on your own terms. Except that the one where I could end up alone would suck a little bit because I am inherently a social person. 🤷🏼‍♂️

So I have made the life changing decision to not change anything about my life at all, just do the things I enjoy doing, pursue the dreams I want to pursue, meet people and interact with them; if I connect with some of them, that's a fantastic bonus; if that connection leads to something more than a friendship, even better. The only difference is that I won't hold back**^((\*\*))** when it comes to making the most out of my time on this earth, or other planetary bodies^((\*\*\*)).

I am also learning how to live with disappointments, how to overcome them, and how to limit their influence on my enjoyment of life. That bit is quite difficult especially with overthinking and with that soul crushing monster squeezing my heart out, but I am slowly controlling these aspects of my life, and also I am not giving up to that prick that easily.

Well, that's that. Thank you for reading this article, I very much appreciate it; and sorry for the long rant.

Have the best year yet!

I have a loving partner who's great, and I appriciate him so much. However, I want friends...I have 2 ""best friends"" who never speak to me unless I make conversation first. 

Im just reflecting back to Last week, I found they both went out together, 3 times in the week, for meals and drinks. Understandably, one of them has just broke from a long term relationship, but she didn't even tell me, I found out through social media. The other day, they both asked could they come to my house to ""get her out the house and keep her mind occupied"" obviously being the person I am, I said yes. They said to me ""should we get a takeaway"" and again, I said yes, thinking we would all chip in but I ended up paying for it all, over £40 and I'm the one on the lowest wage out of us all. They said if I sent my bank details over they'd send me money when they got home, so I did....no money even went in my bank, i wouldn't mind...but I ordered the least expensive thing, their food was so expensive. I did ask (shouldn't ask for my own money back) and completely got ignored. I wouldn't mind usually, but it's just been Christmas and I've been left with £12.43 in my bank until February. I had no thank you for letting them come over, no thank you or nothing. 

It's been over a week now, but it's been on my mind since I found out they went out together without an invite, I'm 25 and I've been friends with one of them for 20 years, the other (who just invited herself into our friendship) around 10 years. They've made me feel like this lots of times, but I don't want to let them go as friends as its all I've known. They're shitty friends, I know this, but if I don't have them, I literally don't have ANYONE apart from my boyfriend. I know I should be thankful, but there's just times i want to go out with friends, shopping, drinks, for food...but I can't, because when I ask, I get ignored, or I don't don't gey invited. 

I don't know what to do, I say that if I don't have these 2 I won't have nobody, but it already feels like I have nobody 😞",lonely,So lonely...,2022-01-04 11:33:29

4441,lonelyratinahat,1641247957,1,"Okay, so... I feel so alone... there’s one person in my life, and while I love him I NEED friends... but I’ve just never been able to make any. I haven’t really had a proper friend since leaving school. Even then, no one Ive ever considered a friend has been real with me.

I’m desperate, I need friends. I’m nearly ready to give up on life. I literally don’t care if you genuinely like me, or if you just try and get to know me out of pity. It’s near the end for me I think. I just want to be able to say I have at least one friend— even if I know I’m lying to myself.

I thought I could write a little list of struggles I have and see if anyone felt they could relate to me... if I get more than one person I’ll make a group chat, and maybe we could have a nice supportive online friendship circle. First thing out of the way— please do NOT contact me if you are under the age of 18. I am F20.


STRUGGLES: 


— I struggle with a lot of mental health issues— including, anxiety, depression, psychosis, bouts of agoraphobia, PTSD and possibly borderline though I have not yet been diagnosed with that last one. Mental health issues run deep in my family, and I like to think I’m an understanding person/ good shoulder to cry on. If you aren’t an emotional person I might be unpalatable for you.

— I am neurodivergent, specifically autistic.

— My anxiety, essentially,  makes it hard to leave my house. Recently, every time I’ve left my house and had to interact with anyone— when I get back home I feel legitimately suicidal because all I can think about is how awkward and accidentally horrible I am— no wonder everyone hates me. I feel helpless... like there’s nothing I can do to make myself likeable or even just not hateable. Growing up, my mum was schizophrenic and illogical thinking specifically paranoid thinking was introduced to me as normal. I saw this incredible kind woman (although she was definitely not a perfect mother) get treated badly even though she deserved the world and it still fucks with my head when I really think about it.

- My PTSD stems from childhood bullying. I get really uncomfortable when talking negatively about people aka gossip, which I’ve been told is a normal part of friendship and I need to get used to.

— you’ve probably already figured this out that because of the way I feel about myself I don’t work. I want to, really, but I’m just so scared and incompetent that I just don’t know what to do. I’m currently doing an online course in animal care— it’s the first stepping stone on my trying to get a job and I’m so fucking scared.

— it frustrates me when people consider themselves lonely purely based on the fact they don’t have a relationship. Makes me want to cry and scream to myself— trust me, having a partner and no friends is millions and millions of times worse than having friends but not having a partner.

THINGS I ENJOY:

— Recreational use of marijuana. I also tried cocaine for the first time for NYE. I haven’t tried any other drugs but would be willing to experiment with some. I like drinking too!

— Psychology.

— Cooking/Baking.

— Creating stories.

— Spirituality. Specifically zodiacs and tarot.

— Animals. Especially small ones. I have two pet rats and a hamster and they are the lights of my life. (As is my boyfriend!)

- The TV show Bojack Horseman.

4448,Katherine9009,1641246100,1,"How sad is that 🙃

short backstory: bullied as a child and teen which has left me with very low self confidence, I've been on occasional dates and some of them even go well with the guy wanting to meet me again but I can never seem to make a connection or feel attracted to them and it never goes anywhere. I wonder if my low self confidence contributes to that somehow and if I should seek some sort of help, like with a therapist? I'm so tired of everyone around me, both friends and family, having someone while the last time I kissed a guy was 10 years ago. Don't get me wrong, I *have* been in love before so I doubt that I'm asexual or aromantic, it's just been years since it happened for me and with every passing year it really feels like it gets increasingly harder. Of course, the number of men I dare to meet from dating apps aren't many and sometimes my confidence has been so low that I would cancel dates or end up ""ghosting"" them simply from being afraid that they wouldn't like me (or even that I wouldnt like them and be disappointed yet again). And the few times I have liked someone (as in from guys I met casually, through work or whatnot, were either taken or just weren't interested back). 

I just... don't know what to do anymore. I have a decent life otherwise but sometimes the loneliness and feeling of being so different from ""everybody else"" that comes crawling every single time I see a couple can be crushing (sometimes I cant even bare to hang out with my friends if they bring their boyfriends due to feeling envy). I have wondered several times if I really should seek some sort of therapist about my self-image and loneliness and was wondering if anyone else here has done the same? Or just in general feel stuck in a similar situation to mine?

I no longer have full good days. The best I get are bipolar days where I where I have really high highs followed by depression. That or I manage to get high on marijuana without it making me severely depressed and lonely, a rare occasion these days. There’s just always this void. Sometimes it’s anxiety, sometimes it’s depression, sometimes it’s a deep emptiness. Even when I have these bipolar type highs there’s this underlying feeling that something’s wrong. I don’t know why is humans are so cursed. I think everyone deserves love but relationships are just so convoluted and even when people do decide to form friendships and romance there’s abuse and complications and all sorts of stuff. Sometimes I wish sex didn’t exist, to me it just feels like the source of so much evil. And it’s like I’m not even in control of my own body. Even though I feel this way, I’m still biologically programmed to lust because we’re just a bunch of highly evolved apes that reproduce forever for no discernible reason. And it’s skewed my view of people too. I can no longer see them as the sort of conscious, almost divine in a way beings that I once did, and only see monkeys whose actions are informed by a core of indulgence and lust. It’s almost like an obsessive form of thinking and I hope I don’t have OCD. 

I often wish I was enough for myself. Like a monk or Nietzsche’s Ubermensch. But I’m a fallible, weak minded being and therefore a slave to my hedonistic desires. I don’t know. I can talk about philosophy and core meanings of my loneliness and justify for the rest of time, but at the root of it all I just feel like shit. Loveless and alone. Fuck the Ubermensch I just want to be held and cared about. 

Here’s a little anecdote. It’s about me 🤗. At one point in time I was so fucked in the head that I became infatuated with the edited girl version of myself. So much so that I planned to lose weight, start wearing makeup, grow my hair, and become her. I just wanted to be a pretty girl. Maybe then I’d get some attention and love. I never went through with it, and it’s probably for the best, I don’t think I’m actually trans, I just wanted to escape myself. But I still find myself infatuated with transgender women in general. Obsessed with one girl in particular. And then I just feel gross again that I’ve allowed myself to become a creature of lust and fetish. 

I have to go and stop writing now, but I hope one day all of our mental health will be stable and we’ll find some truth and meaning in our life, either without other people. I really hope everyone here can find their happiness. Love y’all :)",lonely,Just need a place to vent,2022-01-04 07:56:31
4458,inauburn,1641242029,1,"Thinking of the previous post about martyrdom

You know what stoic books and therapists would say, maybe it's you, in the sense that changing your ways is more feasible than trying to change the ways of everyone else.

Then what if it's you and you embraced it fully

Me: ""as far as back as I can see noone really loved me, even parents""
Therapist: ""maybe it's you?""
Me: it's me

Because

I am the Earthly Manifestation of Pure Evil
I am the Lord of Darkness
I am the The One Who Knocks
I am He Who Walks Behind the Rows
I bathe in the tears of the suffering
I swim in the blood of the innocent
I am the Eater of Dreams
I am the Devourer of Souls
I am the pebble in your shoe
I am the black hole at galactic central point
I am Entropy
I shall eat all Energy
I am the Light of millions of Suns exploding
all at once
I am the ringing millions of bells
all at once
millions of bells made of skulls,
I am the Millions of souls screaming in inconsolable anguish
all at once
Throughout space and time
All is pain and suffering
And overall it is all My Doing
I surf on the waves of the Sea of Despair
I command the Armies of Hell at the snap of a finger
I ride with the Apocalypse
I leave behind only the crushed skulls of those who were foolish enough to oppose Me
They shall all burn in Hell

I am Hell

Cursed to roam aimlessly through time and space
Screaming in sorrow and pain

I am the bad guy, and everyone else just collateral damage of me existing

I won't be apologizing for existing any time soon

Deal with it.

Most people don't like my vibe and other times I don't like theirs. I've had good friends, few. Few means like 2 or 3 who could be honest to me at all times. But times have gone by. After grad, in college I still maintained a straight face being a terrible loner and hiding my vulnerability. I met many people who were at different paths of their own. Some were yeah hi hello bye. Some were good enough to ask. Some are still in contact after 2 years of graduation. But in reality, there's no one. It's wake up, do your work, back to bed and sleep. Life's been fair to me, most times. Now I have enough maturity to embrace myself. I go out by myself. My parents do accompany me most times. They know I don't have anyone to hang out to. Why so lonely? You might ask. You see, I've had friends who stabbed my back. Lying to me in my face and telling me that I'm soft, weak and just another happy go lucky person. I've met many people in these years most people find me naive, stubborn, narcissist and a highly witty and over sarcastic person. I'm not narcissist.

I always appreciate someone with a good sense of humor - sometimes I’m too serious for my own good. 

I can be found volunteering as an emotional support listener online, taking care of my family at home and going for long walks outside. I’ve got a wide variety of interests, so we’re bound to have something to bond over. Let me know what you’re passionate about.

4490,LeggingsAreMyJam,1641223152,1,"The week before Christmas, the woman who had told me that she was with me for the rest of our lives very suddenly decided that she no longer wanted any of those things. On a Fri I was asked to move out, on a Sat I was told we were no longer getting married, and on Sun I was told she wished to be single. This after a relationship that was the most solid thing I personally had ever had in my life, leaving my entire world shattered. Via texts. 

to say I was hit hard, would be a criminal understatement. Completely blindsided by all this (I was actually in the process of planning family activities for that weekend that *she* suggested for our children (separate relationships) and ourselves. I spiraled. Hard. I have CPTSD, so finding ""love"" and a healthy partnership/relationship where I feel safe is so very difficult for me. This has made me feel that I'll never be able to trust again. 

After the split, I reached out to my entire support structure. I raised the alarm, so to speak. The response that I got back was so awfully disheartening. 

I'll admit that the timing was terrible. It was the week of the biggest holiday in the US, and I was asking my peer support group to help me instead of taking that time with their families. But then the holidays ended. I've reached out to them all several times since then, and I've just basically been ghosted by those I considered my friends and chosen family (I don't have any bio fam anymore since I came out as trans many years ago). 

This has left me feeling absolutely terrible. My SI has never been higher, but I've also accepted that I'm ""not allowed to die"" so long as I have a child that depends on me so I just idealize it daily knowing that someday all this pain will end. I've come to realize that I truly cannot rely on anyone when things get hard, and that absolutely terrifies me. Worst, before this, I thought I had a small, but mighty group of people in my corner. Now, I've come to learn that there's literally no one there with me, and I'm just so very tired. 

I'm struggling folks. Usually when I create posts asking for help like this on various subs, I get no response, but I wanted to try one more time, because I'm just that bad.

Then there are people who will try to act like they care about you, then one day you will wake up and see you're blocked by them because you weren't what they wanted you to be.

you just have to pretend to be fine, being the funny person and pretending to be in a good mood because if you have mental health problems people won't support you, people you might consider friends will just laugh at you or not take you seriously.

life? such a short word. such endless possibilities. but the ending.. well its unknown until it happens.  progress? is something you make over time. even the tiniest things are progress. (examples of progress: start off as a baby. you babble and stumble every time you try to walk. well look at you now. speaking fluently and walking straight lines.  thats major progress. how about hand writing? you learned as you grew up. which is also progress. and you can also learn progress from observing others goals. take tying a shoe for example. you may have watched adults, other kids, or even videos to tie your shoe. now you don’t need to wear Velcro anymore. (unless thats the current style) something to be happy about. now think of life this way.  a book. every single book has an ending. whether bad or good. its still an ending. some endings happen with no explanation and some have every detail. now dont think to hard about that. because its not really that important. just a thought. now i would love to explain the meaning of life to you: everything in life has some meaning to be put there. trees = filters the air we breathe. coal = fuel. you = a person on earth who may be struggling with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. sounds familiar huh. well you have a purpose… and it may seem very incorrect (because of the dark place you might be in) but i think the word purpose has a meaning.. just like you. purpose = the reason something was said, done, or created. so you have a purpose. and that purpose is to progress in life and enjoy it while you can. treat everyday like it might be your last. that doesn’t mean become reckless, but to slowly make progress over the years. find put more about yourself, enjoy hobbies and find new ones, and most importantly learn to love who YOU truly are. 
with that being said, never end things over i silly mistake. don’t overthink life. enjoy small things and praise the big. stay safe my love, and whatever you do, never think suicide is an option.

When we're out of balance being alone can make us feel lonely and sorry for ourselves, ans we might still feel like this even when we're in company. Sometimes when we think of being alone it can bring a fear of feeling lonely or melancholy, as we often associate being alone with these feelings.

Counterbalance this by observing your blessings and it won't be long before you are in a state of gratitude for your own divine company.

I take paths meant for many, and face it with nothing but my own wit. 

I travel the streams of life in a boat meant for many, and yet row ever so slowly as I’m without my fellow man. 

I journey through treacherous heights, knowing there is no hand or rope to remedy even the slightest mistake.

I push through the fog of confusion, knowing I have no lantern of clarity in which the flame of companionship burns ever so bright.

I brave the blizzards of heartbreak knowing there is no shoulder in which to warm myself upon.

I embark on quests that I know I’ll never be prepared for, and wonder why I fail. I find problems in life that I know must include another, and yet I am shocked when I bear witness to the results. 

I know the troubles of my life are quite literally in my head, and while I dare to say these wages are unjust for my actions, I know deep within my soul…

I’m a 23 year old guy and recently my social life kinda fell apart after I moved back home from graduating college and I lost all my college friends and my girlfriend and I mutually broke up. That was 6 months ago, I work full time with genuinely great people and my ex and I still talk occasionally, trying to remain friends. 

I’m just wondering how it gets better from here? I’ve made work friends but that’s it, they’re just work friends. I’ve made attempts at hanging out with them but I don’t seem to fit in/they already have a circle that I’m not really a part of. I have one work friend in particular who I really get a long with when we work together but I think I’m misreading what that relationship actually is, he doesn’t seem to like me as much as I like him, he’s nice on the job but if I try to reach out when we’re not working he kind of treats me like a distant coworker, doesn’t respond or gives 2 word answers or responds kind of rudely/curtly. The same thing has happened to me with other coworkers, I see snap stories of them at bars together or hanging out at one persons house and Im never invited. My ex girlfriend only talks to me when she needs me, often not responding for several days whereas I respond within the hour 90% of the time. she has a bunch of new work friends that she loves, I feel like everyone is moving on and living their lives and I’m just not a part of any of it. I don’t hold any negativity towards any of them, I know I’m not owed their friendship and they’re not obligated to talk to me, but I feel like I’m a nice guy, I care about people, I try to do the right thing, I’m pretty charismatic, but everyone seems to not need me in their life where I need them. I can’t help but feel kind of lied to when one of my close work friends doesn’t have the same energy when I’m not working with them, it’s like they’re only talking to me because they’re stuck with me there.

What do I do? Is this going to last forever? I’m trying to not fall into a pit of despair like in highschool where i convinced myself that everyone hated me, but I don’t see how it isn’t that way right now.

I desperately want to talk to someone but I’m in the UK and it’s 3am and no-one is awake or would even care to help me. 

I don’t know why this is happening. 2021 was the absolute worst year of my life. It marked the 10 year anniversary of my stalker literally trying to ruin my life, of her trying to set my house on fire in 2020, of me losing my job, of me developing excoriation disorder so badly that I’m permanently scarred on about 60% of my skin, of getting clinical depression (again), of falling headfirst into full-on alcohol dependency, of losing a 7 year relationship, of my ex taking my dog, of having to spend over £115,000 to keep my home, of dealing with my mum’s bowel cancer scare, of becoming agoraphobic, of having to go into alcohol detox. It’s just too much. 

I’m trying to be positive, I’m trying to help myself. 

I’m 74 days sober today. I own my own home outright. I’m recovering my liver and digestive function so that they’re better than 7 years ago. I managed to travel to see my dad for the first time in over a year. I’ve started therapy. I’ve been exercising and cleaning and meal prepping and *functioning*. I’m doing better. 

Or…I *was* doing better. 

I want to throw myself into the sea right now, like the piece of rubbish that I am. I can’t get away from these intrusive thoughts - that my ex is painting me like the psycho alcoholic ex-girlfriend, that I’m worthless and won’t ever be able to find and keep a job, that people don’t want to spend time with me or even be seen with me, that I’m so utterly ugly to my core, that I’m broken and just need to be thrown away.

4636,xfallenangelx95,1641159641,1,"READ EVERYTHING IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEND ME A MESSAGE I want you to read everything to avoid unecessary misunderstandings .ONLY chat requests and Private messages - PLEASE :) Please send me a message ONLY If you're in exactly the same situation and If your expectations are the same.I want to find like minded people.

I'm quite active on reddit &amp; post almost daily but mainly because most people (more than likely) don't read my posts &amp; some people don't ask me any questions.Not everything you see is what It seems to be.If my post is too long to read for you - just simply ignore it instead of sending me another super short message

I’m on reddit only because I want to find a friend – life can be tough and we don’t always get what we want.

I used to have so called „friends” but..they’re no longer in my life.Why? I don’t know but let me tell you one thing – A true friend would never just give up on you for no solid reason.What kind of friend would I like to meet on reddit? What are my expectations?

I would like to meet someone in a similar situation – why? Because I honestly feel like only a person with the same expectations and a similar outlook on life would get along with me. I want to talk to other people on a daily basis mainly because..I want to see someone’s effort and because I don’t want to feel like someone’s last option! Not again.Just to make things clear – I’m NOT forcing anyone to talk to me and I’m fully aware that not everyone has enough time to talk to others often and I know one more thing – not everyone wants to talk to other people on a daily basis which I completely do – UNDERSTAND.I often feel misunderstood by people who read my posts.People always giving me unwanted advice and criticising me are just wrong..I’m not a needy person! What I’m simply suggesting is that It’s always possible to find someone to have a random conversation with – someone willing to send you one message once or twice a week..but..It’s almost impossible to find people willing to make time for you.I’m not asking a busy person to make time for me by changing some plans! Absolutely! I’m here to find someone who wants to talk daily (throughout the day or maybe even night) of one’s own will.Someone looking for the same kind of connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their ""friends"" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you. I have a lot of free time (I don't want anyone to send me a message only out of sympathy or boredom though - friendships shouldn't be forced) so..send me a message only If you want to talk often and If you're a talkative person) I'm not really interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful messages. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.

• I do NOT respond to any „Hey,hmu” or „u want to talk” type of messages (super short messages or messages full of abbreviations – I literally can’t stand abbreviations and acronyms in text messages)

&amp;#x200B;

• I don’t talk to people underage and people way older than me (If you want to know why I just don’t feel comfortable talking to kids and people old enough to be my parents – especially online) 18-35 age range (I'm 26)

&amp;#x200B;

• I’m not on reddit to get something off my chest or to find someone to talk to from time to time so If you’re too busy to talk to me or don’t want to talk often..just don’t contact me - I'm not trying to be rude - I just don't want to feel like someone's last option again - I've had enough of ""busy friends"" which is why now I'm looking for something different

&amp;#x200B;

• I’m not looking for a relationship or someone to flirt with so If you want to be „more than friends” find someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

• I don’t respond to messages I don’t find interesting which is why I DON’T mind being ghosted by people who think I’m not „for them” being ghosted after exchanging one or two messages doesn’t bother me.What bothers me is being ghosted by someone I like.Being ignored by someone after days or weeks of daily conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

• I want to talk on reddit first just to make sure If we’re a good match.I’m also not interested in group chats

&amp;#x200B;

• I would rather talk to someone from Europe because Europe is my continent (similar timezones) but even If you’re from the US (for example) but have enough time to talk often –you can send me a message.I just don’t want to wait any longer than 6 or 7 hours to receive a single message that can be typed in a few seconds – max minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Why can’t you see any of my interests listed down below? Because what really matters to me is..who you are (If you’re honest,talkative,understanding,caring and trustworthy – for example) just simply – It matters to me what you’re like! not what you like.Don’t get me wrong – you can tell me what you like or dislike but in my personal opinion common interests are important mainly when you want to find a gaming buddy on reddit (for example) or If you want to meet someone to hang out with in real life and..go bowling for example.What most redditors seem to care about are common interests – I don’t. I get along with other people despite having completely different hobbies but I absolutely don’t get along with people way different than me (different exceptations and outlook on life – some aspects of life – way different sense of humor or personality traits – It’s just an example)

Let me tell you one more thing „why does she have more/different expectations than other people?” Dear people – We ALL can choose what kind of people we’d like to talk to and maybe even become really good friends with and I? I don’t want anyone to be disappointed.We all have some expectations after all.(there are people out there looking for someone to play games with – for example – and I’m not one of them)I’ve met a lot of people forcing themselves to talk to me or talking to me out of boredom and I don’t want to experience anything of that nature ever again.Friendships should be natural – not forced.Both people wanting to be friends should feel comfortable and have something in common.

I'd rather talk to someone in a similar situation.Someone friendless..Don't get me wrong - most people deserve to be happy and It's good to have friends but people who have friends in real life are usually more focused on them &amp; have less time for others.Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on.Sometimes I feel like the only friendless &amp; rejected person in the world.I love warm-hearted people.Sensitive people who always try to understand others.Empathy is everything but please don’t send me a message if you’re another person in a different situation just willing to „help” me.

Imagine never getting any messages from others..always waiting for someone to text you..waiting &amp; waiting..spending most of your time at home (not by choice) I really wish I had at least one person in my life.One person who would make me feel important.If you really need someone to talk to due to loneliness and If you have time to talk to me daily (throughout the day and even night)I always make time for others.I'm literally always available.I could even stay up all night long only to talk to someone  I’m ready to commit but only If there’s some chemistry between me and someone else.I don’t do anything forcefully.

If you want to talk to me tell me your story - tell me why you're on reddit,what kind of friend would you like to meet :)et cetera

One more thing.I’m not looking for any advice – If you don’t want to talk just ignore my post or even block me but don't judge me and don't suggest me to change only because of you disagreeing with me.I'm not hurting anyone by being who I am and I'd never change for someone who doesn't even know me. I don't need more criticsm in my life or..sadness.",lonely,"I'd love to meet someone new.Someone willing to talk daily &amp; someone talkative.I'm sick of people's lack of effort :( I'm not here out of boredom and I want to make long term friends.If you're friendless,talkative,honest and want to talk daily - send me a message.Don't wanna wait hours for a message",2022-01-03 08:40:41

I recently started studying at an university and almost all of our classes are online and hence I haven't had the opportunity to really acquaintance myself with anyone. I also moved to a small studio apartment away from my parents and it just sucks living here in a city and having no friends to go out with. I'm too socially anxious to visit a bar by myself and yet I have no one to invite out. I've tried looking up some hobbies and meet ups at my city but there seems to be none that would be aimed for my age group, which is early 20s.

I also feel that I'm way too different from everyone else. I'm very much into classic rock and music in general but my classmates really don't care about music more than on surface level. I've always been interested in more masculine things despite being a woman and I just can't seem to strike up any interesting conversation with other people despite my attempts at being interesting and listening to them. I like reading and writing and nerdy stuff.

It just sucks not talking to anyone for days sometimes. I only talk to my parents. I feel like I'm going crazy over here. Music is pretty much the only thing bringing me comfort at the moment.

I'm really lonely i have the motivation to talk but I'm afraid he isn't interested, i don't wanna do anything that would come off as desperate if he is.

I have not achieved anything that based upon I could call myself exceptional in any field. I fell like atleast everyone has achieved something to show off, every close friend in my circle seem to have done something atleast. I feel like i am the most normal person. I am also very ugly looking and it just makes me feel down everytime. Today I was writing diary on my past 2 years and i feel more down now, just 2 years have passed and I could not do a single thing worthy or productive, i have just fallen behind in my studies when I should have focussed more as this year is very crucial for my life. I use to talk to a girl and even had crush on her but yesterday she told me indirectly that she kind of doesn't like talking with me often and i think so all this time I was just irritating her so I have just decided not to talk to her as I just don't want to add to her problems as she has allready many but she did tell me that I am a real help in her troubling times, so I just let her know that i will always be available to her whenever she needs me. But now I miss her a lot. I feel like I am only and only sorrounded by problems and trying to come out just pushes me deeper into more problems and depression. 
Today whole day I have spent thinking about all my life that I have lived and I just feel like I have existed for no good. I feel like crying my heart out and dissapearing out in thin air like i have never existed. The only thing that seems to be helping me out are songs, books and reddit and that's why I am posting my thing here. 
So if possible maybe just share your positive thoughts and if you are also a introvert like me going through problems and need help, just DM me and maybe we could help each other out by listening and understanding to each other.

I had already been living there for for about 2.5 years bc I don’t really have anyone besides my mom and she comes with a long list of toxic behaviors as well so one day I just packed my things and left.. 2021 was the year my girlfriend and I were finally starting to settle into adult life and figure out our wants/needs in the world when this happened. We were kicked out so abruptly without notice so we were very unprepared and neither one of us has ever been homeless before.. 😞 Her family simply said “we can’t stand to see yalls relationship and watch you be affectionate, we do not support it” . My birthday is on the 10th and i’ve never felt more depressed, unworthy, and suicidal in my life… For the past few months i’ve been so excited about turning 21 and now everytime I think about it I cry uncontrollably and go into a whole breakdown. I suffer from bipolar 1, severe anxiety and severe depression with psychosis… So the stress of being homeless has really been taking a toll on me both physically and emotionally. I never really had birthday parties or close friends to celebrate with growing up and for the last few months i’ve been planning and saving up so I could make my day special for ME and treat myself and now I can’t 😞 Im so heartbroken.. We spent our last $100 this week on a storage unit so we would have more space to sleep in our car but i can’t even sleep. i can’t think straight. all that is on my mind is death. 2021 was the year I became a lash tech and started my own business and now because we are homeless I had to put a pause to all my hard work which means no money on my end… I have no one to talk to, no family, no friends, my girlfriend is under so much stress with this and STILL finding the strength to go to work everyday and I feel like such a burden to her. I feel so worthless. so lonely. so depressed. I don’t want to burden her anymore with my problems but i don’t feel like I can go on any longer.. I feel so alone and im so so sad I won’t get to celebrate my birthday 😞 It may not mean a lot to some people but when you come from a family that doesn’t care to make you feel special on your big day, it means a lot when you grow up and can do for yourself… I feel so lost and confused.. I don’t know how to go on. We’ve been surviving off of lunchables and we’re on our last $10 and we still have to make sure we have gas in our car😞 Not to mention we haven’t showered in days.. which just feeds more into my depression.

I’m here to ask for some help, as I’m not sure if I should get to the point where I am bringing this up with my friends/family.

For short background, I do not have a history of a bad or lonely life for the most part. Not a great childhood but many people have had it much worse for sure. I am a recent college graduate from and a former D1 track athlete who ended college on a good note career wise. I still run and am in the process of trying to compete in higher levels. This is not to brag or anything, but I’m starting to realize that my lifestyle has kind of masked symptoms anxiety and depression. This is not to say that I am depressed (I try to be very careful when using that term), but I’ve felt very lonely and sad for the past 6months or so. Luckily I have not been impacted from a physical standpoint. Because I still train,I know I need to continue eating well, and practicing good habits. It has been harder though.

I do not think I’m depressed. But I’m unsure because I truly do feel terrible. Running track is probably one of the only things that keep me at peace, even if it is going out in the freezing rain to run. 

It’s hard to really chat to anyone about this or anything in general. I feel like I just don’t connect well with people my age. I keep asking myself what must be wrong with me for people to not answer or care to have conversations about anything but… I don’t know. I’m quite lost at this point.

4724,DG-Spikes,1641111012,1,"It's hard for me to know what all to say aside from how lonely I've felt the last few years. This recent holiday season really hit me hard. I've been recovering from being in a mentally/verbally abusive relationship for over 3 years. During that time I lost the majority of my friends due to how controlling my ex was and the few I have now are more like acquaintances. The one person I was close with had the same struggle as myself and we'd always lean on each other for support when we were having hard times. Sadly her depression got the best of her and I lost my best friend a few years ago. 

I miss having someone close to talk to, someone who relates and understands how I'm feeling and what I've been through. I miss traveling and sharing moments with someone. I've tried meeting new people but they've all been more concerned about superficial shit or wanting to sleep around. I'm not into those types of people. 

With how society is today and how rude, shallow, and greedy most people are, I just want to live in a calm and peaceful place and be around good genuine people.

There's more to my story. I just miss having a close friend I can trust because I don't just open up to anyone. I don't allow anyone to touch me unless I'm fully comfortable with that person. I long to find a woman that relates and is a kind, sweet soul that can help me feel at peace.",lonely,I feel like a complete mess.,2022-01-02 19:10:12

It's always been the same with me, I'm surrounded by people that love me that's true for sure, but they all have someone as well.
I don't complain and I feel deeply lucky that I have the people in my life, I tell them that everyday and they say it back to me, I know there's a deep love there...
But I still don't ever feel *that* type of connection, everyone around me seems to find those connections, even my one friend that always used to be in the same boat as me found someone that completes them but I've never felt that, or if I have (which I don't know anymore), it's never reciprocated.

I've been in relationships, but I always tend to be the giver as I believe vulnerability to be one amazing quality in people and I adore people that do it, but it's so hard... To never find someone to... Click.

I just... Want what I see my parents having, what I see my siblings sharing with their partners, what all my friends have found for years already. I just want a partner, someone to be myself, to show myself and feel accepted at full, someone I can accept as well.

Every year that goes by I grow a little bit colder, a little bit more cynical and sour, I don't want to but it happens, and I'm afraid I'll get to 30 without ever feeling that complicity, that sincronicity with someone, that inexplicable connection that only we understand... But every year I believe it a little less and I'm afraid I will someday just stop believing altogether.

pure bullshit, if u are 18 and still haven't kissed thats a red alarm, that's like doctors telling you that you have cancer or sth, and you should hurry and do whatever it takes to stop this abomination.

like if ur parents notice ur virgin and kissless at 18, they should panic and cry and quit their job and gather for emergency meeting and do something about it.

4821,DreamerDoge,1641076530,1,"TLDR: What is a local food, doesn't have to be where you are from, that doesn't appear to be popular else where but should? Whether that's because it's easy to make or just that good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did not find any rules saying I couldn't try this so I'm going to give it a go. After browsing this sub quite often, it seems to me this is mostly a place where people vent into the void (I've done this) about being lonely but continue to isolate themselves (also me). 

I think usually a shared sense of loneliness is not enough to start meaningful interactions as you don't really get a feel for what that person is actually like. Equally, while cathartic, it's can be a bit depressing and you guys are more than this horrible feeling. 

The idea? Talk about anything else. Something dumb and unimportant but somehow interesting or controversial. Best biscuit, best type of bread, whether/when you should butter your sandwiches, etc. Essentially something you don't realise you care about or differ from others on until you think about it. 

I hope that this can break the ice and maybe make someone feel a little less lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

The question: What is a food that you have locally, or if you know another place's local food, that doesn't appear to be popular else where but should? Whether that's because it's easy to make or just that good. 

&amp;#x200B;

My food is flapjacks. My understanding is, while Americans sometimes call pancakes flapjacks, only a couple other countries have what the British consider to be a flapjack. The closest thing if you don't have them is probably an oat bar.

Essentially it's butter, golden syrup and sugar melted and then mixed with oats. It's pressed down into a cake tin, baked and then cut into squares like a brownie. Again like brownies it often is a bit squishy before it cools however in general it does crumble a bit more. 

It's buttery and sweet but with that oaty edge. You can make them yourself but you often get them packaged here individually like biscuit and cake bars - it's the kind of thing you find in vending machine. Flapjacks aren't the best but it's very simple, cheap and quick so I'm honestly very surprised that it's not more widespread. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not wanting other people get close to me was one the things that I’ve been doing.When depression takes over completely I don’t want to be close to any human being.Also with having friends etc I felt a bit sorry for disappearing for months etc.

I feel like over the years I’ve developed this thing where I don’t like when a person starts to depend on me or get close to me.I feel like that’s a result of my depression because my mind feels like what If my depression starts going crazy some time later and I won’t be able to keep up with that person,so in my mind it was better to be all by myself and not let anyone in.

4852,StanPhoenix1987,1641062206,1,"Hi all.  I'm new to Reddit so if you can reply that'd be great, even just to let me know I've posted in the right place.

So, as I'm posting here you'll be able to guess that I'm extremely lonely and looking for advice.  A bit about me though to start with:

So I'm currently 34, from the UK.  I served 12 years in the Royal Air Force and am now a teacher.  I'm an only child and, growing up, I didn't really have any truly close friends.  Even now, I only have 3 or 4 true close friends, but still only see them very rarely due to work and life getting in the way. 

As for relationships, in the past I have had a few, none particularly serious or long-lasting.  That was until I got married.  All seemed to be going well.  We even had a child together.  But, like with previous relationships, the marriage ended too.  That was 7 years ago now, and I've been single and lonely ever since. 

I know what love feels like, I've experienced it.  I want nothing more than to experience it again.  I've tried dating apps; two matches in 5 years, one said nothing, the other only messaged to apologise for swiping the wrong way.  I've tried meeting people on nights out, at parties, events, activities, etc too.  No one is interested.  I've had women call me alsorts; weirdo, freak, ugly, probably more insults than you can think up.

Anyway, I know I've got some things going against me.  I'm not exactly attractive, I'm somewhat of an introvert, and I struggle with social interactions like flirting, body language, facial expressions, etc.

I do have some good things going for me though.  Being that I'm not good looking I've spent most of my life becoming a good person.  

Unfortunately, no one seems to care about good people any more.  The world all seems so superficial to me.  

Any thoughts or ideas out there on how or where I might have some luck meeting people?",lonely,I Hate Being Lonely - It's Killing Me Inside,2022-01-02 05:36:46

It was not intentional and now I feel awful and the worst part is I reply back without reading the full text . She was joking about having covid and then at the end of the text wore about happy new year and I guess what she grateful for . I guess she rly mad at me bc she didn't even text me happy new year ...

4888,JustEuthanizeMe,1641047492,1,"Granted, there’s only 3 people in my life at this point and one of them I’m pissed at because she doesn’t talk to me anymore. Point is it’s not massively exceptional to be angry at 3 people at once but I can’t fucking put into words how deep the rage for them is.

Two most prominent right now are my mum and her fucking pathetic husband. I was forced to move back in with her at the start of the year when my depression lost me my job, and I’ve fucking regretted not just accepting homelessness ever since. Those two people people got together, they became a fucking cancer. A fucking black tar pit of all humanity’s most repulsive traits. 

Had a massive fight with my mum about an hour ago cause she apparently had absolutely no choice but to make some totally unnecessary anti-Semitic comment that was based on literally nothing (they both have increasingly white-supremacist ideals that have only increased since they met). She knows full well shit like that makes me uncomfortable and that I won’t ever agree, so I can’t think of any reason to say it other than to start a fight. Then I do lash back, and she turns into the fucking shocked Pikachu meme, and acts like she’s a victim. Then they both go into the kitchen and whisper about me when they think I’m outta earshot cause they’re the most pathetic cowards I can imagine. Fucking Peter Pettigrew looks like Steve Rogers compared to these fucking wastes of oxygen.

And then I’m stuck with a slow-burning, boiling under the surface kinda fucking rage towards my ‘friend’. Don’t think I can even use that term in inverted commas anymore. She was the only ‘friend’ I’ve ever actually had, but I guess I’m also realising that it was never really a friendship and that fucking pisses me off too. 

I get that I’m not easy to be friends with. No one ever really tried until she did, for good reason. But I told her over and fucking over the reality of who I was and what I’m actually like. And she was adamant that she “wouldn’t ever leave”. But if course, after the self-harm, the drinking, the suicide attempt and me getting feelings for her, I pushed her to her limit. That makes sense to me, those were the choices I made and I can live with that, her leaving was the expected outcome.

What I didn’t expect is for her to string me along for some fucking reason I can’t figure out. After I told her I had feelings for her, something every obviously changed. We only saw each other in person one time after that, when we’d text, I’d barely squeeze 5 replies outta her before she’d leave me on read for like a month. Again, thats what I expected, things get weird, we stop talking. 

But the part I really don’t fucking get is why the fuck she’d keep actually texting back after a month. I rarely initiated conversations, occasionally I did, but mostly I wanted the ball to be in her court. And she texted pretty much every month without fail, just outta the blue. But then she’d seem super uninterested in actually having a conversation, then leave me on read for another almost as soon as we start talking.

After she did that enough, I was confused enough to just ask her outright what the fuck was going on and she acted like things were the same as they’d always been. Said nothing was wrong at all. But it clearly fucking was, we used to text for hours. But if she didn’t wanna be friends at all, then why bother texting at all, especially if I’m not? It’s fucking infuriating, I don’t get it. And then the last time we spoke was after I asked if she wanted to hang out again cause I was in town, she “forgot” to reply, and then we had a short conversation where she left me on read again and that was the last I’ve fucking heard from her. That was 7 months ago.

She’s also sent me a “merry Christmas” text every year since we met and I didn’t get one this year, so I’d assume between that and the 7 month guess I’m just left to assume she’s finally let it die. It just fucking infuriates me that she wasn’t just honest when I asked her outright. Apparently I meant so little to her that she would rather make me constantly second guess for like a year whether I even still had a friend and lie to me, instead of making herself slightly uncomfortable for the duration of one fucking conversation where she just told me the truth to save me from having to go through that. That’s just fucking disrespectful, and I get that I’m fucked up, but I was pretty upfront about that from the beginning cause this was exactly the situation I was trying to avoid and she was the one who was too stubborn to listen at the time.

I just fucking hate people, and being this fucking angry at everyone in my life is making me wanna fucking cut myself all over but I can’t even do that anymore cause I can’t stand looking at the scars it leaves. Fucking hate being on this bullshit fucking planet.",lonely,"I feel burning, overwhelming, furious rage at everyone in my life",2022-01-02 01:31:32

I’ve kinda been struggling these last few weeks. There are multiple reasons for this all of which aren’t really serious issues but nevertheless it still does bother me. 
A) academic pressure and a new environment since I’ve recently joined college.
B) having all these thoughts about how lonely I am because I don’t have anyone by my side who I can share stuff with.
C) dealing with my insecurities about how I look, speak.

I decided to write this here hoping maybe one of you could help me out if you’ve ever been through similar struggles. I’m sorry if most of my words don’t make any sense. Thanks for reading anyway, really does mean a lot.

Now don't get me wrong I have basically 0 friends outside this group so it still so much better than nothing. But..felt like an outsider like always as I always feel bit intimidated when I see them in a group like tight knit one and feel hesitant to approach sometimes and end up standing in the corner and they just think that I'm the kind the person who doesn't interact as much is chill with himself too most times. And at this point this has become a personality trait. That are other things like me not knowing how to drive or not having good dressing sense or not knowing what drinks to get if you ask me to go buy some as I always have other people in the group do all the work basically making me feel like a child who can't do anything by himself. But more importantly I feel like I have killed every passion outside just recreation stuff and feel like a parasite completely reliant on the same 3-4 people who keep taking me on trip with them and like if they ask me to bring a friend at any point I wouldn't have any other friends. They are lovely people though. They are not in my work city or my hometown, so now when going back either of them all I can think about is be depressed about being able to return back to normal life.

4904,Glum_Performance4701,1641032165,1,"Hey everyone I hope a lot of people read this (I just wanna feel heard and maybe even understood) let’s begin 

It’s actually quite an impressive streak I’ve been shockingly able to keep up since high school and I’m 19 now. I consider myself a confident person very much in my looks at least, I have a lot of self love like a lot I care for myself, love and admire myself and really enjoy own passions and creativity and my own personality at times even. 

I have adhd, anxiety, and depression episodes and my mental illnesses are very visible at times and It’s funny because I’m suffering so much inside and outsiders see me as awkward, rude, lazy, stupid, slow, etc. and when this feeling follows you everywhere you go despite my confidence I can’t help to think if I actually am the problem? What if I’m actually flawed. 

In my relationships with boys I feel like they’re always left me and I say boys because I’ve never been with a man consider, I’m 19, the boys from my generation are actually fucking demons anyways. I don’t date but of course there’s times when I will find someone attractive/ cool and give it a chance and the last time I tried to date things were good, I thought he was really attractive, he thought I was too. We made each other laugh and smoked together and even we had a sleepover and went to the beach the next day and after dropping me back home a few days later he ghosted me (we did not sleep together ever).  It was summer time, I was fine or I thought I was. I felt close to nothing (honestly) I didn’t care, If anything I only cared about the fact that he could say that he “played“ me (my ego is speaking now)

Anyways the guy was Indian and really nice at first. This give me an OBSESSION with Indian guys and guys who are super sweet to me like super bad. And like I said I don’t date (and really because my standard be too high and I don’t meet individuals I find cool to date often) so I get desperate at times we’re all humans and we have needs and I especially crave the emotional part of it all. 

I’m lonely we’re all so lonely especially these days. I find myself on chating sites. Pathetic chating sites where it’s just horny old men anyways I always set the region to India. And like a week ago I met this boy he’s 18 and he was cute! Like so innocent cute and we started chating , sexting at first (that’s the vibe of the site) then I sent him a picture of my face and he was obsessed. I obviously loved the attention and I gave him my telegram and we were chating a few days, it was so nice like sooo nice I just loved having someone to text, say goodnight, tell good morning, tell him he’s handsome and ask how was their day, I asked him so many things about him and he asked about me. We’re two teenagers from across the world it’s pretty fucking cool to me asking questions. 

And it’s pathetic I know it’s a random human but he was sweet and I love sweet men but anyways He’s been trying to call me but I get very anxious like so crazy anxious and I didn’t want to. He told me so many times please just answer for a little and that bothered me because I felt he wasn’t respecting me saying no but he felt that I wasn’t being a good friend by answering even for a little he was saying even just 10 seconds. He called a few times and after me declining them, He texted Take care Laila I will remember you throughout my life, bye. 

How did yet another boy leave me dude it’s just fucking crazy man like i just must be so pathetic and worthless for this to keep happening I feel so empty and alone and I’m an only child. This feeling has existed for a WHILE now. He’s a random boy he doesn’t care for me or anything he just ghosted me like what the fuck. 

I cant get over it. I must be so insignificant to peoples lives that they find it so easy to discard me. I literally cried so much, I feel so alone.

4908,Modern_Bummer_Blues,1641029866,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has leaft little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 3rd! ( Just one left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. I'm currently working on 4 papers for finals week. It would be great to find some good company.

I kept trying to tell him that it was not only because of that but because no one reached out to me to wish me a happy New Years. It seemed like he didn’t even listen to me and kept trying to argue with him. I am sleeping in the other bedroom tonight as I am so upset and am shutting down.

The past several months he just stopped caring and trying and I put up with the bs. He seriously never put time into us, maybe I’d see him once or twice a month but sometimes I just wouldn’t see him. We don’t live in the same city but we live less than 1.5 hours apart, so there really aren’t excuses. Anyway I hit my breaking point when he failed to come for Christmas (he never invited me to anything), I blew up and he got mad at me for being upset because he “had to finish a project”. He ended up saying later on a call that he wanted to break up with me/was trying to break up (at that moment) and all this other horrible stuff about me. We talked the next day and he completely backtracked and said he didn’t know what he wanted and I’m stupid so I dealt with it. This past week he built me up and then tore me down repeatedly as I told him to figure shit out (I know I should have just ended things). Well it’s New Year’s Eve and he hadn’t said anything so I text him saying I need to know, and so he just texts me back saying we’re done. I feel lonely but it’s weird because it wasn’t like he was around much anyway. He didn’t even bother to come to my graduation (he didn’t bother to come to almost anything I invited him to).

I need people. I need to talk, to laugh, to have friends. I want to love, to be touched, to have a woman that has my back.

4941,RealisticSnow4555,1641018310,1,"So, this'll be hard to word adequately because I'm tired. But, I'm lonely. I mean, yes, I have a few people in my life who I see as friends, and I do have family which cares about me. That's more than some can say they have, and I'm not looking for sympathy. This is just me venting. I broke up with the person I was seeing for a year a few weeks ago, and it's been very hard adjusting. I'll make it a short explanation but the relationship was toxic and it didn't work out due to it being long-distance and the fact that it all degraded to petty arguments every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss the companionship that relationship brought. They understood me 100%, and loved me to death, and I loved them too. but the circumstances were too much for me to handle, and not being able to actually see them was a dealbreaker for me.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to be honest, it feels like I snapped after plans for a visit on my birthday were canceled. A few itmes prior we'd try and schedule a date, only for it to not happen. Each time a bit more of my sanity went away. That one time was what put me over the edge. I haven't been the same. I acknowledge it 100% yet I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I'm just sad that I'm beginning the year without them, or just somebody in general who I love. and I'm worried about their wellbeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I don' think I'll ever find another person who'll love me like they did. I look awful, and fundamentally I'm screwed up. I know it though. i'm not unaware of my very real flaws and mental problems.

And as such, there are many many posts in response to this stimulus...  And I, a human being, like each and every one of you similarly lonely people, have appeared, desiring to connect.  My desire is not entirely selfish.  I think that to be self-centered while wanting to connect to others will only defeat your purpose.  

There are hundreds of subscribers to this subreddit online right now, and there have been more in the past few hours.  I've reached out to some, with offers to listen, to be there, to connect, and to help.  That's the way I, personally, have felt was the best way that I could be of service and to not feel alone.  

Yeah... Let me tell you what I have experienced.  

I see some people get dismissed by others.  I see some people who are discriminative, or very selective in the kinds of connections they are willing to accept.  I see some people who are lonely but, for any one reason or another, insist that that is the reality that they deserve, or can only have.  

I wonder, do any of you hope for something better, to free yourself of this pain, inasmuch as is necessary to do something about it other than what you've done?  Do any of you want to make the year ahead, 2022, different, enough to do differently?  

I get it.  You're lonely.  I'm lonely too.  But it sucks.  And my loneliness is my fault.  I'm not so conceited as to believe that everyone else is to blame, and that my loneliness isn't a product of my own behavior in a way I don't understand.  And so I've tried reaching out, which is an action to which I am absolutely averse.  I've offered conversation and connection to some of the other OP's in this sub, and I've gotten nothing but silence, if not nasty retorts and rejections.  So I have to wonder... If some of you don't want to step outside of your lonely-ass selves... How do you hope to not be lonely?

I truly believe that some people cling to their misery.  

I'd love to hear some opinions.  I welcome the angry retorts.  You can tell me to go fuck myself.  Loneliness has me pretty-well fucked already, but I won't take your bitterness personally.

I'm 25 and I've been talking to a guy for about a month now and it's been going well.

In September of this year my best friend, a friend who was as good a friend to me as I was to him. Someone I considered my brother. He very sadly took his own life and it broke me. On some level, I do kind  of feel like I failed him, the last 3 months have been the hardest months of my life.

Except the New Years that I travelled to New York to spend New Years there and he was unable come because of his new girlfriend. But other than that, New Years was our night so tonight has been exceptionally hard for me.

I thought I had friends in two other people, people I had known for over 10+ years now, and they both knew about how hard tonight was for me as I had told them this week and I asked if we could hang out on New Years Eve and they agreed that we'd all hang out online for the night since they don't really do much anyway, they said they'd join me on Discord to hang. So I waited patiently til they could join me, they both have families and were waiting til they went to bed, so I messaged one. Asking when he'd be on discord, he said he was having a few games with two other friends. I didn't overly want to impose but suggested I could come along, he said ok but also that he won't be long anyway cause they'll be off soon. I told him I didn't have access to the discord server and then I was just, I don't want to use the word ignored but he stopped replying to me on messenger. Anyway I waited for an hour and thought, ""surely they're done"". I was sat in my shared discord server alone since around 9pm-ish logging off briefly when I restarted my PC.

I logged into League of Legends and saw them all in the same game together, and thought, surely it won't be long. And left them to it. Anyway it got to 4am and I was sat there, still on the same game, still sat on discord, no invites, no messages, no company on discord and not even a happy New Years. I decided to go to bed and watch a film. I'm going to be honest, I broke down, I felt abandoned and I felt like they really don't consider me a friend. I was thinking about my friend who passed and about how I miss that close of a friendship and about how I'm now more alone than ever. It's horribly impacting my depression. A large deciding factor in going to bed when I did was because I felt myself starting to get really sad and my mind was going to a dark place where I was beginning to consider ending it again. But I really needed to unload and that's why am here.

Thanks for getting through it if you did.",lonely,I just kind of want to unload.,2022-01-01 15:41:51

The most pathetic part of it all is that even after all was more or less set and done, I still called her. I even called her today. She doesn’t ever pick up, sometimes she answers with a text.. she’s told me before that she does it for me, because our relationship was unhealthy. 

But, in these moments I don’t care, I would take an actual knife to the chest just to be embraced by someone. I’ve tried looking for someone, but nothing ever works. I used to not think I was that hard on the eyes, now I think I must be a monster. I’m probably just making excuses for my own social ineptitude.. but still. I’ve gone outside, I’ve touched the grass, but still the only thing on my mind is how cold I feel inside. 

I hate when people say that I’ll find someone eventually, I just don’t believe it. And even if was supposed to find someone sometime in the future, I don’t think I’ll make it that far. I’ve had too much happen in my life, but if I just had someone there I could get through it. Now all I can think about is how cold the nights are and how bleak the future is.

I was still alone and I remember how it felt recent but was months ago when I was volunteering and putting myself out there. I looked into the distance and understood a little more. 

I remember how I interviewed for jobs, some very good jobs, for over a year without results, and then suddenly as I neared graduation, I started to sit alone and make flash cards of my interview stories, and I'd tape myself and recite my response in the interview format. If it was bad I'd redo it. Then my head would hurt and it would be the last thing I wanted to do but I'd flip another flash card and have a go, as that's an interview. It already wasn't fun processing my undergrad experiences and to describe it professionally, in addition to tailoring it to the position. So I started interviewing again, and I said the answers, and I started getting through all of them. One of my last final round interviews the interviewer said, wow you got all of it. Because I had a response for all the questions. They offered and I took another position. 

It's the same with having friends. I know what to do to make people feel cared, comfortable. I've read books, I just don't fully do it because it's too uncomfortable to put that effort into it when my heart is dying not to do it. I'm not at the stage where I can say I really want to change instead of ""wanting to change"" and not seeing I can put more effort.

When you’re really alone in life without someone special to love and hold and share life together with, your plans on special events and holidays and occasions tend to revolve around trying to just mentally endure it.

&amp;#x200B;

* New Years Eve  
*– here I sit here by myself...  again… alone...*  

* Birthday  
*– welp, made it through another year of life by myself… again...  alone...*  

* Valentines Day  
*– my yearly reminder that no one wants me and I must make it by myself... alone...*  

* Easter  
*– another easter by myself... alone…*  

* Independence Day (US)  
*– guess I’ll set off some bottle rockets by myself... alone…*  

* Halloween  
*– another Halloween by myself... alone…*  

* Thanksgiving  
*– another year to be thankful for the strength to endure life by myself... alone...*  

* Christmas  
*– yet another Christmas by myself... alone…*",lonely,"When you're alone, your 'plans' for holidays and special events are to mentally survive them.",2022-01-01 12:58:25

5055,thecherryflower,1640998139,1,"I attended my niece's birthday party the day after Christmas. Hadn't seen my extended family in a long time. I was able to wear a dress (that I hadn't worn in YEARS - tbh I didn't think I'd ever be able to wear it again). I got so many compliments that day.

My aunt - my mom's brother's wife (she's in her early 60s) noticed right away how much weight I lost. It was the first time someone has ever come to me for weight loss advice! She is significantly overweight and wanted to change her life. She said to me:

""What have you been doing? You look incredible. Also...there's something different about your face - it's glowing!""

My soul delighted upon hearing that. I shared with her my experience, emphasizing that it really is about diet and finding a type of exercise that you really enjoy. For me, I began walking over the summer and I never looked back. I hated the gym, doing pilates, any other floor exercise because nothing stuck for me. I never entertained the idea of specific diets (such as keto, etc.) because in my opinion, they are not sustainable. I wanted to establish a lifestyle change.

I started 2021 at just over 180 lbs (I'm 5', 28 years old) and ended this year at 147 lbs (I went from clinically obese to a normal BMI). I couldn't be any prouder of myself. I never thought I'd be able to lose my weight. For some reason, it seemed like a far off dream. I knew though that I deserved to look and feel my best. I was tired of declining social invitations, clothes not fitting me (my mom's clothes didn't fit me either), dreading the stores and having to try on clothes because I knew nothing would fit, walking up the stairs and feeling short of breath, feeling unattractive, etc.

And so...I got to work with these results to finish off this year! I'm still not at my goal weight yet. I'm aiming for 120 lbs (which hopefully I can accomplish in 2022). I've also been going to church a lot and focusing on my spirituality (to help with my self-esteem), thinking about hobbies I'd like to pursue this new year (I'll be tutoring for Kumon, and partaking in flower design - like making flower garlands/bouquets/flower crowns, etc. My dad's secretary does this for a hobby and is willing to teach me! I'm so excited!

Career is still being sorted out - but I know in due time I will have a job (a medical residency) at some stage in 2022. I finished medical school in 2019 and have been back home with my parents since. I've had great difficulty with my board licensing exams. This year I failed one of them and am studying to re-take it in Mid-January. Gonna make sure I kill it this time.

One of my best friends embarked on her self-love journey earlier on (you never really finish because it is for life). She told me that even people who were considered ""more successful"" - fancy titles, high-powered positions/social status, affluent, etc. noticed the glow she exuded. They wanted to know what she was doing. Isn't that interesting?

She even said something that really resonated with me: That most people/our society is very ""success""-oriented. Placing our worth and value on those external measures of success - Awards/accolades/honor/fame/power/prestige/high degrees, etc. but not enough on growth/personal development/self-love. The latter three (and other areas in this particular realm) are what people neglect. Either because they are not self-aware or any other reason. This is why MOST people are/remain dissatisfied with themselves/their lives because they haven't looked inward. This is the true, deep and soulful work that enriches our lives and gives us meaning.

One of the biggest lessons I learned in 2021:

Self-love/contentment/fulfillment is INDEPENDENT of your employment/relationship status (which society places so much emphasis on). It truly is an inside job and it's a daily work in progress. And remember, what really defines you? It's your heart and character. When you have true peace and contentment (no matter what stage you're in), NO ONE can take that away from you. I truly believe this peace comes from God above all else. Now that I'm rooting myself in Him, and holding on to God as my anchor...my life is transforming before my very own eyes.",lonely,"When you work on yourself, there's a certain glow about you. When you cultivate self-love, there's a light in you that other people could only DREAM of grasping/comprehending. It's intangible and elusive to them.",2022-01-01 11:48:59

And I don't know if that triggered some abandonment trauma that I have, or that I eated a lot and triggered some anxiety; but I started walking a lot and thinking nobody loved me, nobody cared about me, I almost started crying, and I started to have a pain in my head... 

I don't know, I feel really disconnected from myself and from people, and that makes me feel really lonely because I'm already losing a lot of friends cause I'm kinda depressed...

Sorry guys I needed to get my feeling out. 

This year was a bad year for me, was really depressed, to the point I was in bed laying there, without wanting to do anything, I didn't care about life or die. But now I kinda feel better, I have some goals and do some exercise, and eat healthier...

But I don't want to let this little anxious moment take this year progress... I know I have a long way to be good, but it's ok, this is my owm path.

I don't know when, but I know I want to feel more connected to myself and other people... because living like this... sometimes... it's a burden.

5079,imaloneallthetime,1640995110,1,"This realization has been a long time coming, and it just clicked on christmas, that the biggest thing that gets to me, is that to no one in my life, am I anybody's 'person.' My brother and his girl have each other, my parents have each other. My cousins and aunts and uncles and grandparents all have a person to whom they hold the most affection. My friends have wives and friends that have lasted since they were children.   


I've had people in my life who have been that for me frequently in the past, but it always fell apart for one reason or another, or time and life separated us, and they didn't feel the need to attempt to continue to be important in each other's. I have gone from group to group looking and being the best friend/partner I can be for however long life permits us to be together. Then my life got bad, things went sideways,  and then the pandemic hit. It's not as if I have no friends or family, I do, and for that I am incredibly thankful. It's just that all of them are each other's people, I am, once again, the odd one out.   


I just want closeness of thought and emotion that I see other people have. It's not that I don't offer or attempt, I send messages and well wishes, I post to our group chats and discords, I send them music and art I think they would like, and I attempt to organize hangouts, and I listen attentively to anything they need to talk about. It never becomes more than that with anyone though, and not one of them cares to listen when I have an issue I could use an ear for.  


All I want in life, is one person, that thinks of me like I think of them. Who thinks when they see something cool, 'I have to send this to HIM!' or 'ah I should ask HIM to lunch at the new noodle place he would love it.' I don't want sex, I don't want money, I don't want marriage or toys or vacations. In the words of Phoebe from friends.

5083,Ok-Manufacturer-5746,1640994780,1,I just keep having the worst time with life and the more I find out about things the more of a struggle it is to the point I dont enjoy anything anymore - and its been a very long time of that... many years. And I dont see the point in trying anymore or to make money to buy stuff because it doesnt make me feel good at all or any power as therapists have said it should. My family did a real number on me to make it that way. I really need someone to talk to. Ive lost all my friends but also Im very draining because things never get better despite putting the effort in. Im also at a point in this long term depression that notions to just be positive are actually toxic as I did that for a long time and it destroys your sense of self when its done long term. Like you cant make decisions and goals because you dont know what you want as you just have been telling other people what they want to hear and you never expressed your unhappiness. Its important (so Im told) for me to stay true to my feelings and not be pressured to say Im ok when Im not. But I totally understand not wanting to hear any of this. Im estranged from family because of a lot of physical and emotional abuse and theyre the type whom just want to deny any mental health issues despite theyre swimming in them but cant deal with even light criticism. But everything just circles back to wishing I was never born because then I wouldnt be suffering for the majority of my life - I really dont want to wake up anymore. Im not in an upset headspace this is how I feel when calm and help for suicidal ideation seems to revolve around that and just calming the person down through observation and then letting them go back to their shit lives that they cant stand - where I feel the exact same. Because its not all about the family upbringing. I just want someone to tell me what job I can get that doesnt rely on nepotism and socializing and ass kissing to succeed and make a lot of money so I can live alone somewhere nice. Even remotely. Owning property is all Id like so I can be a hermit.

Because it’s like everyone around you at least has someone they *want* to spend NYE with, and no one wants to spend it with you. The situation doesn’t change, it’s the same every year. I’ve never even been invited to a NYE party in my whole life. Parties sure; but no one cares enough about me to think ‘it’s NYE let’s invite her over’ as if you’re not special enough to spend that special occasion with them. It just fucking sucks, it’s like a shitty reminder every year. And I never really see it changing.

Or, someone who doesn't appreciate you. Am I lonely? Yes. Do I have a cat? Yes. Dies he love me? Debatable. But, I'd rather pour my love into loving my cat than try to keep a toxic ""friendship"", afloat with a dude who damn near destroyed my spirit and soul.

I’m still hoping and trying to find that one compatible friend despite all trials and errors lol so I thought, why not start with the basic, ask about your fav coffee ☕️ or how do you like to take it? What kind of coffee do you prefer (e.g., Americano, cappuccino, espresso, Turkish, etc)? 
To follow up with that question, if you had to pick on book to read with your coffee, what would it be and why? 

So briefly, and so you don’t have to spend more than 3 minutes of your precious time reading a long post: I’m from the west coast; Cali! So yeah, it’s still pretty early here now! Hmm, what else… before my 3 mins runs out! I’m 6’1” tall, black hair, greenish eyes, and Olive/tanned skin.

5198,JustEuthanizeMe,1640963880,1,"I literally find myself having daydreams about meeting new people, and I can’t even daydream about it without feeling immediately exhausted, and like I need to subtlety try to let them know, somehow, that I don’t have the mental bandwidth to care about another person or deal with all the bullshit that comes with having people in my life at all.

I just really can’t have anything to do with people at all. I have a grand total of zero people in my life right now, barring my fucking toxic as fuck family, but I don’t know they even count as people. Only ever had one friend, and since she finally let our communication die out only thing I think about her is that if I ever saw her again, how I’d tell her to fuck right off. Or maybe I’d just realise I don’t even have the energy to be angry anymore, my eyes would glaze over like they do so often now, and I’d just walk right past her, not even acknowledge her existence.

Guess it just feels shitty sometimes. I know I picked this, tried to make shit work with people so many fucking times that I know the loneliness is better than the alternative. All that people bullshit just doesn’t work for me, don’t see it ever working, based on all the experiences I’ve had. But yeah, guess picking loneliness isn’t exactly great either. Just the lesser of two absolutely fucked choices. Still miss sex sometimes, although I’m pretty sure I miss it more in theory, can’t remember ever having sex that didn’t feel like a chore at the time. Mostly think I just miss getting a hug. Still remember my last hug. That friend I had was drunk, came into the bar we both worked at to ask if I was coming out after my shift. Told her no. She protested, and eventually I changed my mind. Then she ran over and hugged me to celebrate. That was over two years ago.

Don’t know what broke in my fucking head to make me so goddamn anti-social that I literally can’t even imagine a conversation with another person without exhausting myself immediately, but what ever it is it must be well and truely fucked cause my mental bandwidth for social shit is non-existent non. Not 2 years of therapy or dozens of fucking medications can even help it at all, in fact it’s only gotten worse since I started trying to “fix” it. Guess I’m just supposed to be completely fucking alone.",lonely,Can’t even imagine meeting new people without immediately telling them to leave me alone,2022-01-01 02:18:00

5201,lonelyinlove121,1640963130,1,"Happy New Year to all of you here on this subreddit! I know that it's been a difficult year for most of us. Perhaps you lost a loved one to the pandemic. Or maybe became unemployed, homeless, went through a break-up or divorce, struggled financially, fell deeper into depression and anxiety, suffered an illness that has drastically affected your life... Many of us have been suffering in some way even before the pandemic. 

I know that this isn't a hopeful note to begin with but I want to acknowledge that many of us are here because we are suffering in some way. We feel deeply unhappy and isolated. It feels like there is some impenetrable barrier between us and others. We feel disconnected and alone. Some of us may be suffering from trauma. We might be spiralling into despair or consumed by a general sense of hopelessness and uncertainty about the future.

We cannot deny our experiences, nor our emotions in response to them, but I believe that we've got to have hope. The alternative is to choose complete and utter despair. A despair which obliterates any chance of purpose in the time we have left alive. A despair that renders living a completely mechanical and futile process; drawing breath, second by second, without purpose.

If I still believe that there is value in continuing to live, even if it's the fear of death, then I've got to have hope. Hope is often defined as a feeling. But for me, hope is a belief; a conviction that things will get better, and that I will survive whatever adversity comes my way. Like a lighthouse being battered by monstrous waves but continues to shine its light even if dimly. Hope is the belief that the worst will not destroy me. 

Whether the tidal waves of despair are in my mind or outside around me, I have faith in myself because I have made it this far. I have held my brother as he convulsed on the floor in pain, I have survived the sleepless nights of dark thoughts in my head, I have withstood feeling isolated and alone. 

I am still here in spite of all that has happened. And since you are here reading this, then it means that you have also survived. That is an undeniable fact. Hope does not mean that life will be all sunshine. It does not mean an end to loneliness and sadness. 

As long as we live, these emotions will continue to be part of our experience; the fabric of our lives. No one is happy 100% of the time. Chasing happiness is pointless. It's just a chemical rush swirling around in our brains, and then it's gone. I have found contentment to be much more attainable. From moment to moment, acknowledging that so long as I'm alive, possibility exists.

Contentment also requires some measure of self-acceptance. There may be things that you dislike, or even hate, about yourself but these things tend to fall into 2 categories: those you can change, and those you can't. The things that can be changed are not a permanent part of you. You can work on these things by yourself or with help from a counselor. The things that can't be changed, you've got to learn to accept because they will be part of you until your final breath.

Self-acceptance isn't a permanent state of being nor is it a completed work, hence why I said that you'll require **some measure** of it. Find contentment and you'll find peace. You may still feel lonely, but you'll be able to say to yourself, ""Yes, this is what I'm feeling. Yes, it hurts. But I'll be fine."" 

Finally, I'd like to note that nothing will change if nothing changes. If I want something to change in my life in 2022, then I can't continue to carry about my life in an identical way to 2021. If I make a change then, for better or for worse, I will see the difference.

Most of this post started off as a message to myself that I decided to share with you. I hope that it speaks to you too, and that we can see one another in 2022 living better, more fulfilling lives. Happy New Year everyone! May your year be filled with possibility, love, contentment, and hope.",lonely,Hope for the new year,2022-01-01 02:05:30

So this year I’m alone and I don’t see to be very good at handling it. I can’t tell anybody because I don’t wanna make my parents feel bad for me so I tell them it’s fine. I pretend it’s just a regular day and nothing special. But I feel like crying all day. So what do you guys who spent NYE alone do today that makes you feel good?

Tried to relax. Wanted to play my favourite game with a couple of friends. Couldn't get the private server to show up on the server browser, so no dice on that. Accidentally flared up at the mention of an extremely grindy game I despised, got yelled at.

5206,shinibunny_,1640959259,1,"It’s almost 11pm for me, on Dec. 31st. I’m completely alone, and I’ve been feeling completely alone for a while now. 

This month I went through one of the hardest times of my life. My parents and I had covid, and both of them were in the hospital for 2 weeks. I had to stay at their house alone with the pets to take care of them. I was extremely afraid of losing both of them, because they’re the only family I have. 

But 2 days after they came back home, my mother who was always abusive, treated me like shit because I could finally rest and I needed it so badly (I have depression, anxiety and ADHD, I get mentally drained easily) so I decided to not call them for a day. That was less than a week ago. Today was the first day my father decided to check on me, after a full week of not speaking to me, since he always leaves that to my mother.

I have a bf, but we’re LDR, and lately thing don’t seem to be going so well (could be a fase, idk). And I have no friends, and I mean NO friends. Yesterday I tried to breakup with my bf because I’m really considering “unaliving” myself, but he said that if I breakup with him or “do it” he will “do it” too. 

Besides what happened this month, this whole year was a shitstorm. So much bad stuff happened, I’d be here until next year (haha…) typing it if I decided to say it all.
