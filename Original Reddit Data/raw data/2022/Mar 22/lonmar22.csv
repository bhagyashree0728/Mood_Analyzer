I am seeing i am lacking behind in important events directly linked to job oppprtunities becuz i didnt have any social connections to even get informed and involved in it. I honestly have given up on social life(as my previous post just shines a light on how pathetic it is) but when i am seeing its directly effecting my future livelyhood its really concerning.

1,Fresh_Level_9093,1648730710,1,I now believe that I did something bad in a previous life because this can't be how my life will be.  Just a little bit about what happened. I met this girl on here and we hit it off.  She was everything I was looking for and more.  We talked everyday and it got to the point I was comfortable with sending her money( she had a medical condition that needed her meds). She didn't ask I offered. Sent her the money and everything was good. Then our of the blue we talking and I make a joke that I have made like 4 or 5 times and she never said anything about it being rude. If she would have saud anything i would have immediately apologized and never made the joke again. she then completely ghosted me saying I'm not the guy she thought I was.  Now I'm here wondering why does this keep happing to me.  Was it all a plot to get me to send her money or am I an asshole.,lonely,this is my life and it's my fault,2022-03-31 23:45:10
2,AwkwardSwapper,1648730595,1,"Erm, so the title kinda says it. But I guess here I m posting this. Hoping someone could give me their opinion on my situation and I guess some advise. Gonna leave this post up for a few days before I delete it. 

  
So just to give some context, I'm a 24M from Singapore, have had two major medically diagnosed depression breakdown (Been dealing with it for the past 7 years now). I don't really have a big circle of friends so I try my best to keep the small circle that I currently have. I'd say I've been the initiator of a lot of things that I do with my friends. Texting them to check up on them, organizing meals out ( 1 to 1 or in a group), inviting them over to my place and prepping &amp; cooking dinner for them, planning their birthdays and gifts. Mainly these things I guess.   


But as of late, I've just been so conflicted about them. If I don't reach out, or do all the planning and organizing and inviting, I seem to be invisible to them. That being said, they can take up to a week to just reply my messages. So I'm just conflicted if I'm not doing ""enough"" or if I'm a ""bad"" friend, or the worst case is that they don't want to be around me and remain friends.   


It just sucks to see them organizing shit (sorry mind my language) and whatever with other mutual friends and some that are in my friend group, and not treating me the same. Heck, all of them even forgot my birthday for the past 2 years while I kept brining them out and covering the bill for their birthdays.   


Sorry if things don't really link up. It's a little hard for me to process, link, and convey stuff in a more... structured manner when I'm opening up and venting. I'll be glad to clarify some things if needed.",lonely,Been contemplating posting about this for awhile now. Seeking some advise I guess.,2022-03-31 23:43:15

16,PurpleRazberry,1648715508,1,"I’ve felt incredibly lonely and gone through several month long depressive episodes over the course of last year. I’m in college, so this has even caused me to fail this semester purely because of how much class I’ve missed when I couldn’t get out of bed. 

For context: I am a femboy, this is an identity I’ve grown much more comfortable with over the past year and it’s a part of myself that I could no longer leave behind even if I wanted. My (now ex I guess) girlfriend was never supportive. She had even said she couldn’t be attracted to me. 

This made me feel so alone, yet I couldn’t imagine ending things. We still loved each other (we still do). There were some points that it felt like killing myself would be the easier option, and honestly the intrusive thoughts of doing so we’re becoming more and more frequent and it was scary. 

I had decided a few weeks ago that we need to end things for both of our sakes, I could tell she wasn’t happy with me either. We had plans to go together to prom when I was home in the summer, so I thought I should wait till then. Both because I didn’t want to make her go on her own, and because I didn’t want to do it over text. That would’ve been in April, and in hind sight definitely too far off. She brought it up the other night, and after some discussion we ended things and are remaining friends. 

For some reason I can’t help but feel less alone now, I feel free to be myself. Don’t get me wrong, I haven’t been able to sleep the past two nights and I feel dead on my feet. But part of me feels excited thinking of all the things Im free to do now that I wasn’t before. I finally started telling other friends about myself (that are back home, everyone up here knows) a bit before this, and they’ve been supportive. 

I still am a lonely person in general. I have very few friends, even less who care, and now no girlfriend. But it feels better, like maybe I can actually find someone who loves me for who I am.

Maybe this is too optimistic for this sub but I finally feel like I’m at the end of this, I can finally get better and finally be happy.

These four people get out of a bar and walk behind me. It was two guys and two girls. I was assuming they were couples. They were walking faster and I pulled to the side to let them pass and before they did, one of the girls looked at me and said disgusting with the others laughing then going ahead of me. I know some of you will think I was just being paranoid and they were talking about something else but due to being called names throughout most of my adult life, I know the difference between personal attacks, and people talking to each other without talking about me. This was as personal as it gets. All four of them were attractive. I'm this unattractive guy who looks even worse due to illness. I can't take this anymore. This is what happens when I go outside. People will say, they are just four jerks, ignore them. If it was just them I could ignore them but it's been so many people throughout my adult life.

All I've ever wanted in this world was love, not money, fame, cars, power, just simple love. 

What is the purpose of being alive without someone to share your life with¿ Even one sided love is better than the emptiness of existence. When you accept that you'll never truly have the one thing you want in life, your will to keep going gets snugged out just like that.

I guess I just don't have anything left in me, I feel like my insides are gone, like I'm hollow. 

People say ""it gets better"" or ""you're young give it time"" but there lies, it dosent get better, everyday is somehow worse than the last, just when you think things can't possibly hurt anymore, things somehow do.
One thing that never disappoints is pain, it's always there, always getting stronger until it breaks you.

I heard this quite recently that I've come to like a lot ""when a man meets a force he cannot destroy, he either submits to the pain or destroys himself.""
As of this moment, I think I've done both.

51,10kcrows,1648699288,1,"It's a long story but I need some advice so I'll try to keep it simple. For some reason I feel like this is the best place to ask this question, maybe because the people here really understand how painful loneliness is.

My ex dated me for a year. He was using me for my apartment because he doesn't want to rent his own place. He does this in all his relationships: he always dates women who he can move in with and mooch off of. He's very manipulative and he pretends to be in love but all he really cares about is getting what he wants. 

He found another place to stay in January so he broke up with me. Then when that didn't work out, he came back and is now pretending to love me again so he can live with me. He never will admit that this is what he's doing even though it's obvious.

The hard part for me is that I barely see my friends, maybe a couple times a month, and I feel super alone most of the time. Being with my boyfriend/ex/whatever he is, is really fun and I have so much fun with him, I love him and he makes me feel belonging and connection and we cuddle and have sex and it's great, and I don't want to give that up. 

And yet, I know he's using me and it drains me spiritually/emotionally to know that. I don't feel like I'm in control of my life now that he's back, because he has kind of taken over my living space and he doesn't even help out with bills or rent or groceries even though he makes 4x the amount of money that I do.

So idk what to do. It's either I let him use me and I get to feel connection/have cuddles/have fun with him, or I have to go back to being lonely but at least have a sense of control over my life/finances/living space.

I guess in a way, we're all ships at sea. We yearn to be able to find a port to dock at, and get to watch everyone else get their turn. Only difference is, these wooden boats can only handle so much turbulence on the hard waters and we're stuck in the way back of the big ol sea. Yeah, you go on Noble Barque. Enjoy being able to find refuge at a dock and peace. There is no such peace when you're lonely. 


Is that really a bad thing? I guess the answer is yes. Nobody to disappoint you, nobody to let you down when they forget anniversaries, birthdays... Nobody to cheat on you and leave you worse off than you were before. Then again, there's nobody to comfort you when you're sad. There's nobody to validate your feelings or make you feel better about the way you look -- so you use websites like Photofeeler and /r/rateme to try and feel comfortable in your own skin. Nobody will throw you a bone, though.. They're **brutally** honest -- which I guess is a good thing. After all, you wouldn't want someone blowing smoke, right? That'd make you feel twice as worse.


Feel, feel... FEEL. That fuckin word does more harm than good, most days. If we could just turn off emotions, would that make things better? Well... Probably not, honestly. We'd all be psychopaths. What would make politicians so special then, if EVERYONE was one? 


I dunno the point of posting this, honestly. Maybe someone can find peace knowing they're not the only one feeling this same way. Waking up every morning, almost disappointed they didn't expire last night because they have nobody in this life to make it worth while... Or haven't for such a long time that they're convinced it won't ever happen again. Maybe it won't. 



There are so many things in the world other than finding love, but then again nobody wants them unless they've already known the most important of them all : How it feels to just **be wanted** in someone's life.

  I feel empty. I’ve felt that way longer than I’d like to acknowledge. Years of pretending to be a good guy. Witty, wise, caring, and always wearing a smile. It’s just too bad that smile was never real even in the moments I truly want it to be. Forced to wear a mask for so long that it grows into you becoming who you used to be but twisted. Strange looking in a mirror and barely recognizing who you’re even supposed to be after the old you died. Trying to crawl out of a grave too deep to reach freedom or peace and so I’m left with what I am now. An empty shell pretty on the outside with fading memories within that I wish to forget.

 Days feel like hours. Hours are seconds. Seconds are..well you get the point by now. I don’t feel any purpose anymore with the absence of anyone who could really care. Even when there was someone there they really weren’t. My comfort and kind nature benefited them and I never mattered when I wasn’t useful. I like to think it was just me creating an illusion that I won’t be alone. To be truly honest, I don’t understand why I do it. 

 I used to have faith in God. Now I don’t even know where I’m at with my spirit. Having gifts that don’t make sense or source. Visions, dreams too real for it to be lucid. Encounters of things I still can’t prove being anything but strange. Now a heavy weight sits inside of me making me feel alone. Not cold but heavy. It’s becoming unbearable. I’ve always been ok with not needing a big social life and even pretending didn’t bother me as much as this feeling does. It’s like I’m missing a piece of myself too important to ignore. 

 I don’t know where I’m going with all of this so I’m just gonna stop here.",lonely,Emptiness,2022-03-31 11:48:27

I didnt used to have a mean or resentful personality like I do now, and I believe it stems from my desire to reciprocate past and present acts of meanness with my own. I become extremely angry when I think about all the times I was beat or pushed or made fun of where the outcome was always that I need to brush it off and prepare for the next time. It was a constant show of what others were allowed to do that I wasn't, be it because of my weak stature or my mental conditioning to be nonviolent and to trust the system. It also didn't help when ur bullies also seem to be floundering in your wake, since a lot of them were very popular and seemingly very consistently happy. Now, after having long been removed from school, my emotional state is deteriorating. I used to be able to hold in lots of repressed rage by transforming it to sadness, which is a way more socially acceptable emotion to have. Nowadays however, I've been feeling my rage slip every now and then, but it doesn't provide any catharsis. I want to get away with what my bullies were able to and get away with it, because in my perspective, it was the way to become popular and therefore happy. I want to be able to assault someone then go to the homecoming game with my 10/10 gf. I want to be able to constantly berate someone with insults and have all my buddies laugh at it. Ik it wrong as shit, but I'm so fucking angry that others have been basically rewarded for being awful while from my perspective, I've only been punished for trying to act proper and correct. I fully believe I will never be able to let it go, because how can I believe in other human concepts like justice and equality if I do? And even if I let it all go and forgo a belief in societal justice, at that point I would just act out my repressions anyway if I didn't care. Even my therepist had to drop me cuz I cant get over it, and if its obvious that i cant find love for myself with all this repressed hate, then i obviously am a lost cause and should end my life before I really hurt someone, right?

in my head or “in my own little world” i believe (this point in my life) that sex is fun, yes it can be dangerous i’m not gonna lie. i just don’t see why we can’t do fun sexual activities together or individually. i myself don’t personally have a problem, i’m comfortable very with myself and it kind of turns me on. communication is all that i ask for (were both adults here). 

To me rn : someone to be around and GIVE (try) YOUR ALL to is very rare and not easily found. I go into my relationships to be with that person till the end. NO matter what i chose to be with you &amp; i’m gonna be here &amp; stick with you good or bad. I’d expect the same in return since this is a relationship. 

idk if it makes sense but i really have no one to talk to, it’s hard because i’m not trying to put my man down or talk about him. i just..need advice and it’s hard trusting amongst my people.

137,True-Human-Scheme3,1648650428,1,"Hi, I’m 17(M) and I can’t understand what is wrong with me. I’ve already experienced puberty a couple years ago, so it’s not about hormones and teen depression stuff. I can’t say when all of this started, I feel like I always was sort of introverted guy, tho I love to hang out with my friends. I don’t have much of them, less than 10 in fact, but they are all good fellas, since I’m very picky about choosing who my friend is. Unfortunately, I don’t communicate with them to much and I always feel being side kick. I don’t really feel like any of them can truly understand me also.

I have decent social skills and good and a little bit weird(not quirky) sense of humor, I don’t have opportunity to use those tho.

I have never been in relationship that last more than 1 week and I have never kissed someone. I don’t struggle without gf and I don’t know why, but I rarely think about relationship in general. I have never had crush on someone also. I’ve been seeing those relationship memes/vids from insta/tiktok and I don’t feel they are quite right, I can’t see love there. Some might say that true love needs to be developed, but what is sense then? I can love absolutely anyone following this logic. I’m dreaming to have someone to hug and talk to tho.

I’m in good relations with my family, but we do not communicate too much and I don’t have much connections with them neither. I feel like I do not belong anywhere but myself. So I moved to my grandma, so I could have my own room and nobody would be able to bother me.

I also want to talk about my sexuality: I am very addicted to deviantart fetish porn. I struggle really hard about that since I’m orthodox christian. This is not heritage since my family consist of atheists(I am not against that). I decided it for myself and religion is just another confirmation of my moral beliefs. I don’t want to consider myself as bi, who I am in fact. I don’t think lgbt is bad, but I would rather be straight.
This is also not the case of my loneliness, I still do love women, but regular porn often can’t satisfy me. I’ve tried NoFap several times and I was feeling better, but not in way about loneliness, but self-esteem.

About looks: I’m not ugly but wouldn’t say I look manly enough. I’m lazy and don’t have muscles. I also have too childish/feminine face, too high-pitched voice.

I don’t really like psychologists due to I’m don’t like opening to strangers. I’ve been at one’s once, when I was passing medical comission for uni. I completed test which shown that I have high submissiveness?( I don’t really remember) and suicidal tendencies and depression, which I don’t actually feel. Maybe I’m in regret? Neat part I didn’t specially choose negative options in test.

I’m not motivated at all, don’t have ambitions and I do nothing to achieve my dreams. I also do not have much hobbies. I rarely listen music. I don’t watch movies almost at all. All I do is existing. The only thing I love to do and do frequently is playing Minecraft on my server. Unfortunately, m friends quit it a long time ago.

I don’t believe that I’m unhappier than anyone. Every human being has their own problems, that we may just not understand. I just would like to solve question about why I struggle from loneliness and often feel like hole in the heart but ok with it at the same time?",lonely,I can not understand myself,2022-03-31 01:27:08

167,Mental-Bodybuilder15,1648639318,1,"So, after reading many others posts, it looks like I’m not so alone in dealing with loneliness. Whatever that’s worth. Basically I’m 27, just turned 27 a month ago. I’ll try not to ramble. Last relationship I was in was 2019 and it ended horribly, half the reason it ended was because I was bisexual or more gay than anything at this point and didn’t understand it yet and I was with a girl at the time. I never felt like I really loved her and I knew it wasn’t fair to her to so I broke it off. Among other things. So now I’ve been trying to navigate this gay world for the last couple years exclusively and it’s gone horrible. Like awful. I’ve been with 3-4 guys and each experience left me so empty after and regretful. They’ll either be insensitive and not my type when we meet, OR, and it’s so great when this happens, I’ll like them a lot and then they ghost me like the next day. I had gynocomastia when I was a late teenager really bad and was also a 100 pounds overweight throughout high school. Well, I got surgery on my chest and I lost more than 100 pounds and have been lean for a while, but I have extra skin on my stomach and my nipples aren’t even, it makes me really self conscious and makes any guy who likes my face or personality, immediately shun me and bail. It’s happened again and again. I feel like I have a somewhat handsome face, but I almost feel like I’m cat fishing people. It’s ruined my social life completely. I really don’t have any friends. I have one who i met sophomore year of high school and we’ve been close since but he moved to Indonesia. So yeah. For about 4 years now. I haven’t talked to my mom in 4 years, her and I have a horrible relationship and I have 3 half siblings, none of them have reached out to me either and haven’t spoken in a long long time.

i hangout with my boyfriend a lot, maybe too often. he hurts my feelings when he tell me a wants some alone time or that he doesn’t want to hangout that day. and sometimes i know that he forces himself to hangout with my just so he doesn’t hurt my feelings. i cry to him all the time about how lonely i am but i just don’t think he gets it he’s always been popular and had huge friend groups.

I wish one person would hang out with me but I haven''t had one of them in years. I can't blame them. Nobody wants to hang out with me.

Nobody deserves to be alone.... I myself have suffered for many years. So I made a server in the hope to help myself and others combat this horrible feeling.

There is a great bunch of people so far. And that's how I aim for it to stay!

I didn't go in to work today because I woke up feeling so hopelessly drained I couldn't move, let alone face any other human beings for a whole 8 hours. I'm torn between telling my colleagues what I'm going through and potentially have them resent me and completely lose all respect for me or keeping quiet and only consult strangers on here or through therapy. 

Regarding therapy, I tried once to start through the NHS (government health care) but it was a complete shit show. On the other hand I don't think I can afford to pay the ungodly amount of money a private therapist charges with the likely possibility that it just won't do anything for me anyway and I will have thrown all that money down the drain.

Then they get angry because its not their fault im feeling bad, or that its unfair that something good happens to me and not them.
When i talk directly about my feelings to the same person, but in the friend group, they act super worried and say i shouldve brought it up sooner.
All in all, no one in the whole group actually tried to help me in any way or talked about it ever again.
To be fair, Im sure they have their own problems to deal with and i dont blame them for not also having to deal with mine. Therefore i dont bring serious topics about me, as e.g. things that gets their mood down, up, and when i do, with a lot of time inbetween.

I am usually a very happy and talkative person if the group gets quiet or bored or have a conflict e.g., and i rather take resonibility and look like clown to save others from it. no matter the history with the person. Otherwise im naturally rather a shy and introverted person. Since i have issues trusting people with my emotions, i barely talk about them serously. But i always take time to listen and talk about their problems, if they care to share.

They probably dont have energy to deal with it, or maybe think i joke around or do it for attention.

I'm also sorry if I lack English vocabulary, English isn't my first language so I might also have a hard time expressing my feelings because of my language...   
so anyway, I just feel kinda empty, and lonely every day. Throughout my life, I never really have friends that much, I do talk to people but most of them are just classmates and families. I had friends before, but most of them ended up leaving me behind, and sometimes I just feel like I am at fault. I feel guilty, maybe because I talk too much(?), but I always do consider their feelings too, I let them talk and express their own opinions, whenever they need something I would always help them. Honestly, I don't know, I'm confused whether I'm at fault or maybe they're the ones making me think that I'm at fault. And just a month ago there's this one online friend who just started ignoring me even though I did nothing wrong, we were just talking about the current updates of a game then they suddenly start ignoring me. I first thought that they were busy so I waited for months, I always see them online talking to a lot of people but they never talked to me... so it just leads to my conclusion that they never really want to talk to me anymore. maybe they thought that I was boring, or they just generally don't care about me.  
It also happened the same thing in real life as well. It's because of these events that I just feel like not making friends anymore, I'm too afraid to get abandoned, and rejected again. But it hurts to know that no one will care for me. I just don't want to deal in friendships anymore, I don't want to trust anyone anymore. it's just too scary to be judged and be rejected... I don't know what to do in my life anymore... ever since I was in grade 1 I've been so lonely and whenever I see people having fun with their friends somehow I felt envious that they were having fun... I think that's all. I'm not really expecting people to help me...

218,Vividlee11,1648604452,1,"This is my first time posting on Reddit so bare with me, but I can’t help but feel like I’m really all alone in this world. I’m a 20 year old black male and I live in a crappy apartment that I need to get out of but I don’t have enough money. I’ve pretty much been an outcast most of my life. I’ve always felt isolated because of how I am, and the things that I like. 

Since I was a small child I realized I really loved video games and a variety of artistic outlets (fighting games are my favorite.) I loved various types of art forms mainly Asian inspired ones but not exclusively.  Drawings, poetry, music, some sports, even psychology. Basically anything that requires a great deal of focus, precision, creativity, and training. I’ve always been quite curious. 

Earlier on in life as a kid I was well liked by my peers for my differences but later on in life it’s flipped into the opposite. Life pretty much started going downhill with my relationships since the beginning of high school. I got into a toxic intimate relationship with a girl that greatly altered my perspective on life and how people are.   That ended in a little less than a year but ever since I’ve realized how many people have started to treat me poorly. I got bullied for what I liked, my introversion/awkwardness, and my differences. I even realized my parents were pretty narcissistic toward my siblings and I growing up. They have had an authoritarian style of parenting. Whatever they said was how it was supposed to go and they never cared about our individual feelings and differences. Was basically blamed for everything that went wrong with their lives since i can remember. It’s done a good bit of damage to my self- esteem. At 18 i got a job in a warehouse and was kicked out of my home so I had to move in with my girlfriend’s family and then eventually into the apartment I’m in. Im not satisfied in my relationship with my girlfriend anymore though, as I feel like I’m alone when I’m with her. She has a hard time being attentive to, and caring about my emotions, interests, and desires. She’s very pretty and a nice girl but we don’t connect well on an intellectual level. I don’t think that’s what I want in a partner long term. I’m estranged from all previous friends and family I’ve had growing up except for her. It’s been like that for years now. 

At an attempt to cut my venting short. I really just want people to connect with and and to feel heard/supported. And I’d like to do the same for them if they let me. Im not great at making friendships/connections but I’ve got to start somewhere. I’m taking a huge leap in sharing this with the online world. I understand that I play a major role in finding happiness and getting my life back on track. I don’t want to die with regrets or wasted potential. Tired of feeling miserable all the time.

I got ""kicked out"" of my family's cult religion. So their contact with me is at a minimum now. I barely see them anymore.

Winter where I live is depressing. Very cloudy. I work from home so I have no contact with anyone.

I have great friends, they are the only thing that keeps me sane. But they are busy and we can't see each other all the time.

On my day-to-day, I just feel extremely lonely now. I hate this feeling. I feel desperate sometimes to just grab a coffee with a friend. Or I text anyone I can think of just to go to the gym with someone. Or get a roommate. Or start a new physical job just to talk to people (but I make good money already so I don't really need one).

I'm sure the nurse was just being friendly, and doing her job, but she was nice, every couple minutes this gorgeous nurse named Ashley came in she called me honey, and my love, and was very polite and caring towards me. I joked around with her about her being very tall and how she had to raise the bed high off the ground so she could give me my needles. She was having trouble drawing blood, and she had to inject me 6-7 times, I actually loved this, she was just sitting by my bed talking to me, and It made me feel special.i didn't care that she kept stabbing me, and that my arm was actually in a lot of pain.

We’re not a couple but we tell each other we love each other for 2 years now, we just can’t be a couple cause of long distance right now. She has hurt me so much lately, others involved, she has apologized and promised she’s only focusing on herself and no one else right now. 
I got this feeling today that something is up. My whole heart started to hurt. I checked her tumblr, she’s liking someone’s new posts. Tumblr was always “our thing”. I decided to check if she follows the same person on Spotify, and she did. She also follows all the girls she’s talked to. 2 or 3 irl friends but the rest were just girls she’s talked to/is talking to at the same time as me. I had to go throw up. I don’t know why I get like this, I hate myself in these situations. I want to die and end my life in these situations. 

Everything got blurry and I texted her that we need to talk and that I can’t do it anymore. Immediately regretted it. Embarrassed myself. Opened up. Said too much. Now we’re gonna talk on the phone tomorrow and I don’t know what to say. I’m embarrassed. 

I hate being like this. I hate putting my worth in how others treat me. I hate myself for loving her. I hate myself for being so jealous. I hate myself so much.

My days revolve around her. If we talk or not. How she talks to me if she does. My mood is always based on her. All I ever think of is her. Nothing else. I’d do anything for her.

Because I am who I am, I own the fact that I have issues pertaining to my sexual identity and my race within said identity that even the most well meaning, educated people won't understand. But, lately another anxiety bug has reared its ugly head. Gay men culture, generally speaking, is highly sexual (even in the most mundane of places) and our current technology encourages it (at least, I feel). Though, I am a victim of sexual assault and stand firm in my boundaries, I've always viewed myself as pretty healthy in a manner of speaking with my desires, frequency of connections and any other way one would measure insight into my sexual prowess. Lately, however, I've been feeling more prudish. Or sensitive, and triggered even. It's like, no matter who I'm talking to and no matter the subject, I'm dodging trite innuendos, steering the topic back to the original focus, or pretending I didn't hear it at all. This seems to happen all the time. With gays in casual, intimate or even professional settings. It's exhausting. And honestly, it's making me not want to interact or have sex. I'm a gay man, who's beginning to get turned off by interaction with men. Because I'm 41 and the combination of my upbringing and geographic breading, I wasn't equipped with identity vocabulary. I'm researching identities, pronouns and communities. For a while, I've identified as gay, and sapiosexual. I'm now wondering if asexual is being sprinkled into the mix. I've researched asexuality but it hasn't seem to resonate. I still get horny and desire men. I long for companions. But, I wouldn't be caught dead at a social event.

I installed a dating app called ur my type and after receiving a few matches I deleted it because I'm convinced no one could really ever love me anyways and it's such a lonely and pathetic existence. 

I have one person to vent to right now, but I don't want to keep bothering them. I've already considered just blocking them to save them from my misery. Seems that's all I've ever known and maybe all of it really is my fault.

I'm the one who doesn't talk to people, I don't let people get too close unless I'm trying to be with them. I only ever let my guard down in a relationship and I always get stabbed in the heart for it so whats the point?

But I just can't help it, it's like an itch I just can't scratch. I need to be acknowledged, I need to be wanted for once. I'm so touched starved, so love starved, I'll latch onto any sign of interest. But that just makes me even more pathetic.

Maybe it was always meant to be this way. I don't know anymore. All I know is I am so lonely and I am so tired of hurting. I just want to know what it feels like to be truly loved by someone. That's all.

But I'm asking too much. I always do. I can't help but hate myself. And then I've got everything else on my plate too to worry about and I have absolutely no energy to take care of myself. Today was the first time I showered in 2 or 3 months, I don't even really remember anymore.

It's no wonder nobody wants me or loves me, I'm ugly, I hate myself, I hate life, I just want this to be over already but I can't give up either. The itch is always there. Some notion that if I just keep trying...

I'm getting too old for games anymore. I want friendships that will last, I want a relationship that will last. I want connection but I just can't get it, no matter how hard I try.

I didn't think this was a problem when I was younger; I figured I'd grow out of it. But now, I'm pushing 33, no wife or kids and I realize I have a very small circle of people who actually care for me or even love me.

Sometimes I think ""why is it like this for me?"". But then I realize I not only don't love, but don't care for most, if not all people. I haven't for as long as I can remember. I was in the military for a time, studied abroad, lived and worked across the U.S., became a contractor overseas and lived and worked in 3 different countries. And the theme is the same for each period in my life; I haven't built any meaningful relationships with any of the people I've encountered.

And personally, I haven't been laid in almost 8 years. I know it's not normal. Feels like it's killing me inside. Like no one desires me. But I don't think I'm ugly, and don't get me wrong, I love sex, but I can't have it with someone if I don't feel at least a connection with them. One night stands is an alien concept to me. Feels impossible for me. Crazy part is people around me generally assume I have an active sex life but the opposite couldn't be more true. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. I've actually never shared this with anyone. The thought and realization that's it's me makes me deeply uncomfortable but I'm really starting to struggle with it so I felt compelled to share.

They're just wanting to make friends and hang out and you just leave them and make fun of them for just being the different odds than you, and the fact that this personality type is now ""cringe"" just makes it even more frustrating to me. I am frustrated at society for this mindset and I want it to stop!

As a former person who was bullied and rejected for being this type of person in the past, people can be scumbags to very optimistic people. In the past, it was very pessimistic people making it worse and now it's optimistic people turning them into lonely, feeling-like nobodies cause of this mindset.

We need to change this mindset. Give people a chance unless they're asses.

I was never the one to *make* friends, people seemed to befriended me either out of necessity or seer luck. I had friends growing up (thank god) but it was few in numbers and obviously after high school people sort of drift away. That's sort of where i'm at now. 30 is closing in fast and I spend 90% of my free time alone. No plans, no gatherings, no dates. Just me. If it wasn't for training jujitsu I probably would have died due to lack of human interaction. I swear if you dont talk much you just seem to lose the ability to form words in a conversation?

 Last person I had a romantic interest wasn't really serious about it. Turned out to be validation/boredom on her part, or so im assuming.  Was a 12 year on and off again ordeal. Always been the type to really fall for that *one* person. Was it loneliness or a connection that kept flickering on and off and i hungered for it? We eventually did date for about 2 weeks. It was weird to feel excitement and she seem genuine in her affection at the time. A damn hug would have my brain exploding with dem feel good hormones.

I could make her laugh easily and we seemed to be on the some page. Was beginning to feel like myself again at times. But apparently I wasn't her type in some way or someone better suited came along.

253,sweethop99,1648589687,6,"So I'm not quite sure why I'm posting this, I guess I just had the thought.

I'm a 28 year old guy, soon to be gratuating from the university I'm attending, and I guess I just hit some sort of wall tonight. I am sitting in my one room apartment by myself as I do every night at this point, and I just got to thinking, it's actually been 4 years since I touched another person.

Like, i can think of a handshake I did maybe 3 years ago at a job, but that's been it really.
I have an auto immune disorder that sort of made me shut off the world when the pandemic hit, but I had the zoom meetings for school, so I guess I didn't really think I was missing out on anything. I just let the whole world move by while I hid away from everything. 

But now that I'll graduate soon it got me really thinking about my life and how I've been going about it so far.
I used to be pretty out and about. As a teen I always kinda placed myself in all kinds of situations with other people and I was really quick at making friends back then. I had a ton of friends from all kinds of differemt groups, and I felt like I fit in with mostly everyone. 

But for some reason I just couldn't keep those friendships going into my 20's and nowadays I just spend 98% of the time by myself, doing mostly nothing really meaningful. With the last 2% shared between my parents and the local cashier at the store. 
I haven't been engaging in social activities for maybe 6 years or so. And I haven't ever dated at all.
I feel like I have devolved into this odd existance where I seem to have forgotten how to interact with people. Even on here I mostly just find myself having reationary burst or I'm lashing out on people in comments.. Like what the fuck am I doing? I'm a grown ass man, right? I should have this shit figured out by now! 
But for some reason I have just become this complete asshole, who isn't contributing anything positive to this world besides making my mom happy when I come home for Christmas. 
I mean, I have really let myself become a fucked up fetished weirdo that I honestly have no idea who would ever want to have any relationship with. 
I'd of course welcome anyone who would want to spend time with me, but on some level they'd have to be crazy to. 


Looking at some old social media account I see many people from my past having children. I guess the pandemic really is a babyboom scenario. But it does makes me feel very lonely.
I feel like I'm missing out on so much of life, yet it all also seems so overwhelming and honestly estranged for me at this point. I feel like I forgot how to exist in the real world and how to interact with people. And I have no idea where to begin with any of this and how to move forward.

Anywho, that's me spilling my guts.
Fuck it!",lonely,There's almost 8 billion people on this planet and I haven't touched one in almost 4 years.,2022-03-30 08:34:47
254,Nxgent44,1648589483,2,"Idrk why im writing this but I gotta vent so if any of u are lucky enough to read this I apologize in advance. Im in 2nd year College and tbh its everything I thought it would be, from someone who never really had a good time in highschool for various reasons in and outside of the institution. I have a good amount of great friends now, something I wasnt sure I would ever be able to achieve, I feel like im an easy person to dislike if that makes sense. I wouldn’t describe myself as Rude or an asshole or anything like that I think im a pretty nice person but that might also be the problem. I have trust issues meeting new people I think its cause I already assume they have a bad opinion of me before I ever talk to them, maybe my brain thinks it’s easier to assume everyones secretly against me and act distant rather than be too friendly and risk getting walked over. My roommates are probably the best friends Ive ever had! I got extremely lucky finding them and Im not taking that for granted but I find it hard to actually trust them. I trust them but I don’t feel like I could actually talk to them about everything I’m dealing with, because my mental state has been very up and down since I was a kid and being at university my parents aren’t really someone I can talk too about it, mainly cause I dont wanna worry them and they aren’t the most understanding when it comes to emotions but its honestly just how they where raised. My roommates are great but I feel like any second it could change and they could any minute not wanna be friends with me anymore. Its happened  times before with friends I thought I was gonna be friends with forever and im sure a-lot of other people have shared that feeling. I have a pretty good social life id say We party every weekend but always make time for school yet I feel invisible when it comes to meeting Girls, Im not an overly attractive male but I don’t think I’m necessarily Ugly but again its all perspective ig. Dating apps dont work for me and im starting to think its not the pictures that aren’t good, rather im just unattractive and awkward. I don’t really understand whats so wrong with me? Im not a simp or a Douchbag but for whatever reason I either get shot down instantly or if it actually develops into talking I manage to sabotage myself either by putting too much or no effort In. I also seem to be attracted to girls that obviously don’t like me, the few times I’ve actually been approached by a girl its too weird for me, almost like I cant comprehend someone would actually be interested in me. I heard this saying once “people only accept the love they think they deserve” and I think maybe that might be apart of my problem. I feel like I also crave the one thing I cant have, and I think alot of people do this but when I didn’t have friends all I wanted was friends and now that I have friends all I want is a girlfriend, I think about it for probably 80% of my day when I’m not distracted by school or something. I wish I didn’t care so much but its been months now and its not even something I can cry about anymore its just acceptance at this point. I feel like theres almost some dark force preventing me from being happy and having a relationship like a curse or something. Ive been trying to be more positive but as the days go by it doesn’t seem to be getting any better, its usually 2-4 months in between meeting a girl that I might actually have a chance with (I usually fuck it up) and seeing my roommates essentially have any girl they want whenever they want secretly kills me inside. Im happy for them but also extremely jealous, I just wish that someone would see me for me yk. Ik that if I had a girlfriend I would do anything to see her smile [within reason] no simp shit I might be down bad but mama ain’t raise no bitch. One day maybe it’ll be different but I also know that nothing will change If I don’t make some effort to change something in life.

266,Basil_spice,1648585563,3,"I've been alone for a while now. the only consistent human interaction is with therapists and doctors. I'm in group therapy,  and even so,  I'm so scared of connection and rejection I can't properly connect with anyone.

And since I've only been talking to nothing but therapists and doctors for the last 6 months, I'm completely socially inept. If I do get into a conversation with someone,  I will do most of the talking,  and most of that talking is what's troubling me. I know I do it, and everyone else knows. It makes me want to isolate more and makes social interaction even more nerve-wracking. 

But after a really bad weekend, I no longer felt human, but then I remembered a few weeks ago I matched with someone of bumble bff, and we added each other on snap. Her and I never spoke, but since I'm new in town, I asked her about a popular abandoned building and the possibility of exploring it. In my limited knowledge of her, I knew she dumpster dived. it didn't seem like a big jump to go from dumpster diving to trespassing. She was totally down and said she would go with me.

After that, we've been chatting back and forth,  and now we have plans to meet up possibly this week. I realise I still do talk about myself a lot, but I am trying to have actual conversations with people in group therapy and ask them about their lives. I didn't ask not because I didn't care. I never asked because then it could lead to friendship, and that was terrifying. And still is..

But I'm trying to actually start doing the work to be happy and be the social person I was a few years ago, before my co-dependent relationship, and before the pandemic... and before, I started self harming again. I've been in treatment since November, and I'm the only thing stopping me from relationships. I'm going to freak out and probably want to cancel plans, but I won't I NEED to get out.

281,MonkeyDforda,1648572587,1,"Hey there 

I made a post on here before about my recent lonliness wich was also caused by covid ,but I realized that I have always felt lonely all my life even when there were times where I had lots of friends and daily social interactions.

I kinda always felt like I was born with the specific role of being an observer. Someone who wittnesses the life's of others, but therefore has no life of its own. I never felt like I was the main character at some point or even an important side character. Maybe I got to be an unimportant side character or just a charcter in the background sometimes, but for the majority of my life I always felt like the viewer who no matter how loud he scearms at the screen, no one will hear him and he won't have an effect on the outcome of the story whats so ever. 

When ever I had friends or was in a friend group I rarely felt like I had a connection with these people. To me it felt like people were never friends with me for me, but most of the time it felt like I was there to fullfill a specific role. Often I just was the filler, the target of jokes, the last guy to call when there was no one else and often I just was sorta there. Even with people I sort of was close with I felt like was just there to play my part. More important roles than the ones I just mentioned, but still just a role that could easily be discarded or replaced.

I don't have the sense (and never did) that I have an important impact on other peoples lifes (not that I really tried to tbh). Even in my family. Like if I were to die tomorrow their lifes would just continue like normal with the only differents being my abbsence. Of course they would be sad for a while, but once they overcome that its like almost nothing changed. No one ever told me in any way that Im important to them and that I provide something only I can. I guess I have always tried to be a good big brother to my sisters, but as I said I never got any feedback so I don't know.

I know that my position in life is without a doubt largely my own fault for not trying to be more to myself and people around me. I've been in this postion for so long that now where I wanna be more I don't know how to and how to even get started. Things like my introverted nature and social anxiety only make it harder. 

I kinda already accepted that I might be dying alone without ever having achieved something im proud of or without ever having made an important impact on someone's life.

290,Bredbanani,1648565656,3,"Disclaimer : I don't know if I'll keep this post up cause I know there's actually no one who can help me. I just wanted to write it down for once and send it to the void rather than repeating it in my head every single day.

My name is Bren and I'm currently 30 years old. I grew up with my mom, dad and younger brother. As nice as that sounds however, we never had what I'd consider 'a warm family'. I never witnessed any love between my parents. My dad never showed any interest in us and was mainly found looking over his birds or watching tv after work. I think my mom sees her input in this differently as well, but I wouldn't say we necessarily got a lot of love or affection from her either. I know she was tired from work as well and she'd provide us with food, but there was never any 'quality time' for us after school. We could join them in watching tv up to a certain hour before bed, but that was about the best you could get. Like things like playing boardgames with us was definitely too much to ask for.

At the same time aside from that, I was also definitely not liked at school. I can't remember any time where I wasn't seen as 'different' from everyone else. No one ever wanted to play with me, people would avoid me, people would actively make fun of me. Basically to summarize it I was bullied from a young age. The thing that hit me the hardest in that regard has to be when I was about 8 years old. My classmates had started this new thing where they would pretend to be spraying themselves after they had been in contact with me. For example if I were to bump into them by accident or the teacher made me pass papers in the classroom, they'd spray themselves so they wouldn't be infected because it was something I touched as well. I guess it sounds silly now, but it definitely put a lasting effect on me. I do feel like I must be disgusting and that even being accidentally touched must be the worst thing in the world. I switched schools a few years later, but unlike other succes stories, no matter which school I switched to and even when I moved on to different high schools, it still happened. I was always an outsider, someone who people just didn't like or didn't want to be associated with. (I could give so much more examples here, but it would only get longer than it already is.)

So with my family life not being great and my school life definitely not being great, I ended up being drawn to the internet, especially to games where you could walk around as an online avatar. It definitely temporarily filled a void for me. Somehow with me not talking to people face to face and using my hands to 'talk', people could at least tolerate me. And over the years I definitely made some what I'd consider 'friends', something I could've never thought of irl. Unfortunately those times are already long gone and these people have actually moved on and actually created a life for themselves (and I'm happy for them that they did.)

My life took another turn for the worst when my parents decided to divorce when I was 18. I initially didn't think it would be too bad cause they never loved each other anyway, and it was a clear choice to live with my mom out of the two, but I didn't expect that my mom would end up being an alcoholic. After moving with her I suddenly had to learn and take care of a lot of things in life which I had little experience in, on top of trying to be there for my younger brother as well who had just started high school. I just tried to stay strong, escaped on the internet when I could and had the illusion that maybe with time someone would come and save me, cause fairytales always have those happy endings.

Unfortunately 30 came, and several moves later I don't see my situation ever improving. While my mom isn't constantly drunk anymore, she's a very negative manically depressed person with spending issues, a hoarding disease and CFS, meaning she's home all the time on disability pay. I don't want to talk too negative about her, she's still my mom, but I can't deny that it weighs heavy on me. She doesn't do anything but eat, watch tv &amp; perhaps whatever her current interest is. (For example she's heavily into gardening now, so she will spend all her money on new gardening equipment and seeds, but when it comes to actually maintaining the plants once they grow it becomes too much effort and she'll just let everything overgrow and allow it to be a mess). And I get so jealous whenever I look at my coworkers who are roughly the same age as her and see what they're still able to do.

I just feel so.. stuck. I feel so tired and drained and I feel like I have nowhere to go. I started working parttime when I was 21 and have been doing this job ever since. But because of the odd hours it's insanely hard to combine anything with it. I also get insanely overwhelmed and exhausted by every day interactions and I don't know what that would be like if I worked 8 hours a day. Needless to say I can't afford any housing on my own and any program which focusses on housing for people with low incomes have a waiting list of at least 10 years, and it's only increasing.

I feel like I've spent all of my young adult life just trying to survive while not being able to work on my own issues that I've had since I was little. I do am getting tested for autism in about a month, but I feel like if anything that will just add another label onto me but it's not going to help. I fear that I'm just going to waste my life working to have help fund her financial issues and then come home and be a house maid.. the only thing that still keeps me going is that I also have my pets that I have to take care of, but even they're getting sick a lot lately so most of my spare time is going to nursing them too..

And then i didn't talk about the fact that I'm terrified and overwhelmed by everything in regards to driving so the best I can do is bike to places.. \^\^'''''

So I'm basically just a very pathetic person who has literally no one left to actually reach out to. I don't know what I'm hoping to gain from writing this down. It feels good to get it off my chest I guess even tho it has barely scraped the surface of all of my issues, but it was already long enough as is.

If anything, I hope I can at least be the 'bad example' parents warn you about, don't end up like me.",lonely,My long story,2022-03-30 01:54:16

I wish there were evening clubs that don't involve alcohol, something like a pub or something where people play games (there are some gaming places for board games, which I think is an amazing idea, but they are not exactly where people can just join a group of you are alone)

I don't have any friends. I've joined all kinds of stuff to meet people. I either can't get to meet up groups as they are too far away or they just aren't my cup of tea. The closest to a friend I do have makes absolutely no effort in conversations. I end up babbling to them when things get really tough for me. I'm the one that has to go to them to spend time together and that's like one or 2 times a year. It's always in his bedroom and I get to watch him play games. Obviously this makes issues with my relationships. I want to spend time with him like the adults we are. He could at least meet me halfway. Our only conversations are about pokemon and that's fine but its incredibly repetitive. He's happy to wallow in his pit and if I want to keep the friendship I have to join him. We were great friends once upon a time. 

I work closely with one colleague and he's pretty antisocial. Now I know he absolutely does not owe me his time but it prevents us from having a working relationship. I can't train him properly to do my job when I'm not there and vice versa. 8 hours in silence is mental draining. I use that time dwelling on the negativty in my life and I'm pretty sure it's making things much worse than they need to be. 

I don't even have a fulfilling relationship. At this point I'm pretty sure I'm just being used for somewhere to live. I come home and he's got headphones on playing games. I like games too but theres no room for me at all. It's like that until bed time and then he's on his phone. I try to talk about my day or anything on my mind and then I get moaned at for keeping him up talking.

I tried and failed and I am basically rotting away and I don't look as good as I used to. I grieve endlessly. It's been half a year. I still have a foothold in every stage of grieving.

As far as friends go, I wouldn't say that I have any close friends. Anyone I may consider a friend is pretty much someone online that I'll only occasionally message with. I feel like every chat is a void. Yet somehow I think that an even more impersonal void is worth writing to.

My personality consists of random esoterica and obsessively trying to wordbuild and come up with things for my story. I'd like to create a webcomic. I've never read one, but I'd like to make a magnum opus to at least contribute something to someone and have something to show. My way of coping is to focus on this story and setting. But when i stop thinking about it, or the night comes, it feels like sobering up, and inside of my chest feels like a black hole.

Because of years of solitude, I convinced myself that I dislike people. That I would much rather be alone than enjoying time with others. I believed that for so long that I pushed everyone away. That I subconsciously self destruct relationships because, being alone is easier than talking. I pushed myself so much that I feel like I am alone in the world. Like a side character that no one cares for unless their right in your face. I try to make friends but I’m either easily forgotten, I don’t know how to communicate, or I simply push them away because would much rather be alone. This feeling… I hate it. But it’s comforting in a way. It’s familiar. Something that will always be there for me in the end. I truly try to make friends but I can’t seem to hold a place in anyones lives. In public it’s the worse. I always feel like everyone, especially females, are looking at me. I know I’m not anything special but I can’t help but feel this way. Social media is one of the same. I don’t post any pictures of myself because i feel like it’s all a contest of popularity. I stay to myself because it’s easier to just be quiet than to find conversation.

I miss playing videogames with someone  
I miss discussing common interests with someone and chatting about our achievements and goals in videogames

I miss screensharing my games (and vice versa) to someone and us having fun commenting about what happens in the game   
I miss having someone there to spend my time with and chat on daily basis non-stop for hours until one of us is exhausted to the point were our bodies demand rest  
I miss having somebody whom I could send and share everything i'd stumble upon online such as videos, music, messed up stuff, memes, posts everything and anything no filters

I have floaters in my vision and although these aren't necessarily always a cause for concern my eye doctor told me there is a slight risk of retinal detachment and to make an appointment with him if I notice any sort of change in my vision. Even though he said slight risk I can't help but think it's over and I'll go blind someday. This thought has been on my mind a lot lately but in addition to this, I just feel so insanely isolated these days. Can anyone else relate? How did we get to this point? I go online and this loneliness seems to be prevalent everywhere. I guess what I'm saying is I feel stuck and voiceless. Sometimes I hate days off because they remind me or how much of a loser I am. Nothing to do all day, no one to spend time with. Funny how big cities make a lot of us feel disconnected. I know the vision thing is something I'm going to have to be diligent with to ensure my vision can be saved. But I guess I'm just looking for some support since I don't really have anyone in real life I can reach out to. I'm not expecting a key to all my problems if anyone has any kind words that would be good enough. Thanks for taking the time to read my little bit.

361,GirlBoss_1999,1648522241,1,"Hi Reddit. I don't wanna give any details but I just wrote this little ""break-up"" text I'm planning on sending to my best friend - the closest one I've ever had; and I'm honestly scared because I don't think I'll ever have a true friendship like that ever again.

See, I had a very traumatic childhood and a very traumatic experience last year. Both honestly made me currently terrified of trusting... anyone. I just don't know how to be vulnerable around people, and I don't even know how to approach them at this point. So I don't see myself making a single new friend in the future.

But, although I'll miss him and don't have the ability to make new friends for now, he does neglects me a lot. We've been through this over and over, but the pattern always finds a way to repeat itself. So, to spare myself from further hurt, I wrote this text telling him, politely, that ""our friendship is doing me no good, please don't text me again"". 

I can't send it, though. 

Cause I know the moment I do, then that's it. And then comes that alfuw time to face the impending grief of a relationship that will always mean so much to me.

Well, I love him very much,  but I don't want to keep someone in my life just because I'm afraid I'm incapable of finding a substitute for them. Plus, I don't want to condition myself to cumpulsely force future relationships to feel these voids of lovenessless inside me.

Like everyone, I guess I have to learn on pratice even little by little how to heal from loosing people close to me, because it can and sometimes will happen often in life.

But I so feel very empty and depressed and anxious because I generally don't know what to do with myself or what's to come.

Does anyone have any tips/life-hacks or resources (even academic) on how to cope? Or letting other people in?

When I try to focus on working or studying I get serious burnout. I've been planning on volunteering.

Oh, any reading recommendations?  Cause I've been reading (and journaling about) bell hooks' ""All About Love"" and it's a tough read, but truly cathartic.

Trade some of your emptiness for a brew,
Yeah We may look kind of weird,
But then again don't we all,
Oh baby Watch your step at the door
Don't trip and fall,
Come on in amour,
Take your coat off and say hello,
Sit and have a drink
While I sing my soul to you.

Oh when were lost and out,
There's just no where to go,
Come on by my friend,
And I'll lend you a peice of my soul,
Forget your worries,
With your bags at the door,
Take some of my laughter,
Because sometimes we're all a little poor.
And I'll sing my soul to you.

Don't stay up to late,
Don't yell and shout,
Instead take a peice of my heart,
And just hear me out,
All this heartache I can never soothe,
Open up a little bit
Because I stay open past 2,
Grab my bong and smoke away,
While I sing my soul to you.

Don't be afraid we all sin,
Nobody's perfect my dear,
Life is full of wonders,
And not all of us win,
Give me your hurt and your fear,
And I'll tell you where I've been,
Share some love for yesterday
And I'll sing you my soul,
I'll sing my soul to you.",lonely,Poem I'll sing my soul to you,2022-03-29 12:45:47

377,thatlonegirl,1648515930,1," Hey there!

You can call me Hanna, 32 from Southeast Asia who was just recently diagnosed with PDD (Persistent Depression Disorder). I just thought of writing this to let it off my chest. I've been dealing with a lot of things since the year started. A series of unfortunate events if you may call it that. They might not be big of a deal to many of you for you might've gone through a lot worse, but for me, this has affected me and it's only almost 3 months in this year. Maybe these things that have happened to me were a trigger that's why I am feeling like this, but what do I know? Anyway, I'd appreciate if you would give me that tough love kinda thing but I think right now, all I need is comfort and listening ear. In this case, eyes that would read this and share my feelings with.

So, lets start shall we?

* My family attacking me and accusing me of things that I am not. They've thrown hurtful words without reaching out to me first and asking me things or talking to me first like normal people would. They've been telling me that I've been distancing myself from them when they know exactly why I am doing that. They always make it seem like I am the problem when they keep telling me I'm not. Action speaks louder than words - I always say this because it's the truth. Don't get me wrong, I love my family and I miss them so much but the complication we have is long overdue and I don't know what to do anymore. I have the intentions of fixing everything but the way they interact with me is what makes me not do it anymore.
* The person I consider my bestfriend that I care about so much left without saying a word. Yeah, he basically ghosted me. He's such a dear friend of mine and I will always hold a special place for him in my heart. I like him so much but not to the point that I am in love with him yet, if that make sense? It may sound silly and stupid but I only met him online almost two years ago in the midst of pandemic, I wouldn't have met him if it weren't because of Covid-19. I miss him so much, there hasn't been a day where I don't miss him. He was the one I go to whenever I am feeling blue or when I am going through something or just about anything, good or bad, but now he's gone. Though he's still in my social media and I think he didn't block me on the messaging app we use, I am staying away from him, keeping my distance because I respect the space he made between us. I am not entirely sure what happened between us, I thought what we had was just a small hiccup that we have to overcome but I was wrong. Two months has passed and we still haven't talked to each other. I was the last one who reached out to him and he didn't respond. No response is a response. I just hope he's happy and doing well.
* So when the friend from second bullet left, I revert back to this other friend I had previously that I had sexual relationship with. I needed something/someone to distract me from the things I was going through but only after 3 weeks when he broke the agreement we had and that kinda triggered me. You see, I've been fooled 3 times before, they all cheated. I mean, I know I can't blame him for what he did. Couple in a relationship have this kind of problems, much more with us as we are not in a relationship. I know exclusive friends with benefits is not a thing but it's what I want and need for now and that I all I want. With what he did, it kinda made me think that I wasn't enough and it made me wonder if I will ever be enough for anyone. I'm not enough for my family, for that friend I mentioned earlier and I am also not enough for this guy. The only thing I liked about it was, he had the courage to tell me and own up to it.
* My work has been overwhelming me for the past months and my performance is failing. With all the things that distracts me about my personal life and the load of work, its not really helping me. I came up to the point where my boss has talked to me about my work and I still have lots of pending work.
* And lastly, I am flat broke now. I honestly don't know what happened, how this happened. But I am guessing its because of my excessive expense. I always go out and meet up with people. I travel. Do things outside. Buy stuff I don't need. Treat my friends whenever where out somewhere. I think that was me coping up with things that's happening in my life and now it has caught up to me.

With all of these that has happened, the intensity of my suicidal thoughts has grown stronger, but I won't do anything that would harm myself, that's a promise. I've come this far in this life, I wanna see the outcome. I wanna know how it feels like to be genuinely happy, I think I deserve that.

If you made it this far, I thank you so much for reading and spending time with me.",lonely,That Asian Girl,2022-03-29 12:05:30

Feels so bad to be so lonely but what's out there is just so much worse. And being lonely is terrible.

I found good people through my hobbies in the past, but not anymore as it seems. It happens time and time again. Always.

My morals have grown a lot too and now I stand up against sexism, homophobia, etc and see things with a lot more insight. So that hasn't helped either but I wouldn't change it. Or maybe it doesn't change anything, I've met decent people in the past who today still would find decent. So what is it?

People are just a lot more fucked up these days than a few years ago?

I don’t usually post on here but I’ve had some time to myself and I don’t think I have much longer. My name is is ash. I am 20 years old and I suffer with a severe eating disorder, depression, and anxiety. Now, I don’t want any of those “illnesses” to come across as an excuse for my actions because frankly not even for a second are they. 

I am in my second week of intense vomiting, hallucinating, pain and it only gets worse with every day that passes. I have chronic anorexia nervosa in which it’s been almost 2 weeks since I’ve been able to eat, I’m not starting to struggle with even keeping water down. I’m writing this note because I’m really scared.

I know at the end of the day no one will most likely read this. But I’m scared. I’m a 20 year old kid who’s on the verge of having his body shut down. I recently also separated with my girlfriend of 3 years and that’s playing a big role into my mental deterioration on top of my physical health. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m alone in the hospital. No family. No friends. No love. All i want is for someone to think about me one last time if that’s all I have. 

Anyways Reddit. Thank you, if you took the time to read this just know I appreciate you more than you’ll know.

I love myself. I have done therapy for a few years and it has really helped me to finally love the person that I am. To love my story, my heart, my sadness - just all of it. But I still cannot get rid of the bad thoughts I have about myself. Me not deserving love, care and happiness. Every day is a fight with myself, of not letting those thoughts take over my life and some days it just wins. The love for myself is still there but it even sometimes pours gasoline on it all: „I am deserving of so much love, why do I never feel it then?!“ - Am I broken? Ah, I just don’t know.. There are so many thoughts in my head, one louder than the next. 

Why does no one love me? Or why don’t I feel loved by the people that might love me or say they do? I wish I could feel and accept love, but I don’t know how.

Sometimes I think that some other „lost soul“ understands me or I fall in love with the brokenness of someone else, in the hope that that person might finally see me for ME, all of me, and understand what goes on in my head, just like I want to love someone with all their dark sides, even because of them. But maybe I don’t deserve it. Just maybe, I don’t deserve love. Who am I to be loved and love in return. Sounds so fucking cheesy, but I mean it. This weird little human existence on this weird little planet - why should I be entitled to feel love and connection?

And so I spin my sad little stories night after night.. just that today I’m sharing parts of it with you, in the hope you will feel less alone because of it.

This month I met the most beautiful girl at a comedy club. She's a 10/10 in looks and quite nice too. My voice was shaking the first time I started talking to her because I was that anxious. It's gotten better but I was still super nervous around her and would be afraid to ask to kiss her although it was obvious she liked me too. On 5th date and After a night of drinking she finally asked if we could watch a movie at my place. I agreed. My heart was racing the whole time we were driving home and even at home. I finally found my balls and told her I wanna kiss her and we hooked up. Sex wasnt great but thats ok for the first time but Im not sure i even enjoyed it. I didnt find her attractive enough. While she is hot I just like different body type.

 Well that was Friday and I woke up super depressed after. Once again my brain and gut feeling is screaming she is not the one. All those butterflies flew away and I feel nothing. I do wanna be in love and love her but I dont. I feel like Im probably forcing it to happen just because Im lonely.

The event requires a suit. Now, I can get a suit. But it costs like $100 to tailor it due to such short notice. And I don't want to ask my parents for that kind of money. Well, I did. And they said it was too expensive. They are right.

But the crazy thing is, I picked the suit and outfit in such a way that I feel good. I don't even care that others don't like it. My mom hated it. I persisted. I just want to look good for myself for once. I haven't felt like that for two years. I have no confidence because of it, and I just, just once, wanted to feel good.

I convinced my mom to stop feeling guilty and told her I wasn't going. Now I just have to convince myself. I want to look good, just this once, so I cannot have any regrets about this event. I should at least get one such chance, and now I'm going to miss it.

434,cooblat,1648486470,1,"It's been 2 years I'm almost completly alone, and these last 2 months, I really realised it, and it's hitting me very hard...

Since my parents divorced, when I was 10 (I'm 20 now), I've moved several times. It didn't help the introvert I am to improve my social skills, and to have social interactions. The only relationship I've ever had ended up falling apart because I had to move to another place very far away.
High school was really cool tho, and it made me forget that, but the time I moved to another city to go to uni, I instantly closed on myself and at that time it was not a problem to me, I had my little hobbies, was still lonely, but it was ok even though I wished to have someone by my side sometimes. 
And then I dropped uni for a great opportunity that allowed me to work in one of my passions, sailing. But now, here I am, having a completely different rythm of life than every other people of my age, I work the summer, in a touristic place, and the winter, there is no one left. 

My best friend even though I moved several times is somone that I met at 3years old. But as we grew up fra away, the more time passing now, the more time I realise I don't have fun with him, we don't have the same humor at all, I tend to joke a lot and he doesn't, we don't share any hobies, music taste, like nothing....

And some other buddies that I game with sometimes. 
I have better remations with older people, that work. That's cool for friendship, but doesn't help finding love.

 I don't know what to do, I'm really open minded, I have a fine body and I'm not ugly, I'm funny and I love humor, have a good situation, have a pretty good amount of culture (thanks to travels), I speak 3.5 languages and yet I see complete mysoginist dickheads and idiots having social success, that's it, I'm lossed. I don't feel like I deserve it. And now that recently I finaly found a way to love myself, I'm putting everything I do and say in question and ask myself what's wrong with me. Here I am, overthinking again, but I need to take this out of my chest. 

I wanna find someone, I'm trying to do more social activites, but I'ts hard, eventually it will come. I keep hope and will never loose it or fall in depression. Sad moments hit sometimes that's all... 

I tried dating sites and apps, and honestly I wish I'd never give them a shot. 

I met someone through internet and we clicked instantly, but now it's already fading away, I feel like I fell in real love for the first time in my life, but it's an impossible one, she doesn't have any interest in me, I get attached to people way to easily, and It has never ended up being good yet.

I should probably shoot her a message expressing my feelings, but It would most likely end up every interaction we have, even a possible friendship I'd love to have. I'm probably not courageous enough to send such a message. 

That's it.
I want to make other people happy, but I don't have anyone to cherish, I hope it will come soon, ending lonely forever is my biggest fear and I'll never be able to accept it if I end up being alone. 

If you wanna have a chat, feel free. 

Have a nice day, thanks for reading if you made it to the end!

436,Crpyt-,1648486020,1,"This is a lot, so stick with me. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years now. We go to the same school and have mutual friends. I wouldn’t say I’m friends with the girl that this story is about, but we exchange hi’s throughout the hall sometimes and hug. Before I go into depth about the story, let me paint a picture of the girl for you. I’ll refer to her as M. M is a seemingly nice girl, shy but with a fair number of friends, good grades, etc. She had a situation  with my old friend who now attends my high school since sophomore year.My old friend (Elle) recently started dating her boyfriend this year and (M) used to have a crush on him freshman year and has flirted with him this year given the fact that he has a girlfriend, (Elle’s) boyfriend wasn’t so reserved from the flirting and sometimes participated in it. For example, he hugged her for a long time while swaying back and forth, met up during classes while (Elle) wasn’t here for a week, allowed her to lie on his shoulder, and she even tried to hold his hand while he was standing there with his girlfriend. (M) talks to Elle occasionally and acts all nice, but she’s a bit conniving to me at least. Obviously, (Elle) was bothered by this and texted (M) about it. (M) didn’t text her for awhile and seemed upset about how (Elle) was bothered which (M) had no right. She eventually responded and started telling the boyfriend that (Elle) was jealous (M’s) birthday was last Friday and (Elle) wasn’t invited, but her boyfriend was. My boyfriend and I were invited, and I was the reason (Elle) found out about it. So now that you have somewhat of an idea of who she is, I’ll explain the situation with her and my boyfriend. My boyfriend and her have apparently been friends since freshman year (I've been with my boyfriend since freshman year and I don’t remember them being that close). Her and my boyfriend were together for some of my ice skating birthday event in February and my boyfriend said it was so she wouldn’t feel left out and suggested I stay with my friend Z so he wouldn’t feel left out (the only people I invited were M, Elle and her boyfriend, my boyfriend and my friend Z. M and Z probably would have felt left out if the couples stayed together because M and Z weren’t acquainted. They were talking and walking, and he ended up being one of the first people she told was dating someone from our school. No offense, but why are you seeking relationship advice from him, of all people? From my understanding they aren’t close like that. My friend (Elle) agreed and we both feel a little weird about it. It was just brought up again earlier today at lunch because my boyfriend told us how she’s having boy problems. ""M is having boy problems. You know how M and I text right? Well, she texted me about how her boyfriend doesn’t give her affection and didn’t go to her birthday party ""- My boyfriend, it just bothers me because they don’t just text about her boyfriend and their problems, but they send each other memes and she used to take pictures of him sleeping in class. My boyfriend clearly doesn’t think anything of it, but I do, and it upsets me and has me a little vexed. Am I being irrational or are my feelings valid?

439,Jurez1313,1648484365,1,"I've come to the conclusion that I will always be alone. I'm just not interesting enough, outgoing enough, funny enough, or useful enough for anyone to want to be in my life. Just struggling to cope with that realization. It's like, I can't stop my brain from wanting what I know I cannot have. Previously I've been able to distract myself and occupy my thoughts with other things, but those other things have stopped being enough to do so, the thoughts have become so overwhelming.  

To become more interesting, I'd need to do more things. Get more hobbies. Have more experiences. But every time I think of a new hobby to try, I come up blank. No hobby seems even remotely interesting enough, or even possible, for me to pick up. They're all too expensive, too physically demanding, or require too much patience/waiting to keep my interest. The few that don't fall under those categories, I just have no interest in learning or investing time into, because I just innately know I will not enjoy it (normally as I have not enjoyed very similar activities in the past).  

And one cannot really ""become"" outgoing, which is required to become funny. I could become useful by learning some skill, regardless of whether I enjoy it, but I've tried doing that in the past to no avail (college twice, online courses as well, all failed).  

Some people say to volunteer my time, as this can provide fulfillment even if the activity itself is not enjoyable. I've looked and looked, searched high and low, scoured the internet and even asked in my city's subreddit. There doesn't seem to be a single volunteer position that I am qualified for, that has shifts I can work. Probably 80-90% of volunteer positions I find only have weekday shifts available, no weekends or evenings. I could e-mail asking ones that I find myself suitable for, but if they're not advertising for those shifts, it's likely because they're always filled, if they exist at all.  

So I'm out of ideas. The few hobbies I do have - playing video games &amp; board/card games, watching movies &amp; TV shows - do not really hold my attention for very long anymore. You could say gaming might allow me to meet people, and normally you'd be right. But while I have no problem socializing with people online, as soon as it comes to interacting face-to-face/IRL, I completely freeze up, especially if we don't have something to talk about (like we do when we're playing a game - the game itself is the topic of conversation 99% of the time). Similarly, board &amp; card game meetups are all online now, too, which means they aren't even necessarily with people in my area.

My family situation is really difficult. My mum has been really toxic with me and can’t support me. I’m triggered by a lot of things she does and it makes me so worried and hopeless, my body goes into flight response because I get so worried about my mental well-being. My dad keeps to himself and we have no connection. They seem like okay parents at times but they’ve done some horrible things and I can’t see them in a good light most of the time. Sometimes when I’ve been so stressed with uni and work I’ve had to go to my mum because I was desperate for any kind of support. I really struggled to support myself at that time and really needed someone. And it helped only temporarily just for that day. When I’ve sought support from my parents in the past it’s completely back lashed and that’s why I hardly go to them. However, I’ve had to a few times when it was too unbearable to deal with the pain in my own. The pain of feeling like you’re so alone and that you won’t experience any happiness, meet anyone you love or have anyone love you back. It’s the most unbearable feeling. Things that usually trigger it are social situations. I’m so critical of myself and hate myself when make a mistake where I look dumb, accidentally give the wrong impression, inconvenience someone or when I try to read peoples minds and believe them to be negative things about me. When this happens I start thinking about my family situation and how horrible it is because they aren’t there for me. All my negative thoughts about them and myself make me feel so unloved. I am so worried about myself because I have so many symptoms from my stress and depression. And I’ve learned the conditions that I’m really likely ot develop when I’m older which include things like dementia etc. This makes me so anxious because I think my life is just doom and gloom and all i want is to be happy and loved and love others. I’m almost 20 years old and I feel like my life has just been extreme anxiety, depression and loneliness and so much pain. Everyone thinks of me as just a nice person but that’s all I am. I guess sometimes some people will message me but I’m 90% of the time always messaging them first. All I need is just one person to really care about me. I want to be able to talk to someone and connect with them. I haven’t been able to do it and it’s killing me.

I want to find someone who has had experiences similar especially regarding my family situation so I don’t feel so alone. I feel better when I know people have had it worst than me. Once when I fell into one of my debilitating episodes of feeling hopeless and so alone I forced myself to think about how my parents aren’t that evil and that someone definelty has experienced something similar and worst. But it was so hard to believe this. I just pray to god that I’ll have the strength to love myself and just be there for me (but I have no idea how to when I don’t like myself, when I’m so sad and depressed, when I’m so behind in University, when people reinforce all the negative things about me etc) or if God can put someone in my life that really loves me and is there for me.

I met a guy in college who seemed really friendly and he initiated conversation with me as he saw I was new and didn't know anyone. Within weeks of knowing him I found out he is doing Mechanical Engineering in college, plays four instruments and composes brilliant music, writes fantastic stories, plays chess very well( has won many inter-college tournaments),  is very enthusiastic and knows a lot about economics and politics and often talks about the things he wants to do for the betterment of the country. 

He also has a blog where he shares his opinions and thoughts on various topics, and  everytime I read something written by him, I'm blown away by his depth of thought and the interesting perspectives he always manages to introduce his readers too. He plans to do a Master's degree in Quantitative Economics after graduation, and I'm sure he'll get into a great university and be awesome no matter where he goes. 


I on the other hand am doing a easy humanities degree and I chose it because it was easy, my hobbies are watching Netflix and going on Reddit, and am boring and dumb and ignorant. Everytime I have a conversation with him it's mostly me nodding along to whatever he says and sometimes i don't even understand anything, but he patiently explains everything to me. 


I'm slowly cutting contact with him because I feel like an embarrassment of a friend and also because I don't have anything to contribute or be of any use in our friendship. I feel very inferior and know that he's better off being friends with people who are on par with him mentally, and can consistently keep up with him.

458,Boring_Ad_7144,1648473254,1,"Hi, I'm  in the UK. 

I've been homeschooled for a long time, so I have no friends and really no social life outside of work which sees me only ever really interacting with people a fair bit older than me. 

The truth is, for the most part, I don't care about the lack of a social life, but there are parts of it that I feel I can't live without, most notably I want to have a girlfriend. 

The fact is, I don't really care about sex, so it's not about that, but I just want to find that one person to spend the rest of my life with, and I know I'd be a great boyfriend (and eventually husband and maybe even father), because I'd genuinely care about her, and I'd do anything for her to be happy, but quite frankly I just can't find anything like that. 

I've spent so much time on the different dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, POF, etc.) and I've sent so many messages and swiped right so many times, but nothing has cone of any of it. 

I've never been rude, or disrespectful or insulting, and I've always tried to be honest and kind. 

I used to be very self conscious, but not so much anymore. I think I look half decent, I haven't got six pack abs, but it's not like I'm repulsive or anything, the truth is, I'd put myself in the 'average' category. 

I get that some girls will only care about you looking like a supermodel, or being rich, and I'm quite happy to let those ones jog on, but I just have to think that after all this time, if I haven't found at least one person out there that likes me, then what's so wrong with me? 

I don't think my photos are awful, my bio isn't awful, I genuinely don't know what I'm doing wrong. The closest I've actually had to anything on these apps, was the one time I got catfished and stood up. 

Other than that, I've had maybe half a dozen or so message me back, but they all ghost out eventually.

Every day I wake up depressed and lonely, and I feel like I don't have anything to be happy about anymore. I can't remember the last time I smiled and meant it.

461,stherix,1648471072,1,"I’m from Singapore so don’t mind me if some things sounds weird/messy because it happened a while ago and it’s still bothering till this day.

I used to have quite a good friend group in Secondary school, it was small but i enjoyed it. 

In our final year (2020) , my bf and i got together.. one of my best friends(let’s call her 🐚) really hated my bf because of some childish things that happened when we were in Sec 1(i did tell her to move on because at the time we were 13). 
Anyways, in 2021 i entered College, that’s when my friends and i started to grow distant from one another,, which is normal because different schools and schedules. i did try my best to arrange meet up with 🐚 and my other friends but our schedules just didn’t work out.

Around August 2021, 🐚 started to rlly avoid me. i would tell her i miss her and i would like to meet up with her now and then but like usual , she isn’t free or i’m not free so i just decided to stop asking and wait for her school holidays. One day on IG, she posted this story on her spam saying how fake ppl can be, i replied to it asking what’s wrong, she then answered me in a very dry response… once again i asked her if i had done something wrong for her to reply me in such a manner, that’s when she burst out saying what a bad friend i am ,that i never made any efforts when it came to this friendship and that i always chose my bf over her. i decided to just take blame because i did feel like i chose my bf over her.. she then told me she doesn’t want to be friends anymore and i told her if that’s what she wants then i respect it. 

moving on , a day later i went to her place to confront/make up for things. we made up and moved on.

that’s when i realised she somewhat showed her true colours from the beginning.. she’s the type of person that if she wants something, she MUST get it. she has lazy eyes and has been insecure abt it,, i told her she looks perfectly normal the way she is but if she wants the surgery then go for it, she’s from indonesia so originally her fam planned to go back Indo for surgery but due to covid… you know the rest, she cries , beats and scolds her mum for the lazy eyes she has and it gotten to the extend of her mum having to beg her dad to get the surgery in SG(which isn’t cheap). the pattern doesn’t end there…i change my phone? she begs and beats her mother to beg her dad to change a phone too.

My conflict between 🐚 and me started when she started using excuses to not do the things that she has to do. she gotten into a LDR with some stranger from a mobile game twice too when i told her not too(FYI they broke up on my anniversary with my bf and she blames my anniversary…)

i’m not trying to make her sound bad but.. i miss how she used to be. the fact that she’s using my bf as an excuse to not like me anymore is ridiculous as well.

right now, im still in contact with some of my friends but we don’t rlly meet because of school but the 🐚‘s situation has been bothering me since the day she had that outburst on me..

any advice would be greatly appreciated but once again i’m sorry if the story/timeline is messy.",lonely,i only have my bf as my only friend + friendship rant,2022-03-28 23:37:52

He has this laundromat business that’s about to open and no one really cared about it except me, I’d go with him to check the place and see the goods and give him my insights on what’s good and what could be changed. Also , I was the only one who gave him a gift week before he traveled and he was so happy about it. lastly, im currently helping his older brother to find a job in the company i work for.

So he had to study aboard this late Feb for his diploma, and I’d really want to know how he’s doing. But i have these thoughts that since our friendship is the shortest (among the friends group) that he might find me annoying, and I too worry that I don’t want to disturb him from his studies ...

We’ve definitely gotten closer than when we first met but I still feel like I don’t know things about them that maybe I should. My friend has never voluntarily shared things with me really. I still feel like I don’t know them on a level that I should. I try to become closer with them, I tell them I’m always there for them if they want to talk or need someone to rely on. I will always be that friend. They have told me a few things that they’ve never told anyone before which I appreciate because that means they trust me.

They like going to the movies with me, they told me they enjoy it, but never do they ask me what we’re seeing this week, or when are we going. It’s always me. And I know they could be busy with other things in life, I understand that but this person is on their phone 24/7. I know they get many messages but it’s not that hard to text someone back if they’re waiting for a reply.

I hate that this friendship seems one sided, I seem to be putting in more effort than them and I hate it because I know I’m a good friend and a good person. I’ve never done anything to them that they would have something against me. I just want to know if they don’t care to be my friend anymore because I’m tired of putting in effort to people who don’t care to back. I’ve been feeling that with a lot of people lately and it’s taking a toll on me. As well to mention I asked them to make plans yesterday and they said they were going out and they invited me along, they were either going to two places so I said if you go to this place let me know and I’ll come. They texted me about 4 hours later while they were on their way to a place already, left me waiting and said they were doing something else and they already left anyways so I couldn’t even go if I wanted to.  So I’m asking anyone, if we usually see movies once per week, this new week is coming up, do I text them and initiate the plans? Or should I wait and see if they text me at all this week to ask, because I’m done trying to keep this friendship alive.",lonely,Not sure if my friend wants to be friends with me anymore or was ever my friend to begin with,2022-03-28 16:54:14

503,i-have-nofriends,1648444377,1,"A few years ago I used to have a really tight friend group. We were like each other’s second family and it was fucking amazing to be part of for as long as it lasted. That fell apart and I’ve been frozen out of socializing in a way ever since. I watched my old friends move on or go their own ways and all forget about me, and I kept in touch with some of them but it’s just not the same anymore. I don’t have this kind of close connection with anyone now and every day it feels like there’s a hole in my soul where those people together used to be.

I’m not especially close with my family and that’s been made even worse by the fact that I (and a couple close family members) are the only people in my family living outside our home country. 

Sure, I’ve met a lot of new people since then, and I’ve grown as a person too, but it just doesn’t feel like enough, and many days I don’t have anyone to talk to unless I reach out first. I feel like an afterthought in the lives of everyone around me. They all have other friends too who I feel like are so much better than me in every way and it leaves me with a feeling of “why bother? What can I offer?” And I’m afraid the answer will be nothing no matter how hard I try. I feel like if I died tomorrow no one would care, they would feel sad for a week at most and then it would be like I never even existed. Recently I noticed myself catching feelings for one of my friends and to me she’s important, but to her I’m just another dude she hangs out with occasionally. I have one person now who I could consider a close friend but if he made a list of people he cares about I’d be tenth place at best. It feels horrible. I feel like I’m living a shadow life, just waking up and forcing myself into doing everything I need to do, and eating and shitting and showering and going to sleep again. 

My family isn’t very understanding of mental health and they think I’ve become too soft and am “looking for problems because my life is too easy”, so I don’t really have anyone to say this to but it feels better to get it out somewhere.

But sometimes I wish the roles were switched y'know. I know it sounds pathetic, but I wish I was the one receiving physical affection. I wish I was the one being pet or cuddled. 

I'm surrounded by my family most of the time, but I'm more like a ghost that occasionally leaves its room.

He apologized profusely but a stupid half-assed apology doesnt make up for all the pain he caused. What really sucks is he was actually a wonderful partner and my first love, he just had a lot of difficult issues. He was also my first best friend and basically the only real friend i had throughout my teen years leading up to now which made the pain of having to leave him for my own sanity even worse. He saw every good and bad thing about me and decided in the end that its not enough after all, despite promising he'll love me forever while constantly calling me his soulmate, and that shit really fucks with my self worth and feeds into my self esteem issues. I know people arent obligated to stay or love you forever but this feels really cruel.

Why do I have to be like this? Why do I have to sit through this fucking life and watch my sister and her husband be happy and my parents be happy and see my old crush in Walmart being happy with her boyfriend? I have to listen to songs about people being happy and finding people to love them despite being way more fucked up than I am. I have to watch movies about people being happy finding each other. I have to watch to shows and anime and read books and manga about people finding people who love them despite their flaws. I have to watch all my fucking peers in college flit around being happy with their people. And I’m alone through it all, I’m just sat here with my eyes forced open, strapped to a chair and being made to take it all in. I have to watch every fucking person around me be happier than I’ve ever been in my whole life, happier than I’ll probably ever be.

I hate this. And why tf did I have to see her in Walmart? I was TWO GODDAMN HOURS away from my home to be in the same city as her (where my parents live) , and I just HAPPENED to be in Walmart at the same time this gorgeous, funny, kind af fucking bitch happens to be there. This fucking girl who my dumbass actually believed I might’ve had a chance with. What tf are the odds, dude. Shit like this makes me think there’s an evil god specifically torturing me.

I don’t fucking get how broken people find love. It doesn’t make any fucking sense. Aren’t people who’re fucked up not supposed to be lovable? But I see it happen all the goddamn time. But if they can be loved, why can’t I? What special kinda fucked up am I? Why tf do I even have to breathe if I’m that awful a person? I’m not on drugs, never smoked or drank, I’m not mean or abusive, I’m pretty fuckin smart. Literally the only fuckin thing wrong with me is no one has ever even had a goddamn crush on me, and it’s killed my self esteem. But apparently that’s all it fucking takes, that’s enough to disqualify you from having a happy life. Get a fucked, isolated, religiously traumatized childhood that makes you scared to fucking talk to a girl and that makes you hate yourself for even wanting to, and boom; now you’re fucked up and lonely until the day you fucking die.

I don’t fucking want this.

If I cut myself, I’m crazy, I have a reason for feeling as bad as I do. It would mean that I’m not just weak, I’m actually insane.

My account is new but I’ve been on Reddit and other socials before, and have seen plenty of “lonely” people looking for friends or lonely hearts. While it’s sweet that two unlucky people can find each other online, I’ve found that lots of these “forever alone” people are those constantly ghosting or leaving others then proceeding to bitch about their own solitude later like the world’s the problem. 

Don’t go getting to know people, making them devote their time, energy, and little clinging emotions to you all for you to dip without giving it a second thought. Some people really do hope and pray to find their potential life partner in subreddits like these. 

If you have the chance/luck of having a good person in your life, don’t fucking throw it away and victimize yourself. This is one reason why people have intense trust issues.

544,TheUnluckyR,1648429842,1,"I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’m 25. About 4-5 years ago I found someone I meshed with beautifully. I thought maybe it could be my first girlfriend. Then she started lying to me. I’d have mutual friends tell me oh ____ and ____ are fwb. And I’d be like oh I didn’t know that. I told her hey people are saying this about you and she’d be like no. That’s a lie (comes to tell me 3 years later that it was true) and she did this with maybe 3 different people. I was crushed and ended up vomiting cause my body doesn’t feel anxiety and just builds up stress. 

A few years later I meet a new girl. She’s very beautiful and starts talking to me. I’m shocked but in my head I’m like oh she’s nice. Along with that I’m still not trusting of people cause…. People lie. We go for dinner, take a day trip, go on mad dates. We both state we like each other and so I ask her. “Will you be my girlfriend?” She says no. I don’t take it to heart cause her reasoning is we’re co workers. Which is totally fair. I’m not upset by it and carry on with my life. A few weeks later my friend tells me she saw her with another guy holding hands in another city. When she saw my friend, she told her “don’t tell him you saw me here”. She tells me cause she knew how much I liked her and again. I’m hurt. My vomiting starts again (between 2019-2021 it Avg’d about once every 3 days). But whatever I forgive I forget. 

Another few years pass and that same girl in the other city tells me she’s obsessed with me. Sends me all these pictures, suggestive texts. We have great conversation it’s beautiful and I fall for her. I tell her I’ll go visit her and she’s beyond happy. She tells me imma get laid (I’m a virgin) and I’m more than happy to lose it to her. I go to her city and the day before she tells me she’s going through some family stuff and she’s not the happiest so obviously I’m not gonna pressure someone who’s sad so I respect and enjoy my weekend there. Few days pass and she tells me she was seeing someone else and they make her so happy. 

Again. I’m crushed. I dont know what I’m doing wrong… it sucks. Maybe I’m unlucky. Maybe I’m just easy to step on (I’m still friends with all of them). Either way I’ve come to the conclusion I’m just unloveable. Maybe one day someone will love me the same way I love everyone.",lonely,I’m unloveable.,2022-03-28 12:10:42
545,starsofthelick,1648429419,1,"Just needing a place to get a few things out, and processing them by writing it out is helpful. Apologies if it's not the most coherent, easy to follow.

A year ago, I was looking to get married to the woman I had been with for 3-4 years. Everything in our relationship moved so, so fast. We only knew each other for 8-9 months before I moved hours away when I transferred to a different graduate program. We did long distance for close to a year. We got engaged and just a month later, she had a very urgent surgery for a tumor removal. Surgery was successful, we moved in together, and a year later, moved again out state to ""begin"" our lives. I was finished with my studies and starting my new career as she was continuing school for another few years. Last summer, some things came out in the relationship that I won't go into detail about here. I believe these things came out because I was so freaked out about getting married to a woman I'm not absolutely sure I still deeply loved. Just weeks before the wedding, we called it off and I ended the relationship. Devastating. But...relieving. It felt like the right call and was one of the first times I ever truly followed my gut. 

Just weeks after, I was living alone and looking for something very, very casual...very different from my usual lifestyle. I went on a dating app, expecting it to fall flat. Met a girl. Turns out we both developed a very strong connection and hit it off. Told her everything about my previous situation and recent breakup. We knew what we were getting into, but still went with our guts, telling us that we really have something here. We've been dating for just a few months and decided to end it yesterday. In a way, it felt very sudden to me as I was the one who initiated it. But... I've been feeling an uneasiness in me for the last week. 

Everything on paper was great. Strong physical, intellectual and emotional connection. But lots of worries about the future (again, potential moving situation.) Suddenly, things started getting very serious, and I began asking myself, ""How can I possibly be ready for this?"" Despite having such a deep, intimate connection with this woman. I was awfully good at convincing myself that I had grieved my prior relationship. I hadn't. Not so much missing my ex, but just processing the last 4 years of my life. 

Though I hope there is one day a future with this amazing woman just broke up with, I know I have so much work to do on my own. I've always been so terrified of being alone. I know that there can be comfort and peace in being alone, but I've so often associated aloneness with loneliness. I'm nearing 27, and know there's still so much out there to experience. But damn, I struggle so much with being by myself. I don't have a very strong local support system, but I have no desire to move back home closer to family (I love them. It would feel like a step back, for me). I work as a mental health professional and love my job, despite its tendency to take such an emotional toll. I'm starting my own therapy back up in the next week, which I know I've been avoiding!

Anyway, not really sure what I'm looking for. But, I know happiness must come from within, and my people pleasing tendencies only leave others and myself hurt. Going from relationship to relationship is not a fix to inner issues. I know this. But, alas.

The transition of a life of comfort to a life of poverty will be an unwelcome adjustment to say the least. But I can’t stay here forever. I can’t make someone love me, be intimate with me, do anything remotely similar to the way a husband should behave. I feel alone when he sits near me. Conversation is like pulling teeth or watching paint dry. At the time I married him two years ago I was at my lowest. There really isn’t much excuse to be honest. I’m desperate for human connection but all I receive is messages from married men that are currently bored with their wives. Once they get laid I suppose their wife then again becomes appealing and I never hear from those “friends” again. My male friends tell me there are men out there that will want me, need me, and stick around. But I completely disagree. No one stays. No one is capable of consistency. And now it seems like if I ended up with someone else I’d just be wondering who they were talking to behind my back. The mistakes of my 20’s have led me down a dark path with no light in sight. I don’t see any way out of this. Before you suggest couples counseling (done it) or report me to Reddit for suicide resources let me tell you that ironically I am a mental health professional.

I don't know how to make friends though I have various interests. I read a lot but never had a friend to share that with me.
 I watch mindfukk shows and fantasy and I'm a mcu fan and watch anime but never had a friend that would watch that with me.
Listen to music and podcasts all day but don't have someone to talk about the ideas in my mind.
I love art and fashion and can surf artworks all day. Even the only sport I play(pingpong) require 2 people and didn't play it since mid school.

 I'm a really carrying person and nonjudgmental but I don't think that I'm with like-minded people. Don't mean that I'm better just feeling strange.

But anyway, I've grown up and now have an office job and live alone. And while on paper I'm ""doing better"", I am so not. 

My whole life I haven't let people get close to me. I'd love to have friends but I can't because there is something call it social anxiety or something that causes me to reject invitations so I always end up with no friends.

Since I don't go out it is pretty much impossible for me to meet a girl. It just won't happen. I work at a small office so the chances of me meeting someone there are beyond slim.

I know there are a lot of people shorter than me, but in my country this height is far below average. So I’ve always been the shortest kid everywhere, all girls and boys were taller than me. Of course, I was bullied a lot, but I try to forget it. I remember I used to measure my height many times because I couldn’t believe it that I was actually 5”6. Well, ok, that’s not the topic.

At least that’s what he’s been telling me.

I’m in therapy and take anti depressants, but nothing seems to help me make friends or look for emotional connections outside of my weak relationship. 
He makes me feel like such a loser because he seems to be able to make plans with his friends so easily. He never even bothers to invite me to do things. When we do hang out, it’s either at my apartment or his apartment. We live in Atlanta, and there are so many things I want to do with him. I don’t just want to sit around with him, I need someone to spend quality time with, and someone who appreciates who I am.

614,imsuspendedsomehow,1648410925,1,"I have suffered with my fair share of mental health issues. I’ve dropped out of school and finally finished last year by homeschooling myself. I’ve never had a face to face friend. I was treated like a freak or a nobody. I went to hospital programs both inpatients and outpatients and even the saddest people there were able to build friendships. Surprisingly I was treated like shit there too. I spent a lot of time to myself because I didn’t feel I really fit anywhere.

A few years ago I made a discord and decided to try the online friend route. I’ve met a lot of people who have too claimed they were sad and lonely. Others told me they were socially awkward and were able to relate to the struggle of making friends. Yet they made friends and later left me to say I’m too much. That’s the thing these people who I thought were just like me keep finding people. The lonely people make friends. The introverts make friends. The people who also have mental health issues make friends. Those who said too many people have ghosted them ghosted me. Those who promised they would always be there and be nice to me turned on me just to tell me I meant nothing to them.

Why does it seem the people “just like me” still find people but I am still alone. I could get comments on this post or no comments at all and I will still be alone no matter how many people text me they don’t find comfort in me. They don’t see me as a person they want to talk to.

As time went by, I found to hard to make new friends due to me being extremely socially awkward and introverted. I rarely got to see my close friends that I've known for years and that got me even more upset (I lived far from my home town so I barely got to see them). By the end of the first semester, I felt quite depressed and started having negative thoughts regarding how much of a loser I am and if there is something wrong with me that made people not want to talk to me.

During the Christmas break, a girl from a random group project I was in started texting me. We didn't talk much to each other in person. However, when we started texting each other, we surprisingly had alot in common. It was also the first time a person of the opposite sex had shown some interest and ""signs of attraction"" towards me, which was kinda overwhelming for me at that time. After a week into the second semester we hung out. She invited me over to her place for tea and we talked for hours. I confessed that I had feelings for her (looking back I should've not done that so early). Was initially awkward, but then we started holding hands, had a bit of banter and flirted with each other for a while. 

That evening was the last time I seen her in person. After that, she started skipping classes, texting less frequently and almost seemed like she didn't want to talk to me anymore. After a couple a weeks, she told me she went back to her home town and said she prob will drop out. I fell into a deep depression afterwards caus the only person that I could relate to and vibe with in my university, just out of the blue disappeared from my life. I kept beating myself over the idea that I might've done something that led to her dropping out to never see me again. She was being vague about why she didn't come to classes and why she wanted to drop out (she did tell me before she had mental health problems and a troubled past so that could play a part). As a result I became a bit pushy and desperate for her to stay, without acknowleding her feelings.

I haven't been to college in 4 weeks due to my depression getting in the way and the negative thoughts I had previously coming back to overwhelm me. Tomorrow, I'm returning with only 2 weeks left of this semester, and I'm a bit anxious about it. Idk how I'm going to spend the next couple years in college being alone and sad, and the thought of that makes me more depressed. I feel extremely guilty for the way I treated her the last few times we texted each other, but idk when to apologize since it seems she doesn't even want to talk to me anymore.

I say recently but its been a almost 2 months now and I'm still suffering from the sadness and the loneliness. She lost her friends due to drama and I decided to add her to my circle of friends because I thought it would be best if all of the important people in my life were friendly with each other. I regret that a bit now, I had a main circle of friends or the ""boys"" and an outer circle of friends, because of the breakup all the important friendships I've had has either crumbled or felt different. They chose sides and split with me and I don't blame them, and ever since the breakup every emotion I've bottled up came gushing out, the thoughts and the overthinking and the noises in my head don't stop and its gotten worse and worse to the point I almost always have to listen to something on my phone or else ill start breaking down. The outer friends chose her side and split with me and it saddens me how fast long time friends turn to strangers, I look at old pictures of me with them and my ex and its sad how only two of them remained.

My main circle of friends feels different, I treat them as family or as brothers, but recently either due to the breakup or me overthinking it feels different, everyone feels distant and despite them telling me otherwise I feel like they've gotten tired of me venting almost always because of how they ignore my messages and never invite me to anything like play games and go on calls. Another reason as to why I feel like they've grown distant or felt different is because one of my friends in the main circle is comforting my ex on almost on the daily and that hurt me a bit and made me overthink a lot, he knows that I haven't moved on and that I'm still waiting for her, and it feels like he's replacing me and I'm overthinking about how he has a hidden agenda. I stated how I feel and now he ignores me despite him being the one who was comforting me at the exact time of breakup and was the one who told me he will always be there for me, and funny enough he hasn't. I'm guessing he sees me differently and maybe the awkwardness between us has made the whole group uncomfortable or something, and for the past 2 months I've been alone because of the constant pain I feel when I see them and the crippling loneliness keeps me awake at night. Dealing with the breakup and with the sudden loss of friends and the death of my friend and dog with no one to talk to has been hard and I decided to talk vent it here because I have no one to talk to about it and I'm so overwhelmed with everything and I don't think I can last any longer.",lonely,Lost friends due to a breakup and lots of overthinking.,2022-03-28 04:44:57

I've become completely cut off from any kind of bond with anyone and it kills me inside that I have never been able to experience a 'normal' summer out with friends and just living life without constantly questioning my actions or doubting myself since I'm insecure and self-conscious. 

No family down here where I'm living at the moment, and definitely no friends or gf I can go to the beach with and walk and talk and eat ice cream with. That's literally all I want and I'd be completely content with only that every weekend or so but instead I'm riding down the seafront or walking through town and all I see are happy families or couples enjoying the weather together. It makes you feel even more alone than you already are (which I didn't think was possible!).

It's a double-edged sword because the weather is so nice out so you almost have to go out or you'd feel guilty for not taking advantage of it. But obviously on the other hand as soon as you go out and try to do normal 'summery' things you quickly realise it's gonna be a constant battle of anxiety, sadness, loneliness from seeing the rest of humanity living it up without you.

For anyone else in the UK, aren't pubs and beer gardens a great place to spend lazy Saturday and Sunday afternoons with a few mates? If only I had a group to do it with that I could let loose around and just chill in the sun while necking a few pints ;)

So I'm turning 21 in a couple of days, but ever since I left home for college about 3 years ago, I have been spending my birthday alone and I suffer the most around this time of the year. 
When I was alone on my 19th birthday, I was still emotionally okay because I still had high hopes for the future of finding friends and maybe a girlfriend too if I'm lucky enough. After a year, the special double-decade 20th birthday rolls along and nothing has changed. All the people I've tried to make friends with always have more important priorities or some COVID excuse, and I'm always the only one initiating conversations and trying to meet up or they just stop texting entirely after a while. I've also tried to ask out a couple girls I was really interested in over the course of the year, but every time I was hit with the ""I'd date you if you were taller"" (but that whole topic is for another post)... I spent my 20th birthday alone, because even after swallowing my pride and straight up texting people if they wanted to spend my birthday with me, they either said they had other plans or just didn't respond at all even afterwards when they probably should have seen the text by then. So I bought a small cake and a candle from Walmart to facetime my parents with to let them think that I'm doing okay, and so they can sing me happy birthday since they couldn't make it this year either. After they hung up, I continued to sit on the floor in my dark apartment room and just cried for hours without ever being calm enough to even taste the cake. I don't know what got into me when I did this, but after I couldn't emotionally handle the pain anymore, I relit the candle and just held it up to the bottom of my forearm in hopes  of the physical pain of getting burnt overpowering my emotional pain of being chronically alone, but I can say for a fact that it did not. I kinda just plopped over and cried myself to sleep after that lol. It wasn't until the next day that I realized how stupid I was to harm myself like that, and I had to deal with a big blister on my forearm for 2 weeks that hurt like hell every time I showered.
So almost a year has passed now, and I've made a couple new friends with whom I study and chat with whenever I am on campus, but nothing deep enough to call them close friends, since they never text/call for things besides schoolwork. I'm also still invisible to girls because of my height apparently. Some days I wake up wishing there was someone beside me, and some days I wish I didn't wake up at all. I feel lonely, empty, and unloved. That's where I'm at mentally right now. Most people online tell me that I need professional help, but I think I just need a friend. Anyone in the world will do, so long as I can feel from just 1 single person (besides my parents) that I am cared for. It's my 21st birthday in a couple days, the BIG 21st where you go out with friends and get your first drink at a bar or club and have a blast. I'm supposed to be in my prime, supposed to live best days of my life his year, but I just feel like I'm missing out in life... I've already accepted that I am going to be alone for my birthday again this year, but I don't want to resort to self harm again in order to cope with the pain. Do you have any suggestions/advice for what I can do to cope, improve my situation, or would possibly be down to chat or keep me company on my birthday? I do not care who you are, girl or guy, what you look like, what you sound like, or what you enjoy doing; I'll literally take anyone as a friend. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, it means a lot to me. 

TL;DR: I've spent my past 2 birthdays alone, and I will soon be alone for my birthday again. I can't seem to make close friends or find a gf. I feel lonely, empty, and unloved. I coped with the pain in the worst possible way last year, and I dont want to go through that again. Any advice on how to cope with the pain, improve my situation, or wanna chat some?",lonely,Alone on my Birthday again,2022-03-28 04:31:13
647,zealousfucker420,1648401364,1,"First of all I'm sorry for my awkward english cuz its not my 1st language. I'm 16 (almost 17) and never had some real ""friends"" but for the majority of life I just didn't care, I've been playing games, watching some series/anime or sometimes doing some DIY projects with my mate. However as I became teen, I slowly started feeling alone,  looking at my classmates hanging out in city, going on parties, having partners etc. One of my mates is even more not-social than me, but unlike me, he seems to just be used to his life, or even prefer it over having many social relations. I'm not like this - I really enjoyed rare moments in my life with my ""friends"", I often think about hanging out, going on parties, drinking with people and talking to my crush, and It hurts more and more every day. Every day music sounds less good, games are more boring, even playing Minecraft or other games with my 2 mates on dc stops being so enjoyable. Only reason I come out of my house except school - going on gym - starts to feel pointless, like I dont achieve anything even if my body is visibly more ripped than year ago. I start to lose any motivation.


In fact, I have a few ""friends"" since I went to highschool, but with half of them I talk only in school. For the one of a few people I actually stay in touch, I'm just some mate, who isn't close to him, and he doesn't actually care about me. I asked him once if he can invite me to his 18th birthday, and he said he cant because he has bday the same day as his classmate, and he isn't organising his own party so he can invite only 1 person blah blah blah. I understood that but then it turned out not only it was a lie, but he had a 3 fucking bday partys, and didnt tell me about any of them. Another guy seems more to be actually my friend, but yesterday he was calling me from some party I didnt even know about with his mates, and I was so fucking jealous. Besides them, I have a friend I actually spend most time with, and click really good with him, but I dont wanna be some fucking loser with 1-2 friends just meeting from time to time, I wanna have a normal social life, hanging out with more people, spending time in a group drinking and smoking weed. People thinking about me as some alone loser without any friends is one of my biggest fears. I really like a girl from my class since like 2 years, but we barely had any talk, and it even wasn't any personal conversations, just something about homework or idk. I finally understood I need to talk her first if I wanna have any chance, but I'm so awakward talking to people I barely know. However I noticed my social skills increase when I'm drunk, so my only hope it to talk to her on ""półmetek"" which is a kind of school party we will have in 1 month (everyone from class is invited so It's nothing to be proud about). I almost always spent summer vacations alone, but only the last year it started to hurt, and I'm afraid it will hurt even more this year. 


I know some people will tell me to just talk to other people, ask them to hangout etc. But I actually asked my ""friends"" if they wanna hangout a few times, and we actually did only once and got drunk, but rest of the times they either didnt want, didnt have time, or hanged out with other people. I dont know what to do, maybe I should just try to get used to my loser life and accept it.

The hostel i stay in makes me feel very lonely... its like sometimes i dont even exist, i just want to finish these 4 years and leave more than anything.  


my goal this year was to make a girl friend, how am i gonna make one when this college doesn't even let us LOOK at girls ffs.

I've known them for almost 7 years now. One of the main reason for this is after 10th grade we chose different groups, like all of my friends opted for commerce while i chose computer science. So i was in a different class from the others. Now they got a new set of friends and they spend time together in the weekends. I wanted to watch this movie (spiderman nwh) in the theatre with them but they all ended up watching the film with their new friends. And recently i had my birthday and no one seemed to remember it untill one of them messaged in the group chat wishing me around 6pm. And I'm introverted so I find it difficult to start a conversation with my class boys even though they are extremely nice towards me.

of dating and romance and the attempts that I’ve made to find that special someone just ended up making acquaintances and getting ghosted. In the past I’d get frustrated and sad about why and how these things keep happening to me and I continue to think about all the reasons why it went wrong and to be fair to them I can tend to be an asshole or insensitive sometimes which to me is always a hard pill to swallow and I’m learning to become more aware of my attitude and grow my maturity and the more I think about it and the more I try to find “the one”, the realization of being alone and not desiring companionship becomes more and more comfortable to me. Don’t get me wrong the little desire to get married and have a family is still but this idea of no one is attracted or interested in you becomes more of a comfort and less worrying and as a hopeless romantic I’m a bit weirded out with being okay with not dreaming and wishing for the person to come into my life and make it complete and fulfilling. 

The internet is full of opinions of “get your shit together before you find someone” and “there’s a person for everybody who will make you complete” and both trains of thought are important in one way or another but at this point in time in my life both ends seem very tiresome and  unfulfilling with life getting in the way and people getting busy with their own lives I wouldn’t wanna get intertwined in their business. I don’t know what emotion to process this feeling cause it could be happy to go on with my life and do what I wanna do without the thought of love or I can be sad and say I’ll never find it but I really don’t know how to feel with the thought of not craving romance or intimacy anymore…it feels weird to me. 

Maybe I’m just a sociopath with no emotions or just being a pessimistic prick but I truly don’t know anymore and somewhere in my tired brain I shouldn’t even try to find why I feel this way but that’s something for another day.

697,InfinityXR,1648371291,1,"19M. I’m new here so just bare with me. So I feel like I’m slowly coming to a sudden realization about my life. After graduating high school, life has threw me around like a rock rattling inside a box on how to become an independent adult. While that was going on, I still had a bunch of close people that have stayed by my side. When it came to guidance, help, and company. I had my parents. I had very handful group of friends each unique and different with their own groups that I would have fun and vibe with. Lastly, I had my bestfriend who I wouldn’t trade anyone for the world. Everybody knows us as the dynamic duo. As the months and time has went on, things started to shift around but not chaotically and drastically, but slowly and painfully. What felt like a blur, my father passed and my mom was sent to a nursing home due to having Alzheimer’s. Suddenly, I lost a friend one by one until my “handful” became empty. We all drifted away. Through that, I still had my bestfriend. Until last week. There’s only so much arguments that can happen between two bestfriends until one decides to finally part ways. We had stupid and serious arguments before but we always came back to each other. This time it’s not going to happen. While I lost a lot of people throughout the months and years, one friend remained constant and to lose everybody you truly care about all to the last being, is a different type of tortured pain. I’ve been alone and had felt loneliness before whether I didn’t have any help, I didn’t fit in with certain people, or had someone simply just check up on me but this time feels different. I truly wonder if there’s something wrong with me? I’ve always had the question running in the back of my mind if I’m destined to be alone but after typing out of all this, I know I am. It makes me realize that If there are people that were destined or made for each other whether it is as their twin flame, soulmate, or some form of companionship, then what’s not to say that you can’t being completely and utterly alone?",lonely,The deterioration of loneliness.,2022-03-27 19:54:51

To be fair, extended isolation from having no friends for years, and never having a gf at my age have caused me to not even care. I almost wished something would take me out. I'm no threat to myself but maybe something will take me out. I was laying there with the IV in me realizing, I have nothing. I'm a stupid loser who no woman would ever and has ever wanted to be with. I'm unattractive as well because of course I am. What's the point? Why keep going? Everyone looks down on me. I'm physically suffering but that will clear up eventually. The mental issues will not. Having IRL friends and sig. others is what makes life worth living. Being alone while good sometimes is no way to live. I find no joy in anything anymore because I am truly broken. People don't understand and think I never leave the house.

I always felt like I don‘t fit in this society.
Nobody ever really knew me, not even my family. I was never able to fit into Peer groups and i learned to deal with ist pretty well.
But then all of a sudden I met this girl.
I thought she is that one of a kind girl you know?
I opened up about everything in my life to her, we talked for hours, days, weeks. For the first time in my life, after 22 years i felt understood and in peace with myself. My brain stopped overthinking each and every second of my life.
We got together and i loved her so much I can‘t even describe it. And I probably still love her..

Anyway. I always tried to be there for her and make her happy because she had a pretty bad time during covid. I did everything for her without expecting anything back.
It would be a bit too much to write it all down here. But in General I can say that she hurt me so often without noticing. For her every problem there was between us deep down was always my fault.
I got so depressed about it that I was ready to end it all. And when i told her that I could need her too now, she indirectly rejected me in a very hurtful way. I don‘t think she even noticed that.
In the end she broke up with me. When she did she also mentioned that her so called best friend told her that I‘m not good for her. The day after she already behaved like there never was anything between us. As if we always just would‘ve been friends what showed me that she planned it for longer and was totally in Peace with it.

This broke me so hard. It‘s over 6 months now and I‘m not able to trust any person anymore. I never felt so lonely in my life. As soon as I have a minute of silence my head explodes because of all my thoughts.
I can‘t talk about what she did to me to my family, it all just floats around in my head and I can’t stop thinking about it anymore. No matter how many people are around me, no matter how much I like them, I feel completely lonely in this world. There is nothing that makes me happy about being lonely anymore. Once I enjoyed being on my own because I learned how to live with it and how to benefit from it. But now I just feel like a hollow shell nobody even notices anymore. 
During the time I noticed that she was going to break up probably I wrote down all my thoughts on my phone because I wasn’t able to trust or to talk to anyone anymore. When I read through those 131 notes I don’t know how I’m still sitting here writing this post. I’m at the lowest point of my life ever. And I feel like it doesn’t get better anymore.

I (F20), was a college freshman in college when covid hit in March 2020. I stayed on campus when everyone was sent home , because I don't have a home to return tk. I was totally isolated from any human aside from a cafeteria lady who only said hi to me when I picked up food every few days. For two and a half months I didn't speak with another person. For two and a half months I didn't have an in-person conversation with another person. I know that this time really changed me, although I think I'm still learning how it did. 
After all of that, my sophomore year began and covid restrictions at my university kept everything under wraps. I was in online classes but only had physical, in person contact with 2 other people. 2.5 months into the school year, it turned into one other person.

Now it is my junior year. Things are fully opened up, people are getting back together, people have reconnected, connected, and are having the time of their lives. The people I used to be close to are back at it,, and yet I'm here.

I'm lonely.

I'm socially anxious, I'm afraid of getting close to people, I'm desperate to only keep conversation surface level and run away from anyone who tries to get closer. Why? I don't know.

The isolation I've been in these past two years have fucked with me. I am not the same person, I wish I was. I've been trying to be. 

Tonight there was a party and I went..., I've been to parties this whole year. Yet, I am awkward because the people I used to know have come back together and have formed new relationships and seem to be unfazed.
Yet I'm struggling and isolating myself.

I run into people and I run away

Yet I'm here crying my eyes out because I have no friends. It's lonely. It's lonely knowing that once people would consider you their close friends and take time out of their day to hangout and catch up.
Now I'm out of the loop, out of their life, a remnant of the past. I feel like I am a side character that shows up in season 1 and is only seen in the background for the next couple of seasons.

i consider her to be my first love, she helped me through a lot of hard times and i just feel so abandoned even if it’s not her fault. i’m just so lost and just lonely. i spent a year in love with this girl and then her all of the sudden disappearing has been awful for me.

Always had harmful thoughts come by once in a while since I knew I was going to be doing the same thing for 4 years. I did end up graduating high school and here I am now with still no friends but only 1 person that I am close with but I get super lonely when they hang out with their friends or they end up being busy since it just makes me realize that I literally have no one else to talk to or play video games with. I do have some co workers that talk to me but they’re more of acquaintances since they really only talk to me about work related stuff. I still come home with nothing to do even with video games I just get bored of playing something for like 10 mins. It just really sucks not having anyone else checking up on you or having people to hang out with. I just really hate being alone and I know there’s a lot of other people out there that are going through something similar but it just feels like everything is going to stay the same for me forever. Never really had no one else to talk about this so I figured I should post this here.",lonely,No friends for 5-6 years.,2022-03-27 17:53:19

719,Suitable-Internet-22,1648360475,1,"Hello! So I’m new to this thread and never wanted to admit it to myself, but I recently realized that I’ve been lonely almost my entire life. I’ve never had many friends and I’m 24.

What I also realize is that I’ve been suppressing my loneliness by getting into relationships. Yet, I still feel this hole that my previous partners just haven’t been able to fill. They say loneliness is missing yourself, and honestly I thought that was BS until recently. 

I think I started “missing myself” once I entered my 2nd year of high school. At first I was fine then during the middle of my sophomore year it kinda hit me that I never really had a good group of friends that I could relate to. Like sure, I knew people and spoke to them but they weren’t really “friends”. I did have a best friend who I met in 7th grade, but during the pandemic she said she had “outgrown our friendship.” This was also during the same time in which I broke up with my ex of almost 5 years. But my friend leaving me felt so much worse than the breakup. 

I had another best friend for a few years who became my girlfriend at 17. Then she me cuz of my mental health issues, and as a result out friends only became her friends. I felt extremely alienated &amp; isolated up until I got on some antidepressants &amp; came out as gay. 

Since then, I still feel like I’m not “me.” I was dealing with a lot of disassociation, depression, anxiety &amp; paranoia back when I was 17 and I feel like it totally changed my personality. I was also going through some other traumatic events that really impacted my trust issues. And even though I’ve been in 3 separate loving relationships, I still really struggle with trusting people in general. I guess that’s why I’m afraid of making more friends? I made one new friend at the beginning of this year which only lasted a short while once I found out how obsessively neurotic she was. She also crossed the line a few times with personal boundaries. 

I’ve also had to cut other very toxic people out of my life which has made me realize I was settling for toxicity simply because it just meant company. I’m just so sick of putting trust in people and then being betrayed by them.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. I’m super tired and I guess I just feel the urge to reach out to others who might be feeling this way too. I even downloaded an app to meet/make more friends, but I’m afraid of getting my hopes up.",lonely,I’ve been lonely almost my whole life,2022-03-27 16:54:35

I speak politely with manners and respect, maintain eye contact, proper posture, the whole 9 yards but everyone seems to just brush me off and I rarely get more than a hello. I hope it gets better but so far it’s not looking too good for me. I just want to be treated like an average person and hold friendships with other persons.

At the moment I am sad, sad because I can't do anything against that invisible wall in front of me, the impotence in my body is too much, I have never felt something similar in my life, it is too much that I don't know how to manage it, and as if that were not enough the memories chase me like children chasing an ice cream truck on a hot day, the nostalgia is punishing me for having lived good times with my family, for two years I could feel what it was like to be in the company of people you know and love, is it my problem for having experienced happiness with my family?, Having spent good times with my sister with whom I was able to rebuild my broken relationship with her in these two years, isn't that what I didn't have to do?, I was able to watch movies with my father and my mother because I didn't have time because of school, I had to fill my emptiness during these two years with these experiences in order not to live the loneliness again, that thing I felt when I was going to school and I was alone, because I was unable to socialize, the problem may have been me getting used to what it was like to feel accompanied, nostalgia is something that goes hand in hand with loneliness, I could feel what it was like to have a person I could talk to, it's me that's wrong, I'm a jerk for not being defensive when it was two years this nice.  

Person suffering from loneliness to which you give accompaniment for so long is the same as giving a child one sweet a day and from one moment to another no longer give him anything, and the result is just as dangerous as giving a matchbox to an arsonist inside an explosives factory, I’m afraid to see so many people gathered in my classroom, I don’t want to have to experience the same thing again, please someone help me, I don’t want to be alone again I don’t want anyone to talk to me for 7 hours straight, I want to wake up in my room on Monday at 6 with fifty minutes to get into my class online and then take my free time to talk to my sister I don’t want to feel that loneliness again I’ve had enough, school was easier while I could manage it I don’t know if I have autism or something that prevents me from being normal, I just ask to have a normal life in which none of this happens to me.

Crying doesn’t help me shit, I don’t want to repeat those moments like when I was little and I cried for anything, but I have to admit that in my most intimate moment at night with loneliness I imagine a scenario in which, after telling my week to my partner and my problems open my arms and I fall into them, and start crying like a child abandoned in a train station, i need a hug, while I was writing all my feelings in this post obviously I released a few tears but I did not make a sea since it would not solve anything.

744,throwingaway4753,1648354776,1,"I am lonely. for a long time, I didn't know how to identify the feeling because I was too young. Then, my pride prevented me from admitting it. Now, I am fully aware that what my behavior is. spying on ""happy couples"" on the internet, was jealousy. Those accounts that post pics of their friends groups of many people, I stalked them. In public, whenever someone was with someone else (family, friend, partner, whatever) I listened to them intently. Now, now I know why. I was jealous, I was lonely, I wanted what they had.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've thought of it more, this isn't so bad. Would I be happier with just one person, one lover whom I could commit to despite our flaws and arguments and bad/boring days? Probably. But I don't see that happening. It honestly hurts more to search for that. People give up when things stop being fun. They cheat. I have never cheated. I don't get why people do. Why they would rather cheat than just end a relationship? I can only think of three reasons why: 1, they don't wanna hurt someone's feelings by saying they have found someone else more appealing. 2, they want to have the new exciting person while stringing you along. 3, they are married. For the first, it is more hurtful to be cheated on than dumped, the second, ew, and the third, why did you get married if you weren't committed? Or at least get separated if you can't afford divorce if you are that done with your spouse? So all around, I do not understand.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's not just my romantic failures. I only have one friend and they are going to college three to hours away in August. They are bound to forget about me. I've done it before. We both don't want to lose each other so we text every week, then every other week, every month... until it's been a year since we talked and I'm left wondering what happened. But at that point, it's been too long, I can't try to text them anymore, it's too late.

&amp;#x200B;

None of you are reading this for any of that, though. The name of this subreddit is ""lonely"", you've read it all before a hundred times. Hell, you've LIVED it a hundred times if you're still reading. To the point, I think I should completely stop trying. Shut myself in with as minimal human contact as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, I need to finish my senior year of high school and continue going to work. And that will involve some human contact, sadly. But I mean keeping my head down and never talking to anyone, and if they talk to me, keeping it short and sweet. Taking orders at work as quickly as possible. Once I graduate, repeat the process until I can afford a living place of my own rather than my parent's house. Then? Then stay there. Unless a miracle strikes and I win the lottery, I'll still need a job, but if covid has proved anything it's that it's totally possible to work from home with zero human contact. And if I can't work that, I can get a ""real"" job and use the same strategies I used before.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, it would suck, I won't lie. But so does trying and failing all your life. I don't think I've ever made any close relationship with anyone, at least not one that lasted. Whoever said ""it's better to have loved and lost"" was full of shit. I want to spend every single second of my free time in my own space doing the few hobbies I have or on the internet where I control everything I see and hear. And the time I have that isn't free, well, I will spend as little of it interacting with humans as possible. I think this is the most sensible way to live. I think this is how I was meant to live. Whenever I try to interact with humans, I am ignored or mocked. It's been this way for years. Forever.

757,Count_Backwerdz,1648351363,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program co-director at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. I'm currently in the middle of the semester and taking 5 classes ( Just one semester left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! I'm also open to voice chat as well but there's certainly no expectation. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. It would be great to find some good company.

I’ve felt this way for probably 6 years now, I’m 16 and have amazing grades, am in pretty good physical condition, and do lots of extracurricular stuff and am very involved with all of them. A lot of people rely on me and think I have my life together, I act as a confidant and a person to talk to for a lot of people. 

But there the issue arises, I have no one like me in my life. I for some reason never focus on myself and am always trying to please other people; my parents, my teachers, coaches, etc. I have never had a girlfriend, I have very few friends that i feel emotionally close with.

I feel so alone but I can’t tell anyone, I have a porn addiction and just hide in my room unless I’m at school or sports.

792,PastPhilosophy7394,1648339631,1,"i don’t really know what to do right now but to vent, i’m crying after trying to open up to my mum but i find communication so hard. being autistic can really suck sometimes. 

i’m () pretty socially isolated. i’m autistic and have intense anxiety issues, despite this i do have 5 friends who i am quite close with but i feel really uncomfortable reaching out, and staying in touch with people online is something i find really stressful. i meet up with one of my friends now and then to study together and am always invited to group outing and mini trips with smaller groups within the group. but i’m so so so lonely. 
i do online school now which is much better for my mental health over all but i have like no social interaction apart from with my parents, my two younger brothers (15) occasionally my aunt or cousins or a family friend or two now and then. i barely see anyone at all which confuses me because i always hated seeing people so i don’t understand why i feel so lonely now. 
it’s the worst when i’m in my room which is why i often hang around in common areas like the kitchen or living room so i can be near people but i often feel like i’m in the way or something. we do have a dog but he’s not allowed upstairs and i have the smallest bedroom (by choice, since i like small spaces) but i sit in there and feel so isolated and lonely i sometimes wish there was someone or something there with me just to be near another living thing. 
i sound pretty pathetic and maybe it’s hitting me particularly hard right now because i’m sick and i feel more sad when i’m unwell, but it has been getting to me more and more recently. i have asked about getting a cat but my parents aren’t keen on the idea and are the sort of people that will forget about something or being frustrated if i bring it up a bunch of times. also being autistic i don’t have the gift of knowing when is and when isn’t a good time to bring something like that up. 
i am getting counseling soon which is nice since it’ll be someone to talk to about things but this loneliness is so awful and i’m afraid it’ll get worse when i go to university (which won’t be until next year but it’s still something i worry about). 
i tried to talk to my mum and it didn’t really go well. she doesn’t really understand me and stopped trying for awhile. she’s great at fighting for me in like equality aspects but not very good at being comforting or understanding or anything. my dad is autistic too but he doesn’t really need or like people so i don’t think he would understand, plus i already hang out with him loads and i still feel lonely. 
i feel like i have no options. talking online causes intense anxiety, my parents are busy and my brothers find me annoying (which is fair enough because i can be) and my dog isn’t allowed upstairs. i don’t really have any option but to be alone.",lonely,i’m really lonely and i don’t know what to do.,2022-03-27 11:07:11

I have been diagnosed with depression with loneliness and social isolation as my symptoms. I don't really have friends as I go outside by myself and I haven't really been intimate with a girl before. In the past couple of weeks, I have been focusing on my purpose by making a plan filled with goals, strategies, and practices for myself to grow into the person I want to be and I have no doubt but to live up to it by challenging myself every single day. Previously, to remedy all sorts of problems, I would resort to drinking loads of Coca-Cola at my apartment watching TV shows/movies or have unstable moments with emotional instability and mental breakdowns.

In the past weeks since starting to focus on my purpose and sticking to my plan, I've seen couples and friend groups around town when I am outside but I would be able to keep my emotions and thoughts in control and not let my thoughts have an associated emotion to it. If I did, it would dissipate in less than a minute while allowing me to focus on what I'm doing and live up to my plan and focus in the moment while assuring myself that I will get the life in which I get everything I want, like friendships and relationships and all. However...(and this is the problem)

Today, I was outside focusing on my needs and everywhere I went, every single thing damn place I was in (gym, campus, restaurant, hell even while I'm driving to pick up and do things), I see couples every where and it was just so adorable and I just felt down. Before, I know I had unstable habits I've developed and this is probably new to me, but I would like some advice as to what to do in these situations to give myself the peace, self-assurance, and security I need for myself. I guess it could be because I watched all of HIMYM and almost finishing Love Is Blind, so I could be sabotaging myself; however, any advice and tips would be apperciated.

Over the years I have become friends with all sorts of people throughout my life and they have considered me as a friend of theirs (well most of them anyway). Surpirsingly the vast majority of them have kept me on their friends list on Facebook however no-one reaches out to me anymore.

But what I've always lacked, and still lack at the age of 28 (soon to be 29) are friends of my own that I can hang out with. Was bullied a lot, developed social anxiety because of it and ended up keeping to myself a lot. Hardly got invited out to anything when I was a teenager, only time I was able to do things with others was when I was an Air Cadet from when I was 13 up until after I turned 19, job conditions during my early 20s prevented me from having a social life due to working hours and being unable to afford to go out to places. 

I have been living with my parents for most of my life with the exception of 7 months from when I was undergoing basic and trade training in the Army before I got medically discharged. I'm living right on the outskirts of my village on the county border where one side leads to the countryside, the other leads to the towns and cities. So if I wanted to have a good social time, with anyone it would take a good hour to get to anywhere decent.

Outside of work, I do voluntary work with my old Air Cadet Group and also help out on my local heritage steam railway. I am friends with the people I work with in both instances but again, they have their own lives and I don't have social dos with them. I'm also doing a part time higher education course straight afterwork which I'm doing for 2 years. So out of the week, thats 3 nights during the working week that I'm busy and two saturdays a month that I'm busy on the railway. Also hitting the gym when I have the time to do so but I'm only there to workout and not socialise with anyone.

Unfortunately for me it is incredibly hard to meet new people due to how busy I've been. Still on a low wage and can hardly afford to go out anywhere, especially with the rising costs of everything these days.

Or if it's serious (yes believe it or not I have been know to be serious at least once since I escaped my mother's womb) we can talk about that as well. But for real... I'm open to talk about anything you'd like :D
* My favorite vegetable is a red bell pepper. Not sure why I shared that of all things, but if you think about it you probably feel like someone's not an absolute stranger on the internet if you know their favorite vegetable, right?

835,cookiepizza121_,1648324261,1,"Hello, my name is Ree, just to clarify, I am not here looking for advice, I’m just venting, for someone to listen, to not pre-judge and just be mature and understanding. I’m not alone. I live with my mother and brother (can’t hard afford my own place but still thankful to have a roof over my head anyway, so I can’t complain). Loneliness for me is yearning for new people to be friends with, make new connections, etc. Don’t get me wrong, I love my family’s company and I don’t take every conversation I have with them for granted. I just don’t have that much of a life for a 25 year old. I don’t have a job because my mental health is certainly poor, I wouldn’t be a great employee to have anyway, friends have come and go or just don’t bother with me anymore. I don’t go out. I stay in, every single day. I’m autistic also but I’ve never been taught to accept that I am autistic and it’s okay, it’s always been “you’re autistic and we need to solve the problem”, it felt as If I was a problem that couldn’t be solved, the way my parents were behaving about it. The only thing that’s keeping me to not mentally breakdown, is music. It’s my passion and I’m also getting into history as well. I also watch YouTube videos like abandoned places, dead malls and stuff like that. I’ve been isolated away from the real world since I was 17/18 (I won’t go into detail as to why, I’ll just say, I sought for help and it wasn’t a pleasant experience). I’m mentally sick but now I’m becoming physically sick. I’m losing weight because I don’t eat properly, it’s becoming noticeable due to how my clothes have become bigger on me the past couple of months. I’ve never had a good relationship with food anyway. I don’t know what the future holds for me but I hope and pray that I’m out in the real world, doing something.",lonely,Hello there.,2022-03-27 06:51:01

I remember the first time I met her we were in the lunch room and she was crying because she had a headache and the nurse didn't really help and I acted mad for her while sorta comforting her, at this time she's a complete stranger sitting with her friends. Idk how I started talking with her or why I even went to her table but I did.

Throughout Middle school and Highschool we would bump into each other and we'd be really nice to each other like we're kinda friends. I'm the Outcast in the school, the quiet kid... I used to be very open and excited when younger but now I am just dead inside. So anyways she was always nice to me when we talked.

The first time we talked in a while she told me my last name meant trash in Spanish, apparently Baysura (Eastern European name) means trash? But we both just laughed at it.

Now I'm here with 40 days left, I have absolutely no friends, haven't talked to her since 10th grade gym class and I feel like I kinda like her... She's a bit country and city but more with the countryside personality to her. It's been a while and I'm nervous to even talk to her. I don't know how much she's changed since last talking to her, we pass in the hallway but never say hello and we just pass by.

Last time we talked I had very bad acne and my hair was almost over my eyes, now I don't have acne and I started calming my hair to the back (it don't look had I think, I've gotten a lot of compliments on it, if they are genuine...) So maybe she doesn't recognize me? I'm scared that if I don't talk to her I'll regret it for the rest of my life but if I do and if she disregards me in a horrible way in the hallway where hundreds of kids are walking last then it'd just destroy me knowing my last childhood best friend just disregarded me like some idiot on the street... I feel horrible thinking about it and I know I probably won't see her ever again once I graduate.

847,Soulfullyhollow,1648321778,1,"Have you ever felt too lonely, too alone to a point you felt like you are all alone in this world. Questioning your moral existence as to why you remain so distinct from all the heartless and bad people in the world. Toxic and awful people you grew around. In this world where you fight everyday to survive, wherein your life has just been limited to work and study all day trying to stash all that bling and you try to ignore and not care about all the people who try to put you down but then there are days when you can't hold it anymore and you feel too low and breakdown just wishing there was someone in this world who truly cared about you, someone you could talk to, someone who would hold your hand and look you in the and eye and tell you that they exist and they're never leaving you.

Your lonely life and still not finding that right person for you hurts you deeply and sets you back but you know there's nothing you can do and despite of the hopelessness you somehow convince your mind to hold on. To remain hopeful despite of the hopelessness even when your heart knows sometimes it's hard to find that person. But you try distracting yourself again with work and the cycle repeats again. 

Sometimes when those lonely thoughts and sadness find a way into your mind again, you close your eyes and imagine how life could have been if you had someone who loved you, cared about you, the beautiful conversations you would have had, places you could've gone to or movies you could've watched together. You smile thinking of different scenarios to a point if someone would spy on you, they'd think you have lost your mind as the alternate reality you dream of is the only way that you find to be happy at times even if it is for a few minutes until you snap back to reality.

Sometimes you imagine yourself being a Single parent of a broken child like you have adopted and saved so that he doesn't go through what you went through. So that someday he gets a life you never had. Because in him, you see yourself and through his happiness you believe you can see yourself living a happy life you wanted to live, giving him the life he deserves, a child you teach how to defend himself, how you raise him as your best friend, someday he turns Sixteen and you tell him ""One life is all we get, this age will never come back again so go out there, make some friends, have some fun, play some pranks, follow your dreams and plan whatever you want to plan for college, find your person, your destiny, fall in love and live free! I never got to live my life but you, my son, this is your shot. Make this the most memorable time of your life you can cherish forever when you grow up. Make me proud, son!"" 

But soon you snap out of that alternate reality to realize you don't have a child yet. 

Sometimes you reflect on your past, your childhood and think of the situations when people hurt you, abused you  and you think of how differently you could've done things and shown those people their place, you imagine all that and recreate all that in your mind to a point you get off your bed and punch the air in your room in rage imagining those awful demons thinking of all those scenarios again that someday you don't want your own child to go through. 

Sometimes you think of the people who gave you so much of fake love and toxicity and wish you never met them because of all the lies, toxicity and pain they brought in your life, the fake promises they made, all the cute moments but also the sad ones a lot and how those ended and why they ened and you try being too overprotective and defensive over your heart if any person tries to get to it and know you because you don't want them to take advantage of you or play with it or pretend to like you or use you to pass their time and leave you or shatter your heart or keep you in a delusion until you find out and break up and shatter yourself. You don't want all that so you turn into this rude guy who doesn't open up to people ever, an anti simp who hasn't given up on love but won't risk his heart because he doesn't want to get hurt. But sometimes you feel like opening up to someone but you don't really know whom you can trust and whom you cannot. Is she the one or is she not, if losing my heart to her is good or is it not, if opening up to her about everything is right or not, if she can be not just my life partner but also my one true best friend or not.

Because at the end of the day, you are the only friend you got who knows you better than anybody else and you survive by turning off your emotions until days like these they turn back again and free the bottled up emotions and then you get back to being the harsher you because you know it's not worth it. And that's all you gotta be to survive, stronger, harsher and stone hearted.

That's me. Maybe I'm one of a kind, or is there anybody else like me. I don't know. But I'd love to know someone like me who exists or even if not then atleast someone who understands me deeply and truly how it feels to be me and to break my guard and tell me that they're that person I had been looking for and earn and win over my trust and set my heart free from the walls I've built around it.",lonely,22M This is what Loneliness turns you into...

I haven't tried contacting her nor do I bring her up in conversation. (Either way she's blocked me on everything.) Which upsets me not because she blocked me or rather ""cut me off"" but because all I've ever tried to do is help her or give advice with her family problems / anxiety / insecurities / career / hobbies/  and to become a better person and pushed her to try and obtain her goals / aspirations / and dreams.   


Over the years my friend group has gotten smaller and smaller to the point where the main friends I'd spend time with were mutual (or so I thought) friends with my ex. I know personally she always bad mouths me to them, and that would bother me a lot. a very long story short. I've noticed that after she left I rarely here from there people now and in addition the guy whom I considered a close friend (known for 3 or 4 years now) has all kinds of excuses as to why he no longer reaches out. I'm never invited anywhere and I cant help but feel like this is happening because of my Ex and her being vindictive. I know that they all still hangout and drink and go out places. Truth be told, it hurts but I just grit my teeth and bare it. I've been actively pursuing a future that I want and I just feel like once I've made it I'll suddenly start hearing from all them again. Wanting to be all buddy buddy. As I write this the thought of that makes me upset / angry, but to my core I'm a kind hearted person and wont hold on to animosity for long.   


I don't have much of a support system. Talking to people and being social isn't a problem but, once again I'm stuck here sitting alone trying to focus on my future while my ex and former ""friends"" all go out and live life and have fun as thought nothings happened. 

Life is good...  Deep down I want to cry but something in me physically, mentally, or emotionally wont let it out. (I've listened to new Adele album like 3 times one night to get it out of me.)

Being alone is fine, and even necessary to some degree, but having given so much to those around me only for a few crumbs of it to be given back when I need it. That hurts... a lot.

anyway, when i become friends with someone i always try to be as best as i could, i try to do everything to make them happy, even at the expense of myself, because i just like seeing my friends happy more than i like being happy myself. but i just would want to get something in return, even a little? and i don't know whether it's me overreacting or something.
on christmas we were supposed to exchange gifts, i made them a pot from modeling clay that, where it was in half and one side was closed, it had a little spooky house on the closed side, a pumpkin and some gravestones. i spent 4 days on it, sculpting, painting, putting it together, even during night i was working on it, just so i could make it on time, so they wouldn't have to wait for me. the day came, but they told me that they gonna give me a gift later (just so you know, i hadnt gave them a gift then, since i wanted for it to be on the same day). some time later they gifted me one of those small portable hairbrushes and told me that they gonna give me more stuff later and make me a ceramic plate. but i never got anything else. and the problem isn't that, it's that they promised me, but didn't come thru with it.
3 weeks ago we agreed to meet today, i messaged them a week ago to confirm it, they did, and i dmed them 2 days ago and yesterday at 10pm to ask them again, every time it was a yes. so today i woke up at 8am, cleaned my face, did my makeup, put on my best clothes, started brushing my hair out and putting one snack, they told me they really liked and birch sap into my backpack to give them it. 1h30min they cancelled on me, because they didn't get enough sleep, it was the 2nd time it happened. and i completely understand that, but i just would want a notice earlier? since i counted days to hang out, was making plans and was just really excited today to meet them. 
i just don't really feel loved, which again, might be an overreaction. yesterday i went to a thrift shop and bought like 8 things and went home, when it was dark. and i was just so happy, that i teared up. because it was the first time i have ever done anything for myself, the first time i bought clothes and went out till dark. i never felt enough to do it, too ugly to buy clothes, where it would be just a waste of money and time, i thought that i didnt deserve to have pretty clothes, that me wearing something pretty would just be pathetic for myself. but i bought them. and what caused it was the said friend. because they made me feel like a person, that after all not all people would find me disgusting enough not be my friend. and because of our friendship, i finally felt like i was deserving enough. i finally felt like a teenager with them, not some sort of dead child, that has been far too long not decomposing. and i wanted to thank them today, to express my appreciation, but i just don't really feel like the same goes for me. i don't want to feel like i'm the only person that finds this friendship important. i just want to be enough, but sometimes it feels like no matter how much i have to sacrifice myself, it still won't ever be enough. 
i always felt that way, even when i was 11. me and my old friend had a sleepover then and their bday was coming the next day. i spent the whole night, without any sleep, making myself the bday card, writing and memorizing a speech to give them and making them a breakfast in the morning. a month later it was my birthday and they forgot. and i just don't understand what is average and normal here. is me throwing a bday party and doing so much for my friends just too much and people just actually don't really like it as much or is it that they just didn't give me back the same energy?

i don't have anyone else tbh and I don't like being alone for long periods of time.

I'm just feeling super lonely and I've turned to dating to fill a void. I don't know what to do really? Apparently I should be focusing on uni work and going the gym but I feel quite numb and have no motivation to exercise.

Anyone else feel like this sometimes? How did you get out of it or stop thinking about the void you have?

Thanks.",lonely,I'm not alone but I honestly feel it?,2022-03-27 05:00:05

Was going through my messages today and saw all the ones from people who deleted me after they told me to reach out to them any time I wanted someone to talk to. Lol. I'm so over it.

I'm so over the toxic positivity of people telling me that I'm going to get through this and I won't be lonely forever or people who tell me to ""get off my lazy ass"" and go to the gym. Why can't I just find one person who will just talk to me and actually be genuinely my friend? Someone who doesn't keep track of who initiates the conversation first all the time and with whom the conversation just flows naturally. Maybe it doesn't exist.

I haven't really given up on finding a relationship but I'm about to. People are just too goofy or aren't in my age bracket. They're either just graduating college or they're over 40 and have kids already, I don't want to be a stepmom, I don't even know if I want kids of my own. Maybe that sounds selfish but I'm tired of having to walk over eggshells just to voice my opinion or my preferences. I had someone go off on me the other day just because I didn't like Chris Pratt.

Towards Christmas I spiralled really hard and struggled to see anyone as my friend, since people (with one or two people as the exception) only seeming to reach out to me when they wanted something. 

I stopped myself from reaching out to people at the start of 2022, to see who would reach out to me of their own volition. Since imo, someone reaching out to you of their own volition, is the best indicator of a friend - to me.

This girl, I’m in a shared community with them, and see them online in game often, and online in discord every day nearly. I think I still like them but I genuinely do also miss their friendship too.

They’ve not attempted to speak to me at all about anything, unfortunately, and I’m stuck here wanting to have some form of dialogue but hesitant because everything I might say or do would be tainted by this lingering sense of ‘He’s just trying to hit on her, not actually be friends’.

And well, you can’t make people want to be your friend. And I can’t ignore the fact that despite saying they wanted to still be friends, hasn’t made any effort to even have a dialogue in the first place. 

Is it even possible to be friends with someone who demonstrates no desire to entertain the idea? How do I get her out of my head it’s bugging me so much and it’s made me a bitter, resentful person?

With the Covid lockdowns a little while after the start of those 2 years, the isolation helped me come to terms with who I and develop myself as a person.

Fast forward to last October, the start of my 3rd year, some restrictions had been elevated so we were able to see each other on campus. I’ve gotten over my anxiety and insecurities, learned to initiate and hold down conversations with people, become familiar with a lot of people now and made some acquaintances. I’ve also started going to the gym.

I’ve done all that and I still have no friends. I’ve still never spent a weekend with anyone here, not even just hanging out with anyone and it’s very obvious that I’m lonely when people ask how my weekend went (I’m alone all of the time too, so that makes it worse) . People may act friendly in person and in work situations but nobody texts me unless I text them. Sometimes I scroll through IG stories and see the people who I talk to in those pics and videos hanging out and it just gets depressing. Another person who I started talking to said he’s going to a party this weekend with 10 other guys I know (reservation, so I can’t join).

I get so drained from the reality of my loneliness that I can’t  wake up early anymore, which made me miss a few classes and I’ve lost the motivation to study. The only thing I have is the gym.

903,SonataSprings,1648296369,1,"So, my wife of 4 years and I will probably be getting a divorce. We started dating 10 years ago when I was 19 and she was 17. Since then we had been happy together. We spent tons of time together, I think we've only had 1 or 2 ""major"" arguments.

Fast forward to the beginning of the month, my wife told me that she wasn't sure she loved me anymore and was considering a divorce. Not only did this come out of nowhere seeing as we were acting lovey dovey the day before ready to celebrate our anniversary that week, but she told me this ON our anniversary as well. It hurt, but I wanted to try to fix things before just giving up. 

I got her to agree to couples counseling. During our first session, she reveals that she had been talking with another person on snapchat. Needless to say, I was hurt. Our therapist wanted us to get off social media for a while and go out to a nice dinner. 

Well our dinner date was supposed to be yesterday, but she was crying when I came home from work. It was then that she told me that just a few days ago, she met up with a guy and they ""messed around but didn't sleep together."" I was gutted, but I could tell she genuinely regretted her action. This all got me feeling guilty so I had to reveal that I cheated when we started dating.

About 1 or 2 weeks into the relationship, I got drunk at a Halloween party and ended up sleeping with a friend. (I know being drunk is no excuse, if I could go back and tell my younger self that I was dating my future wife, I would). And I've kept this secret the whole time.

This of course led to her saying that she's done trying and wants the divorce. She left to stay with her friend and is looking for somewhere more permanent to stay. I honestly still want to finish our therapy and try to mend the damage.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm scared, we share an apartment with our 1yr old border collie. and I have no one I can turn to. I'm honestly a bit of a social recluse, and am terrible at making and maintaining friendships. To the point where outside of seeing ""work friends"" at work, I haven't really hung out with anyone besides my wife in years. and my parents moved across the country for work.

I'm about to lose everything I know and love, and while my parents have offered to let me move in with them, that's a big change for someone that has never lived outside his hometown.

Then proceeds to tell me that there were at least 10 other dudes she was talking to on the same level as me, meaning that they got her number and were asking her out and what not. Even said she enjoys it when boys spend money to meet her.

I have never felt so digusted and disappointed in my life. 

She told me she enjoys acting multiple personas to bait different guys. So i was led to believe in a lie.. 

At least i kept a straight face throughout the night and the day ended amicably.

To say that kinds of things in front of me and to even say it was her entertainment. It makes me sick to even think other girls on dating apps or even irl would even share any similarity to her wicked state of mind.

That thought really terrifies me. I wish i wasnt so lonely and eager for relationship and that i can dissociate from the desire of romantic connection. Its so fucked up that another human being, one supposedly diagnosed with clinical depression can think so little of other people feelings.

Idk why, maybe i was naive to believe that she was genuinely interested in me from our texts and convos...

914,Lemon_TEst,1648291144,1,"People are people, I think. They behave in ways that make sense from an evolutionary perspective, at least that's how I rationalize others actions. However, I am still unable to understand them, connect with them, relate to them, sometimes sympathize with them. I am autistic. I am a human being. I generally think and act different than others, and that seems to be a problem. I avoid formality in almost every situation, try to act as casual as possible so people will be comfortable. This has not worked. I think people are put off by me. I have been told so. I don't talk to people, all the little rules are so complicated and numerous, meant to weed out those that don't know the rules i.e. those that don't belong. Even if I knew the rules, I don't even know where to start in trying to understand why people do the things they do. They're like machines, and I have trouble processing them as anything else. These social scripts rip away personality from people, and they seem like thoughtless, uninteresting robots. I would love to just go up to someone and say ""okay, we're both people. lets just skip all the stupid stuff and start acting like people immediately"" but you can't do that for some reason. It would be much easier and efficient to just ask people ""What do you think about?"" and ""What makes you interesting?"" but once again, that's not allowed. One of the biggest things I despise about conversation is how often sentences have to end in 'true' or 'same'. So many conversations are meaningless other than to create a feeling of reliability and nothing else. But it always just reminds me about how little I can figure out about my own species, so I resent it. 

As much as I hate social rules and can't communicate, the problem is I need people. It's an evolutionary instinct and only that, but I can't fight it. I haven't had IRL friends in two years. I haven't had a conversation that meant anything at all in I don't know how long. I don't think I've actually ever related/connected to someone before in a way that's meant something to me. It makes me scared that I haven't found anyone who shares my biggest interest. They seem to be really uncommon, which means if I were to eventually find that person I'd be unlikely to be able to make friends with them which would be horrible. I'm very very curious, I need someone else who is very very curious or at least really likes to discuss question topics. I feel like the only human being, completely irrational, but my feelings nonetheless. It's disturbing how real and physical of a feeling 'hollow' is. Like pain but a special kind of pain. But posting here feels horrible too. Currently 272k people have joined this subreddit i.e. a ton of people. But I need my case of loneliness to be unique, one of a kind, because that will mean there's a solution, some achievable solution to solve my loneliness that I just haven't seen yet. But if 272k people are also lonely enough to post here its much more complicated, or unachievable which I cannot accept. This feels like an admission of defeat. But I can think of absolutely no way to escape this. I am in pain, I would like to not be in pain. I'm angry at everyone because their social systems are inefficient, arbitrary, but most importantly I can't understand them. Anger does nothing except make me feel bad, but I don't know what else to do. It is not people's fault I cannot fit into their system, but it's not my fault either. I don't know how much longer I can last feeling completely alone, but I can think of no solution. This is the way it has always been. 

Lets go deeper. I feel completely insane. It is not normal to see people your age as nothing more than specimens for observation. It is not normal to be unable to see most people as nothing more than robots. Regardless, that is what my brain thinks. If everyone were to be a robot that would be very bad for me. That would mean they're probably some hive mind, which means they know I'm not part of it, which means I was doomed from the start and have absolutely no chance at ever feeling better. I just want to be okay. ""why dont i just kill myself now"", ""god i want to kill myself"" are things I say many times a day. Why don't I just kill myself now? That would make me an idiot. If I lost self preservation to a stupid animal instinct like loneliness I would be a moron. Ending the experience of life takes away chance that it will ever get better, slim hope is better than no chance. I've thought about calling the suicide hotline a couple of times, but I'm always stopped by the fact that is completely pointless. I gain nothing. The person on the other end does not care about me, if we ever passed each other in real life we would not recognize each other, and most importantly everything they say to me will be fake. The goal is to keep the other person alive. Therapy was a thought too, but how could a person I can't understand be able to understand me? Paying a person to listen to my problems feels bad. I don't want to pay a person to pretend to care. I just need a human being. Someone who has thoughts and cares about things. But in fact I don't know what I need, because if I did I'd probably be okay by now.",lonely,"[20M]Being angry at everyone is stupid, but im angry anyways.",2022-03-26 21:39:04

Well, to be honest I had tried very hard to make friends since Day 1 but no one seemed interested in making friends with me. I took the initiative to introduce myself and got myself out there to socialize but it seemed like nobody cared. The worst part was when cliques were already formed within the first few weeks of school, which made it harder for me to form friendships. Group work was the worst because the teacher allowed the class to choose their own groupmates and I always ended up being the ""leftover"" and had to join the cliques.

As a child I was still introverted but had many friends now I’m looking at myself and I know my younger self would be disappointed in me. I’ve been alone for a very long time now and it’s gotten to the point where even when people talk to me I don’t expect them to ask anything more than a question and always plan 10 different responses to questions people might not ever ask. I talk to myself more than I talk to anyone currently. It’s been so long since I’ve had a day where I haven’t felt lonely that I don’t remember the feeling of being social. I work at Amazon and being relatively younger compared to most of the people that work there I had a lot of time to myself thinking and thinking. Being so lonely has caused me to casually strike up a conversation with myself. Sometimes it’s a simple conversation and other times it’s can get really heated even though it’s only me. I usually feel depressed and my low self esteem has lead me to heavily self deprecate. I would offer argue with myself during my 12 hour shifts on moments of my life and how I do the same thing over and over. Once it’s got so bad, it felt as though I got sucked into a black hole of nihilism.

940,Complete-Ad-6956,1648276776,1,"A bit over a week ago I decided to message someone that goes to my school. I have no friends at school, and a lot of anxiety and some other problems with mental illness. That being said, I know that and have been improving for a long time. I like who I'm becoming, but the loneliness I feel came to a point where I wasn't sure how to continue anymore. So I started messaging this person because they've always been generally nice to me at school despite how awkward I am and the fact that i just kinda like them. But even if we could just be friends I know i'd be happy.

So for the past week i've been talking to them and it's been really nice. The problem is, we're still super awkward irl. I need privacy, and thats something i cannot get during a school day. Everyone there knows i have no friends, so on occassion talking to them is very difficult because I feel like all eyes are on me, and like everything i say is being judged and made fun of. Idk i feel like i need to talk with them irl in private before talking in public becomes viable at all.

So today i made the fucking foolish decision of asking to do so. my parent runs track and field, so every day i have to wait for them to finish until about 4:30 before we can go home, because we live too far for buses or walking. So, I have that time every day where I'm usually on walks, and I figured that could be a good time. They said before that they only live 7 minutes away, so surely it's not so much to ask right? But then they just kinda entirely brushed it off. I even told them why I'd prefer that, but they just kinda said they aren't able to and didn't elaborate or offer another alternative. I guess maybe their parents are super strict but like it's very depressing to me. I'm sure there's a logical reason but when this is the only way i see myself being able to open up more it becomes extremely saddening. I feel like it's over. Like this isn't going to go anywhere. 

It's not like they don't try to talk to me at school, and I try to too. But shit's complicated and hard and just really fucking difficult for me. During texts they'll often make sure to specify that they like talking to me. If thats the case then why would they not try harder. Were they just busy and not able to elaborate? Are they really just being nice and not realizing how they've led me on to thinking we were friends?

I like the idea of having a family/community of like-minded platonic caring friends where we are there for eachother and could grow old together. I don't want kids, might just get a small pet. Houses are so expensive so I think it would be nice to buy a house with other like minded people. I don't smoke.  I prefer spiritual friendship over carnal friends. I respect others and like to give people space. I'm not clingy, good listener, not a risk taker. Tidy and like comfort. I work full-time. I'm asexual so I'm not interested in sexual relations. Currently live near Birmingham but might move to London soon. Willing to relocate in future. I like the idea of growing old with friends and being there for eachother.

They slowly started talking to me less and less and eventually they kind of stopped responding all together, they like to say that we’re still friends but it’s the way that they talk to me now.

963,Person96,1648268035,1,"I think I might have been cursed or something. I can't explain what happened. I'm not sure when it happened either, but I genuinely think something happened that changed who I was. Who I am. In my 8 years since entering University, I have not made a single friend. Someone who I can rely on. Someone who genuinely wants to know more about me. Someone who...who wants to help me for once. I don't know if that person exists or I'm just living in a fantasy, but they say there's always someone out there for everyone. So why the hell can't I find them?

In the beginning, I made friends. Hell, I had a group that I actually talked to. The one girl, her name was Kat, that I met during my first year of uni I considered a friend as well. She'd tease me. I'd tease her. The group I was with all decided to go out for drinks at the end of the year. I had a group of people I talked to. At the time, I considered them friends despite never seeing them or talking to them outside of uni. This continued in the three schools I've attended. I've met so many people but have not seen any of them outside of school. That, coupled with a bunch of shit at home that still haunts me to this day whenever I close my eyes, have made me cynical and feel like an outsider to everyone. I don't know when it happened, but one day something just clicked and I realized that I never did have any true friends. Only one person in my life has ever bothered to ask how I was doing. How I felt. Maybe it was too much for her, because even now I feel like I'm a bother to her. She's in another city, living her life and being happy and I'm over here bothering her whenever I feel the urge to talk to someone. Even then I don't consider her a friend anymore. Why? Because I initiate every conversation. Every interaction is because I want to use her voice for a song or a voice over or something. Then, it's back to silence.

I feel like an outsider to everything. To everyone. I feel like the only thing I have in this world are my parents. My family. But I'm away from them because I want to make money so I can repay back everything they've done for me in my 25 years. I want to give them a life where they don't have to worry about anything and they can go about their business without any stress.

But is it so hard to ask that I want at least someone to support me a bit? To say that they're proud of me? To comfort me when I get like this? To hug me and stroke my hair while they tell me it's going to be alright? That's all I want.

Even as I write this, I'm doubting myself. ""Oh, you have people you talk to! What about today? That pleasant conversation you had with your group mate with whom you were forced to work with? What about that guy that always talks to you but never see outside of class? What about your parents who are still working to still support you while you grow tired, weak, more damaged, and stressed and bullshit your way through university so you can finally repay them back for all they've done for you? You have so many people already.""

So, why do I still feel alone? Why do I insist on writing this shit? No one's going to read this. No one's going to listen to your sob story. Your plea for pity. Your self wallowing. You're not worth anyone's time. It's best if you just shut up and do your work. Because that's all your good for. You're meant to serve everyone else. You're not meant to see your own happiness. To experience what it's like for someone to ask how you're doing. To take an interest in you.

You're not worth it.",lonely,The shadow over my shoulder,2022-03-26 15:13:55
964,gildedpotus,1648267918,1,"I’ve been in the mental hospital 3 times in the little over a year for severe anxiety and depression. I’m not sure why, but in 2021 I ended up going inpatient for anxiety that wouldn’t end and my life hasn’t been the same since. My 3rd trip in the hospital I would wake up not even caring about being lonely, but just hating existing so much I would just think only suicidal thoughts, but I knew I couldn’t do that to myself or my family. But it really was hell. I was even looking into ECT where they induce a seizure into your brain to help depression which can have big side effects. In these times, the only that could sort of help was talking to people - other patients or staff.

By a stroke of luck I met a girl during this time inpatient and my medication seemed to be helping at least some. We had common interests in board/card games and started dating when we both got out of the hospital. For the first time in a long time I experienced what it felt like to be physically close to someone, cuddle, kiss, etc. She very quickly was saying things about a long term relationship which I should have known was a red flag, but in my position where I was in hell for so long I didn’t really care. But soon, she realized she didn’t wanna be committed, and in fact didn’t want to be in a relationship at all, and this switch was so fast and jarring it hurt me a lot. One of her disorders is BPD, and I guess these people can be prone to relationship difficulties just like this. We tried to stay friends, but even that was too difficult for me, and I kept getting hurt, and she called me emotionally too sensitive for catching feelings when she still wanted to do things like hold hands. Everyone in my life told me this person was manipulative and gaslighting and not good for me and after a few more times of trying to make it work I realized it couldn’t and cut off all communication. This was devastating to me of course but I knew it had to be done because everyone including me saw a toxic pattern.

But this was someone I could hold, who wanted to play cuphead with me, someone I could watch a show with and a girl who liked me. I didn’t realize how motivating all of that could be and help me through even the most severe of my bouts of depression. And it all happened and vanished so quickly.

It just meant so much to me that someone cared enough to want to message me everyday, who wanted my presence and just liked me for who I was. And now I look back and it just seems like her side of the interest was just part of her disorder or whatever, and I got mistreated and always was made to feel like everything was my fault. So it all feels false in a way, and I had to block her on everything and she’s out of my life

All in all, I guess it’s good I had the experience, because how much it hurt me made me realize how lonely I have been and how I’ve been running away from that because of fear of rejection I’ve just withdrawn for many years and focused on other things, but all the while I think I’ve been desperately seeking validation - especially romantically and feel like I have failed so dramatically. I just feel like a pathetic person.

I don’t know why but I feel alone even around my friends and family. I feel like I can’t speak my mind. I don’t find myself interesting so why would someone else? And to have a connection with someone also dealing with mental struggles, be made to feel like they were very invested, and saying unprompted things like “I’m not going anywhere” etc, only for them to not want that anymore and have to cut them out is so painful. 

And now I just feel like nothing… I don’t know how to meet someone that can make me feel like that again. I think the painful truth is I have to work on myself first before I can try a relationship again. I am lucky that I have friends but I feel like I can’t speak what I’m really thinking. I don’t want to die without a healthy relationship. There have been times where my depression has been bad enough I really think there is a risk I could die before that happens by my own hand, but that also serves as motivation for me. But it’s such a lonely road to walk, when my depression already makes me feel disconnected. I am just hoping I have another stroke of luck and taking care of myself the best I can. I have been doing daily exercise and sticking to a schedule, etc. and I do think I’m doing a bit better but I just feel so empty compared to when I was with that girl, even if it was not the right one, and it’s made me feel like I’ve wasted so much time. And I didn’t even meet her of my own will, it was just lucky we were both in the same place at the same time, more or less forced to interact. I have no idea how I could create this scenario in the real world, with anxiety, self doubt and more freedom. How do you even meet people? 

I I’ll never forget I randomly just felt really depressed, like life wasn’t worth living, even when I was with her, and I was just crying for no reason, and she told me “I’ve never known someone so depressed they don’t even know why they’re sad, but I’ll be here for you when you’re like that”. And how it all turned out makes me realize how empty those words were, and how little I meant to her.",lonely,I just need to share my experience with loneliness and my depression.,2022-03-26 15:11:58

In high school, I went on this trip to England, Ireland, and Wales with some classmates and teachers. On the plane going home, I was wearing a bracelet that I had bought while I was there on the trip. It was almost the same color as a rubber band, but it wasn't a rubber band. It was also a little thicker than a rubber band and had a design on it.

My teacher saw the bracelet, and she knows my dad's occupation, which is a surgeon, and my mom is a stay at home single mom. I felt like she was jealous of me, because she knows my dad is rich and my mom didn't work. She said, ""Are you wearing a bracelet?"" I said, ""Yes."" She said, ""I just thought it was a rubber band.""

This remark bothered me so much and I saw it as offensive and insulting. I remember thinking like, ""What the **** was that supposed to mean?"" Why would she ask me if it was a bracelet and say thatshe thought it was a rubber band? My own interpretation of her inquiry was that it was as if she was thinking, ""If your dad's a surgeon, then why are you wearing a rubber band for a bracelet, because only poor kids would wear rubber bands as bracelets?""

Back in my late teens and early 20s I used to love listening to love songs and imagine that the lyrics were about me and a girl I was interest in at the time.

I’ve been questioning if it’s the right thing for a while now, after she has said some pretty brutal things to me - but we’ve got a little one, and I lost my job to the pandemic and we can’t find daycare. So I’ve been without a job for nearly two years. 

She comes home from her work (nursing) and doesn’t want to spend time together most days. She doesn’t want me to make plans with people because she needs my help with our toddler (who I’ve spent an entire 13 hour day alone with) and just wants to play on her phone or watch tv (or fall asleep).

I had to text her tonight to let her know I was painfully lonely and very bored. She told me to go play video games, then stopped responding to anything I said over text or in person, until it was time to put the little one to bed. Then she asked me why I “seem so grumpy.”

I’ve voiced to her multiple times in the last few weeks that I’m wrestling with suicidal ideation, chronic loneliness and just plain misery. Somehow she always manages to give a shallow apology and then move on. Usually later in the same day asking why I’m “sad or grumpy.”

I feel trapped, isolated, unloved and completely invisible most days.

I’m not sure what I hope to gain - just to speak my piece I guess. Thanks to anyone who read. Since you’re here, I’m guessing you’re struggling too, and I sincerely hope you find whatever you need in your world.",lonely,IDK,2022-03-26 13:26:08

I wrote this 2 months ago for some reason

No I blame it all on the parents, especially the mother cause women plays a crucial role in the child's emotional 

If u want to know the root or source of every deep seated emotional issues or psychological problems or personality disorders,u just have to trace it back to the very beginning,ur childhood, ultimately ur parents or the people u spend the most crucial part of ur formative lives that will shape who u are and most likely determine what the rest of ur life will be.these are the people who will exert the greatest overwhelming force on a child's psyche, psychological and if and any personality disorders and emotional disorders.

If u don't believe me just think back to ur childhood,what had the greatest impact....Everything is amplified,if ur experience with ur parents and who they are are mostly positive or even neutral generally fine,u are the most blessed,I can't imagine ur happiness which u don't even realise urself because ur born into it,to u it's the norm,but if ur experiences with ur parents are mostly negative,I can only pray for u.and ur future.Children are different from adults,they have not build up the emotional and psychological resilience and toughness or maturity to deal with such human beings,they do not yet possess the emotional or psychological understanding or experience to deal with such things,hell many adults don't understand it themselves, kids don't have the knowledge to protect themselves or at least distance themselves...And the biggest irony or tragedy is the children often depend on these people,for their emotional fulfillment,security and attachment and psychological development....its like being completely vulnerable and emotionally sensitive and relying on monsters and sociopaths 

Unconsciously whether u know it or not,ur parents will exert an overwhelming force and etch the fundamentals of a child's psyche or psychology.In the initial years maybe u would still thrive regardless of ur circumstances,I dunno why but most kids do,I guess nature in a sense tries to protect u in a state of blissful ignorance....for the first couple of years at least....Around ages 10 to 15 is when the cracks will start to show,u can feel it even without understanding why ,that emptiness and hollowness the disconcerting sense that u don't belong any where,a sense of growing deep seated resentment against who or what someone u do not know,that my friends is the beginning of dysthymia,chronic depression,the results of years of childhood emotional and psychological and social neglect and dysfunctionality or maladjustment that has been building and snowballing.

There is now an instability in ur personality,u can feel it u can sense it,like a instability in the matrix

On the surface,there's a kid dieing to burst out,this is me!!this is my real personality!!the bright, precocious,nuanced u,the personality and the complex person dieing to be loved and to love.Ur dieing to have a blast,to forge that friendships,to forge those great memories.
But underneath theres a dark undercurrent flowing,a dark ness growing....an insecurity,fear and anxiety,of self loathing and low esteem,constant doubt and regret in ur mind,questioning everything....two contradictory opposites like schizo,but who u are and what u are,all that does not matter,the hell is forged within ur own mind,ur mind creates ur reality,who and what u are never mattered in the first place.

Eventually it all comes crashing down in ur mid or late teens or 20s etc....that's when the true isolation starts.its all a matter of time,a combination of internal instability and external 

After all what reason is there to live?if ur mind cannot possibly concieve of a reason,for many that reason is often human in nature,.....and depression is the mind being unable to conceive of a reason to live and depression leads to isolation and isolation is death.it is inevitably death.

And in the state of isolation ur teenage or young adult mind goes through all these phases,grief,despair,bargaining,denial etc five stages of grief,but it never ends anyway,why should it end when the isolation never ends?some people go through it 3,5,7,8,9+ years it's like u think ur mind could not possibly  .....but there's another curious side,a funny side effect ....at the beginning at least towards ur youth, to cope with this unfathomable reality,ur own reality,ur mind creates all these delusions of fantasy and at the same time deep despair,and mild delusions of grandeur....like the TV show Mr robot,like the dark rapturous fantastical world of bioshock...like the NHK hikikomori kyokai.....like if u manage to do something great or build some sort of a bright future,like if u believe ur destined to do something great,like a maytyr or saviour...the world might understand the deepest darkest part of ur passion,the beliefs,ur humanity,ur pain,the beauty and love,the romantic and despair,the monsters and the loneliness and melancholy and ultimately the fragile weak helpless you.that u might find redemption or even someone u might justify the painful existence or lack of a normal life thus far.Of course it never works.....u didn't go to westworld or inception to discover or reinvent urself,u went there to escape from reality only to come out years later to realise there is nothing waiting for u and ur sandcastle in inception and westworld are nothing but the crumbling relics of ur past and ur sanity.

..U set off out in some godforsaken hope,dragging ur tired broken exhausted soul,in search of what u dunno,with years of near complete isolation and borderline psychosis under ur belt.....ok this is it,this year I'm going to fix myself.of course it never works,how can u build anything on a castle of delusions of grandeur and false hope upon a foundation of isolation and paranoia and despair.That foundation that is gone or never existed that others have build over two decades.Ur searching for nothing......like the quote "" there is nothing in the desert,and no man needs nothing""

There is nothing,ur a life that should never have been.....u were lost many years ago,the answers were all there back in ur childhood.u have just been wandering and drifting for the last ten+ years.Ur looking for things that don't exist,like a misaki,like a blue fairy from A.I.,like a westworld

U experience this reality but it's like ur trapped in a limbo.

1009,MisterNosoul45,1648253572,1,"For a very long time I've felt alone. I don't really exactly when it started, but it's definitely something I was dealing with for like 8 or 7 or 6 years ago. So pretty much it's something I had be struggling with for years. I think the earliest I remember feeling lonely was back in maybe 2nd or 3rd grade. And sure loneliness sometimes goes away eventually. But for me it became a on going thing. I told my parents about my loneliness at least twice and they didn't take it seriously. The first time was when I of nowhere, bursted out crying and told my mom I had no friends. She just told my father when he started to become concerned, that I was just being ridiculous. The second time I got caught on a phone call with someone from an online game I played who I was in a romantic relationship with. My mom wasn't happy and took my phone. I think she said something like you can tell me how you feel and tell me anything. And I just started crying and I can't remember exactly what I said but I think I tried to tell her how alone and in pain I felt. She just looked at me with no care in her face and just said I was emotionally manipulating her. I would get in romantic relationships with other people on online games to try and cure my loneliness. Most of the time it didn't work but it at least made my life not as hard as it could have been. In elementary I really struggled making friends. No one really showed interest in talking to me or doing anything with me and I just had a hard time with fitting in. I would try to make friends but I would either still feel lonely, or other kids in a group would get payed more attention to than me which made me give up because it hurt too bad. For me when I felt lonely, it felt like someone was punching me in the chest and the pain was going through my torso and it burned, it hurt. I didn't just feel sad almost always, I also felt physical pain. Things I would do to try and cope with the constant sadness and pain I felt was eating bags of chips and boxes of candy in my bed all in one day. Once the pain hit really hard I would just eat a ton of it and would crave it too. I would also take showers more than I should have because it was soothing. This one is a bit silly but I would poop more because it felt more relieving. Something I would do extremely often was locking myself in the bathroom when I needed to cry or just wasn't feeling very great. And also to hide the fact I was talking to people online. Sometimes when I went into the bathroom to cry, my parents would access me of being up to no good. Which just made me really upset that they constantly thought I was always doing something bad and I was just no good. I remember sometimes crying in my room and they would walk in and somehow not notice or maybe they didn't care. I would use my imagination a lot to try and comfort myself. I would imagine someone hugging me or cuddling me every night I went to bed or after crying or just when I felt that pain. I didn't tell anyone about the pain I felt, other than people I met online. Pretty everyone irl thought I was perfectly fine. Summer breaks were the hardest cause I wouldn't make many friends at school, so during summer break I wouldn't have friends to go and hang out with. My parents probably wouldn't let me anyways cause they were very cautious. So most of my time spent during summer break was with my family who I'm not close with and didn't really seem to care about me, at my church I used to go to, and in my room or in the bathroom by myself. I remember there was this guy I was in a relationship online named Joshua and I was really close to him. He was around my age but lived really far. In 6th grade I would often day dream about him non stop because it was what distracted me from the overwhelming pain. Eventually he left me for someone else, and I swear when that happened, it just made me so much worse. For a day or two I just couldn't really get myself to eat cause it just made feel sick and I just felt so much more pain. I would cry myself to sleep. He was the person who comforted me when I came home from school, went online and just felt alone. After that I tried finding someone online that could give me similar comfort like that, who made me feel understood and listened to. But I didn't find it, I was desperate though. I just wanted to feel happy, but when I thought I felt happy, it turned out that I still felt the pain. It just never really went away and I wanted to just feel okay and happy for once but I was unable to. I felt worthless, like no one cared, I was always scared that I would be alone again. Eventually I got so used to feeling in pain and lonely that I was scared of feeling happy. I was scared of how it would change my life and I was scared I would be a different person. I didn't know what my life would look like if I was happy, it was too unfamiliar to me and it made me kind of scared to feel actually feel happy. NF is a rapper I listened to a lot cause I related to his songs, I listened to a lot of songs just so I could feel understood. Now, I don't feel lonely anymore. I've started to get used to it and now I kind of enjoy it. I still struggle with friends, mostly keeping them because I get stressed after a while of having a friend. And I just give up completely on the friendship and just want to be all alone. So I pretty much got comfortable with being alone.

1027,Constant-Spinach-326,1648248002,1,"19, female. I grew up with strict parents that couldn’t afford to put me in extracurriculars so I only went to school and came home. I was always praised by teachers since I was so quiet. Now I’m in uni, have social anxiety, socially awkward and have made no friends. It doesn’t help that there’s a pandemic so I stay home everyday to keep my parents safe. I have one best friend but I introduced her to my other friend and it seems like they are closer than we are which makes me sad. That friend I had also made fun of me for my awkwardness which is why I decline hanging out with my best friend because she wants to invite her even though she knows I don’t like her. I was at my other “best friend”‘s bday party and she drunkenly told me “I like you better when you’re drunk, I wish you weren’t so quiet and talked more”. I’ve heard this from others as well. When lockdown hit, I worked on myself and glowed up - fixed my posture, started wearing clothes that flattered me, wore makeup, and I was called pretty for the first time. I’ve never had people actually want to talk to me before - people would only talk to me to get close with my best friend or if they wanted to date her. So now idk how to act when people wanna actually talk to me and get to know me. I grew up ugly so I would get asked out as a joke and I have only 1 guy friend. I fear the awkwardness that comes with hugs, handshakes and any physical touch but at night when I’m laying in bed I actually think about how nice it would be to have someone to cuddle with. 

Everyone says to join clubs in uni but my interests include things like dance and painting and I don’t feel like I’m good enough to join a legit club where there’s people who have been dancing since they were 3 and majoring in art. Made friends in classes but when the class is over we don’t keep in contact. I also don’t have the energy to respond to people on Snapchat and I feel like there’s a pressure to look your best when snapping. I also feel like if I have something to say, it’s not interesting enough so I won’t say it/snap my friends. I want to find life-long friends but don’t know how since I live in a town where everyone knows everyone.

I feel like I need to develop a personality as well. I don’t really know what people are up to - I know everyone is a fan of marvel, anime etc but I’m not into those mainstream things so I find it hard to find common interests with people when I meet them and to talk to them about. I feel like a child in an adult body because I watch old Disney shows and cartoons and the bachelor. I spend my time either creating content (I’m an aspiring content creator and don’t want to sit at a desk job for the rest of my life and want to do smth fun while making enough to take care of my parents) or studying.

1065,TheTidark390,1648230781,1,"I'm 19years old, I have never had fell any love to anyone, and when I did it took me sooo long to tell them.

But one day I cracked, I told them, they also had feelings but they weren't sure it was a good idea as they just had a break up 2 months ago and they didn't felt ready... 
We ended up kissing 2 days later, trying to love eatchother not matter how hard it would be, I would have done everything to not make her feel stressed.

3days after my brithday we spoke about future, moving out together, family? Love stuff... we had small chats, and I asked her how they where doing, told me that it wasn't that great  but that time would help... 
The day after I asked them again how they where doing and not to hide it... and that when they told me they wish they never said to me that they loved me, I knew what was coming  we chose to talk front to front the next day.
The next day we went to the same place we talked the first time, and that was it, my heart was rushing, knowing what was about to happen, I couldn't believe it.
We left on our ways, I was alone, nothing made sense, an empty feeling in my chest, like I just lost everything. 
We talked later on, it gaved me hope, we spoke that we could retry one day if we still had the flame running for eatchother, it gaved me so much hope... 
And now that hope is lost burried under hundreds if not thousands of regrets. Receving a message telling you that they had been feeling so much better since they left me. Dreams where broken, the empty in my chest grows bigger every seconds.
I lost the love of my life, my first true love, and now I'm back alone, completly alone, family can't talk with them whitout being hurt, best friend as been so distant, and now I lost all hope for my love...
Maybe I was made to be alone, lonely since the start of my life... until the end.",lonely,When life gets you even more down.,2022-03-26 04:53:01

When I went to college I thought maybe starting over in a new place that wasn’t a small town reputation type of place it would work better. I had three cool roommates and made some good friends. Then one of my roommates broke up with her bf of two years. So I invited her to hang out with my friends to get it off her mind. The first week or so she didn’t engage much, but was happy for some company. Then after that she started to feel better and came out of her shell. We all hung out together and things were good, until out of nowhere she says that she is super into one of the guys in my friend group and he’s reciprocated the feelings. This is like two weeks after breaking up with her because that she had made marriage plans with, so I was a little wary and warned her to take a bit. She agreed and said they had discussed and decided to wait at least three months then check how feelings were to see if they still wanted to date. Two more weeks and they’re dating, and everyone in the friend group is worried and thinks they are moving way too fast. Two more weeks and they are all over each other and saying I love yours, and all the friends are having serious talks with them against this. Then we have Thanksgiving break and we all go home for a week. Five days into the break my friend calls me sobbing that she doesn’t have feelings for him. I console her and we agree that she should be honest with him, and that she was probably confused and used him as a rebound. We expect hurt from him, but know that he was also moving too fast and pushed her to say ilys before she was ready and such and was generally pushy so it didn’t help. He’s very upset with her and starts talking bad about her behind her back and is incredibly rude. I approach him about it and we seem to come to an understanding, but then he continues. I approach him again and tell him that yes, she was at fault, but so was he, that two weeks of dating shouldn’t have love involved anyway etc. basically I defended her, losing a friend in the process.

I don't always have the energy to play with my cat, and I worry that he'll start to hate me, and then I'll be truly alone.

My family actually worked their ass off to buy houses and to live better for their children and for themselves. My grandmother had a kid my mom at 18 and she had to work three jobs while my grandfather was in Vietnam. My grandmother was able to buy two houses and an apartment building with three jobs. How is that possible. I know things cost differently at that time but I think it’s incredible.

Another stereotype of me is that a lot of black families only have one parent homes. I have a reason though. My father was a good man. He couldn’t read but he worked in construction to get bills paid. Unfortunately one day he was at work working on the San Francisco bridge and there was a bad accident and him and a few other workers did not make it back home. I can’t help that I am the stereotype. It just happens.

I grew up with a family who clearly talk and don’t talk ghetto I guess if I should say. I didn’t grow up in the ghetto. So I talk like a white person I guess. Going to high school I never got along with the black kids. It was always so hard to understand them. It was like we are identical twins but born from the different person. I don’t know if that makes sense. Are used to get threaten a lot by the black girls at school because of how I held myself up. I’m kind of bulky I guess. I have a athletic build. I have a lot of muscle. But I am not a fighter. I hate fighting people. I’m a very passive and reserved person. I’m a healer.

Trying to explain simple things like this to them is like talking to a wall. They asked if I was adopted. Just some stupid shit like that. It makes no sense. One day I was going about my business and there was this girl that would always try to fight me but I gave up and I just started yelling at her because I don’t fight, all I asked was why do you wanna fight me I mean maybe I have a bitch face like 24 seven but that’s it. I only talk to 10 people out of the 300 people at the school.” I asked her how her day was. I asked her how she was. I asked her why do you do this to me. She was just stunned. We ended up being friends because I got the courage to talk and she got the courage to shut up and listen and put her fist down.

At the end of the year she brutally got beat up by two girls that cornered her in the classroom. It was really bad her whole face was practically destroyed. I think she had to get surgery. I hope she’s okay. I do miss talking to her though.

Within my group, we hardly talk or communicate properly with each other online. After 3 years of living together at uni we've all become incredibly close, but online messaging just isn't something we really do. The occasional messages, but I don't find myself having long text conversations with any of them.

Despite this we're a really strong group that vibes really well in person. We manage to arrange a weekend to meet up once every few months (planned heavily in advance), and these times are some of the best I've had since moving back home. We can go ages without properly talking or seeing each other, then it's like we were never apart once we do meet up.

After these weekends are over I go back home... where I have basically nil social life 

&amp;#x200B;

Even with this amazing group of friends, and plenty of family in my life, I feel so alone. 

I spend my days either in my part time job, or at home gaming. My Friday nights are no different to that of a Monday night. I feel kind of stuck in this loop. 

I'm hoping to move to a big city next year in pursuit of my dream career and a more social environment &amp; life. I have plenty of aspirations, and I'm excited for the future I'm working towards. Just biding my time until then. 

I never really had many friends growing up, prior to university. So this issue isn't entirely new for me. It's only these past few months I've started to realise just how alone I actually am inside, and have been for a long time.

Now more than ever,
I understand how to love you,

how to live our romantic fantasies,
as we’d once intended to.

But alas, we both were troubled,
heartfelt, and naive.

If I knew then what I know now,
perhaps now we’d be healing.

How headstrong were we,
for holding on so long.

If only ignorance were curable
without, first, severing bonds.

I wasn’t missing out on anything,
staying with my first.

I assumed our case was futile.
Now my daily thoughts are cursed.

Our intimacy was unmatched,
the connection truly special.

All things that I couldn’t see,
‘til I saw other people.

A few key moments without you,
was all I truly needed.

Now I have the skeleton key
for a lock that’s been defeated.

Oh how ignorant I was,
to close so many future doors.

My trials were trivial and problems fake.
My heart was truly yours.

I recently moved back to the city and maybe its good as where i was i had endless access to the mountains and wilderness in the north.

I found myself wandering farther and farther getting lost more than once and i realized any more wandering i would be lost beyond lost. Lost forever. But no one would know. Yet it was beautiful wandering in forests in winter covered in snow. Falling asleep under a tree under the night sky in 0 degree temps was so peaceful so soothing. I remember feeling this heavy feeling of sleep once in a snowstorm and i quickly got up as i knew what that sleep would lead to. But deep down i wanted that permanent rest, free from uncaring people and maybe if one person did care slightly they would find me asleep and hopefully learn to love the next person as much as they could. One day i will return and wander but never find my way back. To be a part of that peace permanently. 

What will i do now? I write music that tells a story in my own secret code. One i built with someone who i thought cared but didn't. 

What will i do now? I will keep working physically.

What will i do now? I will stop existing mentally. I will stop trying to impress. I will keep caring in little ways to help people but accept i will never get that in return....

To those that did care and read this. Thank you for the little love you showed. I don't hate you but i wish you didn't lie.

1190,Independent_Runner,1648164227,1,"I think I’ve always been a lonely person. Even when around other people. Ive never actually had that strong of a connection with many people. 

I think this stems from my romantic relationships that I’ve had/the relationships I witnessed growing up. And maybe someone else can relate to this.
I think most of my life I saw the negative aspects of what relationships were. So I would typically jump into what I thought were the “good” parts. I would hold on to them even if they were tiny and possibly insignificant parts. 

I’ve been in two very serious relationships and both started extremely quickly. Is this a result of being lonely? Do we quickly rush into things to avoid that feeling? Is this a bad thing? 

I had a talk with a friend about loneliness. How that manifests for other people. 
For him, he questions everything. Nothing feels safe for him. For me, I rush into a lot of things. My last relationship started day 2 of us meeting. I fell for her instantly and told her I loved her day 3 and she said it back. (Uhaul lesbian Love is blind style lol) we were in a relationship for 3 years and almost married. He said I was absolutely insane. And that it wasn’t true love. 

But we stayed together So can’t be horrible right? I guess my question is…the way loneliness shows up in my life vs the way it shows up in everyone else’s, is there a right or wrong way to be lonely? Am I crazy for being the type to not want that? I know some people are comfortable in that space.

1224,RelatableMolaMola,1648151118,1,"I have noticed several posts in here from OPs who have been trying to strike up conversations and make connections with people but not getting good responses. Most of the time, these OPs don't really know why people aren't receptive to them, and so default to believing that it's because of the way they look or other superficial reasons.

Sometimes it may be due to appearance, but in my experience, there are also many things people do that will put strangers off, no matter how hygienic and well dressed and generally acceptable looking you are. So here are some do's and don'ts that I put together based on years of observation and being on the receiving end of conversation starting attempts. Maybe this will help some of you guys!

DO: Limit your conversational attempts to people that are already in your immediate vicinity. So let's say you're at a coffee shop. Starting a conversation with someone who's already sitting near you is going to feel much more natural to them than being approached by some random person who crossed the entire room to say hello.

DON'T: Try to start a conversation with someone that you have to cross a large distance to talk to, UNLESS there was already some eye contact and sign of receptivity (like they smiled at you or something). Sorry, but it looks really fucking weird to be approached out of the blue by some person who came across an entire room or open space just to talk to you.

DO: Limit your conversational attempts to just one person. If the person is not receptive, call it a day in that location. It looks really fucking weird if some person is just wandering around a space trying to talk to random people. (Exception being if you're at a party or a bar or club, but even then, try not to look too desperate to find someone to talk to.)

DON'T: Go up to multiple people one after the other trying to start something. It looks desperate and creepy. People notice that shit. You don't want to be That Person that others are warning each other about. 

DO: Strike up a conversation by making a comment about something that you and the other person have in common. For example, if you're both at some kind of group event, make a comment about something happening at the event. If they're wearing or carrying something that shows they have a shared interest with you, make a comment about that.

DON'T: Start the conversation by asking personal questions out of nowhere (like what's your name, are you from around here, do you live near here, etc.). A lot of guides on making conversation will tell you to ask the other person about themselves. This does NOT mean to give them the third degree, especially about things like where they live or work. If the conversation that you started about a general topic or shared interest is going well, you can introduce yourself and then ask their name after a while. Not right at the beginning.

And one last DON'T: DON'T make comments to the other person that make it sound like you've been watching or taking notes on them. This has happened to me several times and to other people I know as well. When someone that I have never noticed or spoken to before in my life somehow knows that I often go to such-and-such place for lunch or that I like to take walks here at X time of day or week, that is just immediately creepy. Yes, people often notice each other, especially when their habits or routines coincide. No, they don't need to comment on that right when they meet. It really makes it sound like they're borderline stalking.

Hopefully this helps someone!",lonely,Do's and don'ts of striking up conversations with strangers,2022-03-25 06:45:18

I’m not looking for any new friends, for reasons explained later if you read that far. (Also sorry for shitty grammar, I’m pretty retarded.)

So, on with the “story” now. It started when I had to move to Texas because of my dad’s job, which I was not very excited about. The move from Virginia to Texas was a massive change in my life, and that’s when everything started going downhill. Due to the sadness of leaving my life-long home in Virginia, I stopped eating as much and still don’t for some reason. I did make a lot of friends, met the bully, who I’ll just call “Ass” and was having a pretty below average time, until the divorce. My parent’s divorce completely changed the way I thought and lived. I stopped making friends, stopped talking to people, and that’s when the minor self-harm started with my fingernails. After the divorce, my dad, the one with the job, stopped helping us pay for the house. The bullying from Ass got worse and worse, and I couldn’t defend myself due to anxiety and being just weak overall. My mom, who I decided to stay with, thought of moving into an RV due to money issues. Then the move to the RV happened, and I just didn’t know how to feel about it. 

Ass still bullied me by stabbing me with pencils, kicking me, and picking me up and throwing me due to my tiny frame from under-eating. This led to my severe PTSD, so I have a huge fear of being around potential people to meet, due to not wanting to go through the same experience with Ass. One day, I really lost all hope I had. So I was on Discord, with the remaining friends I had, and gave one of them admin over my server. This short part may seem stupid, but I was traumatized by Ass. So my best, most trustworthy friend, whom I granted the admin, started to do a “minuscule amount of trolling.” He made a rival server, planned an attack using bots, made a shitty diss track, and called my server corrupt and garbage due to my lack of trust in most people, while all my other friends were against me too. This is what caused me to lose 8 friends, which were all I had. That event evolved my PTSD tenfold, and caused my self-harm to become more rampant, using sharp objects. After that school year ended, my mom decided to put the RV to use, and take a trip across the country. Although I had escaped Ass, I still had to be cooped up with my sister and mom, which was not ideal for me. The trip was nice, and I am still on that very trip, but my mental health has been deteriorating. I don’t know how to feel, as I am having violent dreams and ideas of hurting others, but that goes against my own morals. I don’t know if I’m the victim, or I’m the reason of how I am. It’s just confusing, and I had to put this somewhere. 

I shortened this a lot, excluding a view major details for privacy of course, but I hope at least one person understands a little. 

TLDR: Got bullied, developed quite a few mental issues, and parents got divorced. I moved into an RV, having to be cooped up with my mom and sister. My mental health rapidly deteriorated, and still is.

1243,temprelationshipadv,1648142964,1,"TLDR:  How do you grow a long-distance friendship when the other person showed  interest but seems to have back off and is too busy? I don't want to  annoy her, but I also don't want to stop talking.

I want a friend and I am not very trusting with those that I don’t know. I’m also a little shy/introverted at times.

About  4 months ago I reached out to some old friends from high school to  reconnect (specific people that I cared about but lost touch with). I  ended up reconnecting with someone that I regretted not staying in touch  with. We have been chatting for a while and I have really enjoyed our  conversations.

A  good amount of time has passed sense I have talked to my friend before  reconnecting with her and she is now living outside of my country. She's  been in her new country for 4 years and is single and in a house of her  own.

We  both seemed to have a good amount in common and we both don’t trust  people easily and have had bad relationships (friendships and SO). So,  after having great conversations for the first month of talking, she  invites me to visit her. I agreed and started planning my trip and  learning her language (she started teaching me, twice a week). I was  extremely excited to see her and experience new things in her country.

A  few months in and things started to slow down, she started talking to  me less and less. After a few weeks of little conversation from her, I  flat out asked her in class if she still wanted me to visit and if we  were friends. She told me that she didn’t want me to visit and that she  does not consider us friends. She then explains that she only counts 3  people that are close to her as friends (one being family) and that she  is very selective. She also stated that she is not the type of person  that talks to people every day or even every other day (prefers chat  over text).

A  few classes later, I told her that because I was not going to her  country that I would cut back on classes as there was no rush in  learning faster and I wanted to save some money. She replied “what?!  You’re not coming to visit?”. I reminded her that she said she didn’t  want me to visit. She clarified that she was just currently too busy but  that she still wanted me to visit…. Talk about being left very  confused. Anyways I did mention that I don't have a lot of friends and  that I had an anxiety attack from what she said to me. She apologized  and was sincere about it.

I  know it might seem like she’s scamming me with her classes but she’s  not. She told me not to buy plane tickets when I was about to, she  counted some gifts as payment towards classes, and I offered to help her  get a new computer (I’m IT and she relies on her computer for her  livelihood) and she did not take up the offer.

I do trust her; I just don’t think she trusts me.

She  could also have some walls up, and if that’s the case I want to show  her that I support her and mean no harm. And/or maybe we are just  different in the way we handle relationships… If someone left me a  message and I was busy I’d still find time to reply in a day or two. But  she does not and that makes me feel like she does not care if she can’t  find the time for me. She has once before apologized and told me that  she was not ignoring me...

If anyone’s been in a similar situation here are my questions to you….

I  am trying to be her friend, I help her with computer stuff, talk to her  about her animals/what’s going on in her life. However, I have no idea  how to progress our relationship. For the past few weeks when I leave  her a message, she won’t reply for 3-4 days or until our next class. The  best thing I can think to do is to leave her alone. **Is leaving her alone the right move or will that just cause our relationship to fade away?**

**Should I pick a day of the week spaced out from class day and only message her on that day once a week?**

**Should I try talking to her about any of this?**  I was able to focus on learning her language when I had the goal of  visiting her. Now that visiting is unknown and she’s not really talking  to me as much my learning is suffering due to lack of motivation.

Getting  mixed signals from her. I think part of it is me and part of it is her.  Anyways I hope I’ve given enough detail. I am just not sure what I  should do... I a bit scarred that I might handle this wrong and mess  everything up.

1246,goodjudge_1331,1648140799,1,"Due to an overly detached method of parenthood and an emotionally abused childhood, I grew up trying to be the perfect child while undermining all of my emotions. I was never praised for my achievements (of which I have many, I know it sounds arrogant but this is only for context) just told to do even better next time and if I failed, I would receive the verbal lashing of a lifetime.

19 years later, I am a selfish cynical who is afraid of emotional intimacy and uncomfortable with physical touch. To make things even more pathetic, lately, when I pretend to be mentally ill, it's oddly comforting. That's terrible isn't it?

Yet I crave for someone to understand me and love me, but due to my underdeveloped emotional intelligence, I can never put my feelings into words.

This has led me to be a faker. I can act friendly and even charming at times, but in truth I am very lonely. Because of this, any attractive person who shows me the least but of attention, I give my whole loyalty to them, in case of women I fall in ""love"" with them. 

And when these people undoubtedly get tired of me, I feel pathetic and get engulfed by the most useless emotion ever, self pity.

It's just a rambling of thoughts and these words don't have any proper structure to them but I really don't want to feel this way. Any advice?

Really sucks to be lonely. I was fine with it for a long time, but as I get older fantasy and escapism don’t work as well. But when I am among people I just can’t do anything to move forward. All I feel is discomfort and all I can think to say is some boring shit.

I lost the person that I went to to spend time with, the only person in my life that would listen to me.
I am working on myself and I have so much self love, but because the way it ended I feel like everything that happened in the relationship was a lie, or like one sided.
So now I have that feeling that no one finds me attractive nor enjoyable to be around even tho I would disagree with myself.
I have friends but they either make jokes on the situation or we just hangout but I feel lonely around them. 
I survive some nights without feeling this pain. But now and then I feel this aching pain that I am so lonely, no one to share what I’m doing with because my friends either don’t care or don’t have time.
And I hate how dating has become, call me old fashioned, everyone craving physical relief only and no one interested in any serious relationship maybe it’s because I am young (20). All I want is someone to spend time with, spoil and feel some genuine love.
Idk how to deal with this aching loneliness the moment I finish whatever I am doing I feel it.
I am definitely not perfect but I feel like I’m good enough for someone to show some interest not necessarily romantically but friendship wise too. I always have to be the one to be interested in the other and I feel like it makes me needy.
Idk how to deal with this. I desperately need help. I am going to therapy, I have been in therapy for 2 years as I want to be a better person.

1293,lbrowneu,1648105693,1,"I’ve had 3 (me and them) trio friendships. First was K-9th, second was college freshman to end of sophomore year. Third was 4th grade - beginning of junior college year. 

The first ones became ex friends because we didn’t have to same views and they stopped reaching out first. The second ones were just toxic and kept bailing on me and shit talking about me to each other. The third ones completely ditched me and they hurt the worst. 

The third were two twins. We grew up together. My family and I helped them out of almost being homeless twice. We almost adopted them. My mom and dad have paid  so much for them. Then they just ditch me? We went to different colleges but I have a friend 2 states away and we’re better friends than the two friends that were 3 hours away. The friend that’s in the other state has only been my friend for 5-6 years. The twins were 12 years. The first year of my freshman year they start bashing me all the time as a joke. My humor is mostly sarcasm and trash talking so I was like okay that’s all they’re doing. They don’t mean it. I didn’t trash talk them much because they always seemed to have something worse to come back with which hurt so I didn’t try. I started getting hurt by what they were saying so I got on my phone a bit more. They got into kpop and I didn’t. I tried to listen to songs here and there FOR THEM but I guess that wasn’t enough to show them that I cared. They made their entire personality kpop and it wasn’t mine. They’d ask me to do things related to kpop and I did here and there at first but then they never cared about my interests so I stopped. I got on my phone more. They noticed that and kept pointing it out to me and I always told them it was because they kept saying mean things to me and never did things I wanted to do. What I said didn’t matter at all but I was still at complete fault for being on my phone. This fight happened before junior year started. I transferred colleges literally mostly to have better friends (them) than my last friends at the other school and the twins begged me to come here. It was closer to home so I got to see my bf more and the drive doesn’t bother me so much so I transferred for my mental health. Their boyfriends moved in with the other twins bf and they were never home. I never was in their priorities. I asked and asked when to hang out and they kept bailing or never answering and I felt excluded and I told them that. 2-3 months in and the completely bailed on me. Everything became my fault. They never called or texted or came over. I literally live in the same apartment complex as them. Not once have they come by. 

I miss them so much. I literally have no friends anymore close by. The friends I do have are always busy or lives far away. I feel so lonely and hurt and I feel like no one cares about me. No one ever reaches out to me. I get so depressed over it. Idk what to do anymore.

1294,gunpowdergelatineee,1648104708,1,"I've been avoiding most people these days. While I'm welcoming of a nice conversation, there's a lingering feeling of a lack of a sense of belonging in me. With my friends and family, I feel like I don't have a place anymore. It took me a while to accept this feeling because as ironic as it may sound, I do hate it when a friend vents to me about this kind of thing. I usually think, ""hey, carry yourself well, we all feel that way sometimes,"" that I forget how tough that can actually feel, especially since I'm in that situation now.   


Because of this, I feel ashamed, too, to be lonely. I just immerse myself in my studies to distract myself. When at the moment, I do enjoy it. In turn, I'm doing pretty well in school. In the long run, I don't find it as fulfilling as having a deep, solid connection with someone. I do think my life has gotten out of balance. It feels so so lonely. People say loneliness comes from not being able to express yourself freely, and I kinda agree. I feel trapped. 

I'm also not sure if this loneliness is just part of growing up or something I have to address because I feel like my values are getting different from my friends', but this difference comes from having a stronger sense of integrity and discipline. I feel a little lost.

I personally don’t enjoy that so I don’t engage in their gossip, but for some reason they like my personality and include me in everything (which is why I stuck around - an adopted introvert ) 

Recently I’ve been hanging out with 2 other people who for the first time I’m able to have meaningful conversations with. I felt sociable and extroverted when I talked to them and so I hung out with them for about 5 days, while still talking normally with the other group. However there’s a clear shift in attitude from the circle I was adopted in. They’re avoidant, they keep mentioning “how I don’t talk to them” which was never the case and they don’t invite me to hangout or have lunch with them anymore. I explained to them I like being a bit sociable these days and trying to talk to different people (like am I not allowed to do that) and they were like “um yeah sure “ in a sarcastic tone. now it’s really awkward and idk how to deal with shit like this.

I've always done that for everyone else though, but I think the exhaustion of depression and constant rejection has rendered me to weak to try anymore.

I have a job I enjoy and am surrounded by good people. I’m in college and socialize/ meet a lot of people. Perspective wise, like I said I have a good out take on things. I’ve been through some of the shittiest situations in life and am grateful for everything beyond believe. Everyone says they’re attractive but I’ve genuinely been told that a lot. Of course, the girls who i want to be attracted to me usually hook up w me once then dip. Or I just get kept as a f buddy on the side. Not to be scary but I’m a sociopath so I can be pretty much who any girl wants me to be. I wear nice clothes but am humble and down to earth. I do carry myself with confidence though. I used to lead the party/ rave life and I loved it but ended up getting into legal trouble because of it which made me realize it’s not worth it. Anyways I feel like every girl I ended up with so far has just been toxic/ struggling with their own shit. I’ve been single for almost 8 years and pretty much came to the realization the all the bonds with women I considered “relationships” were just meaningless and I was just being used as a rebound. I’m only 19 so I’m young I suppose. I know there’s time for it to get better but it’s just so lonely sometimes. My only real good friends are dead, in jail somewhere, or just fucking so isolated from the same feeling that they barely leave their basements (I tend to have similar friends to me.) Point being no matter how happy you are with yourself, there will come a time when you wake up in the morning and realize that there’s no point to anything in this life if you don’t have someone to share it with. This is pretty much where I’m at right now. Lately I haven’t been hooking up with anyone because I just want a relationship at this point. I don’t care how long it lasts and if it goes down in flames in the first month. I just want the experience. I’m a lesbian so that doesn’t help (but that’s a whole other topic.) I just know that the clock is ticking and am scared shitless times gonna pass me by and I’m going to be 25-30 and still alone. That’s what shit gets really dire and I’m already feeling hopeless as it is. Money is not making me happy anymore. I’m starting to get traction off of a hobby so maybe fame would feel the void but that’s a LONG shot. I just want someone to spend some time with (because apparently sharing your life with someone is to much to ask even temporarily) and to give my heart to.

In real life at school, I am extremely anxious and awkward. This logically means that it's hard for people to talk to me, and that I can't approach people. 

However, this person and I started online, meaning i've been able to open up in private a lot better. But in person, things are still difficult. Like on Monday we talked a little bit. Extremely small shit, I haven't completely changed in a few days, but as a start y'know it's fine. But today we didn't talk at all. Yes, I probably could have approached them and they would've, but stupid poopoo anxiety brain won't let that happen. Today I felt so terrible. But then, I came back home, talked to them, and felt way better. You might say this is a temporary problem, and then when things get better in real life there won't be a problem. But the thing is, this shows how emotionally reliant I am on them. And I don't want to be. Getting massivly depressed because you just didn't talk to someone is so fragile, and isn't something I would've felt two weeks ago.

1345,retrodruggie,1648086929,1,"I'll start this off by saying that I'm a freshman in college with only a month left. At the beginning of my first semester of college, during orientation, I met a boy who I instantly clicked with. We ate dinner together all the time with a group of new friends we had all met within the first week. After my first month of college, I and he were dating and very close. He was the only person I felt like I could connect with on campus. We ended up breaking up a little over a month of college and it was difficult at first because I felt lonely. His reasoning was because ""he needed to work on himself."" I became detached from the friendgroup because he was apart of it, after all he introduced me to the friendgroup. Overtime I slowly came back to the friendgroup because I wasn't having much luck meeting other people at college, despite joining clubs and talking to other students in my classes. I also decided to spend all my time on working out, piano, and homework since those are all things I enjoy (expect homework I just have to do that of course). 

2 months after we broke up, he came back telling me how much he missed me and how he regretted leaving me. I didn't expect that to happen so soon and wasn't sure what to do. In that point of my life I felt independent and stable but I was still lonely and I remembered how well we connected before. I did miss him too after all, but deep down I knew this wasn't the best idea since second chances don't always go well. After thinking it over, I decided to give him a second chance and we started dating again. At this point we were just a few weeks away from winter break so the feeling felt ""new"" again and everything in my life felt amazing. I was genuinely really happy because I felt as though I had some close friends and a new relationship and everything was going my way. After my last final I decided to trip acid with a close friend back home and it was great. I remember feeling a very strong emotion about the boy I was with. It was so intense I realized that I loved him. 

After winter break things were great, we got even closer and I would sleep over all the time. Since these things are still new to me, I never realized how much I enjoy just sleeping next to the person I love. Inevitably our relationship began to go downhill. He was going through a depression, not communicating about it to me, not focusing as much on school, and began prioritizing everyone else above me. He stopped being physically interested in me and we decided to ""take a break"" after 2-3 months of dating, again. He wanted to break up with me at first, this time because ""he felt as though we can't relate on our childhood experiences,"" but we ended up taking a break instead. 

It was different because the friend group began to fall apart and I knew I didn't have a place so I left. I'm in a sorority as well but I don't feel very connected to the girls they are just not my people. The last time he broke up with me he didn't talk/text me for the entire time he left and even though this time we were on a break, he still didn't text me. However, during the break, I learned some information I didn't know before. I found out the first time he left me was for his ex back home and he had lied to me. It was really hurtful to find out that he lied to me and during our ""break"" I find out that he met new girls with his guy friends and they all smoke weed and sleep over almost every night. I still have a tough time understanding why these people were better than me because I just wanted the best for him. 

About a month after we decided to take a break I finally texted him to break the silence and told him we needed to talk. I was going to end things because I knew he didn't want to get back with me and it was just a bad idea. He texted me back telling me that he assumed we broke up because of the silence, which upset me because I don't think that's how a breakup is supposed to go. Regardless, we finally met in person to talk. I confronted him about lying to me and told him about some of his behavior that was wrong. After an hour he started having a breakdown and crying. I felt bad because I still loved him and so I hugged him for a while when he cried. He told me he lied to me because he felt bad for leaving his ex with her mentally ill mother and absent father. Their relationship wasn't healthy but he basically said he just felt like he needed to be there for her because of her poor home life. Obviously, things didn't work out. As for why we broke up this most recent time he said it was because he felt so guilty for lying to me and for treating me bad he had to let me go. 

We had another final conversation before I unadded him on all my socials. He told me he'll ""always love me, it's just different. An appreciative type of love."" That just kills my soul to hear because I still love him and want to be with him even though I know he's not a good person. I've been through breakups before but they always hurt the same everytime and it sucks. I guess I'm jealous he gets to flourish in his new friendgroup because he can become a new persona to them. I'm alone and I eat alone all the time now. All I can really do is work on homework and get sad over the situation and my own loneliness. I feel very lost and like I don't know what to do or where to go next. I don't want to be alone for the rest of college but I'm afraid that's going to happen.

I’m 14 gonna be 15 in a couple months. I have no friends. No social life.

1360,Flyaway_5,1648080905,1,"Everyone I have ever met in my life has told me that I'm beautiful. Some, even the most beautiful that have ever seen.

All my life, I've expected the rest of the world to bow down before my beauty and tell me that I'm beautiful. I always rely on that validation and reassurance. I keep on waiting for people to tell me that I'm beautiful. I keep track of who tells me I'm beautiful and who hasn't. For those who haven't, I wonder if they think I'm beautiful.

This happened with my 50 year old same sex female teacher. I was expecting her to tell me that I'm beautiful even as she was rejecting me, and I noticed that she didn't tell me what I wanted to hear, and just pointed out aspects about my personality. I was crying over it.

My own thinking has led to me having many problems in life. I lack even the most basic common sense, even when something is so obvious. Like, flying to Germany and showing up unannounced at the airport asking to be picked up at 11 PM and expecting to free load for two weeks with relatives I haven't seen in 17 years over Christmas. Being invited to a friend's birthday party and not even talking to her and wondering why she became cold to me.

Even at work, When toothpicks fell, I was picking them up to put them back on the bottle. I was stacking clothes that they kept on falling. My coworkers who are younger than me helped me and their minds are more mature than mine. When my former professor 40 years my senior told me he loved me and that I was the most beautiful woman he has ever met, I was blown away. I was so distracted by him telling me that I was beautiful that I could not see that he could have been lying.

I have received a couple of complaints about my personality. Someone told me, ""Yes, you are beautiful in looks, BUT UGLY AS HELL AT HEART. You are narcissistic and manipulative. You surely do act like the world revolves around you. Another person has told me, ""You told me that you are 27. When I was talking to you, I felt like I was talking to a 16-year-old. You are a very immature woman, and you're not that bright either."" Is this why I don't have any friends?

People say being fat is bad because it means you’re lazy and careless, but they don’t mean it. What they really think is that being fat is ugly. 

EVERYONE is flawed. No one is perfect. But because fat is ugly, it’s okay to tell you that you need to fix that flaw. The hot guy at the bar could be a fucking serial killer for all society cares but at least his face tickles the beauty receptors so he’s probably a catch. 

Sexuality is fucked. Sex is fucked. It’s all just a stupid biological trick and there’s no point trying to pretend it isn’t all about using people as living sex robots, because that’s what it is. And when you use someone you’re really good friends with as the sex robot, you think you’re in love, but you’re not. You’re just friends with the person you also happen to enjoy using as a sex doll to stimulate your biological urges like a robot and that’s all there is to it. 

It’s no wonder fat people are rejected. It’s not just our society that’s superficial. Sex itself is fucking superficial.

We'd hangout after office. They'd even spend their weekends with me. Eventually, after 2 years of knowing each other, on my birthday, they told me they loved me. I had feelings for them as well, but I did not want to ruin the bond that we shared. So, I didn't say it back at that moment, or perhaps I was taken aback by the suddenness. A couple of days later, they were very vulnerable and we were just listening to music in my room. I looked at them and it dawned upon me that I have never loved anyone the way I love this person sitting next to me right now. That is when I told them I loved them back.

2 years later. Things were going very good. They lived 10 mins away from me. They'd be at my place almost all the time. We were practically living together. Life was amazing. One morning, I sensed something was wrong. I asked them, they denied and said everything was okay and left my place. Usually, they'd text me as soon as they reached their place, letting me know that they're home. That day, I did not get any texts. So, naturally, I texted them to ask. That's when they broke up with me saying ""Don't expect anything from me. You're on your own. You ain't got shit on my conscious. Try what you want, say what you want, I don't give a f*ck."" And I was blocked. The very next day, they started seeing one of our mutual friend's cousin.

One day you care so much. The next day you don't give a f*ck. How do people change like that? If they had stopped loving me, if there was someone else, they could have told me. We were friends before everything. They could have told me and we could have ended things mutually and on a friendlier note. Why did they have to end things so badly? I begged them. I begged them to tell me what's wrong. And I regret nothing more than that. For months, I lost all sense of myself. I didn't sleep for 3-4 days at a stretch. I wasn't able to eat. I just lay in the bed and cried, when I was not sitting in the corner of my room and crying.

My typical day is walking around town aimlessly on my own, maybe get coffee, try to do some work (can't focus) and sleep/watch YouTube videos. 

When I am out I see people having fun. In groups, drinking etc. I feel weird being on my own. 

I made one friend at university, but it's moved to online and nobody goes to class anymore physically. He just texts when he's looking coursework answers

This is embarrassing, but I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 14. When I turned 15 and had heart surgery, mix that with living with abusive parents, it's like my personality changed, I literally feel zoned out every day. Talking to people seems like a big task. And I don't fit in with anyone

A few months passed and after having this obsession with them it was slowly starting to fade although I did still think about them sometimes however after all this time they finally apologised and gave closure in the most sincere way that it’s been very difficult again I thought this closure would help but it just feels like the obsession is growing stronger again I just miss them so much it hurts I miss the conversations and having someone to always talk to about everything.

1400,No_body7,1648059564,2,"I have always been a quiet, shy, awkward person. Growing up, it felt I was shamed for being this way. It sucks, because lately I've felt so conflicted. I like keeping to myself, but at the same time I want to talk to people, get involved in conversations, make friends, talk in class, etc. When I do try and be more social, people either ignore me, they give me weird looks, they don't take me seriously, they make a big deal out of the fact that I am actually talking, or some dumb shit comes out of my mouth and it makes things awkward. This makes me isolate myself from people and I just stop trying, I am literally the quiet kid in the background, I feel invisible and unwanted. This will also make people more likely to ignore me, cause who is gonna want to talk to the guy that never talks? 

I tried explaining everything as well as I could. Maybe I just have really bad social skills and anxiety, or they have just gotten a lot worse over the years. I tend to overthink every social interaction, literally everything I say in a conversation, or like the other day I held the door for someone but I felt like I stood there for way too long and made it awkward and creepy. Overthinking these things suck, it makes me want to be less social, and then I feel more lonely. I would say that I am an introvert, but that shit can get real lonely sometimes, I'd like to have at least one friend that I can talk to whenever, or do nice things with occasionally. The thing is I actually had quite a close group of friends when I was a kid, but of course everyone grows up. 

School finishes in a few months anyway, so what is the point in trying to be social now? Everyone already has their friendship groups, every teacher already has their favourite students, everyone's personality is already ""set"". There is literally no point now in me trying to change these things about myself and make friends, in a few months I'll never see any of these people again and I'll immediately be forgotten about :).

I was kind and sweet, I wrote music and poetry, I praised her actions and told her how proud I was of her ambitions and talents... I don't see what more I could be, but I tried anyways... We had a child together, and my son is my best of all best friends and the only friend I have... The problem is that I only feel alive when I have him and I only get him on weekends... When he's gone, I work and sleep then wakeup to work and sleep again, counting the hours until I see his little smile... The loneliness is bleeding into every aspect of my life... I fall in love with any woman who shows me even a remote semblance of kindness and interest... Then they tell me not long after that they just met someone else and ""We just clicked, I'm so sorry if I hurt you"" It's so bad that my notifications wake me up from a dead sleep because I'm surprised my phone's making any sound at all... I get so excited just to have contact with ANYONE to talk about my ideas and thoughts, but it's never enough to keep anyone's attention... I'm a tattoo artist, I play 6 different instruments, I am an encyclopedia of knowledge, I'm successful in my career, and I have my own house and car that I own and I'm only 26...

Maybe I'm just so overjoyed at the thought of someone giving me attention that I become overwhelming? I don't know... But it's... It's making my eyes rain a lot...

I couldn't get the energy to be productive anymore. I should be studying for the next term, but I don't have that motivation or will to do so. 

People my age are doing so much better than me, even having relationships. I'm 20, single, and wish I could get on antidepressants already without waiting for months.

I recently had a conversation with a random guy on Discord, they mention how crying is natural and would happily lean on a girl's shoulder to cry on. I don't feel the same way. I don't feel comfortable with intimate touches, and I lost the ability to cry so.

Another thing that bothered me a lot and lead me into this mess was that I kept dreaming about that ex best friend of mine. We used to be friends since childhood and it was fun to hear her random facts and insights. Why couldn't I stop dreaming of her? Why does she still appear in my dreams where I'd usually hang out with her?

She's not dead, she just ghosted me half a year ago because I was being an awful friend. (Don't pity me.)

I don't have anyone anymore and nothing will ever match the friendship I had with her. Can't cry anymore. I can't succeed. I'll be lonely if I couldn't overcome my fear of affection and intimate touches.",lonely,Having a hard time crying.,2022-03-23 18:48:43

I'm like a breath of fresh air but I scare them. No one likes change. And getting close to me means they are forced to look at their lives through different lenses. They are forced to see the boredom. The mediocrity. And it's so easy for them. They're around one day and gone the next. Like I was simply a figment of their imagination. How do I keep going when who I am makes people run in the other direction? Why should I? I wrote a post a long time ago that I've since deleted about how the closest I've ever been to heaven was when I stood at the top of the Cliffs of Mohr in Ireland. And everytime I feel sad I think about those cliffs. My cliffs. I could stay up there forever. And yet I'm down here. Everyday feels like a marathon. Everyday I struggle to get out of bed. My husband makes me feel guilty and sad everyday. I wish I had chosen to wait until my person came around. Because he isn't it. And now I have to deal with the anxiety of going to grad school full time and timing my escape so I don't end up homeless. He's not a bad man. He's a complicated man. And I feel guilty all the time for continuing to stay when we don't behave like a couple at all. But I also feel guilty about leaving because what if he ends up alone? But I'm alone.

1473,slugsquad0007,1648015730,1,"Thinking back, I’m honestly surprised I’m still alive. I was about 18.  In my room all day every day for months, the loneliness psychologically dismantled me. I made poor decisions. Then April 5th 2020, I snapped into intense spells of paranoia. I couldn’t sleep. I woke up after “sleeping” for two hours and my stomach was tight. I bent over the bathroom  and tried to vomit but nothing came out. My entire body was shaking, and I barely ate. I would maybe eat a half bowl of oatmeal a day. Certain thoughts would trigger an intense feeling of panic. I further isolated myself, as being around people would trigger some type of panic attack. Came to the decision that I needed to either get myself killed or go to jail for a righteous cause to redeem my sorry excuse of a life. The night before I went through with my plan, an online friend from Florida texted me. She told me I wasn’t in the right state of mind. I folded on the plan. But the intense spells of paranoia and random outbursts of crying stopped slowly as I moved back into the city I grew up in and reconnected with old friends.

Thinking back, a combination of a bad home life, the pandemic, loneliness, and (the key factor,) my poor personal decisions, did INCREDIBLE damage to my mental health. I honestly didn’t think I’d make it to 19, and if I did I’d be in prison.

My mind: you are incapable of feeling any attraction towards someone else that isn't for your own interior motives.

Me: what the hell does that mean?

My mind: you won't ever fully love them, you will trick both of you that you love each other and *when* you break up you will be more scared to be alone than to have lost that person as a partner.

Me: pretty sure everything you're describing is how a basic relationship works I don't know why you feel so inclined to throw all this trickery nonsense in.

I'm not alone but I feel lonely. 

I'm geographically away from most of them and we are rarely together. 

I spend most of my time alone and really without anything meaningful to do. And even though I want to stop this cycle it seems like it just keeps going. I go to sleep after 4AM and wake up really late.

The people I talk with, like university classmates, are just there for a few hours and are not really ""friends"". They don't really make an effort to be with me. 

All this makes me go into a sort of depressive state that comes and goes and makes me not take care of myself. I haven't been healthy for the past few months.

I feel even more lonely since I broke up a relationship a few months ago that used to make most of the loneliness go away. And in between all this, I moved to another country, all alone, for 6 months (I'm back now), which didn't help at all.

before this happened I was very joyous and playful with my friends. around 21 I was just popular and just living and enjoying life but like all good things things came to a end and also with people being involved a lot of jealous and envy is what messed up a lot of friendships that I’ve had with others. 

every friend I’ve had it’s always been a one sided understanding I never really felt like friends with anyone at all when I come to think of it. 

but anyways, after I heard about certain people talking behind my back as well as a mixture of a stressful mom hounding you and always over romanticizing everything I couldn’t help but to be in a shell where I can just be my friend and go missing from everyone. It wasn’t a pleasant feeling as I went a year with little to no contact with anyone that I’ve know. 

and now I am in a predicament that has caused even more people no to like me with probable cause. 

recently my mom kicked me out around this same time last year for smoking in my house. I knew it was wrong but the thing that made matters worse is when she broke my room door open and we ended up fighting. to make a long story short I ended up moving out of my house for 8 months living out of a suitcase with my uncle. 

my uncle was cool he was just too noisy and indirect when speaking which amused a lot of issues with him as well. can you imagine someone saying it’s okay for you to stay with them just to talk behind their back and act weird the whole time. no to mention his family was also there so it just made things a bit sketch when it came to them accepting that I was going to be there. 

while living there, I was dating a girl who was not a good choice at all, as much as she tried to be me and her being together wasn’t healthy at all. plus she was doing sketch shit on the side as well.

1535,daisyboo12345,1647986430,1,"Where to begin....

Had a large group of friends as a teenager, stupidly ditched them for first boyfriend and they did start to get into drugs etc a bit. 

Made friends during university but most drifted off. 

Met the odd friend post uni from flat and house shares but now they don't check in and don't ask to meet up often. 

I had one close friend since university but after a big fall out things just havnt been the same and I realised our friendship was very one sided and we drifted apart and stopped speaking. 

Made friends through work but mostly not my age group. I changed jobs last year and work from home and since I moved ex colleagues have started to fade away/have stopped messaging me despite me really trying to keep a bond going. 

Loads of people from school are turning 30 and all I see on Facebook etc is them doing big posts to each other with throwback pics (some of which I was at the parties of/took the photos etc) saying how they go way back and are best friends and couldn't live without each other. 

My husband has a large group of friends (guys and girls) who live a few hours away from us. I'm really friendly with them at group events but they never invite me to stuff as my own person and not as Xs wife. One of the girls bachelorette parties is coming up and it feels like everyone is invited except me. 

I genuinely feel like I have no loyal/real friends and that no one really cares about me except my husband and family. Most people I know would never think I feel this way or realise I have no friends. I feel like I'm just a background character for a lot of people and once they leave that environment (university/work etc) they just leave me behind and don't see me as worthy of keeping hold of. 

I really care about others, I always try and help people. I love fun and having a good time. 

It feels pretty awful to have come to this realisation.",lonely,turned 30 and realised I have 0 friends,2022-03-23 09:00:30

We all want love and sometimes we get to taste it as it passes us by. Love is beautiful, and something isn't beautiful because it lasts. Just like a sunset, it happens only then and only now. It doesn't last forever but we hold onto it as it's warm rays touch our skin and our hearts. Once the light has passed we are left with a memory of a brighter time in our life. In the darkness we can use this old love to make the dark seem less lonely.  


Once we have lost this love we will feel loss but also happiness that we had the fortune and luck to feel this wonderful emotion. Bittersweet love is when we feel love for something that once was, could have been or never will be.

1582,S_Mohamed,1647966090,1,"In my younger years (6-14) I was a massive loner who basically had no friends. Since then, and now towards the end of my undergraduate degree, I’ve come to make a very small but good amount of friends. However, one thing that I have never been fortunate enough to experience was a relationship or romantic/sexual encounter of any kind. (21M, hetero.)

First things first, fuck all that incel BS, I’m not about that. This isn’t me blaming women for anything. But just feels like the chance of being in a romantic encounter is just greyed out of my life, like I’m a base level video game character trying to start an end game story mission. And it hurts.

Some days I don’t care, some days I look across the street and see an old couple in locked arms chattering away and I smile. And then I remember I will never know what that feels like.

I'm punctual, responsible, and mature. Sure I might be ugly, fat, shy and fairly boring. I really enjoy playing games of all kinds - board, card, video, you name it - and love watching and discussing the narratives of movies and TV shows, but don't really have any other hobbies beyond that. I don't have any career ambitions to speak of but I do want to travel, particularly with another person. I'm a tad lazy but don't mind an adventure every now and again.  

Why is it that no one even wants to give me the time of day? No one ever approaches me, ever. And when I get the nerve to approach others (extremely rare phenomenon), I always get ignored, or shooed away with a generic ""Sorry, not interested"" type of line.  

All I want, is someone to hang out with. To experience new things with, to try new foods, see new places, do new activities. To cuddle on the couch and watch a good movie, if only platonically. I crave that physical closeness. I cry myself to sleep every night, squeezing my pillow so tight I'm worried I might force the stuffing out either end. I want it so goddamn desperately...why am I not good enough? I'm 30 years old and never once have I ever come close to experiencing that kind of connection with another human being.

I absolutely love any sort of hugs or cuddles or anything of that nature (provided that it isn’t sexual) and feel completely empty and starved inside if I even go a day without it. I haven’t had any since the 31st of October. I just really need someone that I can hug, someone that I can hold in my arms (and be held in hers), someone who i can lay down next to and have my arm around, someone to share a blanket with as she rests her head against my chest, someone who I can cuddle with like I’m a giant baby (and the other way around, too)…

I have had a huge crush on a particular girl for 6 years. Needless to say, she does not like me back, likely because when we were in 9th grade, I got really jealous and needy and I ended up destroying our friendship. We have become close friends again but she has said she’s not interested in having a relationship with me… ever.

I don’t have many requirements for a relationship other than I need a Christian relationship, it needs to be centered around Jesus. I also would need her to be okay with me having depression and anxiety issues since I can’t just make them go away.

I'm a 22M and I always felt unwanted so I never shoot my shot with any girl since I feel like I'll waste my time, I also work in retail so I see a lot of women come through our store and of course it's part of my job to be friendly but honestly I feel dead inside when talking to most of the customers. Even right now being 2am for me, I feel dead inside not being able to express myself the way I want to. I’ve been reading and watching Seinen (romantic) anime and manga and I’ve realized how much of a hopeless romantic I am, trying to find someone but that someone will never come. It’s nights like this where I start thinking what I’m doing wrong with my life, what I can improve, what I could do better to be more attractive, or at least approachable. There has been days when I’m out with my friends and they always express how they met their women and I’m there wondering why that hasn’t happened to me yet, of course I ask them how they did it but they always say “just be yourself” but I am myself when I’m around women so I know I must be doing something wrong. I know I’m not that bad looking but somedays I think I am. Seeing my friends with their woman still gives me hope that I’ll find someone but somedays I’m hopeless.

A few recent examples:
My sister currently lives with my mother, she suffers from depression/anxiety because of the toxic environment there. I have invited her over many times and force her to go out with me. It’s getting more difficult to even get a reply out of her, or for her to answer my calls. I invite her over for dinner just to get out of the house and she doesn’t even reply? I’m getting sick of having to try so hard every time I want to see her. 
My mum only calls me once very few months if she wants something or to tell me what I’m doing wrong in life. 
My uncle from my dads side is here from Japan and instead of texting me to catch up he texts my boyfriend??
My other sister I also feel like I force to hang out with me. She does admit she just forgets to reply most the time. 
They are the only family I have left but I feel so disconnected even though I’ve tried so hard. Is it me? Am I the problem? 

Also just had a baby 6 months ago and wanted more then anything for them to be a part of her life. When I was pregnant they acted so excited but haven’t ever asked to see her. Again only if I drive to them with her at a time that suits them and even then I have to force them downstairs to actually spend time with us.

 I thought it would be a friendship that would last until I was very old, but it didn't. Now, I'm alone and without friends, I don't have a job and I only count the days until they die.  

I don't know what to do, I wish I didn't have to feel like this, I already failed twice to kill myself and I'm afraid that if I try again, I'll fail again. 

I am afraid to go out on the street, there are people who have been bothering me and verbally abusing me.  At this point, the only thing I think is, that I have failed as a human being and that I will be alone for the rest of my life.

I would give anything to meet someone I can call my friend, someone with whom I can share my time, grow together and remember the good times.  

I don't know what to do to make this happen. I go to therapy, and although it has helped me a lot, many times I feel that the only thing they tell me is ""you have to feel good"".

1641,helloreporter,1647932702,1,"My therapist and I have been working on a ton of things over the years, and one of them is making friends.  When I escaped a fundamentalist Mormon cult 6 years ago, I lost everything instantly. My marriage, my family, and all of my friends were tied to this cult, so when I left, I lost them all.   

Fast forward to now, I've rebuilt my life in a new state, have a high paying and low stress remote job, learned how to do things ""normally"", started drinking a few months ago, etc...and my mental health has improved significantly. I'm 27, so I still have a long life ahead. 

However, I have no friends. No family. No coworkers. No community. Nothing.   I was able to go on a few dates in 2020, and even had a girlfriend for almost a year; she cheated. 

I've been trying my hardest to get out of my house and make friends.  I spend about 3-4 hours every morning doing working at a coffee shop.  I try to do small chats with people around me, and generally I see people who are regulars.  I will approach them sometimes to talk, but it's never been the other way around.  

I walk around Target, and a local Bookstore during my lunch break to just be around people. 

I spend about 1-2 hours most weeknights at my local dog park. Same story as above, nothing moves beyond dog chat. On weekend nights I visit a bar near me.  With both of these places, I will usually get into pretty good convo for at least 20-30 min. Again, I'm the one reaching out first. Just last week, I connected with someone at the bar; great friend potential. I messaged him the following morning on Instagram something like ""Hey man, thanks for chatting with me last night. I really appreciated having drinks with you; hope to see you again."" What happens? Blocked me. 

I tried dating again this month.  It's been tricky to date lately, as I was raped on my last date back in November. But I'm trying. About 15 matches, only two responded to my message. The first one says, ""You are cute, but you need to go to the gym.""  The other: we talked for about a week and a half, planned a date, things were exciting. I arrive at the restaurant, and she ghosted.  Unresponsive to phone calls/text. Blocked on social media. 

I cry myself to sleep each night because I feel unloved, unwanted, and very, very lonely.  

I was raised in an environment where everyone I would ever want to interact with was in my community. Now that I've left, there is a lot of sadness in that I don't have an example of how the make sincere friends, let alone what a ""normal"" relationship or friendship is like.

1644,throwaway_user321,1647929203,1,"This is going to sound really strange, and you might think I need serious therapy after reading this, but I want to get this off my chest. 

Okay so a few months ago I started watching this guy on tiktok who does ‘comfort character’ skits. It gave me the idea.. I created an imaginary person (a guy around my age to be exact) in my mind so I can talk to him. He replies with what I would want a friend to say to me. So I’d tell him something, and then I think of what I’d want someone to respond with, and that response is what he says to me. 

He shows up whenever I think about him, and will help me get out of bed do work go to bed etc. I usually complain about my day to him, vent or talk about guys I like in school. The things he says most often is “how’s it going” “It’s okay” and “you’re doing great”. Sometimes “i love you” (there’s no actual love involved, I just like hearing that being said to me). I daydream a lot, so he ends up being in whatever scenarios I’m daydreaming about. It’s basically just me giving myself advice except my inner voice becomes a guy’s voice. And we have conversations. I can also partly visualize him. He is tall and has dark hair but no specific face because that’d be creepy. 

I’ve actually imagined this ‘person’ being close to me giving me hugs. It’s like having a close friend/bf who literally knows everything about you and will only support you. He doesn’t have much of a personality, but he is there regularly and a lot of the time whenever I’m alone. I enjoy having him to talk to.. I’m concerned this might be a problem so I’ll discuss it with my therapist. Maybe it’s normal for a kid but I’m an adult. But I’m going to keep him around until I go to therapy… I discussed it with him (lol) and honestly I’ve gotten a lot better at positive self talk and tackling problems. It also helps me feel better quicker. I’m very socially awkward and have social anxiety so it might be worsening that.

I graduated in 2020, and this past saturday there was a reunion of my whole class (in total 104 people) so we could pick up our yearbook. The entire time I was there I just wanted to go home and I couldn't bring myself to say hi to anyone other than my friends, who were easily greeting the others.

The point is later I got home and sat down to read the yearbook, and noticed how in most people's descriptions (if not all of them) it said stuff along the lines of ""they lit up the room"" or ""they were never afraid to express their opinion"" or ""they coud easily connect with anyone"", and I had to immediately close the yearbook because I just couldn't stop crying. In my entire 19 years of life socialization has never come naturally to me. I have always felt like a burden towards others, like I was weird, like I was boring. When others talked to me my mind would just go blank from the anxiety and it would make the conversation awkward. And it just hurts me so much because absolutely nothing has changed. I have been going to therapy for over a year now and I still have the same fucking issues I used to have as a kid. 

It breaks my heart that socialization will never come as naturally to me as it came to all of my peers. And what hurts me even more is that even my shyest of friends were able to befriend new people during senior year, and I couldn't bring myself to go out with them because I just have such low self-esteem and was afraid that nobody would want me around.

Even with my closest friends I have never been truly vulnerable, and I always feel like they think I'm boring and annoying.

Then at home I waste time crying for the 1000th time about how I don't have a decent social life. It's a miserable thing, and then I feel guilty because I actually genuinely have an easy life. It's bull.

Then I don't get anything done. No homework. No literature books I had to read (i have to return it today lol). Only thing I get done is stuff in genshin impact. After that I just browse the internet, though I am genuinely trying to break my youtube ""addiction"" (I use it too much).

So, there are days where I am rather productive, but then the overwhelming loneliness just legitimately cripples me man. Honestly, I am thinking it's an excuse to procrastinate.

It’s just grating, also people who are too nice to call them out in fear of getting called mean. So I’m gonna be the “big bad” and tell it how it is.

If you’re the lucky few that know why you’re losing relationships then don’t act on those qualities that push people away. You probably heard it’s okay to be yourself so do exactly just that without no restraint. Separate you real self you don’t show to the real you that’s acceptable to show. You’re clingy? Give people fucking space and go do something with your life, have some kind of personality outside of demanding attention. 

You’re ugly? Oh well, sorry you lost the genetic lottery, go to the mall, salon/barber (or online if you’re shitty at social interactions and ask people for suggestions and recommendations on what can help the features you don’t have. Develop a style to work with what you have. Also for christ sakes don’t compensate your looks by being the funny person in the room, people are only going to think you’re a clown desperate for approval. A funny joke is more charming coming from a more attractive person. We live in a superficial and shallow society. Even if you manage to look decent, there will be a better person than you visually. So what do you do? Aim for people at your level, if you’re a 5/10 go for 5/10 people or even lower if you’re not sure. Be humorous with people once you’re close to them.

Have you ever wondered why in the group of friends you're the one nobody likes but keeps around? They keep you around because you're a walking woobie. You're miserable and you don't hide it at all. Hell, you probably told people that you're all they have. They pity you so being friends with the loser makes them look better. They do this because they know you have no one else and knowing how some people have problems with sharing they use that as leverage. Grow a spine and look like you have authority over yourself. People will respect those who show that they carry themselves. People want others to look like leaders in themselves in a group.  

If you don't want to improve your life and give up. That's fine, but you're wasting your time regurgitating the same problems what do you expect people to do to sympathize with you?

I tend to procrastinate a lot about doing tasks on my free time and end up doing it at the last second.

My friends are all happily in a relationship or married so I don’t want to drag my single nonsense into their lives lol Recently I decided to make a separate Reddit account to maybe start talking to others and that isn’t even working.

1693,anomolygirl,1647910921,1,"So I am currently a junior in college. I have struggled to make lasting friendships ever since coming back from quarantine. We were sent home for covid after a couple weeks in the second semester of freshman year. This post isn’t about covid but I do want to mention that I feel like it could be a huge factor. 

Some background on me! 
If you were to ask anyone who knows me from my hometown or high school, they would say I am OVERLY social. I grew up being friends with everyone and anyone. My parents always told me “I could talk to a brick wall”. I have never not once had an issue making friends before college. In highschool, I had many friends as well as a group of closer best friends (who are still my best friends). 
I have traveled alone across the country for summer camps and always instantly created a great group of friends. 
I went to highschool in the nearby city without any of my hometown friends and built a new base of lasting relationships. 
My family never saw me being lonely as a potential issue when sending me off to college and neither did I! I never even thought it would be possible to be lonely at university with thousands of people to meet and connect with. But here I am writing this. 

(For context: I have a group of 5 amazing, lifelong friends. We go to different universities OTHER than one of my friends who is actually my roommate and the only person here who I feel completely at home with.) 


I am extremely extroverted and this loneliness has consumed me. I have an amazing family and a secure friend group from my hometown. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing I have a really special friend group that will never break. They also come and visit at least once a semester which is when I forget about all that pesky loneliness. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel stuck and scared for the future. Is this the new me? Timid and antisocial? lonely and hopeless? I sure hope not!! is this normal? I am thankful for what I have but just can’t seem to do the whole college friends thing right.

I'm doing pretty well in comparison to who I was which was depressed and kinda kooky myself. Now I'm getting back in school, working sporadically, traveling some and doing well.

From prior experiences like moving to a new school couple of years ago, graduating high school, etc, I have noticed that actively seeking a friendship does not go well. However, my real friendships before moving away were natural. Others would approach me(I would never make first approach as I didn't feel lonely) at times but those people would not go on to be my friends. Meeting someone via a hobby like video games or playing outside afterschool seemed to be the way to make friends as a kid. This could be friendship by circumstance like living close to one another and going to same school. But the friendships never seemed forced.

However, as an adult people have their own friend circles and don't really talk to each other if they are strangers. I haven't approached anyone to look for a friend in over 3 years to avoid an awkward situation.",lonely,Natural friendship,2022-03-22 11:22:47

Won’t willingly take gifts from other people. I know, I’m slow sometimes, but it shouldn’t have taken me this long to figure that out. 

What gets me is how quick I am to help someone in distress. If someone is depressed or going through a tough time, I will stick it out with that person for as long as they want me to. But I can’t accept the help myself. And today I realized how deep my emotional issues are. I have all these friends and people surrounding me, but not a soul knows about how I feel. 

I’m starting to see the consequences of always giving and not receiving. But it doesn’t help that when the help is offered I push it away.

1702,amyy124,1647907826,1,"I was never one to get close to people, because solitude was always something I admired. But I never stopped to think that saying that I was fine that way was just an escape from the cruel reality of admitting that I needed someone and not having that someone. 

But during these last 2 years I have gotten into the habit of pushing people further away (including my family). I have been sinking into my deepest uncertainties, facing the dark unseen, knowing labyrinths that I never imagined I would come across. I met loneliness and got lost in it. Every day is exactly the same, a monotony that has been unbearable to bear. The things that I used to do for pleasure now I feel like I'm doing for obligation, and without realizing it I end up wasting my time 
wasting my time with futile things to escape the reality in which I find myself. 

Life is passing before my eyes and I'm standing still, just watching things get behind me. Try to imagine what it is like to be 16 years old and have absolutely no friends. No one to send at least a ""hello"" on WhatsApp. The worst thing is that it is not easy to change this, because as I said, I have always been away from people, so I don't have any social skills.

I had everything planned out and had been preparing for days to make one of those meme ""autism won"" cakes and celebrate with my friends... who of course aren't there again. I'm just not a priority to them. 

I don't think they're bad people but they make it clear that I'm only the sort of surface level ""fun"" friend - they're happy to play games and hang out (when it's convenient) but never people to actually talk to. Sometimes I'll bring up personal stuff in a conversation, not even anything heavy or sad but just a little more personal than usual and they will just slide over it.

1710,NotReallyAlone,1647904599,1,"Recently I decided to quit drinking and get back in to a healthier lifestyle, and for me that mostly means eating well and lifting weights. Before this, I was drinking heavily, and I would always tell myself I did it simply because I enjoyed it, nothing more. But now, without it, the feelings come flooding back, particularly loneliness and discontent, and not just the romantic kind, more the emotionally disconnected and isolated kind. I had been using alcohol to numb myself, and it worked amazingly well. I didn't need to feel the pain as strongly, and I could disappear off in to my own world of my interests, sipping on whatever alcohol I wanted for that numbness and for kicks. The painful feelings disappeared (this is not an advert for alohol, please don't take it as such).

I guess I'm writing this as both a warning for those which use alcohol to numb feelings, and to ask how I can cope with these new and very strong, raw emotions. I've cried for the first time in a long time, but I will not use alcohol to cope anymore, it's no good, but without it I feel the full force of my longing for companionship and emotional connection. I'm seeing a friend tomorrow, I hope, for the first time in a while. Perhaps I'll ask if I can hug him, and if we can just talk. What I need is people I connect with, and alcohol is a false friend.

I dont enjoy saying it and never had, as nowadays so many people say this to sound ""quirky"" but I've been going through a terrible depression for three and a half years now and at this point I'm at the worst it has ever been. I've always had a very rough childhood due to being overweight, bullying and abuse from my some family members and having no friends; however when I got to my teens I turned my life around. I became a very fit, confident, outgoing, sociable and open guy. Never did I struggle to make friends or talking to girls again and I couldnt had been happier — finally my life wasnt miserable anymore. Fast foward three years later and... I'm at my lowest point in my life.  


I left my studies due to some personal stuff, so I have no highschool diploma for a start. I've been miserably living in my room for nearly four years now, barely going outside as I dont study nor work. I dont have anyone to talk to now; my family finds me dead weight and cant stand me sometimes; I have no remaining friends (as I had to move back to my parents home); no girlfriend, hell, no physical contact with anyone in years.   


I hate it, I cant stand it anymore. I feel so miserable. I have zero energy to do anything, I just spend most of my day at my PC or sleeping. I see no light on my future, I really would love to have a partner or someone who loves me and can just distract me so I'm not left alone with my thoughts... but at the same time I dont even think I have the mental energy to commit to a relationship, as much as I desire to feel loved again.  Some days I just break down crying due to events that happened in the past and how bad and lonely I feel. I dread going outside my house, I've become so insecure and developed such dumb fear to people that I cant feel comfortable engaging in a coversation with someone aside of a \`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`´´´  hello´, as I get extremely akward, insecure and scared.   


Its insane I once was so confident and outgoing, now I just feel like an empty shell of my former past and a disappointment to him. I really wish I could go back in time to when I was happy. I know my venting may sound dumb but I dont know what to say or do, I've never spoken about this to anyone ever and now I'm desperately writing a post on reddit looking for just a bit of reassurance from someone.  


I've given up in life. I've tried so hard to push through and tell myself that ""it's going to get better,"" but I've been saying that to myself for years now, and it only seems to get worse. No matter what I try—if its getting back to studying, working, going out— It never works. I dont want anything anymore, I dont want to work so hard all again to be truly happy for a couple of years only to fall back again into depression and loneliness.   


The only thing that keeps me going is that I want to become a writer and I'd love to someday publish a story I've been working for years, but if it wasnt for that, I dont think I'd be here anymore.

i met a girl thru OF who lives in a different country and paid for a GFE.. it was pretty nice for a while, she was just very available and willing to talk at all hours and send cute voice memos and stuff.. this continued for a while and now she met a guy irl and i’ve basically been backburnered. she insists nothings changed between us but the cynical part of me thinks she just wants to continue to get my money. i’ve had this happen irl but online feels even more pathetic. i know it was an entirely transactional relationship and that i just deluded myself that actually thought of me as a friend.

i’ve gotten so used to having her be emotionally available to me and now it feels like i lost a friend that i never really had and paid for.

There is a concept in programming called rubber-ducking. If you have a problem in your code, you can't find the answer, it's easier to debug if you explain it to someone or something so you explain it a rubber duck sitting on your desk as if it was your colleague or Siri, or Alexa, or Cortana. But unlike the voice assistants, the rubber duck won't get your out of focus by doing a search to the internet with your inquiry.

A therapist is a person you pay to hear your problems because no one else will (for free). I don't think I can afford it at the moment and a therapist is still an autonomous entity, unlike the voice assistant, the therapist will look for your inquiry in their own internal database of knowledge, this might or might not interfere with the process of debugging, since every body has its own particular set of circumstances and its not all a one-size-fits-all.

I went to do some shopping yesterday, got my hair cut. I wanted to go to a manga and comics store nearby but it had bad reviews on Google so I didn't.

Look how beautiful it is outside today but I have no where to go and nothing waiting out there for me.

I thought about ingesting some kratom but I have sleep problems when I do and have work tomorrow. I'm still not ready to ingest syrian rue and acacia bark powder and don't know when I will be, but tomorrow is work day so I can't.

The nagging feeling of time wasted that refuses to go away. Get used to the impotence of just writing words to the digital void that never answers the way you want. From 2004 up to now, people repeat the same words they read in media, thus no matter who or how you ask you know word for word the answer you are going to get. People === Google.

There are some people who are just algorithms now.

i think my lack of confidence contributes. in my day to day life i am a confident person, but i truly don’t believe i’m the type of person somebody could fall in love with. i cannot imagine someone being exhilarated to see me in the way i am with someone i have feelings for. i get along weirdly well with boys; i’ve always had close male friends who confide in me, but that’s all. i don’t consider myself totally unattractive, but i think i’m plain. i worry i’m just a bit of an unloveable person - i think i don’t have anything special about me.

1771,samirhadi,1647876426,1,"Many of you struggle with getting out of bed and I am gonna share with you some tips to get out of bed more easily.

Tip #1 is an alarm clock app that either requires you to scan a code for the alarm clock to turn off or you need to complete a small task to shut it off like math equations or burpees or something. These apss can be great but weren't enough for me to get up. Should be finde for most people though.

The second tip is to drink a lot of water when you are going to sleep (1 liter or so) then you'll wake up in the middle of the night because you have to go to the toilet. Then after going to the bathroom, drink water again so you have to get up in a couple of hours again. When  you are already standing upright, you'll have more willpower to not get into bed again.

If you wanna learn more about tips like these, here is a youtube video about this topic that I made recently: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvlWFu9q8xo&amp;ab\_channel=Samyto%E2%8E%AESelf-Helpin3Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvlWFu9q8xo&amp;ab_channel=Samyto%E2%8E%AESelf-Helpin3Minutes)",lonely,How to get out of bed easily,2022-03-22 02:27:06

I dont just want a relationship, I want to feel like the most important person to someone else just once, and obviously for a single mother, that position is taken by the child. So what, I lower my standards and remain in a relationship I care nothing about for the sake of having any relationship at all?

Her theory was: Because I have awkward body language, resting b!tch face, and social anxiety, chatting online allowed me to bond with people easier because they didn't automatically assume I was stuck up or uninterested. (Church lady also insisted I had undiagnosed autism. But no, I was tested for it. I'm just anxious and shy.)

But then I met a few of these internet friends in real life. Flew across the world to spend a couple weeks with them, two separate times. And everyone I met liked me. Friends of friends and their whole families. Chatting with new people wasn't hard anymore. 

But why? I'm the same person, anxious and awkward, no matter what country I'm in. I think I was even _more_ shy overseas because I didn't want to attract attention to myself and be the stereotypical Loud American Tourist.

1788,GeneralMudkip101,1647868347,1,"I'm not sure if it's just me or not. But being alone and single gives me the freedom to do what I want, not having a partner who wants constant attention and wanting to pull me away from the things I enjoy and telling me those things are bad for me and I should focus on them more.
I understand a relationship goes both ways, but sometimes I enjoy my ""me"" time, doing the things that make me happy. Same things goes for them, if they are doing something they enjoy I won't pull them out of it just so they can do what I want.
Most of the time I'd be enjoying my time spent with them, and others I'd rather sit alone doing my own thing.

On the other hand, I miss having that type of connection with someone, enjoying the time together and making memories that will last a life time. Sometimes even joining in on each other's hobbies and likes and having fun. I also having that someone to talk to about anything and they listen to me and vice versa.
It's also the physical connection I miss. Wrapping my arms around someone at night. The hand holding and cuddling during a movie. Even those more intimate moments and passionate nights. 

I want that someone who will just love me for me, and accept that I'm weird and odd. Someone who is ok with all my faults and is willing to help me fix them instead of seeing the things that I enjoy as the problem.

But I'm scared. Not wanting to mess up my next relationship if I ever have one again. Getting to the point where I'll like someone but begin to over think everything, seeing nothing but flaws in the imaginary relationship because of me. Maybe I'm not supposed to be in a relationship, but just sitting on the side lines alone. And it scares me that I'm ok with that, ok with being alone. Ether way i'd be happy with the outcome. 

Together forever, or forever alone.

I don’t take them seriously tho cause, they’re my sisters, fuck them. But lately I don’t have the strongest mindset due to college stress so It’s getting under my skin. 

I hang with with my cousins and they always say how ugly I am. Like I’d take a photo with my cousin and she’d  delete it and say, “ yeah sorry I gotta look good for snap” and proceed to just take photos of herself or with other ppl. 

I bet I’m not in anyones camera rolls like that. Nobody has a single good photo of me or a photo with me. I used to have a bunch of them in my camera roll but I deleted them and stopped saving memories. 


My friends(if you can even call them that), have completely forgotten about me. They always talk about how I’ve never been anywhere fun and they’d take me, but for spring break, one of my best friends just told me they’d planned to go in 2 days and it was “last minute”. She always states how last minute her plans are.  It’s just an excuse to say we didn’t invite you cause nobody wanted u to come. 

I don’t understand. I’m not a terrible person. I’m not a super shy person either. I’m not rude or childish, I can be a bit annoying but so can everyone else. I’m loving and caring and I’m always there for ppl.  Maybe in the past I wasn’t so interactive but I was going thru dark times and she knows that. Now that I’ve bettered my mindset.

For starters, I'm a 24 year old male that has never had sex, and I've only ever been in 2 ACTUAL relationships in my life. And here's the thing, I get why I haven't had more partners like I am overweight  and I get nervous talking to women. Plus the slew of disabilities I have don't help. All I do is sit online and get jealous of people in happy relationships. Tbh I feel like if I was more confident I'd have better chances with women, because sure I'm overweight but I don't think I'm bad looking because it's not out of control, it's just hard because I feel like if I say the wrong thing everything will fall apart. It doesn't help I'm also terrified of actually getting down to doing the deed for similar reasons.

I've put in an incredible amount of effort to trying to not need a partner but all I do is long for someone to hold me, someone to talk to, just someone, anyone to love me. And it doesn't help that even though I have 2 very close friends that I consider my brothers, they can't help me because I lied to them and they think I'm better with women than I am, only so theyd listen to my relationship advice. Wow, that's the first time I've ever actually admitted any of that. I guess I should end this with a question so its not just me dropping my sob story.

I am 25 years old, working with my brother. Our company is doing relatively “ok” though there are many sharp thorns to tread through along the way. While I enjoy my career and the work along the way. I can’t help but feel worthless despite being in the industry for four years. My brother is 12 years my senior and he is the reason I am where I am today. With a university degree and a roof over my head. 

He has his worries and I wish to support but my performance hasn’t been amazing. While I get it that the years in 2018 to current has been riddled with pandemic and economy issues, but I don’t see much worth. 

And back to topic, I don’t have much friends, actually scratch that. I don’t have any. I’m surrounded. Constantly. But it’s the empty feeling in the heart that I can’t help with. I have a loving family and all. I get it I may sound entitled, but nonetheless, empty and miserable. Both personal and my career. 

I don’t know. I can’t speak to anyone. I have to maintain my image with the public as the representation of myself also affects the company. Yes I could talk to my brother, but sometimes you know, outside perspective can be refreshing. 

I don’t have much money, I don’t have friends, nor a girlfriend if you are gonna ask. I just feel so alone. Worthless. Not up to par with my brother who has accomplished much. But relies on me today. And I haven’t been able to do much.",lonely,Worst Feeling,2022-03-21 19:13:44

1836,DocRock3m,1647838984,1," I'm posting this here with the hope of bringing realization to others.  We're all lonely in certain aspects of society.  To be alone is painful, to be severed is agony.  

   I have squandered inherent gifts that people would kill for, without hesitation I reveled in foolishness, headstrong into dead ends, blind &amp; fearless.  
I have been so foolish, so absent from the world until last Nov. My perception shifted, I had an epiphany, then slowly awakened to 36 years  trail of my ""existence"".   I endured six months of anxiety, rage and frustration.  Beginning to accept the reality of my meandering youth, this enabled me to start figuring out where I went wrong and how I can improve.  Optimism aside there is only so much that can be done in 40 years.  Every direction seems unfavorable.   

Sobered by the thoughtlessness, self destructive catharsis driven hubris, I now recognize as a subconscious death-wish.  
No one could stop me if they tried, and they did. I was incorrigibly bold, emotionally reckless. I ran away from every single person who just wanted to love me. It never upset me, I never saw myself as anything. So I never attached to anyone. I had never noticed how distant I was, but last Nov I woke up and recognized I was completely alone. Not just isolated, I was entirely absent. I had no social media, no calls, no contacts, no co-workers, no family, friends, pets, community, no society. Severed from the minds of others. I tried reaching out, re-engaging with colloquial familiarity. I was met with polite dismissal, like a dishonorable burden that shouldn't be trusted. I'm like a ghost amongst a group of old friends. They are made uncomfortable by me. I've made myself unrecognizable to the only people who knew me.  


So here I sit, alone. Cold, hungry, tired and humbled, but not upset. I'm more focused now, more tempered, more patient. I'm the opposite of what I used to be. I have trouble remembering what I was like. That's how I know that I've grown.  
Forgive your past for it languishes as I scribe my will into this ethereal glow. Ghastly &amp; luminous, safe for nurturing wounds, or showing vulnerability. I've spent enough time here, it could almost feel homely.  
I see how alienated I've become, I'm drawn to lay down in my own handcrafted casket. Ironically, this is why I'm compelled to fight hard and rebuild.  
I never do what I'm told &amp; reject what is expected of me.

I used to be a very outgoing, bubbly, vibrant person but ever since this creature got attached to me everything changed.

At first I kept trying to thrive, ignoring it was out of the question so I acknowledged it and tried to live with it. Slowly the things that brought me joy became dull to me. Motivations diminished and my friends started disappearing. 

So I decided I could take this creature head on. I fought and fought but it always overpowered me. Left my body scarred and damaged.

1842,Sea-Of-Honey,1647837176,1,"I read a book recently called ""No Longer Human"" By Osamu Dazai. It's the first book I have read all the way through for fun in years. (Warning if you choose to read it, it has some triggering topics including suicide, depression, addiction to both alcohol and morphine, and rape just to name a few)

It helped me put my anxiety in perspective. I realized early on in the book that I really related to Yozo's clowning and social anxiety during his youth and childhood years. I have a lot of trouble with what I want to do in my life too so his struggle in college and his father's expectations really had me interested. I was in that same stage of my life.

Then I kept reading. It made me realize how close I was, how easy it is to lose myself to my anxiety. How my mask couldn't last, that I could turn into an addict so easily. Desperate for the good attention of others, desperate to have myself heard, all while waiting for the other shoe to drop and for the world to crash down in on me.

Yozo's interests and mine were basically the same. We both wanted to understand, to love, be loved, and to truly express the seemingly endless thoughts we had. The difference is, from his struggles I want to learn. I know what I have to do to get over the feeling of needing a mask. I am stronger and more prepared for my anxiety. I will be.

The reason I'm posting this here and not one of the book subs is that I see a lot of people in here from all different age groups with anxiety over the people in their lives. People with all kinds of struggles, backgrounds, races, and looks that, like myself, have trouble believing they are worthy in their space. They may feel too clingy and annoying, intimidating, ugly, or just that they just don't belong. This book really helped me, so give it a try. It may help you.

Also if you read it and like it, I'd love to talk about it with you (Or just anyone in general). Maybe we can make our own little book club :p",lonely,I read a book,2022-03-21 15:32:56

And even before I lost them I was still insecure, but now I'm even more so, and every day I just see them and people in general just having friends and talking to people and meanwhile my fat ass is sitting there dying inside because I just feel alone and like there's nothing to live for and that the first 3 attempts on my life made by me should have succeeded and that I don't benefit society and all the self depricative phrases you could possibly imagine. The friends help a lot, like just one interaction can make the day go by faster, it makes classes so much easier and everything becomes easier to just ignore, but on the days I don't interact with them, I feel dead inside, the days just drag on like trying to sand a finger down to the bone manually, and previously was one of the (very) many I have so many random scars on my left arm and by proxy also one of the reasons I wear long-sleeved shirts and sweaters in every condition of weather. But I haven't done anything to myself physically harmful like that since then so I'm hoping that's at least getting better. But anyways, like I said I am incredibly clingy and also very insecure about it because I don't want to be a burden to people and all that. I tried to think of the cause of the whole situation and the only thing I can think of is the 3 years after my dad died were just nothingness and only about 4 years ago did it happen do its still a bit painful but that whole period of nothingness where I basically unlearned anything I'd ever learned about social life, and having a healthy relationship, meanwhile having my mom verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusing me from the side didn't help either and only recently was I pulled out from it and then promptly thrown back into the void of nothing, I'm referring to the friends I previously had and felt like my life was complete with them, and then promptly lost them.

But I keep having my own image in the back of my head, taunting me, showing me every little thing wrong with my appearance, me being overweight, not showering enough, my smell, my hands being all fat n shit, feeling like I have sausages for fingers, what i think people think about how I look, etc etc. And I just kinda sit there and nod like "" yes this is a good point I am a fat piece of shit"" and in real life I'm just sitting there and just hhheeeh-ing in the most strainful way possible.

I have to do things I'm not proud of to make sure I can eat and pay rent. I'm putting myself through university but I struggle to even get out of bed. My future is so uncertain and I'll struggle my way through the next few years. No one knows these things about me. I think it'd just make them unhappy, but I just want to get it off my chest.

These aren't the happiest years of my life and I've not even hit the worst part yet. I don't want to get older.

When I came to school the next day, I realized that she told our mutual friends about everything we talked that day. I didn't like this situation and I put some distance between me and her. I think she must have told our mutual friends other things about me that my communication with them was suddenly cut off. I moved to an apartment alone this year because of my psychological conditions that required me to take a break from school. I was getting on well with my next door neighbor until my lovely neighbor moved. Since my assignments are crazy, I am often busy to go out. but some days when I want to go out, want to share something with someone, I realize how lonely I am. At the beginning of this year, I tried very hard to socialize. I did whatever I could. Unfortunately, I didn't want to continue some of the friendships because some people's behavior towards me was just for benefit. It's starting to get on my nerves now that I'm the first person to approach people. I started to think that I am so ugly that people want to avoid me. I have enough friends in my own country. I even have relationship that's been going on around two years (of course, my studies abroad put some distance between me and my partner, we are doing well enough). I am very lonely in where I am right now. My loneliness used to make me happy, when someone looked at me, it would seem like a compliment, but now the way people look at me makes me nervous. In this country, I met someone from my mother country. It made my outings less lonely. but hanging out with him caused my ex-friends who waved at me to not even make eye contact with me anymore. On top of that, this friend of mine started to constantly criticize something about my appearance. I don't know what happened. I was happy with myself and someone else's thought started to affect me. I feel bad. When I shared this with my family, they showed concern, but they also said it was very normal. I don't have a problem with not being able to talk to people. My only problem is getting tired of trying to talk. I wish there was someone here that would comfort me when I feel bad. I tried to socialize but my efforts make me feel like I am trying so hard that's why people are distancing them from me. I tried to do nothing and left things to be, still nothing happened. I don't want to talk to my friends from my own country and share my troubles. I've tried. but when I tried, they also started talking among themselves about me. It makes me paranoid when people talk about me all the time behind my back. however, I will always be talked about. I wish they would say something to my face instead of talking behind my back. I'm even fine with arguments, I am just so sick of people talking behind my back as if I did something wrong. I opened this account because I needed a place to share my thoughts. I just need someone to listen to me on this, I guess. Idk. After I emptied my head on here, this writing started to make no sense to me.",lonely,a lonely college person's vent,2022-03-21 10:45:10

I personally find going for walks around the neighborhood pretty good too, give people a bit of a wave and a ""hello"". I'm finding skipping really decent as well just for clearing the head with some cardio.

Have been getting a bit into gardening too and just trying to get more sunlight. 

It sounds really lame but I find gratitude journaling in the morning pretty good too. I have a lot going wrong in my life (loss of friendships and health issues) but I'm holding onto that potential of good things coming my way. 

Just thought I'd post to say you're not alone, keep on fighting and I genuinely hope you're able to squeeze a bit more good out of your days in whichever thing you find helps :) 

I find having some ""next steps"" goals to be good too - mine are currently to try and step out of my comfort zone and join a few local clubs of some kind.

1909,alvida-tanhai,1647812951,1,"For some time I have been looking at the posts of this subreddit. And after having build some courage I want to tell my story, which I have never told to anyone.

I never had any friends in my life, in school I was always alone, I never had any memorable moment of school. I have always been nice to everybody, not for sake of getting anything in return, but doing good for the sake of goodness.

Some peers I talked in school always came to me when their friends left them or they had a break-up or some other emotional problems. I always helped them, but in the end they all leave when their problem is solved by me, when I help them in solving their problems by listening to their problems, giving advice and so on. 

They never tried to start a conversation with me, it was always me who would check up on them, asking them how are you doing and so on. 

I always wished them on their birthday but they never wished me or even care to ask me when is my birthday. Even when in school they acted like I did not exist, never said hello to me, but would immediately come when they needed help.

They would always say that I'm a great person, a person who understands, a person who cares(I'm not boasting about myself). But would never even care to ask me how I'm doing.

I always wondered if they meant what they said, why treat me like a nobody or a ghost or a forgotten one or somebody who is left out.

Because of such experience I have given up on the whole concept of friendship. 

I will always try my best to help people who are going through difficult times because no matter what pains I go through, it is the kindness and sacrifice of unknown people who have made the world a better place.

Have you gone through the same experience like mine ?

Why is finding an online friend so hard? Ya I guess if I had an F after my age it may help.

Also much prefer talking to women.. I'm married, I am looking to keep things in the friendship zone.

I'm 38 so would prefer 30 plus.. but like I said this is just for friendship so 20s is fine

There surely are others that have some need to have an online friend.. someone who you can just send messages to whenever without the worry of meeting up and conflicting schedules

I had found a friend like this however was ghosted... Please know that if our conversations go beyond introduction I will not be the one who walks away.. sure not everyone clicks but I won't leave you feeling hurt.

As much as I desire a companionship or friendship more than anything else on this planet , more than all the money in the world, I also recognize that people have this amazing power to fucking destroy you, because they only see and manipulate you in the form they choose, no matter how far they are off to your true nature and who you really are. And frankly I'm over it. People aren't people anymore. We are robots who judge each other , put each other down, step on all the other heads of others we don't care about , as long as I keep my head the to sky,I cannot see who I am crushing below me. Tying happiness together with the friendly company of others to acknowledge your existence , to feel alive , loved , and that you are a living a normal life like everyone else is a recipe for disaster. I am alone, and maybe it's better that way. Because other people love to draw you in, you give them your utmost effort to add substance to your life by doing the same for theirs , then they deploy the fact they are a fake fucking snake who already predetermined you are a disposable fucking nothing to them like the others they deflated of life and discarded. 

 I struggle between having hope, being ""okay with myself"" , coping with life, not living it , hating myself, hating my life , wondering why I am not good enough , then fakely accepting that I'm cool with everything.

1929,Arkaydian,1647807033,1,"My next therapy appointment is a few ways ahead and I’m being crushed by the weight of my distressing thoughts so here I am to vent.

As a child, I often exhibited signs of having “imaginary friends.” Long story short; the beings I talk to that have no physical bodies are actually the spirits of the other side.

Sadly, as years went by, I have never had any genuine physical friends or any real connections to physical family members. This is unfortunately due to just not having the right people fall in line as by my fate up until now.

The people on the other side were (and still are) much more accessible than physical people. When I was casted into the mental health care system as a teenager, I couldn’t talk about a lot of my trauma because physical people (my family) stressed me out way more than spirits (the voices in my head) did.

My father was abusive, and the rest were indifferent. Amongst other things, any remarks each family member perceived as offensive would warrant an extreme emotional response.

Outside of family, sadly, anyone I meet just doesn’t want a deeper relationship with me. Whether it be me outgoing to them or them coming up to me, it just doesn’t happen.

I don’t even bring up my spiritual prowess. Just who I am hasn’t met the right people yet.

In short, it is unfortunate how this just happens; society collectively leaves people like me alone not on purpose, but by random chance.

Outside of my spiritual capabilities (physical, mental, emotional; excluding spirit), how many of you would say the same about just having bad luck of not finding the right people in your life?

Genuinely care, am curious, funny, smart, compassionate. And yet still have no one to hang out with most of the time. It really hurts...

I know a lot of really lovely people. Lots of great acquaintances and (very) casual friendships. Somehow getting to the point of hanging out regularly (and I don't mean super often like once every 2-3 weeks even, with texting in between) has proven next to impossible.

The few deeper friendships I have are either long distance or crazy busy so I don't get to see them for months at a time.

I desperately need more regular in-person social interaction.

I've tried dating apps too, just to meet people...though I reject the idea that adults can only get deeper connection through a romantic and/or sexual relationship. Even then, I'll match with people and talk...they eventually ghost me every time.

I'm at a loss here. Advice appreciated.

1947,0pinion8d_ZA,1647799158,1," It's been so long since I tried to open up and speak about how lonely I am that I can't even think of more to say. I have ASD, I lack self confidence and I have become used to being pushed down and suppressed my whole life. So much so, that when I read *""****Markdown Mode***"" in bright red letters in the right hand corner of this editing box, my first thought was that it is some form of notice directed at me to indicate that my post would automatically be marked down / lowered / suppressed in the group. 

My second thought was that others, after reading my first thought, would likely skip to the next person's post, thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The worst part of this thought train is that I actually know what markdown means because I used to be a developer. Which makes my first thought seem even more ridiculous.  

My fourth thought is I should probably look and see if there is self-loathing or depression reddit because I probably wouldn't be lonely if I liked myself. Perhaps the difference between solitude and loneliness is whether or not we enjoy the company of the person we are being forced to spend time with when we're alone. And in that case, which came first, the self loathing or the loneliness. Do I hate myself because I don't fit in, or do I not fin in because I hate myself. 

My last thought is that I've overshared.  Which I tend to do. It pains me to see how many members this group has. Ironically loneliness seems to be a shared poverty that we can all afford to end but seldom do. If you are still reading and my thoughts and I haven't already driven you away, thank you.

I pretend everything is OK in front of my family (what's left of it) and coworkers. Nobody knows I'm lonely and therefore occasionally depressed. I'll lie that I went somewhere and did something with someone just so nobody knows I'm alone on my birthday, or that I did nothing during summer vacation.

What I wish for the most is to not have that pathetic feeling when I'm alone somewhere. Remove that, if I could go anywhere, and feel free alone - movies, theatre, events...and not give a damn what it may look to other people, I think I'd be happy. Instead I keep thinking damn I'm here alone, everyone must think I'm really pathetic. That's the saddest part, and I know most probably don't - I certainly do not give a damn when I see someone alone somewhere.

Nothing has changed even though I worked so hard for a change. Everytime id get something going, they’d eventually end up leaving and never speaking to me again, even after I say “Hey hope you’re doing well”. Nothing.

I think I was better off not trying at all. Had a mental breakdown today thinking about all this, and I started thinking. Maybe im just better off alone.

The only time in my life where I felt like it all had meaning, like I had meaning, and that it was all worth it was when I had someone. Those days are long gone and my will to live went with them. Love is what I want. I want someone that wants me as much as I want them. Though as it seems to be with anything that would give me even the tiniest shred of happiness the universe itself goes out of it's way to prevent it from happening. The only ways for life to be tolerable would be to have someone that loves me, or to get some sort of brain injury that disables all emotions so I turn into just a machine.

We would be on FaceTime with each other every single night, we’d hang out multiple times every week just watching TV and movies together, and I just loved being around her. And for some reason, my shortsighted brain decided the moment it started catching feelings, that the best solution would be to cut and run. I didn’t answer one of her calls, and then a couple more, and that slowly turned into two whole years of not talking. Fast forward all the way to today, we’re in contact again but she barely ever answers me and never has time to see me anymore. On top of that I’m pretty sure she’s seeing somebody.

2026,InternationalNat,1647750912,1,"I (22m) am a junior in college and have never had a core friend group like 95% of college students do. I have one close friend, my best friend, who I’ve known since freshman year and this year am living with, and he found his core group about a year ago. He doesn’t want me to be part of it though because he thinks we should have separate social lives since we’re already roommates, and thinks that I’m awkward to be in a group with, and that it’s not his responsibility to manage my social life/that if I’m upset about not having a group that that’s my problem. While it’s not his responsibility to manage my social life, part of me feels him not wanting to be in the same friend group with me is kinda weird because I don’t see why you wouldn’t want to be in the same group with a close friend. Apart from my best friend, I have a bf who I see about once a week as well. I feel really terrible being the only one who has no core, tight-knit friend group in college. Why am I the only one? Pretty much everyone who wants one seems to have one, but nope, not me. Here I am just being alone all the time. And it sucks. I feel like I’m missing out on what is supposed to be the age when you have the most, and closest friends. No matter what I do, I can’t seem to find a close group of friends like everyone else has. I am part of two clubs on campus, gaming and anime club. I go to gaming every week and have been in both of these since freshman year, but haven’t really found much more than some acquaintances in them. I don’t get why people say things like “you shouldn’t be this affected by not having many friends, you should just be happy with yourself” when in reality, there’s a certain level of isolation that is very painful, even if you have a very healthy sense of self, and I think most people who have always had a solid, close friend group to rely on don’t realize this.",lonely,I hate being the only one in college without a friend group,2022-03-20 15:35:12

So My birthday is tomorrow.  Another year older, and as is the case it has me reminiscing and not such a good idea.  One year ago I left a relationship with my child's mom, a ten year relationship.  I was a hard drug user for years, and have been clean from the drugs and drink for three years last december.  She picked up the pipe last year around this time, and was like ""Nope I dont want rehab, I don't want help, I just want to smoke crack and disappear overnight this is fine I can't see why you have a problem with this.""  So I left.

So now with this new lifestyle I do not only not really know how to go about making new friends, but need to be careful, because I will naturally go right tio the fuckups, and that is a legit danger if I allow myself to be bullshitted.  Ad my partner of ten years, well I dont know what the fuck is going on with her.  And usually I am mostly ok with that.  But obviously I still have some feelings in that regard and they are hitting me hard right niow.  I have a six year old daughter I rarely see, like zero friends to actually hang out with.  Ive gotten so lonely...well shit that im here on Reddit ranting about it.  Lol.

I just isolate and play guitar and study music theory.  Sometimes I go hit the streets and play, or go to the parks and play, that will be better as spring comes.

But tomorrows my birthday, the people I really love are far from me phyisically and spiritually, and I'm just hurting right now.  The last thing I want is to spend the night in my room crying but that's what is going on.",lonely,Feeling like it's hitting me pretty hard right now,2022-03-20 15:11:53

I am a 23 year old guy who has always been awkward and insecure. I always looked young for my age (l look 14 now) and that has always made me feel like an outcast and less of a man. 

Past
On top of that when I was younger, I had a series of surgeries on my leg from age 13 to 18 due to an accident I had as a baby that injured my growth plate on my femur. I was in crutches for months at a time and I missed a lot growing up because of it. I never went out with friends or had a romantic relationships with anyone during High School. i didnt got to school events including prom. I even got super skinny because I did not eat at lunch because I was too embarrassed to ask for help with my food tray when I was in crutches. In school, I felt like I was invisible to girls let alone girls I had a crush on. In college, I thought things were going to change. But a lot of it remained the same. I felt like I didn’t belong, I looked like a skinny middle schooler surrounded by adults. I was/am so socially underdeveloped that is a miracle I was able to graduate and get a job. 

Presentish
I never tried asking a girl out because I feel embarrass, I can not see myself asking a woman out looking like a kid myself. Oh and the cherry on top is that ’6”. I am Mexican, so my family is short. I feel disgusting. But i feel guilty complaining about my life because through out all of this I am lucky enough to have a supportive and loving family. My parents are the best parents any kid can ask for. I also have a great first job coming of college which I feel extremely lucky to have considering how tough the pandemic has been to some people. I feel like I should be thankful for all this and accept that not everyone gets everything.

I love these people, I really, truly do. In fact, they mean the world to me. 

I just wish I was somebody’s favorite, whether that’s being a partner or just being someone’s best friend. The friend group I spend time with are all couples and I’m the only perpetually single one. In my two decades of being alive I’ve never been in a relationship and have had no *lifelong* friends, nor any best friends currently. 

These friends I have now have known each other for a long time and care deeply for one another and I can tell. They hype each other up; between every joke or tease, they genuinely compliment each other and tell each other “I love you”. 

I heard this all again, except not once was I “hyped up”. I spent more time observing than I did having conversations, but I was already in my own head at that point.

I just want a friend to hug me and tell me how much they care. I want to hold someone’s hand and comfort them. I want the love and care I have for others to be more reciprocal. 

I don’t blame them. I’m not angry. I’m just seeing that, even as my mental health waxes and wanes; even though I have my good days, I will likely feel even worse down the line if things don’t change or improve. I can’t see myself living best-friendless or partnerless into my 30’s or even 5 years from now.

Since then, and prior to, the majority of weekends were spent in solitude. Unhealthy for the mind, I became increasingly incapable of escaping my solitude. Year after year I felt my brain rotting away due to the deprivation of such basic biological needs - communication, touch, hope. But it never came.

The times it did were simply a passing fog, once lifted, the reality of my life, and my future once again as glaring as ever. Week after week I’d hope to have plans, to escape the coffin of my residence. And week after week, I’d be disappointed. My mind became less human as time progressed and eventually the idea of having a normal life, those experiences became foreign to me, to the extent that they became unfathomable.

I’d pass people on the street, in the store, at work, genuinely confused how they were able to navigate their life to a place of general normalcy. No, their lives certainly were not perfect. But they were not rotting away each weekend, alienated, alone, bereft, and clueless as to how to function normally in society.

And here I am, over three decades into life, alone on a Saturday night because I was unable to grasp the innate intuitions of how to live. Sexless, no touch less, I have spoken 4 words to a human today. Medium iced caramel latte.

I constantly feel like the one left out and the last choice. To give a preface I suffer from severe anxiety and any type of social situation can easily overstimulate and overwhelm me. I am also a freshman in college so the friends I hang out with are fairly new and I have not fully broken out of my shell (as someone who suffers from extreme anxiety, this is something very difficult for me.). Nevertheless, I still feel fairly close to these people and consider them close friends- I just haven't reached the point of full comfort. Okay now onto the way that I am feeling. So the group that I mainly hang out with is five people including me. They also love to party, get drunk, and dance. Another thing is that they are all part of a culture that I am not a part of so I can not relate to the things they relate to (I have no idea if that makes sense lol but I hope that is the right way to say it, I am not the best at writing). They also all speak a Spanish which I can not speak. I can handle these differences sometimes but it is hard to relate and to hang out with a group of people who enjoy the things that you enjoy the least the most. I do enjoy the partying some of the time. Many of the time I find myself leaving to go to a bedroom or to bee alone in there social situations because everyone divides into pairs. I leave and nobody notices. when we are dancing everyone is in pairs no matter what style of dancing it is (it doesn't help that I am a terrible dancer lolol). I usually am planning a way to leave the whole time and get so happy when I can just be alone without worrying about anyone leaving me out. Even in a group where there is inly four people including me, they gravitate into a group of three and speak Spanish. I know they are not talking bad about me or hate me, they just forget I'm there I guess lol. This is also not a situation where I invite myself, I am invited to these situations they just often don't pay much attention to me. I believe I am a part of this friendship group but am constantly asked ""are you coming"" to plans that were never communicated to me and often left out of the loop. its kind of sad because these people are really my only friends and I feel as if when they are in the group I might as well not be there. I feel as if I am invisible and when I talk no one hears. I feel as if I could ghost them and wouldn't hear from them for days. I always tell myself that this is in my head and I am isolating myself but when I am in the situation, it's fairly obvious that I just can not fully relate to these people. I wish I could more thoroughly explain the situation and emotions I am experiencing but I am terrible at communicating through writing and I feel it would turn into word salad if I tried to do that haha.",lonely,Always feeling like the last choice,2022-03-20 12:15:56

People have been nice to me in the past, and I jumped into conclusions and thought they automatically were in love with me just because they were nice to me. Because of my own thinking, this turned into obsessions I have had about women old enough to be my grandmother, and I am a woman, too. I seem to be so bored by life and trouble being motivated by most things, so I've filled my life with these obsessions and amazing women to focus on. I don't want know what void this being in love/obsessions are filling. I tend to process feelings very deeply and I get so emotional over the most little things. 

I also remember things that most people don't. I've brought this up and they would say, ""I don't remember that at all."" I also tend make this intense eye contact when I am talking to them, and not looking away when the conversation is over.",lonely,Why am I a highly sensitive person?,2022-03-20 11:57:48

I’ll admit I do call her nearly every night. But she’s unemployed anyway and doesn’t leave the house much either so it probably has something to do with me. I feel like my family hate being around me a lot of the time. When I’m downstairs I can feel the weird atmosphere like I should just leave them to hang out. And when they try to joke I sometimes take it personally so it’s awkward a lot the time when I talk to my family. 

It’s pretty depressing that even my family are tired of me. They have been for a while tbh. Now I’ll probably spend more time rotting in my room because they’ve made it clear they don’t want me near them anymore. They pretty much came to the conclusion that I’m autistic as well as my teacher and since then they’ve been acting weird around me. I’m not autistic I’m just an introvert but it makes no difference to them. Luckily for me they haven’t actually spoken to a professional about this and it’s just been swept away so they’ve forgotten about it.

And this year I've realized that I've been using it to distract myself from loneliness. I'm an only child, and I've never been a part of any friend group. Most of the time I'm the plus one, or the person they call when there's an extra slot. I've always known that, but never really gave it much thought. I'm  an only child, and very used to being on my own.



This pandemic, I noticed myself getting lonely more often. I'd cry at random times, and stare at the darkness for hours. Sometimes I think, if I die right now, will any one of my 'friends' notice... then I remember, I don't really have any.


I'm always the last choice, the last one called, the forgettable one, the always there when you need her but we don't want her now. Lately I thought that maybe the reason why I stayed in student government for so long (this is my 6th year) is because I've got nothing else to do.

I (21M) work at a supermarket. I’m incredibly shy and quiet, I barely have any friends. I’m haven’t been depressed in the past but these last few months this situation is all I’ve been thinking about and it’s making me very hopeless and beginning to make me depressed. I have terrible social anxiety and anxiety in general, and it makes me a nervous wreck a lot of the time. There’s a woman (32F) who works with me. Her personality is the polar opposite. She’s very outgoing and social, everyone loves her, and she has no problem talking to people. A lot of the staff find her very pretty and I do too. Looks wise at least.

The way she acts towards me is very strange. She’ll mimic my voice in a patronizing way a lot when she hears me talking on the phone. When she walks by me she’ll tap me on the head or shoulder and when I look she’ll pretend she didn’t. And a few weeks ago after a staff meeting some guy was talking about ropes in reference to a project he’s working on and she whispers to me “you have no idea how badly I want to use ropes on you” then she smiled and walked away. After, when she walked by me in an aisle she goes to me “i know you’re thinking about what I said and seeing you uncomfortable makes me so happy” Then she tapped my nose and left. know Creepy as fuck, but that’s not the worst part. This thing that happened last night is what drove me to post.

Me and her close on Thursday nights. From 9-11PM it’s just me and her in the store. I was in the break room sitting in front of the vending machine while I was on my break. Then she came in and came over to the vending machine, and leaned over me to pay for something and her breasts were directly in my face. Then she pretended her money was stuck or something and didn’t move for like 45 seconds it felt like fucking forever. I had no idea what to do and I was just sitting there having an internal panic attack thinking she would never move. Then she just left with a self satisfied look. It was the most uncomfortable thing I’ve ever experienced.

Today I’ve basically just been laying in bed all day terrified of the next time I work with this lady. This situation has taken over my entire life and I don’t know what to do. Every thought I have is about what she might do to me next. 

Early on I thought she was like flirting with me and I was kind of excited because like I said I find her attractive, but this has gone beyond that. She doesn’t do this to anyone else and no one’s around when she does so no one would believe me. I don’t know what to do please any advice helps.",lonely,"This woman at work is harassing me and I have no idea what to do, I feel so hopeless and alone. Any advice helps :(",2022-03-20 10:35:52

She also seems to be hiding things from me on social media about her personal life (like instagram and discord). I really dk whats going on with her but whenever we talk nowadays, its just her making random jokes about me (which are pretty lame ngl) and its just so strange to see her acting like this cus she wasnt like this 2 weeks ago.

Our friendship has lots of ups and downs and something major happened to me back in November which got me super depressed but she apologised to me and we were actually doing really great till 2 weeks ago and noe im just so fucking confused. 

Maybe she found friends who are better than me and thats why she's leaving me out. Or she's secretly talking to our current friends elsewhere without me taking part in.

Its just so shitty to feel like im not trustworthy and interesting enough for her anymore. And i guess its partly my fault cus i suck at socialising with people and i always feel awkward during conversations and then feeling so bad at myself that i have to leave social media for a few days.

2073,Mell0wyellow79,1647732538,1,"Ugh. I’m depressed because I’m lonely but I’m too depressed to see people or make any effort. It’s not like I don’t have people in my life. I do. I have new friends and old ones who I know want to see me but I flake because I’m so depressed and then my depression is amplified by loneliness. It’s a vicious cycle. 

I know this will probably inspire comments about getting help for depression, however I have and I am and it’s just not working. I’ve been seeing counselors, on medications, etc. The issue I feel is that I don’t want to burden people with my presence when I’m depressed. I can’t help the way my brain is- and I don’t want people to deal with me. I get myself in stupid social situations because of lack of judgement stemming from depression and mental issues and then it’s just not worth wading through the social minefield to try to see if this time it will be different. Does this make sense? I feel like I either embarrass myself, get hurt, or exhaust/annoy people. I feel like even my counselor feels stuck with me and doesn’t know what to do with me. I’ve been through so many counselors and it’s so exhausting to find them (figuring out insurance, who is taking new clients, getting on waiting lists, etc.) Its like a full time job to figure out how to get help and I’m just so exhausted. I want to be normal and I want to just be able to be satisfied with life and take ups and downs in stride and be able to be satiated with a social life. Instead I feel like I’m hiding out all the time from some kind of war that I am somehow in charge of solving and also somehow started, and trying not to hurt anyone or myself (purely emotionally speaking- I’m the farthest from a violent person.) I have no problem attracting people- I just know when I meet someone that they will eventually be disappointed with me and it’s painful to live it. I don’t mean to. But my depression isolates me, makes me feel under water, sucks all the light out of me, and I’m left a shell of a person trying to act like a regular person but just tolerating social situations until I can go home and collapse and take the mask off. It’s so frustrating. 

I’m pretty. I’m successful. I’m kind. I’m thoughtful. I’m creative. I’m talented. I’m well connected. But I’m carrying around a million pounds of nothingness and I feel like rubber bands and tethered from my soul to darkness. I just can’t get away from it, and the farther I try to get from it, the more I snap right back. It’s exhausting. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say it to someone. I’ve been on my couch all day and it’s 4:30 and I haven’t showered in days, my teeth are I brushed, my house is a mess, my bird just shit on my food I had delivered because I’m being irresponsible and not making the food from the groceries I also had delivered yesterday, and I’m just generally a mess. But I have turned down 4 social invitations and I’m avoiding people.

No matter how many times I got tired of it I kept chasing after this one person constantly asking to do something together only to be lied to or ghosted. Why? Because these people are smart about it. They will give these small glimpses of a fake friendship when they notice you ignoring them for your own good and then reel you back into this bullshit only for the viscious cycle of disappointment to repeat. 

I gotta give props to this person though. Today the person was blunt about ghosting me and told me what he/she/other was doing meanwhile with a smile and a kinda ""I only now spend time with you an hour and a half later because I have nothing better to do"" vibe. Like I get that, nobody owes me his or her time and admittedly this lesson took me WAY too long to be understand. 

But man, is it so hard to just say you aren't in the mood for doing something together and call it off with a quick ""no"" instead of ghosting and secretely going out with the other members of the gc without me lol? 

I know I'm a clingy, vulnerable and desperate dumbass and I really don't wanna blame my BPD, but man it sucks living like this. I am so glad I at least have 1 true friend who is at this point my second unofficial brother to be honest and I understand how fortunate I am but my fellow people of all genders, races, ethnicities, nationalities and other walks of life: know your value and finally quit the bullshit when the person you are trying to bond with is being disingenuous or clearly not nearly as interested in this as you are you beautiful human being &lt;3 👏

You deserve being liked, desired and loved. But understand that it also takes some work to build a great friendship/relationship and it ain't a seamless fairytale! That's what sets my single success story (my brother from another mother) apart from literally everybody else I tried to be friends with. From now on I will be much more reserved and let friendships or relationships happen as organically as possible and definetely not rushed via common interests (whether that's a club, community or place etc.) instead of just chasing the same damn highschool colleagues that I honestly should have never texted again since 2020.

I grew up in a house without affection, was abused from the age of 6 for 5 years daily. I’ve never heard a parent tell me they loved me.

I started having boyfriends at the age of 13 because I craved affection and attention. I would become obsessed with them, I’d be treated badly and just accept it so I didn’t lose them.

From the age of 19-22 I was in abusive relationship with a guy who hit me, blackmailed me, humiliated me, cheated on me. Eventually he left me for another women, he’s still with her now. I became homeless and had to live in a shelter.

Every single relationship I have, friendship or intimate, I destroy it. I love so deeply. So fucking deeply. I just want to be held. I want to be cared for. I want somebody to ask me how my day was and stroke my hair. Whenever I meet a guy who would do that, I’m repulsed. I have to leave immediately. 

If I’m with a guy who barely cares, sees other girls, puts me down. Then I cling to him and become jealous, obsessive and paranoid.

Or maybe I'm the bad person here for overthinking and expecting too much from someone.

Maybe it's good that it's over.

2100,Dramatic_Mulberry157,1647720495,1,"**TLDR: I send people my picture and get blocked or ghosted immediately after and its starting to really hurt.**

It's not like I had very much self esteem to begin with. I've struggled with that all my life. But i've been trying the online dating route to meet women (or men, really) since its harder for me to go places like bars and clubs where ppl normally meet (i have a significant mobility impairment). I'll start talking with someone, the conversation will click pretty well, then they ask the dreaded question: let's exchange pics. Well, at that point i figure ""i might as well try"" even though i have a pretty good idea of the outcome after so many tries:

They block me. Or just stop talking to me. Every time.

Every. Fucking. Time.

I would kill to hear a ""oh you're cute"" or even ""you're handsome"" (which feels more like something a mom would say then a romantic interest) but nope. Only a deafening, agonizing silence.

As for the sites/apps where your pic is the first thing they see, i never get any matches or likes or messages to begin with and all mine go unanswered.

In the case of me sending the pics upon their request, it clearly isn't a personality issue, since we'll have been talking quite well up to that point. It's all the face.

Are so many people really that shallow? If so, what hope is there for a hideous beast clearly barely resembling a human, like me? Or am I just objectively unattractive and unappealing to anyone? I want to keep trying because that's just my natural spirit and attitude about challenges, but this is really starting to hurt. Its almost a tangible physical sensation now, the rejections. I find myself feeling worse about myself with each failed attempt. And of course, when your confidence is gone you're even LESS appealing to anyone, especially women. So I'm just digging myself a hole by trying this method but idk what else to do to try and rectify my loneliness and isolated feeling. In person isn't much better, since i have visibly low confidence, am apparently quite unattractive, and disabled (yes i feel like that makes a difference to people. in fact i know it does, from experience).

Fuck me, I don't even have any platonic friends. I have three people who would say they are, but we never hardly talk let alone go do stuff, so its like they arent even in my life anyway.

How does a person deal with this? It makes me so sad, and i don't want to get into the self-pity mindset since that's also toxic, but i feel like im getting there whether i want to or not.

2103,BTNboy2090,1647719092,1,"(M/27) I today realised that I am lonely even having family and friends I still feel alone.
 I would say I’m generally a good person, I’m kind empathetic and will always accept people for who they are but i feel in this world it’s not reciprocated.
I’ve had a hard 3 years with me caring for my Nan who has dementia and my mum suffering from COPD and being in and out of hospital, these two women raised me and now I feel like I’m loosing them, maybe even lost them already. On top of this o my ex left me over a year ago and I still have strong feelings for her but she has blocked me on everything which makes me realise that she thinks I’m the problem or she has peace when I’m not around.
For some background info we were together for 6 years and she was with me through everything but the last two years I became more dependent on smoking weed to bury my problems. My mental health was non existent and I made mistakes, but now I’m a different person as I’ve been through therapy and still continue to have sessions weekly, I haven’t smoked weed for a year and a bit, before this I had smoked solidly for 10 years.
Every time I think about her I blame myself for loosing her…

Im 23 black girl in Europe and I swear isolation like most of you know is not fun. I get in my head a lot because the days I’m not forced to socialise I don’t speak to anybody. Im generally at loss because my anxiousness seems to only be getting worse instead of better. Making friends irl is hard but I have noticed it’s even harder on the internet. All you have is texting or calling. What if we run out of things to talk about? I had one person I held dearly to me and sadly lost them due to disagreements he was the only person I felt really good talking to and who could deal with how I feel. We used to call hours watching stuff, playing games together or just chatting.  He didn’t mind my random rambles and I don’t think I’ll ever find someone like him. He wasn’t  perfect but I miss our friendship daily. He was the only person who accepted me for who I am and my closest online friendship. I wish I could have something like that with someone again.

Years ago I was very social &amp; talkative. I was being friendly &amp; I had some friends. And in school I was being myself from the start &amp; tryin to make friends with my classmates. Unfortunately, I was bullied in school because of I was being myself &amp; etc. So I started isolating myself from others hoping that it will be more secure &amp; I won’t be treated that way again. When I went to high school a nearly a year ago, I kept myself away from everyone cuz I didn’t know them well. I’ve become isolated &amp; more introverted. But I start thinking that I am an extrovert who has isolated himself. When I talk to people, I enjoy that so much &amp; feel kinda charged. 

Now I start hating my loneliness more &amp; more. I want to end it, but I am afraid that being myself &amp; trying to make friends again will end up being bullied &amp; feeling bad again. Idk what to do in this situation.

I am guessing it is because of low self-esteem and not having a SO but, based from what ive learned, most of my mental health issues come from a significant lack of any kind of love/affection in my life. So i am currently trying to get a SO but i am not attractive...

The thing is, i mostly have female friends and they all agree im an 8/10 and that i would be an awesome bf because of my very caring nature, my jokes, personnality, etc.

So im just lost, if my friends (which are all pretty different and all have different tastes in guys) think i look good, then why am i not attractive to anyone else ?

2110,throw-away-518,1647717192,1,"Hi all! Venting here, as I feel alone with my thoughts and was just wondering if anyone else can relate.

Does it bother anyone else when someone who's a lot more social than you complains to you that THEY have ""no friends""?

I feel that it's VERY insensitive when someone does this. I don't have that many friends, but I'd never go around telling people that I have ""no friends"", because that would be VERY insensitive to people who actually have zero friends. I'm fully aware that many people in this subreddit have it far worse than I do. I sympathize with you all, and please know you're not alone.

In my life, the only people I can comfortably text right now are: Parents, brother, boyfriend, boyfriend's mom, one cousin, three friends, one acquaintance. I'm FULLY aware that many people have it way worse than I do, and I'm so sorry if any of this is triggering.

Two of these friends are childhood friends who are away at college, who I text rarely and see once every 2-3 months or so. The other friend lives a few minutes from me and I see her about 1-3 times a month. I also have one work acquaintance who I sometimes talk with on snapchat, but that's it. There's nobody else besides family who I regularly communicate with. I'm not in any group chats, and can easily go several days to a week without messaging a single person besides my parents/brother and boyfriend.

Any other friend/acquaintance I had in the past, I've completely lost touch with. I simply don't have the social skills and capability to keep in touch with people beyond the situation I met them in. This is meaning that that if I met someone in a class, I'd permanently lose touch with them pretty soon after the class ends.

An example of this: In the past, I had a friend who I was on a sports team with in high school. We're neighbors, and used to meet up to go for walks outside of practice. We both initiated these walks equally. After the season ended, it very quickly turned into just me initiating them, and it slowly fizzled out completely. The ""friendship"" is now limited to just waving to each other as we pass by in the neighborhood, that's literally it. I was on this sports team for four years, and nowadays I don't talk to a SINGLE person I was a part of the team with.

I can't even comprehend how people can keep in touch with friends several months to several years after the fact, I just can't do it. It always becomes one sided with me literally keeping the friendship alive on life support, then it inevitably fizzles out, EVERY single time. I simply don't have the capability of keeping in touch with people. I'm not nearly likable or social enough.

The main reason I'm making this post is because of my boyfriend. He always tells me that he ""doesn't have many friends"" and is ""socially awkward"". That is the complete OPPOSITE of the truth. I get triggered when he says this, it feels very insensitive to me. He hangs out with these two guys about 5x a week, and has SEVERAL other close friends and acquaintances who he sees less frequently. I estimate that he has about 30-40 friends/acquaintances that he can comfortably text at any time, and about 10-15 people he can comfortably ask to hang out with one on one with.

He can literally go two years without speaking to and old friend, then talk to them again like no time has passed at all. If I went two years without contacting someone then reached out to them again, they'd very likely respond with something along the lines of ""who the f\*ck are you"". My boyfriend is just a lot more likable than I am, he's very charming and people simply want to be in his company.

He even has female friends who he hangs out and zoom calls one on one with, and tells them about his relationship with me. I've NEVER has opposite gender friends, and don't ever see it happening. He always tells me that he has ""only two friends"", when in reality he has several more. He says he only has two because these are the guys he sees several times a week. All of his other friends he sees a lot less frequently, I'm guessing about 3-5x a year. He's seriously such a social butterfly, and I get extremely frustrated when he complains to me about having ""no friends"". I wouldn't be as bothered if he simply admitted he's a very social guy.

I'm not even fully sure of the purpose of this post, I just feel really alone in all of this and I'm curious if anyone else can relate to any of it. Thanks to anyone who read this far!",lonely,"I feel alone with these thoughts, can anyone else relate?",2022-03-20 06:13:12

Hello to all this may reach, I’m slowly but surely loosing my will to live &amp; the battle of making / loosing friends. 

To be brutally honest I have next to nobody to make plans with or even talk to every so often, whilst my busy work schedule is earning me a substantial amount for my age I truly have nothing else but work &amp; the gym. I attempt to make friends, they fade, my best friend lives quite far away, I have no plans on the weekends anymore (other than seeing my best friend) &amp; im truly lost &amp; somewhat scared that I will grow older just to be alone? 

I’ve had this talk with myself &amp; my mum that I really don’t want to make it past 40, im so set in stone that the crippling loneliness will go on for the rest of my life and I can’t deal with it.

I also broke up with my ex a few months ago, her and I also made ALOT of plans together and granted I am grieving from this, it just reinforces the fact I really have nobody in this life.

2143,JACCO2008,1647705836,1,"TLDR- I got rejected by a girl I liked and it made me realize how genuinely alone I am in life because I have no one to talk to about it. 

About a month ago I got an ""it's not you, it's me"" text from a girl I really liked. This isnt a horribly uncommon experience except in this instance. I was really into her before even going out. She said on our date that she wanted to go on a second one and that she liked my ""energy"". She was slow but reciprocal on texts, and seemed engaged. Everything was looking up as far as I could tell and I thought maybe I might have found someone who was actually interested in me for once. 

Anyway, I got that text at 6AM when I was on my way to work and it killed my day. I replied back to her just saying I was sorry to hear that, but I understand, I hope she can find what she's looking for, reach out in the future if she wants to try again, etc and I figured that was that. The weird part was that she texted me back like 12 hours later saying thanks for understanding, she will reach back out when she's ready, thinks I am a great person, etc. I wasn't expecting or hoping for a reply. I mainly said that as a parting pleasantry so that just made it all worse because even though I don't expect her to, it gave me a tiny unrealistic glimmer of hope for the future and that hurts a lot. It hurts so much that it's been bothering me for a month.

Now, all that said, the reason I'm putting this in lonely vs dating is because I've never felt more alone. I've always been something of a loner and haven't really ever been popular enough for people to reach out to me first, but I never realized how truly alone I really am until this. This rejection hurt me really bad for some reason, way more than the others over the years, and I don't have anyone to talk to about it.

I can't talk to my friends about it (they know the girl and interact with her occasionally) because I don't want them to feel like I am complaining and feeling sorry for myself and just say ""oh great, this again"". 

I can't talk to my family because they get all weird about my dating life and make it hard to be honest with them. 

I can't talk to my coworkers because I have a very professional and stoic reputation that I don't want to ruin. 

I can't talk to a significant other because, well, it's been 5 years since I've had one. 

The only person I can really talk to is my therapist, but she's $100 a session which means I only see her every 3-4 weeks for 50 minutes, so I don't really count her. 

So here I am. Hurting very badly emotionally over something stupid and illogical that really shouldn't be hurting me, and I have no one to talk to or help me work through it. 

I feel like my life is sort of a ""food desert"" where there is plenty to eat, but none of it is nutritious. Even though I have people around me, I'm still very much alone.",lonely,"I am hurting, and I have no one to talk to",2022-03-20 03:03:56
2144,BrokenWayne,1647705264,1,"Loneliness is like quicksand. The more Lonelier you feel, The more desparate you get. People especially women hate this. Women hate desperate men.

Lonliness is like an endless pit. It's easy to succumb and really really difficult to get out. The more you struggle, the more you succumb.

Loneliness can be conquered, it's the state of mind you need to work on. Work in silence. Work on your personality, your financial situation, your body, your health. At the end of the day, these are the things that matter.

Only thing you need to keep in mind is this:

                              DO NOT GIVE UP

Fight for where you belong, where you deserve to be. Never ever feel weak or be overwhelmed by the situation.

                          YOU ARE NOT WEAK

People are fickle, at the end of the day everyone's alone. But it's the mindset that defines you.

After I became 21 years old, I basically had 0 friends.  And my last friendship with 2 males was that they used for money to buy weed, so I broke it. I don't do drugs any more or drink.

Studies show 33% of adults world wide are lonely. So not taking into account any extenuating circumstances that is around 33% of immediately reachable humans are lonely. That is around 2 billion 97 million. Yet I'm supposed to believe that there are virtually zero websites to meet people for platonic relations in my area? Like seriously, Tinder has over 75 million monthly users and 65 BILLION matches. I understand sex is a human need, but so is platonic socializing! Think about it. it is a capitalistically implausibility, not a single successful friend site? 75 million users monthly for a hook up site and I cant find 1 single person to show up for my event on meetup.com, only 4 user in my entire state on FriendMatch. I google 'make friends on Tinder' and the first result is people bitching about the concept. 75 million people want to hookup or date and 0 of them want friendship? I refuse to believe this, because it is impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to live like this, I've tried just about everything to find someone, anyone, who I can connect with. The only people in my life who even vaguely understand my passions are the teachers and therapists who I have payed to be there. There has to be some way to for lonely people with similar interests to meet. There are 271k 'Lonely Hearts' on this sub reddit, but this is merely a conjugation. There must to be way of uniting these 271k, these 33%, making some kind of app or site, not based around sex or romance or any other intricacies of modern society, where one can connect with their fellow man, simply because they need platonic human understanding. I want it, and if you are lonely enough to be on the r/lonely subreddit, than you likely do to.

2184,Count_Backwerdz,1647679916,1,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program co-director at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. I'm currently in the middle of the semester and taking 5 classes ( Just one semester left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! I'm also open to voice chat as well but there's certainly no expectation. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. It would be great to find some good company.

I do have people I consider I friends but both of them don't like to text much, so even if I do text them first I either get no response till at least the next day and even when I do I've got no ideas left on what to talk about. I just like talking a lot and it feels really bad knowing I don't even have people I could talk to. Yes, many would say that I have my family but I find it easier to talk to someone my age, maybe? 

I also overthink a lot and past experiences, -where I was not included in class activities or ignored in conversations and heck even my old friends don't contact me anymore- make me feel like I'm annoying or a burden so when my friends don't even have time to text me back I get these negative thoughts too. I start thinking that they don't care about me or that they just don't like me...things like that. 

I know and understand why they dont want to text too but it's not always easy to convince myself that everything is fine too. I do have a lot of hobbies but when I'm troubled by these things I can't focus on them too so it's not easy to distract myself. 

Also, I believe my Pre-Menstrual Syndrome(since I'm a girl) makes these feelings and thoughts worse than they already are. 

I've tried talking to both my friends about all of this and while one of them understands, I guess she can't change herself for me, right? 

While classes were online, we used to talk frequently but now classes are offline (and even though I meet one of them everyday I keep thinking that they're meeting me because they have an obligation and not because because want to) so everyone is tired after going back home, including myself, so I don't expect to talk anyone anyway but during vacations, or holidays both of them are unreachable and it just feels lonely. 

All of this also makes me feel insignificant a lot...like even if I disappear randomly then also no one would realize. I think I might be a little depressed too(won't self diagnose but I'm going to get all of this checked out by a psychologist) and I definitely have gotten more anxious than I ever was. 

I wish I had a solution to this but I can't seem to recognize the actual problem too. I try to convince myself against most of my overthinking but as I said, during my PMS it's way too difficult to control it. I know I shouldn't depend on others for my feelings too but I guess the fact that I've always had friends and after moving cities I couldn't make friends and now when I did, I still feel alone.

My birthday was ok 

Umm well to start with my divorced parents got into a fight so that was fun.

Luckily it wasn’t like drawn out or too bad it was more of my dad pissed off my mom (either purposely or accidentally) and then my mom berating his phone then he pretty much ignored her so she was in a pissy mood for couple of hours.

But out of the darkness comes light as me the fresh 19 year old and my mom and sister played Mario kart and jeopardy for a few hours.


Then came the highlight of the Day I went to go see The Batman .


So before  I gush about the Batman there are NO spoilers and let me give you a lil insight on how I see myself 

I wouldn’t consider myself a comic book fan in the same vain as I wouldn’t consider myself an Anime Fan.

I like specific characters and Shows. And those are the ones I follow.

So like the comic book characters I love and I follow (some more than others) are 

Batman 

Spider-Man

The Question 

Deadpool

And 

Hell boy.


And for anime the shows I love are 


Lupin the Third 

Pokémon 

Digi mon 

Fairy Tail

Dragon Ball 

and 

Black Butler


So I wouldn’t consider myself a fan of either medium but I love specific series from these mediums.


So my point for that lil thing is that my knowledge of Batman stems from only the Story Lines I’ve read, the games I’ve played, the movies and shows I’ve watched and the lil factoids I know.


So time to Gush about The Batman!


Personally I found the best part for me of the Batman was The Riddler as a villain 

In all the incarnations of the riddler I’ve seen he’s never seemed to really be out to kill somebody more than he is just more so out to have his ego scratched wanting to show how smart he is to Gotham and proving he is smarter than the worlds greatest detective 

I love how in this movie they turned him into this deranged serial killer who thinks he is this Martyr.

The Character is portrayed with just so much realism from his costume, to how plans and speaks and spreads his message and goals.

It gives me hope that Matt Reeves if he gets the green light to make another Batman Film what other villains he and the writers would be able to give this treatment to.

Like I love Murphy’s portrayal of The Scare Crow but it doesn’t ever feel like truely scare crow to me, I’d love to see a new scarecrow with bigger plans a badass costume his goals and actions giving the Audience a sense of Moral Ambiguity. They could even bring back Murphy for the role. Maybe Mr Freeze or Hush as a secondary villain.


Also a 3hr film length I was a lil worried about but for the information and the scope the movie covers it’s a required amount of time and honestly I didn’t feel like a 3 hr movies there is barely a dull moment.

Also I really liked this version of The Penguin I’m very used to either Danny Devito or a Cockney English guy.



But after the movie I visited my dad we chatted he gave me a card we watched tv for a bit unfortunately he wasn’t feeling well so he couldn’t be in person for the cake ceremony 


Then I got home had some pizza for dinner had some really good cake

Then I ordered my sister her birthday gift cause her birthday is in a few days 

Then I went to bed went through another day and here I am.

I have no friends. At such an age and time, I should but I don’t. It’s hard to form close, long term connections. 

Everyone stuck with their hs or pre-existing circles. I tried to maintain w hs but it didn’t work. My closest hs friend said we were only friends cause we had no better options and that we were only friends cause we spent everyday together for 8+ hours. 

I’ve accepted that I will never have the childhood/hs close friends others have nor even close uni friends as it’s been 2 years of covid online and commute to uni takes long.

I volunteer, am social and pretend to be nice but in reality I’m so alone. A bf could solve shit but idc about a relationship. I just want friends. 

I watched Batman alone after work, it was great movie and I enjoyed it but when I saw others with their friends or how people would tell me they’re watching it with their hs mates. I get sad. 

I hate this because everyone sticks w hs for this sorta stuff and trips since everyone lives in the same place after hs (Sydney) usually. I wish I tried harder. But I’ll continue just going to the gym, waging and finish uni.",lonely,watched Batman alone,2022-03-19 17:54:19

I helped her out of an extremely abusive relationship and we'd been together 1 year 6 months and 5 days with a month of speaking before that. I don't know what to do. I've been to a therapy session and have had the police called on me multiple times because I would be crying in my uni accommodation saying I wanted to kill myself and throwing objects around. I haven't self harmed because I'm too afraid of pain and haven't killed myself even though I have stood on a bridge once, again because I'm too afraid of pain.

I would happily do things for her like get her snacks and drinks and the likes. I just don't know what to do and all I can do is be angry and want to kill myself and just keep thinking I've lost my best friend and soulmate. 
All I wanted was to make her happy and for her to help me and me to help her and all she wants is time away from me. I want her so badly I just can't deal without her. I don't know what to do nothing is helping I have no hobbies or friends and being on the phone to mental health teams and saying the same shit every time with nothing happening other than ""well if you feel like this again call us before it gets worse"". My mum doesn't care she's ""giving me space"" to cry and get over it but I'm never going to get over it I want to die all the time so badly just to not exist or think and everything will be over and I won't bother my girlfriend anymore.

I get so little play it’s unreal. I’ve been in one defined relationship for like two weeks, and like flirted with three different people. One of these flirtationships was like the healthiest romantic arrangement I’ve been in as it just kinda was on and off for a while before fizzling out. No drama. No feeling abandoned or rejected. Just us not having enough time for each other.
The one relationship I had (the two week one) fucking sucked because it was my best friend who dumped me for my own good and our friendship was basically ruined for like a good few months and has only just now gotten closer again. 
I had one like near hookup experience and it just kinda sucked. I was really smooth and confident outside the bedroom (a miracle for me) but once we were in the bedroom I was reduced to being an indecisive moron.
Anyway, I just sort of look at the massive amount of failure in my life and don’t know how the fuck to interpret it. Sometimes, I just think I’m kind of ugly. I have a tooth gap and I’m overweight, but working on it. I have a hard time believing this but I’m probably not a hideous guy. I suppose a big part of it is that I have zero confidence. I always feel really awkward hitting on women or even talking about women I’m attracted to because me being attracted to a woman feels like an insult to her. Like I feel like if I say I think a girl is cute, even to like a close friend, I’m insulting her as a person somehow.
Regardless of the cause though, I just sorta hate fucking up every time I wanna hit on someone. What makes it worse is that everyone around me is like a natural at it compared to me.

2205,ThrowingAwayTheMovie,1647668023,1,"Hey Lonely,

I used a throwaway account because I do not want these feelings to be associated with my person. It is something I feel inadequate about.

My life story, I think, is a little on the unique part. I've been born and raised in a middle eastern country to a middle class family. I was bullied growing up, and had mostly made friends with other outcasts. I was, and has always been, a massive nerd. I did not take care of my appearance or health. After I finished uni, I decided to change, and so I did. I lost a lot of weight, got fit, started taking dancing lessons, going out, expanding my friend group and so on. I dated, had flings, etc.

But throughout that, I felt there was something missing. Like there is this promised or desired life that I wanted, that was just beyond my reach. I went through a lot of growth during that time. I made mistakes, learned from them, and realized that I didn't want to live in the middle east anymore.

I moved to Europe in my late 20s, where I became depressed for about a year into my studies there. I eventually got my shit together due to help from friends I made there. I had a few hookups there but nothing serious. After a few years, I immigrated to Canada.

I was broke with degree and work experience that was worthless there. So I struggled, working min-wage and retraining on the side. Now, I am 33, with a new career with a lot of promise. I'm settled, I've made it.

And throughout this? I've managed to maintain my growth as a person. I'm really proud of myself. I can tell my kids (if I ever have any) that I came to this country with $200 to my name and a dream.

But here is the thing, I'm afraid this day, will never come.

I have friends all over the world. Dear friends, close friends. Friends who would cross the ocean for me. I'm intelligent, driven, with various interests. I take care of my body and my mind. I'm multilingual, and can hold myself in many situations.

Then, why do I struggle so much with romance?

Why do I now feel awkward and fearful? When I wasn't before? Why do I lack the confidence? And even when I shoot my shot? Why am I missing a lot?

I don't know. Maybe I'm not sexual enough? Maybe I'm gunning too high?

I wish there was a guide for this part of life.

The part that is really getting to me now is my age. I'm 33, not young, not old. I can handle making mistakes when I'm young. But now, I fear that a day will come when I will not have any more chances. I'll be ""left over"". Too old to be desirable. This is probably irrational, but I can't help but feel it.

But I always tend to come back to the idea that I think I check all the boxes that society told me to check, yet I'm not getting my dues. What a toxic way to think, but can we really deny that the world doesn't tell us just that? Take care of yourself, be interesting, etc. You'll get it. I \*Like\* myself as a person. I'm proud of myself! I'm done with that cliche piece of advice. What's next?

Of course, my rational mind knows the solution: I need to get myself out there. But many of us would probably relate to the fact that that is easier said than done. Between work and gym, there is limited time to socialize per week.

Sorry if this took long. There is much on my mind that I wanted to get off.

I spent my twenties putting most of those points into my hobbies and various life skills. Not a bad choice, per se, but when your hobbies are the only thing you have that define you, there's gonna be some problems that come along with that.

It's like the only source of happiness I have available to me is in creating stuff, but specifically sharing it and having people express positive things about it. But that's the thing: it's about *it* and not *me*. If I don't make and share things, I don't get the happy chemicals. Contrast that to someone who has a solid social support network or a romantic partner -- they receive happiness just for existing and being a person others like and want to be around.

I could have spent more time developing other skills, like...being more charismatic and likeable. That's not to say I haven't though, just that I could have done more. I feel like my only worth is in the things I make, not in who I am. I do feel self-worth in myself for those sorts of things though, it's just never affirmed from the outside by other people.

In any case, I guess I'll just have to keep trying more in the next decade of my life.

2236,Moist-Cut3459,1647654306,1,"Okay so this is basically just a random 18 yr old girl ranting (Tw: I talk about depression, BPD, antidepressants and suicide): 

Backstory: All my life I really loved people I always wanted to give everyone everything. I just loved being surrounded by people.

 I had a group of friends we were 7 girls. We met when we were in grade 9. 

When I was in tenth grade, a problem happened with my group of friends and I ended up losing my circle of friends. Which really affected my mental health (that was already bad btw) even more and I went to a therapist who diagnosed me with Borderline personality disorder (bpd) and gave me some antidepressants. 

 Then covid happened and I just ended up depressed even more and socially awkward. 

 I ended up not getting my refills during covid cuz my mom was scared of going to the hospital (covid was still a big deal) and she didn’t think it was that big of a deal and assumed im fine, well spoilers alert stoping antidepressants out of no where fucks the shit out of you.

 I lost a big part of myself. If I could go back and not take them, I would.

I lost it. I acted on impulse and my bpd got so freaking worse and I just became so vulnerable, hurt and my self esteem hit the floor. I was suicidal and tried suicide 8 times yet im literally still here. 

 I met a group of friends online through a female relative of mine, and we would be on call 24/7. It was me, her, 2 of her other female friends along with 2 other guys. 

Me and one of the guys, lets call him A, actually because close friends. 

The other guy, lets call him B, was good looking but so freaking toxic. We started sexting and because I was so vulnerable I actually never said no to him. I created such a huge emotional bond to him and until now even through all the shit he put me through ( which btw was a lot im not exaggerating) im still attached to him and would literally crave his attention and i’d do anything for it. 

I tried therapy and literally nothing helps. I lost contact with him for like a year but we ended up connecting again early 2022 and even though he changed as a person I still am very very attached to him. He actually admitted that he was tempted to manipulate me but he felt sorry for me cuz of how vulnerable I was and he knew I couldn’t take it.

We never were a thing and I dont wanna be a thing but I really dont know why im this attached. 

Anyways, I try to not do as much and move on, I like to think I did improve.

Now, about 3 years later and after reconnecting with my old friends and moving on from our issues, I still feel lonely af. Our relationship isn’t the same and I just feel like an outcast. 

 I just want to have this one person who would be awake at 3am and we’d talk about life and stuff. Meaningful stuff that actually makes you feel connected to that person. Imma huge sucker for deep convos and I’d do anything for them.

Then my dad told he was thinking about interning her if it gets too hard for her. My parents don't know that I still struggle with it and think that my SH story is over, also they tend to prioritize my sibling's mental health than mine. I feel desperate.

What have I done, I think that by telling her it was a problem in our family, that I was addicted and that I bought something especially for it, I made her addicted to SH.

I lost both of my best friends today.
One of them got triggered because I brushed against them (they don't have a touch phobia I am aware of) and they got really upset and of course, I apologized because I felt bad. They went on to ignore me for the rest of the day untill finally they texted me saying they needed space.
I'm totally fine with someone needing space and I totally respect it. The only problem with this is however that the last two friends they told they needed space to, we're ignored for years and my ex friend kinda ruined their lives by whiplashing them back and forth with texts and canceled invites. So I'm assuming this means I no longer have this person as a friend.

The other person talked shit about me to someone else and I overheard. It wasn't mistakes le because there is only one person with my full name and that is me. They talked shit for about an hour and I just sat there listening. This person is a pathological liar and so I don't really trust them/want to be around them anymore

I have Asperger's (the formal diagnosis is ASD, but I absolutely hate that categorisation), which is a double whammy of shit.

At the end of the day I was asked if I was joining and I said that I didn’t get the e-mail. They forgot to add me to the list (and also like 3 other people of my department of 40 people). I don’t know what’s worse: not being invited or forgotten. I did sign up for it but honestly I don’t really want to go but feel pushed to ‘put myself out there’. 

Next thing some people were having drinks after work. They were just leaving and yelled at my team mate to join them. I was ignored. My team mate asked me to join, but I felt like a burden and said no. 

I also had a meeting at work with someone who I only had seen online. It’s always different seeing people for the first time in real life, so I walked to her floor and looked around. I saw someone who looked like her, but I was ‘t sure so I kept walking across her floor and at the end I turned around and walked back towards the girl I first saw. She had stood up from her desk and walked in my direction. I walked towards her. When we were getting closer I gave a slight wave but she just walked past me. She didn’t even look at me. She joined a group of her colleagues and I was too afraid to walk up to her. I lingered at the floor, waiting for her to go back to her desk but she didn’t. Eventually I just walked back to my floor. She later messaged me that she totally lost track of time. I felt awful once again.

Then Friday, today, I could work from home. I had done a lot of work at the office and was basically done so I worked a few hours in the morning and watched Disney movies for the rest of the day. I cooked a meal for my boyfriend and I and we ate while watching tv. My boyfriend almost always goes to friends in the evening. He knows it bothers me that we almost never spend evenings together and that he only comes home for dinner or to sleep. Being lonely is something embarrassing to me and I don’t talk to him about it. I had the worst week ever so I wasn’t feeling my best anyways, on top of that I was bored out of my mind because I watched movies all day. I wanted to have a good night together. He’s tight on money so we couldn’t really go anywhere or I had to pay for us both and didn’t feel like doing that. I know he’s planning on leaving that night when he starts offering me tea after dinner. And today he did that as well. I went to bed early, he knew I wasn’t feeling good. We had a short conversation in the bedroom about how I didn’t plan anything so he would just go. It feels like forcing him to stay with me if I say no. I don’t want to force him or anybody to be with me. I already felt disgusting today, I felt fat and unattractive, alone, lonely and bored. And when I heard his car leaving I just cried. 

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy my own company and my favorite hobbies I can do by myself. But this silence is too much. I’m really trying at work, but it hurts so much.",lonely,Another Friday night spent alone,2022-03-19 07:28:25

We change, not only because of the time that passes by, and it takes *a lot* of time to understand a single person and make a connection. That's a whole damn world within them to get to know.

But I want to start somewhere. It hurts that I can't even talk to my family. I live with only my sister, our parents live near too, but they have no idea who I am. I only answer yes or no questions and don't speak more. That's how I've always been. Lately, my need to socialise made me open up more. When I start sharing about myself or excessively talking about things I'm passionate about, I get punched in the face by their disinterest.

I have always been that weird, isolated kid that everyone knew something was wrong with and stayed away from or bullied and assaulted.

(TW - sexual abuse)
I was brutally raped and abused since I was 4 until I was 13. It happened several hundreds of times. Dealing with that, developing depression and being autistic turned me into a person that simply nods her head and runs away from any conversation that seem more complicated than that. But I have a lot to say. And I have a lot of love and warmth inside of me that I want to share.

Even trying to meet online friends is too difficult and overwhelming. After only a few messages exchanged, my mind goes into ""RUN!!!!"" mode. I can't continue and it makes me physically unwell how difficult socialising is. Especially when I am filled with fear from unhealed trauma and anxiety from inexperience. I almost never talked to people. I almost never had full conversations. Don't get me wrong, I embrace my autism and love many things about it, but it sure makes it way more confusing and complicated.

Being around people terrifies me, but I want to have at least one person I am close with. I want to have someone tell me about their day or something they're interested in. I just want to sit relaxed, with no tension in my mind and body that's always present, look at them and admire how beautiful one's mind can be. I love people. But it's so damn difficult, and I can't help but feel frustrated and helpless.

TL;DR: I am unable to socialise and I can't talk to people as it's confusing and overwhelming, but have the need to do so.

As a person who used to be married to the ""wrong"" person: Being in a shit marriage is better than being single, alone, and depressed.  

I have been depressed ALL of my life, and the ONLY time I was stable and happy enough to finally get off of anti-depressants was when I was married. 

The marriage was far from perfect, and it was clear by the 1-year mark we shouldn't have gotten married, but for most of it I was happy and so was he.  

Things that happen in even shitty marriages:  

- You always have someone to go on random adventures with. Once, I woke my ex up at 12AM to drive 2 hours to one of the best 24-hr donut shops in the country. Then, because we were both on a diet, we split one giant donut between the both of us, and watched netflix in the car before returning home. This was a Tuesday.    

- You gain valuable life skills. Your spouse goes to work or school at a specific time, comes home at a specific time, and that forces you to maintain some kind of order in your life. You are forced to organize, because you're balancing your schedule with theirs. This is a life skill that every depressed person needs, but it is hard to cultivate if you are completely alone in life. I also learned how to do laundry correctly, because while I never cared about fucking up my own clothes, I did care about his, and the result was me actually enjoying doing laundry and being privy to how to clean clothing correctly.  

- You have someone to back you up, at any time. There were so many instances where my exhusband would stand up for me if I was being mistreated. I used to be very sick, and he'd always have to advocate for me at hospitals and dr's offices. He wasn't always there for me emotionally, but if someone tried to harm me he would spring into action.  

- You make friends easier. As a woman, it's just easier to make friends if you're married. My circle of friends grew tenfold the moment I said ""I do"". Married women, and men, often have a bond that closer than singles because your life isn't shifting as much. Married people have set schedules, and meeting for brunch every second tuedsay is just harder to execute with single friends.   

There's more but I just wanted to vent about this. My marriage was terrible...but it was still better than being lonely, single, and depressed like ive been my entire life, because of the reasons above and more.",lonely,"""being single is better than being with the wrong person"" Bullshit.",2022-03-19 04:08:46

I have some few friends, i would say like... three. But i love them! They're just like me, 19-20 years old, virgins, gamers and that stuff. And just recently, after we finished high school, we started hanging out. Just to be clear, it's been almost 2 years since it ended, and we've been hanging out for like... 5 months i believe? Or maybe 6... well, it's recent.

What i wanted to say is that we're not hanging out for like some weeks. I thought like:

""Okay, they have their lives and i have mine."" 

And i decided to hang out... alone. And it was cool, i bought a Coke, some snacks, grab a book and sitted in a bench on the park.   
At first i was scared because anxiety... and i'm still a bit ashamed... but i'm happy that i can have fun and enjoy even being alone. 

But there's a feeling, which i don't know how to explain, that bothers me a lot. I would say it's like... something's missing, you know? And i kinda know what it's missing, but i know it's complicated and it's not like:  

""Okay i'm feeling sad, i'll go to the shop and buy a girlfriend.""   
I don't exactly know what i can do, but i know that relationships don't start like this, at least not with me. 

I rarely talk to girls, but i know it's not hard. I don't want to talk to someone just because i want to feel less lonely, feels like i'm using someone else as a shield to something i can't face, and it will end with me and someone's else hurted. But at the same time, something's says i still need someone.

And i tried, i need to say. I never cared about social media or stuff like that, but i decided to maintain my Instagram at least. And of course, i tried to get some dates. A total failure.  
One of the girls that i tried to date ghosted me for like 2 weeks, and yesterday she sent me a pic with another guy.  
Another girl accepted, but ghosted me after accepting... which i don't really understand.

I'm not here to say ""Womans are monsters"" or complain about being rejected, i'm actually pretty much used to be rejected. So, if you're a woman, and you're reading it, i'm not here to spread hate to a gender.

As soon as i saw that post i wanted to cry. It made me feel so bad about myself. The worst thing is im currently mentaly pretty unstable (due to stuff that happened in the last few years) and seeing that post about her destroyed me.

Just wanted to say this because its on my mind since i saw it.

I hate myself so much for beeing shy and introverted it makes me feel sick. How the hell should i get someone when im always so quiet.

The only ""good"" part is, (about my current state) ive started working on myself and im trying to get a better version of myself. 

Im constantly in a fear of never getting a girlfriend too. Yes, i know beeing too forward about this isnt going to get me anywhere. Im waiting for that one day but the point is not everyone in this life gets a partner. Always seeing posts like ""dont worry youll find someone one day"" isnt really helping.

Sorry if its bad written. English is not my first language. This post is a pretty big mess. Im not sure what my goal was with this i just wanted to write what was on my mind (because im obviously in a bad mood rn). 
I hope it was somewhat understandable what i was trying to say.

This was intended to be just for me so if it’s extremely vague there’s a purpose behind it. I Don’t expect anyone to read this and excuse the grammatical issues as I did not care enough to fix them.

The following can be added to the beginning of the sentence to make sense. I/ im/ you/ your
- feel empty/ sad/ mad/ pointless
- Can’t look at you anymore/ just a shell of your old self/ feel like ever since a certain event things haven’t been the same, don’t act the same
- No allowed to hold you/ touch you/ even look at you anymore, without you pulling away, telling me to move, “don’t look at me”
- Feels like you learned to live life without me. That’s fine just stings a little 
- Ask “can I get attention” like I haven’t been waiting an entire fuckin year just to hold you, caress you, comfort you
- Tells me to go play my games like if that’s not what I’ve been doing for the past damn year, tired of games, tired of wasting precious time now that I’m here
- You keep your distance until you want something 
- Disappointed your able to call random friends or family but took you at least 3 months just to shoot me a plain txt. Even then I’m the one that started the convo
- Really waited an entire year/ paid over 3000 in expenses/ couldn’t wait to get home just to feel ignored, useless, pointless 
- Ironically enough the one most excited to see me was my little sister who I’ve been ignoring all this time
- don’t know what to do with myself… dedicated all this time and recourses to come home and now that I’m here it feels like my life is a lie. If I can’t be happy where I thought was my happy place then what is my happy place? What is my purpose if I’m not needed here… 
- Not happy but I don’t want to let go of precious memories…maybe there’s a solution to this feeling…maybe not

Inner thoughts 

Damn… really couldn’t wait to get home just to want to go back to work… only time I actually feel like I have a purpose, where people rely on me, believe in me, support me. But work isn’t the happiness I want to have… I miss the old ways of being happy, relationships, friendships, bonds. Maybe I’m not cut out for this stuff. Should I just forget these past couple years. Remembering hurts, wishing for things to go back hurts, I don’t really wanna hurt anymore… no one to talk to, no one who cares to listen, funny thing: my sister saw I was sad and after attempting to open up to someone she really cut me off multiple times just to literally use what I just told her to make fun of me. Ouch but what did I expect? Drop my guard for a sec and it immediately bites me in the back… crazy. This family is being torn apart from the inside slowly gutting itself. Think I’d rather be by myself… but the loneliness is enough to drive me to my breaking point. I really played myself with this one. Grunt life don’t sound too bad anymore, keeps me busy, gives me a purpose that will hopefully result in death, all in all a good trade. Useless, pointless life given a greater cause… could I be overreacting? What even is a proper response to all of this? My best guess to react is looking at other people in this situation…hmm… suicide don’t sound half bad. If it’s selfish to leave the ones that love you then why does it feel like I’m never loved until I’m gone… the ones to claim they love you are the first to leave you… leave you to fight this desperation alone… then the sadness kicks in, the feeling of emptiness and purposeless emotion that can all be ended in a instant. I want to say I’ve always had a positive outlook on life but sometimes it’s hard to keep my head held high when I put everything in my life into consideration. My dad who I loved unconditionally since childhood never really accepted me because he believed my mom cheated on him and I was never his son, this lead to me always being the odd one out in the family. Always getting beaten… bullied by my own father and I remained positive because my mo… my mom didn’t love me either… tough luck. She believed I was a mistake and that I should’ve died during childbirth. Funny enough they both set their differences aside just to harass me at a young age. It’s honestly crazy what hating a common enemy can due to reunite an unkindled flame. I like to think that I’m way past these experiences and have grown to forgive them but if that’s true then why does it still hurt? Another funny story: after my dad came home one night and finished beating the shit outta me because why not? I went to my room to cry and my sister who was sleeping got tired of my whining so she has the wonderful idea of shutting me up by suffocating me with a damn pillow… I don’t really think I have PTSD or depression but I still wake up sometimes with the feeling of being suffocated… is that normal? Maybe my idea of a loving family has been tainted by cartoons and fiction and that this is really what a family is… maybe this is how they express themselves and I’m the odd one. Idk… maybe a family like the ones on tv just isn’t meant for me. I’m tired of this empty feeling… I made plans to hang out with friends before I got back home. Everything seemed perfectly planned out but then I traveled 3000 miles just to be told they had other plans… slowly but surely all this planning went to waste… and tomorrow morning I’ll have to push through the day and pretend like everything is ok…again…and again… and again… but I’m never really ok… is that ok?",lonely,Late night thoughts,2022-03-18 21:21:11

I want to stay positive, and I try to hold my head up, in hopes that something intervenes and we correct our ways. Everything seems so apocalyptic. 

I travel far too much for my employer and though I see many places from the airplane window, the hotel views of cars passing by give me more to daydream about. I can't make regular friends and my relationship is suffering. But I'm doing my best and though wrong, I try to mute out the walls falling down around me. 

I have a pen pal, but she's disappeared for sometime now. I'm not sure if she's coming back. It's hard to hold onto friendships that are virtual, but that seems to be the only way to create friendships, when your life fits into a suitcase. You want someone to listen and that they find your random travel pictures amusing. I want to listen and find their random pictures even more amusing. 

I was supposed to catch a flight home tomorrow, instead I'll stay here over the weekend. I'll go home early next week. And then I'll wait for my next assignment. I'll watch the planes fly over my house while I watch the dogs do their business in the morning's wet grass. I'll do that and wish to be on a plane again, when a week earlier, I didn't want to be on that plane at all. It's a true love hate relationship. 

I want to write someone and I want to hear from someone. And though my words are short here, I write incredibly long winded emails of anything and everything. I realize that there are better suited places to seek friends, but people here seem more supportive and we are all experiencing the same loneliness all around. Wow, I suppose this has turned into a request of sorts, when I had meant it as a vent. I guess I may as well ask right? You should most definitely be mature and a deep conversationalist.

2364,DeerStalkr13pt2,1647589490,1,"Warning-This is a medium length post

I am going to start this out by saying this: It's been a long time coming. My mom and Dad divorced when I was 6. I'm fourteen now, and will be 15 soon. I lived with my Mom until I was 12, because of my actions, I had to move to my Dads. I've since cleared up my act.

About a month ago, my mom called me and told me that she was moving. The reasons were:

\--She had no family

\--She kept getting back and breaking up with an abusive boyfriend (The last straw was when he got convicted of defrauding medicare)

\--And she was under a lot of stress.

And so, she moved from Texas to Arizona. She left me, and my sister joined her. I'm living with my Dad and my step-mom.  I felt lonely, since I don't really have the most...open relationship with my father. I've been studying and building model kits to keep my mind off of things. (I have quizzes almost every other day, so I study a lot. AP human geo is a fun, but hard I am not going to lie.)

You may be thinking ""OP, why don't you call your mom and talk to her?"" I have no phone, my Dad won't buy me one, and I can't really talk openly about the things I feel, since my dad is kind of...nosey, and if his ego is hurt, he gets really mad.

Recently, my Mom has been kinda pressuring me to live in Arizona with her, and it makes me mad. I have family here, in Texas! I can't just leave them! I also don't want to leave my Dad, as while he is overbearing, I feel like he would be angry at me, I feel like he'd be hurt, my grandma would be hurt, heck, my Great-Grandma Ruby would be hurt as well. 

I don't know what to do, I love my mom, and I love my Dad as well. I don't like how my Mom just up and moved without giving me much notice (I had a weekend with her before she left, which she left the day before Valentines Day.) What do y'all think I should do?

Tl;Dr: My Mom moved a month ago, as I sit at her house during spring break, I think about if I should move here, the consequences, and how it would hurt my parents.",lonely,My Mom moved states and I'm sad,2022-03-18 18:44:50

2367,Throwawaylonely40,1647586965,1,"Figured I’d share my 40 years of dating experience here. Basically I don’t have any.

I’ve barely asked many girls out really, but those I’d did ask rejected me pretty hard and certainly weren’t flattered to be asked. In fact I’ve gad to apologise every time for even asking.

One girl hugged me once but she was just being nice and wasn’t interested in romance. I think my sole romantic experience is a girl being dared to kiss the next random person who came through a door and that person was me. It was only on the cheek but she was semi attractive at least.

My failures always bothered  me slightly but I kind of believed the bullshit that I’d find someone eventually. It then became obvious that was never going to happen so I put more effort into seeking a partner, only for dating apps etc to increase my sense of rejection much more so (they messed  with my mind so much at one point). Anyway it seems to get to me more and more as time goes by, so if you’re wondering if it gets any easier, then the answer is probably no. I talk to other people who are single and they talk of having fun dating, memories etc and I simply have that part if my life completely empty and of course I find the process of attempting to find a partner so much work for zero reward.

I’ve never shared my story before. I’m not sure most people would believe it TBH. I’m not even fat or ugly or hugely socially awkward. I don’t look great from certain angles I guess, but I’m a 5 out of 10 looks wise and my body must be a 6.

I’d just like to experience love once before I die basically. In fact right now I’d just like to experience asking a girl out on a date (or her asking me), and both of us at least enjoying each other’s company in a somewhat romantic sense.",lonely,40/m never been in a relationship or on a date or even kissed.

However I’ve been traveling through Europe for fun and work. Fun part was with friends and then they left me to do my work. We had unbelievable fun for 5 days and now I’m alone, completely alone.

The place I’m in is a town of less than 5000 people and don’t now anyone my age here, I don’t speak the language and currently only have internet on my phone which means I can’t even do my work properly sigh…

I’m getting super bored and lonely. I’m thinking a lot about my life and relationships and feel that I lost a lot of opportunities which is depressing me more. 

I can go out in a nearby city but I’ll be alone. I can’t drink because I have to drive home later and I can’t take anyone back home with me well because the nearest city is 40 mins away and I don’t think anyone will want you go.

Dating apps apparently do not work because I’m ugly.

2369,Folk_Herro,1647585776,1,"Hey everyone, I hope you're having a good day/night wherever you are. I'm writing this because honestly, I feel entirely undesirable. I'm 25 and I've done about every self-care method to-date. From therapy, to changing my wardrobe, to losing weight, to using a new skin care routine (I love it) to focusing on my career (made huge strides in the past 8 months), taken myself out on dates, almost anything I can think of that makes me feel good and I still feel terrible. I go out a lot (often by myself) and I know I'm not a very approachable person and my anxiety over the pandemic has only gotten worse. But I still try because I don't want to be alone anymore. I'm tired of crying every night only to wake and smile to the world for 16 hours like I'm okay when I'm not. I don't think ugly or anything either. There are things I hate about myself (I hate my smile A LOT) but I've come to accept them. I feel like as a person, I'm in a better spot now then I was 2 years ago this time when I tried to harm myself and end everything.


But no matter what I do, no matter what advice I take, no one has ever wanted to be with me. I asked my crush and she only sees me like a friend. She is truly a great person and I want her in my life in fashion but why is it that no one has ever wanted me? I try not be ego centric and think someone has to love me because I understand it doesn't work like that. Everyone has preferences and the right to be with someone who fulfills but I can't help but wonder why has no one looked at me in that way? I can't help but wonder I'm missing to never have one person in 25 years say ""I want to be with you"" and actually mean it. The women I've dated have never once told me that there's something wrong with me as a person or how I look. My friends are always surprised when they learn I'm still single in my life updates, coworker can't believe it, girls I do meet with are always surprise and sometimes turned off by this and hurts so much. I can't control how someone feels nor do I want to. But there has to be something I'm missing, there has to. I just don't know what it is and I'm obsessed with it. I know its unhealthy, but I desperately want to be loved. It's the only thing I've ever desired, more than my own career. I really don't know what to do to improve my chances. I don't truly see the great guy people see when at the end of the day, I'm alone again. 


I'm sorry if it's a long read, I really am. I just had to vent a lil and i plan to go back to therapy after another failed attempt. I'm just very lost and my cries for help often go unnoticed.

I have a great family, I have food to eat everyday, a roof over my head and I really am grateful. Lately I’ve distanced myself from my friends bc i feel like they don’t have time to/want to hang out with me. Not their fault at all just makes me feel like shit. They’re childhood best friends I only became friends with them in high school, definitely closer with eachother than they are with me. I have distant friends I’ll talk to once a month over dms but really nothing real. I don’t have a significant other either. I’m not necessarily dying for a relationship but I do feel more lonely bc I also have no friends. I’ve never been in a serious relationship or on a date, only had high school boyfriends. It’s been almost 3 years since I last talked to anyone romantically at ALL. No one has pursued me or asked me out, I haven’t found anyone that I would like to ask out myself. I consider myself fairly attractive, fit, and smart. I take care of myself I like to look my best, I love shopping and dressing up. I think I am emotionally mature and available, well I try as hard as I can. I have spent the last three years alone just working on myself. It was great I definitely learned and grew up alot. I know I am very young with much left to learn and I understand that I will not have everything together at this age. But now I feel like I’ve accepted myself and done my self reflection. I’m ready for excitement or passion. Not even romantically just having some friends would be fine, anything !!!!!! Sometimes I don’t understand why I have trouble forming connections with people. I definitely want to, but I’ve never been able to find that ONE person whether it be friendship wise or romantically. I see people at college with friends and it makes me so sad, I’m not that shy either I definitely try to engage with my peers idk I just haven’t clicked with anyone. I feel like I will always go through life alone, everyone has someone that they’re closer to than me. It’s disheartening. First world problems lol. I am so touch deprived I think if someone hugged me I would cry. I just wake up everyday and repeat the same cycle I wish life had some excitement that, I felt something.

The thing is I never spoke up about all the chaos, because I didn't know it was bad. I was also falsely medicated with heavy doses of Vyvanse and Risperdall (or Risperdone idk).

Anyways, that's kinda like the backstory for this. Growing up I never really had friends, and so they meant a lot to me. The less you have, the more they mean. In 4th grade I made a friend in this girl who I found the prettiest and kindest creature I've ever met, Bella. Me and Bella grew very close, I asked her out several times, as dumb kids don't know when to stop, to which she politely said no every time, but she was still the same person afterwards. In 5th Grade, me and Bella were going good, then one day I ask this dude, Mason, where she was. He said ""Didn't you hear, Bella got home schooled.""

I had lost the only thing that mattered. Following this, I didn't realize it until now, but I became a womanizer, I developed a fear of abandonment, and I've trashed 4 really good and positive relationships, because of said fear.

I had my ex and his friends and my three neighbors are my age and were always around, plus I had started volunteering and the older folks were so nice. I had my two dog park friends and in-person classes. I finally felt happy, before that phone call too but it was just overwhelming how stable I finally felt.

My relationship ended, it had to, and while I wish the work I’m doing was enough, I know we really won’t get back together. In October it started to go off the rails when things were serious and I needed more markers of commitment. My neighbors moved for various reasons and don’t have time for me. All my classes are online. My dog park friends have drama. I have more responsibility since I was hired by the place I volunteer and mostly work alone while the nice older people get to do the same teamwork and I have to drive around picking up orders.

For a few months I had it all, and post-BU I lost everything else that was supposed to help me be okay without him. We had issues 2 months ago and have been officially broken up for 1 month but before all that we had plans for today (St. Patrick’s day, I know no big deal but I remember looking forward to it.) I saw people partying downtown and I just can’t go, can’t run into him, and I’m home alone.

I guess I had some though I never really took much time into it if you know what I mean. Like in third grade, I started being friends with the “popular girls”. Since I didn’t really know how to be a friend, they kinda brainwashed me to become some bad person, so I become one. I always knew it was wrongs and I never really felt accepted there. I barley spoke and I could only speak a certain times or else I’ll be judged since I was lower in there rank. 

However, once 4th grade rules, things for really good. I had my actual first ever group. We were few though as the years went by, we grew stronger and bigger. I always never put too much effort into it though. I just talked to them at school and that was it. I guess some of us didn’t become as strong. I really only was strong with two. 

Once I got in high school, I was expecting to make many new friends; to start a new path. Though it was quite the opposite. I sit alone everyday at the same day next the wall. The funny thing is that wear I am is right next to wear one of my friends from 4th grade sits. She barley acknowledges me. She hags out with the other kids from our old school but now me, even though I was closest person she know there really. I guess it was my fault at some since I wasn’t the best friend at first, though I have change to a much better person.

I have made few friends. One from my English who is very sociable and one from my biology is more shy. I always wanted to grow a stronger relationship with them. They even hang out with each other so it seems perfect. I just can’t get the pieces together. I know for this I have stand up, I have to look up and move on this path.

2454,pleasefeelbadimdead,1647552695,1,"I live in a small studio apartment. Just me, as it's been for about 7 years since I moved out as a teenager.

About a year ago, a single lightbulb went out in my bathroom, one over my mirror. There's five over the mirror and two above me in a little glass dome and once the first one went out over the mirror I told myself I was gonna go to the store and replace it. 

Well, I never quite got to the store and weeks and weeks went by and I guess I just didn't notice it as my eyes adjusted to the new lighting and then another one went out over the mirror. I told myself I was really gonna have to go to the store and get two lightbulbs, but, well, guess what? I forgot and got busy and it just slipped my mind.

When both the lightbulbs in the glass dome went out, I just figured it didn't matter. I didn't so much mind the ever dimming light as I found it was easier on my eyes and I figured (please excuse my edginess if you think I'm edgy) that no one ever visits me anyway, so why bother with new lightbulbs? Who am I trying to impress?

When the third lightbulb went out over my mirror, I promised myself I'd change them all when I got a girlfriend. I've been single since just before the time I moved out and I've been working on myself, exercising, going out, learning finance and art and all I can. ""Once I get a girlfriend,"" I'd think, ""then I'll finally change those stupid lightbulbs.""

And then I guess I forgot about that, too. No matter how much I tried, no matter how much I worked and worked, nothing ever changed and the fourth lightbulb over my mirror went out and I just didn't care. I don't care now that I basically shower in the dark. I don't care now that I struggle to put in my contacts. It's just not a concern to me. I don't know why.

I just wanted to share this with you all, because today is the day the final lightbulb went out.",lonely,there are no lightbulbs in my apartment,2022-03-18 08:31:35

2472,_____myself_____,1647542664,1,"That's what I'm going to start doing.

I [29m] have been lonely for so long that in some ways I've become numb to it, but every now and then it becomes very apparent that all the pain is still there - it's just buried under the surface. Yesterday I spent a couple of hours down there with it, crying more than I thought I would, even when I thought I was done.

And lately I've been feeling so ""stuck"", in a sense. It's not like I haven't tried to help myself. And I have, really, because I've been more socially active the last half a year or so than I even was before 2020 when the pandemic hit. But I'm still lonely, and so much of it is romantic loneliness. Maybe if I had some really close friends, it would scratch that itch of needing to feel loved, but as it stands right now I mostly just have acquaintances and a few people I'd call friends but even those relationships aren't too deep.

Anyway, regarding the title, I'm deciding to start channeling this mental bullshit of feeling shitty about myself into something actually useful, like my fitness. I'm not overweight by any large degree or anything, but I could stand to lose some weight and/or gain some muscle mass.

I already feel unlovable whenever I realize I'm almost 30 and I've never really been in a real relationship, aside from one summer a few years ago that I always make a point to feel gratitude for it having happened. So it's pretty obvious that I have self-esteem issues. I live alone, never have people over, and have a pretty shaky social circle that doesn't really satisfy.

And that's why I feel stuck. I'm doing things and making changes and trying hard to push myself out of my comfort zone to find what I need, but those needs still haven't been met. I'll keep trying of course, but I just feel like I need something I can depend on to make myself feel loved, even if it's just seeing the physical results of my workouts.

As a last thought -- I've considered pets, and I just don't see it working for me. If I got one it would be a cat, but every time I think about it I just have too many concerns:

- What if it escapes my house and doesn't come back / dies? I live in a somewhat urban area and don't have any protected outside areas. I can't deal with the idea of losing a pet that way.

- I feel like it's sad for a cat to live indoors all the time. I know many do and have good lives / better lives than they would otherwise. It's still something I can't shake.

- I'm afraid of the responsibility. I have enough things that give me anxiety as it is.

Sing, and the hills will answer;

Sigh, it is lost on the air;

The echoes bound to a joyful sound,

But shrink from voicing care.

Rejoice, and men will seek you;

Grieve, and they turn and go;

They want full measure of all your pleasure,

But they do not need your woe.

Be glad, and your friends are many;

Be sad, and you lose them all,—

There are none to decline your nectared wine,

But alone you must drink life’s gall.

Feast, and your halls are crowded;

Fast, and the world goes by.

I ran the same dialogue with a friend I knew had a boyfriend, said I was doing a bit. I was just trying to lighten up.

I’d wish her a happy Valentine’s Day a year or two after the fact. She responds likewise. I just feel desperate in the situation.

2521,Cameron6312,1647516287,1,"
So recently I met this girl, who happened to be friends with my now ex gf, a small portion of my time with my ex she helped me give advice and helped me feel better when my ex would make me cry and such(don’t judge me please it just wasn’t that good of a relationship lots of arguing) anyways, she helped me a lot, she made sure that I was ok, now at the time she told me that she jus strictly wanted to be friends and just wanted to help which she is a great friend, then I was mean and told my ex that I’d remove her cause she was mad I even had her added and said things like she was a bitch and tries to ruin stuff, but this girl is still friends with her and me being that guy who wanted to do anything to make my gf at the time happy I agreed and said that all she does is cause issues so I removed her didn’t block her, though deep down I felt so bad for doing so and I still do, then me and my ex broke up, then a day after the break up she adds me back, and I asked her what does she want cause I was still pretty upset about the break up, my ex said basically she didn’t love me anymore, then a week later gets engaged to another guy who she was in love with for so many years, I was really upset about it, but anyways the same day this girl adds me back she tells me she heard about the break up and wanted to make sure I was ok, and we talked a bit, then I start getting super depressed and she comforted me and all this stuff, and I apologized to her for being a crappy friend towards her, and I felt bad for removing her, and then a few days later she tells me about the engagement and I was so upset by it and I was just so shocked cause throughout the relationship she swore up and down she didn’t want to get married, but changed everything around for another guy, but oh well, anyways this is more about her friend, she has been there a lot for me and she makes sure I’m ok like I don’t even have to reach out to her she comes to me she’s really nice to me and let’s me vent and such, then after she told me about the engagement I just kinda went quiet for a day but she messaged me like a little funny message but I never replied, then a day after she messages me asking me if I’d like to hang out with her and her boyfriend, now I got a bit shy about it, and I said I don’t know, and she was saying that she knew I didn’t get out a lot and just wanted to hang out with me, and I was still on the offense about it, then I start getting all upset and she asks me if I’m mad at her and I tell her no and listed out all the things I was upset about but then she comforted me and said sorry about how I felt and such. 

This is where things get really like wow…

She comes back and tells me that her boyfriend is intimidated by me cause she told him that I’m sweet and cute, which really I was shocked cause I’ve never had anyone intimidated by me let alone jealous or whatever of me, I’m not some model guy, I’m chunky, average looking, not like a 10/10(sorry my confidence is kinda crap 😅) anyways she tells me also that if she wasn’t with her boyfriend that she’d definitely date me, which again I get shocked, cause in the beginning she only wanted us to be friends cause I was in the relationship with my ex which you know is normal. But she then tells me that she would like to get to know me more personally, which again I’m wow and my heart is racing at this point just reading these messages, and to be quite honest she is very cute to me, and she’s been there for me through a lot, anyways, she said she didn’t want her boyfriend to know, and I ask her if her relationship is really that bad and she said it has its ups and downs, and I tell her that I would wait for her if this is what she wanted, and she told me that it wouldn’t be fair to me and I said I don’t mind, cause I mean I do like her and she understands me, so then we agreed to do this(please don’t give me any hate saying this is awful let me explain more) then she tells me she really likes me and such, and said that she would love to hang with me, but she said she may not be able to go alone and her bf would be with her, then she tells me goodnight cause she was tired

Next day she messages me saying that she hoped I’m sleeping well and other nice things I message her saying yeah I’d like to hang out with her but see I’m really broke, I get food stamps and disability money that I use to help pay bills and buy food and stuff I need(I have autism, ADHD, OCD) mostly get it cause the autism I think idk, anyways she knows I’m broke but she said that doesn’t bother her, and I tell her we could just find a place to hang like somewhere free lol, and she was like we should get food and I tell her I’m broke and tell her that I wouldn’t want to make her spend money on me cause I’d feel bad, she also has limited money due to losing her job recently, so then we talk more and I started asking questions to get to know her more, and we both talked for a few hours I asked her what she wanted ultimately from us getting to know each other and she said possibly a relationship, and I was getting anxiety from it but not bad anxiety lol, and then she went to bed and I went to bed early in the morning

Then today she sends the same message about hoping I’m sleeping well and then I message her back and she asks how I slept and such, and we then talk for a few more hours then I ask her what is she unhappy about with her boyfriend and she gives me a paragraph about things that have made her unhappy, there’s no abuse or anything, just more like arrogant, sometimes crappy, not very lovey, etc etc, so then She tells me she feels they don’t click anymore cause this is the 2nd time they’ve been together and she even said he’s a asshole, I tell her it may be best for her to find a new job and save up as much as she can and then move out,and she agreed, I tell her how I feel about her and such like saying I like her as well and whatever and I get nervous and ask her if it’s ok and she said it is, 

It’s weird though like she changed around her whole view on me after me and my ex broke up, do y’all feel she maybe liked me from the beginning? She mutes her notifications when she isn’t near her phone so that her friend(my ex) and her bf don’t see the messages, I would like to be with her, if that’s what she wants tho, but then I told her I wasn’t feeling well mentally and physically and she was super sweet and sending me hearts and promising me that everything will be alright and sending hearts, which she never has before when she gave me advice during my relationship, but do you think she really likes me, am I just dumb and not seeing obvious signs and such lol, any advice would help, please don’t bash me or her.",lonely,Does my friend truly like me?

I don’t even know if this is what I want the rest of my life- to be a nurse. It just happens that this is the only available course to take in college where im at that I can make good money (i live in a small town). 

Right now im currently waiting for other nurses to come in because i have a rotation to fulfill with them. This morning i got up and thought “is this what i want in life?” I thought about working 12hrs shift consecutively and working ass of and eating my young. I saw myself waking up 4 in the morning to get ready to work 12hrs or vice versa if i get night shifts. But thinking about life and what’s there to it? I don’t want to work my whole life. I want to see the world and experience many cultures and see people. I don’t have friends that i relate to because everyone seems motivated and my friends in college got family or have live in partners while I still live with my mom (which im not complaining).

2527,TheAlphaByte,1647513851,1,"This question has been on my mind for quite a while now.

To answer it myself: Growing up, the voice inside my head was mostly negative, evil, and SO mean and I hated myself mostly because I was putting my own self down and not realizing that in the process I was devaluing myself in every way. This continued up till I graduated from college and maybe a little bit after too. 

Now or to be precise, the past 2-3 years, I've mostly been alone and in that loneliness I found a bliss. As I distanced myself from others, I got closer to myself in a way. I understood and befriended the voice in my head. Don't get me wrong, it is still sometimes mean (I call myself dumbass a lot 😅) and that's mostly because I'm forgetful.

I'm not religious or anything but I like to play with the idea that inside each one of us is an Angel and a Devil. Both sides are within you at all times. It can be true chaos when they fight. But when they understand, agree, and unite, that's when the magic happens ig lol

I long for deep conversations, star-gazing and going on road trips with someone who truly understands me. I wish to love and be loved.

2541,Emo-emu21,1647503630,1,"I don’t really know how to start this, but I’ve felt a really deep sense of loneliness, just really not feeling super close to people for a very long time. To anyone who went to school with me until probably my senior year of college, it would appear as though people liked spending time with me, and I them. But I have truly not felt as though the effort or concern for the friendship has quite been reciprocated, and I don’t think it honestly matters if I’m not doing well, at least according to my old friends. Last year, I went through a lot of shit that kept me contemplating suicide almost daily, and I had pushed a lot of anyone I had considered close to away on accident but was comfortable in isolating and not talking to anyone later, so I kept it up in hopes of 2 things: a) for them to reach out to ME first, b) to notice my drastic change in behavior from goofy/chill/outgoing to very irritable/withdrawn/just not the same due to circumstances at the time that had caused me to spiral like I had never coped with before.

What I found is that I wasn’t contacted for a month by anyone (excluding for school/work) except for one friend, who has ulterior motives of being more than friends. And I probably wouldn’t have been contacted at all had I not reached out to people first.

I think a lack of uncertainty for me about what constitutes a normal, non-emotionally and verbally abusive/manipulative family as well as not spending time with kids my age often (controlling family liked to limit my recess and I was gone every summer until the age of 20, had to be home right after school, etc so it felt incredibly hard to form connections), and growing up with the mindset of depending on people being perceived as weak definitely contributed to my putting up a strong front and not really talking about the extent of my depression. Maybe bc I don’t like discussing a lot of my problems openly for fear of judgment or vulnerability being used against me, as had happened an ungodly number of times growing up, but when I have brought up issues, it seemed like I received an “oh that sucks” or “but didn’t you grow up rich and travel every summer” “why are u sad if you have everything” or a sense of apathy/dismissal and a continuation with them using me as their therapist with no reciprocity.

so im a first year student and i struggle to make friends in college. my anxiousness is so bad and i always feel uncomfortable in a room full of others. i cant even contribute in tutorials or discussion, so people give me odd looks. the people i do want to talk to, and who i think are interesting for me to wish to be friends with are out of my league. i havent done much with my life - it is pretty boring considering i was raised as a very obedient and sheltered kid. so the people who i want to be friends with think im weird, and its true because i have no experience doing the things they do or having enough topics to talk about. so i always feel two steps behind everyone. im so self conscious of myself, my appearance, personality, experiences to reach out to anyone. even though i partly blame my parents for being way too strict on me, in the end i just feel like an idiot because they are not really the ones who gave me social anxiety and made me so boring. 

my close friend who i used to talk to everyday has stopped putting in effort to talk to me. its very hurtful because now i literally dont talk to anyone anymore. i dont have any family members im too close with, no internet friends or relatives i like. my friend wont text me if i dont text her first, and our conversations have gotten shorter and shorter. so this contributes even more to my feeling of alienation and social ineptness.",lonely,extreme anxiety and loneliness in college,2022-03-17 18:39:57

But I’m afraid that will never happen. I have two close friends who are in a separate friend group that I’m not in (I don’t get along with their friends). Us three have a separate group chat for memes and discussion etc. Occasionally my two friends will rant on and on about their other group chat with their friends. Another time one of my friends will ask my other friend if he wants to do something clearly implying that I’m not invited. When confronted about it he made up a lie that I’m supposed to be included, but it doesn’t feel that way. 

On another note, I have a group of people that I know (I don’t know if I’d call them real friends) who consist of my two neighbors who I see as brothers and people I met through them. This group kind of took me in when I was lonely in highschool, but they also tried to get me to try using drugs which I reluctantly agreed to. Now to start with, these neighbors and I used to hang out all the time since we were little. But things started to change when I would hang out with them and they would invite another friend over who I didn’t know. These individuals would continually tease and bully me and my neighbors didn’t do anything about it; they just let it happen. Fast forward to today, we’re all fresh in college and I still feel that I’m being mistreated by them all. I’m the butt end of every joke, I am constantly harassed about my weight and how I have never had s*x or even had a girlfriend.

So yeah, got emotionally hurt, somehow triggered my loneliness, now I’m reluctant to meet people, but I’m lonely. Totally the worst, isn’t it.

I just hate this weird feeling. I still like being alone, but I feel lonely. Maybe it’s that I’ve become too self conscious and don’t like “looking” lonely to other people? I just don’t know.

It’s ok to feel lonely I mean shit that’s inevitable but when every single day is on loop for you, then that’s when shit starts to suck. You wake up, play the same songs everyday, ride the bike on the same path, Sid in the same seat when you code, go to your room when you eat,play and quickly get bored of video games. Shit gets tiring quick just life in general. You can’t even call friends because they’re not cool with you how you are cool with them. So what do you do to hide the pain?

Now I was never going to say anything because A she already has a bf(who was also one of my friends) and B I had and still have zero self [confidence.So](https://confidence.So) this just lead to us talking a lot and eventually exchanging snaps and talking about everything.We always hung out during school and made eachother laugh so it was all good vibes.Well fast forward i join the army and sometime during basic those 2 broke up(apparently he would get drunk and make her feel like shit) Now during basic they take your phones away so come graduation I came back to a dead ass [phone.So](https://phone.So) during the bus ride to the graduation field everyone was all in a good mode cause they're reading a bunch of messages while i have nothing but spam texts as I was feeling down I check snap and find that i had one person who messaged me...her.Not just from that day but all throughout basic(she was snapping me even though she knew I wouldnt be able to read them)It was full of shit like how im her best friend and im a hero and that i better come home safe and how much she misses and loves me.I damn near cried.Well fast foward we talk on snap periodically but nothing ever comes of it(combination of distance and my lack of self confidence and plus pretty girls dont go for ugly guys)but halloween comes around and we start talking alot and all my feellings towards her(which never really went away)start flooding back,pretty soon were making plans together about what were going to do when I get back home on leave during christmas.On my 21st bday she told me how much I meant to her and how grateful and blessed she is to see me live to 21(we both have been talking about how down we've both been especially as of late)and how me coming home is a light at the end of the tunnel for her.Well fast foward again she picks me up from the airport and we talked for hours before she dropped me off and she said she couldnt wait to hangout again.We never did that was the only time we hung out and she kept coming up with excuses.This put me in a super low mood during what was supposed to be a good time(it was so bad i thought about going back to work early)cause I really had no one to hangout with and it just felt like highschool all over again of me staring at the ceiling.Well I get home and we talk still and Febuary comes along and she starts talking about wanting to be a gf again and have a valentine(I half jokingly said I could be her valentine if she wanted.)Then comes last weekend were she tells me how shes feeling low and how shes going to do something she's going to regret and hangout with a guy she shouldnt.Well turns out all they did was watch movies and talk.This ofc gets her feeling optomistic and she sees him again and shes actually hangging out with him right [now.Now](https://now.Now) I know I have no right to feel jealous(I do)and I know the guy she's with and he is actually really cool but now I cant help but feel some sort of resentment towards him.I already tried deleting snap and stop talking to her but litterlly no one else messages me and she is still my best friend.I tried hannging out with my friends here but they all got things going on,my best friend up here is also handsome and has a new gf.This is the type of thing that happens to me all the time.I know I wont ever be with anyone cause of how I look dude,I just wish i was dead sometimes you know",lonely,My Crush(And long time BFF)just got a boyfriend and i dont know how to handle it,2022-03-17 16:55:14

It sucks scrolling through Tiktok or Instagram and see people having the time of their life with their friend group or not wasting their time in their bed like I am. 

I have friends in classes but never make plans as they already have their own friend group (I'm a commuter) so I always go eat alone or go to the library to do hw during my breaks between classes. I just wish I had friends who I can bond with.

2564,Complete-Ad-6956,1647494303,1,"I've mentioned this a lot before, because I'm basically just using this group as an anonymous public journal at this point, but I started publicly using Instagram and followed people I know. I did it because I literally talk to no one at school most of the time. I try to be responsive, but I need room to grow and get better at conversing in a more private setting before I'll ever be ok at it. So I figured that if I post stuff online, I have more time to think it over and more adequetly express myself.

However, this has also lead to a pretty stark disconnect I feel between my online and real self. I wish people would talk to me irl, because I'm trying my best to make them realize that I'm actually a real person who has interests and a personality. Some of the people I follow I've been going to school with for nearly 4 years, and they hardly know me at all. So, sometimes I get depressed about the fact that in reality, not much has really changed. The fact is, this loneliness is a part of me. It forms a part of my personality, that frankly I don't know if I want to ever completely go away. But a few days ago, I felt really bad and used song on my story called ""Mr. Kill Myself"". I just got really overwhelmed and felt a need to cry out for help. Idk if people got the message though. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.

Then a couple days ago out of the blue, the girl i ""like"" (in quotations because i don't know them), messaged me. This was the first time anyone had messaged me. Something went on that day that she would have been very much aware of. In short, there was aschool event which made me extremely anxious, kind of trigged trauma, and made me awkwardly stand on the sidelines while everyone else did it. She made small talk, and asked if I was coming to school the next day. The thing is, that's where it ended. Nothing happened the next days, she hasn't talked to me. I'm not sure if she was worried about me, or just trying to be nice, or if she wants to be my friend, or what. I don't want to lose the tiny amount of momentum I've built. I want to message her again, but that would require me instigating a conversation. I feel like maybe I'll just make a fool of myself. Maybe I'll make it obvious that I like her. Maybe she'll think she made a mistake by talking to me at all. Maybe things will become even more awkward irl.

what I thought was my closest friend who I originally met over the internet started to simply not give a shit about me once she got into a relationship. it's been well over a year and I still can't get over the fact I've been ignoring the fact she never once asked me about myself or anything I enjoyed.
 and when once in a blue moon when I would work up the courage to talk about something I was interested in that she wasn't, I was lucky to get a response. and yet I still bought her a birthday present this year. I would take a bullet for any of these people. I can't even offer up a good reason why, I just love them despite being such a background character to them.

I’ve been feeling so disconnected from everyone for awhile now. Like an npc in a video game or side character in a tv show kind of disconnected if that makes sense. Like I am there to teach everyone else a lesson on how to be a better person or move on from some kind of trauma so they can move on from me and find their real friends. Like I’m just temporary, a tutorial on how to make friends that you can just forget about as soon as your done with it. 
Maybe it is my self isolating tendencies that have done this to me but I really wish that for once someone noticed when something was wrong with me and actually asked if I was ok. I really wish people asked me questions about my life and my thoughts instead of it feeling like I always have to force them to listen to me. It’s not like my friends are mean when I talk about my life but it feels like I always have to bring it up myself because no one will ask. 
People seem to always end up leaving just as I feel that I can trust them. Just when I feel that I can tell them when something happens to me they always seem to move away, switch schools, or start making new better friends.

Just genuinely asked if something is wrong maybe even ask if there is something they can do to help. Or when I say I’m listening to music or watching a new tv show someone asking me what I’m watching/listening, maybe even checking out whatever I said I liked to see what I’m talking about.

I get that I tend to go above and beyond for my friends in what I will do for them and expecting them to do the same for me is ridiculous. A good portion of them don’t have access to the resources I do which is why I offer the help to them but it would be nice if someone could offer some time for me. Just some time to listen to what I like and ask what I’m planning to do today and not just because I asked about their day. 
I just don’t want to feel so alone all the time. After all I know so many people at this point that I should properly click with one of them.

2593,kywas_,1647479456,1,"hi everyone. im 23 years old. until now, i feel like ive always have to beg people to go “somewhere” or to “do something”. now most of the time i wait for invitations and i dont like making them because i always get rejected, i always say yes (or most of the time) i always try to make the time and make other people feel special and appreciated.

the thing is my boyfriend is playing a showcase tomorrow. two friends told me they wanted to hang out with me and i said i had this event and it would be super nice for them to come with me, they said yes 2 weeks ago.

i talk to them again today to see what was the plan for tomorrow since they werent saying anything… one of them said “i forgot:-(((“ like… is that how relevant am i for you? and added she didnt have any money since she spent the whole week going out. the other one said she has a test on friday… and then added she might have covid… i dont know if this things are true because i feel so let down.. like why i always feel like im not that important to anyone.. its always “i forgot” “i cant” do they really can’t? or they just dont want to..

ive come to the conclusion that in some way im forced to be more independent emotionally and physically, maybe i do want to relay in people, but at the end i just prefer to assume that im such an introvert because i have no other choice.

ive always been scared of celebrating my birthday, people always come with weird excuses last minute and its so sad to just not do anything for your birthday because you cant do much, because people doesnt want to be there or you are not that important for them. 

i know i have my boyfriend and family, but sometimes i wished having one or two really close friends to just have each others back.

i had a friend for a while, but then he got a gf and he just stopped talking that much to me and became more like and interested thing? he spoke to me to drive him somewhere far away.. as a good friend i wanted to help him thinking maybe he would make the favor back.. but the minute i said i wanted to invite him to this event he didnt replay anymore… later i also said the situation with the first two friends and no replay neither…

in some way i feel so lonely, not because there’s no people, there is some of them, but they always make me feel in the shadows like im not even important to them, im not that interesting to talk or to bond to, like it doesnt matter if im there or not it would be the same.. ive noticed that when people tell me stories and i say like.. i was there….. it’s so sad and im done begging i just prefer being alone but it feels worst being alone because it wasnt your choice..",lonely,how am i supposed to celebrate my birthday…,2022-03-17 12:10:56

TW: Suicide

At the beginning of the year a friendship that meant a lot to me ended in a disastrous manner. I'm still hurt and confused over what really happened, and I'm afraid the truth will never come out. I do my best to try and move on, but it looks like it is taking longer than I anticipated. The friendship had turned romantic a couple of months prior, but due to the pandemic and living in different countries we were unable to meet and make anything official. Still, I felt like once we'd meet, we'd start a relationship. We had been planning the meetup already and the things we'd do.

I know I messed up at times and I do have a part in the relationship falling apart, but we're all human and make mistakes. I could have forgiven for his mistakes, if he would have apologized, but he didn't. It felt like he turned everything around and blamed me. People who I told about the situation stood by me and told me his behavior wasn't right, and one even said he was gaslighting me. I still tried fixing it. This whole thing took a toll on my mental health and I got drunk twice and made attempts on my life. 

A month later I had to put my cat to sleep. Almost 2 weeks ago I received the ashes and the grief that I thought I was over came right back. I have these random feelings everyday of the cat still being in the house, but she's not. I have split second thoughts of feeding, brushing and petting the cat, but I can't. She was sick and it would have been cruel to keep her alive. I don't regret my decision, but I miss her so much. I got her when I moved into my first apartment at 18 years old, and she was already an old lady back then, but she was always so healthy and active. Not having her around in the house just feels so unreal. The house just feels empty.

And of course, since misery comes in threes... I was supposed to go to a concert with another friend, but he decided that he didn't feel like going anymore. This concert was something I was really looking forward to, along with meeting my other friend, and now neither one of them is happening. I feel betrayed by my friend, since apparently he's not that into the band anymore, but didn't feel like telling me when the tickets were on sale... He also previously said that another friend of his would be coming with us, made it seem like he had a ticket also, but later said that friend never intended to come. My friend had some other reasons/excuses as to why he doesn't want to go, but he could have messaged me and talked about it.  


I feel like shit. Two of my closest friends seem to have lied to me and I've lost my cat. I don't have much left. I feel so alone. I want to wake up from this nightmare. I thought that this year could have been good, I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, but now I feel like the rug has been pulled from underneath me, thrice in a row.

Some time ago I was diagnosed with cancer, which was not the biggest issue. The cancer was curable, that's why I'm here, but the price I had to pay for it was enormous. I couldn't really go out, because of my poor immune system (caused by cancer treatment) so I didn't have any friends, everyone stopped giving a shit about me as soon as they found out about the diagnosis. I was fine with that, I found myself a passion that I wanted to turn into a job, but after 2 years I lost the joy and fun that I was getting from it. Currently, I have no friends, I don't know how to make any, and I also don't have anything that I like to do in life.

Seems like the reason I've made it this far is because my immediate boss and mentor pities me and doesn't report all these slip-ups I have made, I can't stand myself any longer, I have a boiling hatred for the figure I see whenever I stand by the mirror - I'd strangle it with my hands if I could or had the guts to. I'm useless, no, I'm beyond useless. Not even a useful idiot. I can't even count fucking boxes for crying out loud! I'm a disappointment and failure by any metric, had everything handed to me in a silver plate and O still fuck up. My mind is always up in the clouds, living fantasies and imagining scenarios given my poor performance at work and in my personal life. I want to silence them, I want to bury these images and sounds but I simply can't! I try and try just to fail. My boss thinks I get angry at him after he calls out what I am doing wrong but that isn't the case, I keep quiet after being berated because I want people to know I understand the situation and my wrongdoing - but apparently that's having a ""disgusting character"".

This loneliness of mine is destroying my psyche bit by bit, I spend hours talking to myself because there's no one to text or call. I'm tired of being forgotten, of simply being *there*. Going back home to my bed and computer isn't healthy but what else can I do? I've lost all interest in the hobbies I used to enjoy, I'm terrified of going outside and talking to people in order to make friends because I *know* my ineptitude and awkwardness will inevitably push them away until they are no longer around me, if I open to them I will get hurt no matter what, as has happened in the past. What can I do? Is there any hope? Should I even bother at this point?

I don't know what to do, I've struggled with dissociative disorders, generalised anxiety and depression for over four years but neither therapy or medication has helped me. I don't tell my boss because I don't want to be treated differently to others or be straight up fired for being a burdensome individual for the company.

I am pretty sure we ALL talk to ourselves alot as that's a common way to comfort ourselves when we don't have anyone else to rely on close by .

Well then WHY is it that i just refrain from talking to others as i feel like a burden on them ?

I recently turned 18 and currently live with my family - an older brother and parents . 

Me interacting with them , in a healthy manner // where we don't end up telling each other to die or hit each other etc // is a rare occasion. 

I crave normalcy and warmth almost everyday and feel pathetic for feeling this way since i believe i am the one who ruins the happy atmosphere in our household as well .

I tried to not be a nuisance by isolating myself but that also seems to hurt them .
When we do talk , we argue and that spirals me down to panic attacks and depressive episodes and it must have some impact on them as well since i KNOW that the words i use during those times hurt and cut deep .

I always feel guilty afterwards but you can't really take back what you said AND undo the effect it had on others yknow ?

I feel judged and disgusted whenever I ""open up"" as it feels like i am ""trauma dumping"" on others .

I have a habit of talking about everything once i am pushed enough , in a jumbled and confusing manner .

Lmao i remember apologizing to my old therapist many times since i just kept on venting/ranting about things nonstop. Sometimes having to take deep breaths in between .

I have a friend but i feel guilty whenever I tell them about what I feel since their life and thinking seems to be the opposite of mine . 
Dragging them down and making them concerned seems selfish and pathetic .

Similarly with my family 
I just 
Try so hard to not talk about certain things that can make me burst 
I just try so hard to be normal
Its draining 

I always feel extremely tired after talking to almost anyone even if the conversation was a small talk that lasted for like 5 minutes as my brain just constantly tells me to screw shit up 

Create ""drama"" 
Talk about feelings or certain incidents which i KNOW is a conversation which will hurt everyone and heal nothing

These days my plushie has kind of become my confidant since i stopped going for therapy as i am stupid and broke

I cry while hugging him and rant to him about everything  and anything and i probably look like a maniac while doing so
I wish I had a pet 
That would be nice 

Something/someone warm to hug 
That loves you unconditionally
That trusts and relies on you and doesn't criticize you constantly 
Maybe one day i will be able to find that and open up without crying like a baby or screaming 
Maybe

I act happy around them and talked about many things and hung out a lot with them, but at the end it always ends up with me not feeling... almost like satisfied being with them.

Maybe I should also explsin how I make my friends: 
Usually I talk to a person I sit next to or I like, I hang out with them and get into their friend group. Mostly when I am comortable in that group (which is usually a small group of 2-4 people btw)
I get a lonely person who hangs around me and get them into the friend group as well.
And they usually get good very fast.
But after a few month or years I just... don't feel like they care if I am there or not. 
And when I talk about it with them, they tell me that they'd love to be friends with me and would do anything to keep me around. But when I drift off they never even seem to notice. 
I know it sounds like I just block them out and tell myself that they dont care, but they just dont really talk to me if I don't talk to them and likewise chatting. 
So this is my point, i guess:

Whenever I have friends, I put so much effort into a good friendship and as soon as I stop they, they stop being a close friend. 

But it's even harder for me to get an online friend, it just never works and I don't know how to find someone in the first place

They seem to have better friends already
 and those I bring into the group enjoy it there without me too. And I'm happy for them, I just can't connect the same way.

I don't know if it matters, but: I also never been in love and I'm nit sure if I even love my family. I don't mind dying or death in general and it doesn't make me sag when someone or something dies, including pets.
Nor do I mind these problems enough to get a therapist to talk about it. I once had one and I learned, that I can't talk sbout my problems in person, I just tald her that I'm fine and so we never actually talked.

But what I really want to talk about is really common comments in this posts, comments that are right and should be taken in to account by the OPs, this common denominator in all comment sections is the warning that love and romantic relationships are two way streets and that you can't just go on hoping that you will just GET from a relationship and that most of the time it also means GIVING/sacrifice.

I'm willing to sacrifice, I'm willing to pour my heart and soul in to a relationship if it means that I get to make a person I love happy, I'm willing to give up so much if it meant that I get to be next to someone that actually cared about me, I would give anything to get the chance to kiss that one person in the forehead and tell her that I'm not leaving, I would give so much more just to hear someone say the same to me. 

I may not have much to offer, but if I ever get the chance to show someone how much I care, I'll show her that I'm willing to risk what little i have.",lonely,"I'm willing to sacrifice, I'm ready to pour my soul",2022-03-16 18:14:34

In the past few weeks, I heard about a friend of a friend who paid for concert tickets for this girl that he hasn't met prior. Two days ago, they went on that date and it seemed to work out, but I commented that he went to the nosebleed seats and that it was boring for that reason, especially since I have experience dealing with that in a concert environment. I knew about this because he posted it onto his Snapchat story.

I told him that I thought this whole relationship or whatever it is at this point (he's fully committed to calling her his girl and saying that she's an extension of himself after the first date) was sort of an act of stroking his own ego, that it didn't feel genuine and that I felt he was sort of using it for bragging rights.

Maybe I thought wrong. He lashed out at me and told me to get a life, and then I had sort of realized that I don't really have a life, and that I have nothing to really be proud of. Overall, I feel like I don't want to be in anyone's life after hearing this and many other comments he made. I honestly feel like I'm a waste of air and a waste of space and a waste of everyone's time.

And so now, I don't really know how to continue with my life, feeling that I just ruin other people's lives by being in theirs. I'm not sure, maybe I'm being too harsh, but there was a time where I had felt desperate to be in other people's lives to spice up my own, and now I feel like that is selfish and worse for the people I seek out.

I am trying to be less of an introvert so id really like to meet some new people. Lately iv been feeling kinda down and a bit lonely so lets chat. I dont mind a short term chat but preferably id like a long term friend. I would like someone that wants to talk about both serious topics and silly topics. Also if you have anything on your mind and need to vent i dont mind listening. 

As for who im looking for age, ethnicity,location dont matter just be fun and nice! Of course it would be great to find someone with common interests but its not a deal breaker im willing and want to learn about new hobbies. So if you think we might make great friends lets chat, we can chat on reddit or whatever app you might use. 

So a bit about me well im about 5'10 with brown eyes and dark brown hair. I have 2 cats, i enjoy hiking, sleeping, going to the movies,mall,bars, concerts. Im a pretty big geek, I love comic books some of my favorites would be The walking dead, Spawn, Invincible, Batman, Hellblazer/Constantine, Spiderman, Old man logan to name a few. I also enjoy reading books like The expanse, ready player one, Lord of the rings. I am currently reading The witcher series i have finished all the short story books and finally starting Blood of Elves.

As for Movies and Tv i like scifi fantasy but ill watch anything. Some of my likes would be Futurama, Lord of the rings, Harry potter, Back to the future,  Rick and morty, The office and parks and Rec, King of the hill, America dad, family guy, Final space, star wars, star trek, a good amount of marvel and dc shows and movies, if you would like to know more please ask.

I Also enjoy video games and I usually just play on my xbox. Some of my favorites would be Red dead redemption 1&amp;2, Fallout New Vegas&amp;4, Assassins creed 2 and origins, Pubg, skyrim, Bioshock, mass effect, i have plenty of more

If you would like to know my music tastes i am very much a punk,metal, classic rock type of guy but that doesn't mean I won't listen to other stuff.

2736,OogletThe3rd,1647406819,1,"TW: suicide

I can barely remember what I did last week, let alone a few years ago. But that's only when I try to remember. When I'm doing something else that's when it hits me. I can feel my stomach twist and spiral and feel my blood heat up. Then I try and turn my head to other things but it ends up with me remembering more and more things until eventually nothing feels fun anymore and I just shut down for the day.

Looking back on myself, I'm damn jealous. I used to be so much better then. I was actually likeable. I had friends, my parents smiled, I ran around in the grass until my legs hurt. Now I just sit around when I get home. Can't bring myself to go outside because my thoughts keep thinking ""they're looking at you."" Can't even trust some of my closest friends. I can't stand silent car trips or a quiet room or anything like that because that leaves me alone with my thoughts and my thoughts make everything worse.

Sometimes my thoughts play out horrible horrible situations. If I hold a knife my brain plays out what would happen if I just stabbed myself. It plays out car accidents, me hurting my own family, just things I hate thinking about.

I just wish I could do one thing right and let myself be proud. Not letting my head tell me ""theirs was better"" or ""you could've done better"" whenever I pour my heart and soul into something. I never like it when my brain talks and I wish it'd just shut up for once.

Absolutely, I need therapy. Can I or my parents afford it? No.

My family has eased up on their care for her, she requires light hospice care for blindness and diabetes, leaving me to pick up the slack. I do not mind but it is getting old. That dog is truly my best friend. I used to hang around unsavory type characters but no longer. I distanced myself from my old friends and I do distance schooling, partly by choice partly not. My friend list is very small, I would go as far as to say that is near nonexistent. My last outing with a friend was actually on my birthday 3 months ago. I had prioritized meeting with my friend over meeting with my family on my true birthday; maybe for truly reasonable reasons or because of the status of our relationship but I had to choose between going to dinner with my friend or with my family. I would consider my current family environment as toxic. My mom is selfish and lazy. My dad isn't perfect. He complains about substance abuse but succumbs to the pressures of beer and dip every day and night.  My brother is one of the unsavory types as mentioned before, albeit slightly less so but that could just be my relationship bias interfering. My dad is awesome. We have our issues but my dad has worked so much for my family. I mainly hang out in my room because I cannot stand to be around my family members, a functioning part of the dysfunction. It is not to hide away on purpose, maybe so. I have a short patience with family regarding the smallest issues which is a part of the reason why i hide away in my room. I have another brother in the army. He is awesome. I have no problems with him over the years and we have a great relationship. Ever since he left things have changed in my family. My mom used him to run errands, evidence of her laziness, but now that he is gone that option is no longer available. Things have taken a toll but that is too much to get into here. I want to move out. I want to escape. It is almost time for me to move out. I am finishing my AS degree and transferring to finish my BS so i will move out when i switch universities. That is not for another year or half. I am trying to manage. Moving out will be much easier after I have an AS than if i move out before. I will be able to use my degree, in accounting and finance, to get a job. I am 23. I am basically a hermit. I like it but I want to be a hermit with another person or with a network of friends.

Of course the irony of it all is that I have been pushing everyone away from my life lately, and nothing ever seems to be working out for me. Being alone hurts so much, it makes me question my existence and everything, it really puts me in a bad head space. I look at everybody else around me, I see the world thriving, people having the best of their lives, partying with friends and hanging out at each other’s place. I really am jealous of them all as I have never had the privilege to experience this all in my teens due to my strict upbringing. So yes, I have been lonely for most of my life, a prisoner of my own room, viewing stories of my friends having fun through a small rectangle screen while torturing myself to depressing thoughts, videos, music, etc. 

I don’t know what more to add, this all makes me look less appealing and so if you would wish  to skip this post and ignore me, you have every right to do so!. Apologies for taking your time to read this lengthy post :( . I wish you all well!

Here’s a wee bit of information about myself (Should you like to talk to me instead): 
- An introverted extrovert (yup, that’s me for sure lol) 
- I would like to know about you (well you can mark me as a listener), I enquire about people I care about almost on a daily basis 
- Religious (if you are too, that’s a bonus!)
- Be prepared for fights lol: NOT physical lmao just your regular messaging disputes or discourse (I feel like this is how relationships are really strengthened to the max, so if you don’t like it don’t bother lol) 
- Trust issues galore 
- I love sports in general, games as well (not overtly a gamer myself but will engage if it need be) and will converse about any matter  

Any gender is fine! Although I must warn females who would wish to talk, that all my previous female best friends have gone out of their way to love me but I’ve forced them all out, one of which is my ex (still wants to marry me off, WELP!), one had her family find out so I had to apologise in great detail while with the other I chose to keep my distance to avoid any potential conflict. For guys, it shouldn’t be much of a problem as I would expect you all to carry around your “no homo” pass for the rest of your lives.

It's just the same thing everyday untill now, I met my friends, socialise, hanging out but none that seems to 'click' for me to consider them as genuine interaction (it's just probably just me being selfish). Every moment I spent with them fell dreadful overtime, some says they cared for me, some said that I'm their best friend but truth is they never understand me.

As time passes by to my twenties I don't even bother to socialise, I just responded to whatever they talked then continuing wasting my time on this earth alone.

It got so bad that I can't even speak short sentences without fucking it up.

This never really bothered me much untill recently around my birthdate (reaching 22) all of these shitty feelings and thoughts of how much I've wasted my life incapable of doing what most people consider as natural such as:

Having somebody to rely on (either help or emotional venting), having romantic partner (when I try to court potential romantic partner around age 21 I just can't because my social life has become so dystopia that I can't even start/hold conversation longer than a minute) and seeking new friends (mainly because I know nothing will change no matter who I speak to because most likely the problem is me and not them)

I know I'll be worthy of love and a relationship on day, but I also know as I am now know one will hardly even look at me. I work out a lot, trying to get in great shape. I'm in college for IT, something that should pay a lot so I'll have a desirable income. I'm not the smartest but I'm not an ideot either. I have a goodish amount of previous experience but not a tone. Enough that I know most of the do's and don'ts of maintaining a long term relationship. But I guess due to a lot of my circumstances, I literally can't get one right now. I live in a shity basement with a boarder line abusive father. And when I say basement I mean corner with no walls or a door. Just concrete, a fold out couch, and many many spiderwebs no matter how much I clean. He's insanely rude to me and anyone I ever bring over, so there's no chance in hell I can really bring a girl here even if I'm allowed to. Other problem is I don't have a lot of money yet, and I'm covered in acne. Working on the acne thing as best I can. Gonna be on antibiotics for it soon. I'll do whatever it takes to get ride of it. I know one day if I keep working hard my situation may change. But it's also gonna take years. Maybe one day I'll get to live a nice life and find love and happiness.

2807,svetaxx,1647375547,1,"I've been having a rough few days. I'm feeling pretty depressed about my life in general and so lonely. I live alone and have been for about 6 months now. It's my first time living alone and I work from home as well. I'm 26 and am just terrified and upset with the direction of my life.

I'm starting a new job next week and will be working in person for half of the week so I have something to look forward to. I have a handful of close friends but a lot of them have a boyfriend and are living with their partners. The others seem to live much fuller lives than me, have more plans, etc.

I do have a boyfriend that I've been with for a little over a year but we've run into some issues and it seems that we are going to be breaking up soon. We just want different things out of life and are both having a really hard time letting go of each other. We've been bickering more too.

My family is not close whatsoever. I don't speak with my father who was abusive my entire life. I do speak with my mom and sister (the two of them don't have a close relationship with one another and my sister doesn't speak much with my father either) but I just don't feel like I have a family honestly.

As I'm realizing my boyfriend and I are close to breaking up, I'm realizing how much companionship and friendship his presence brought me. He really does feel like my best friend and I am very close with his family, who almost make me feel like I have a family of my own. I feel like I'm subconsciously holding onto this relationship for dear life, knowing we might not be the best fit for each other long term, because I'm scared. A good amount of my friends are heading towards marriage or just seem to have a bigger friendship circle or closer relationships with family. I just feel so alone and I'm so scared. I'm not a big drinker but I was considering drinking a drink or two alone tonight because I'm just so sad and need some relief from my feelings. My friends are busy with their own partners, some of them living with them, and the others can be inconsistent at times. I'm getting so down on myself about how sparse my social life has gotten.

I know that I'm only 26, but I feel like time is flying by. I'm worried I won't ever get married or find the love of my life. I'm worried I won't ever have a family of my own. I'm worried I will feel this lonely for the rest of my life. I'm worried I will only fade further from my friends who are entering different phases of life. My biggest fear is never getting married which I know is irrational and not the end of the world. But I don't have enough of a social life to be okay with never being married. I don't have enough family or familial support to never get married. I have a lot of trauma that makes me crave a partnership and close friendships maybe more than the average person. I'm kind of rambling at this point but I'm just so depressed these days and terrified of how much worse it will get when my boyfriend and I go our separate ways.",lonely,So lonely lately and really needing some support,2022-03-16 07:19:07

I use to always go out, my best friend of 8 years and I were attached at the hip. Within the last 6 months, everything came crashing down around me. My ex came back into my life after breaking up with his girlfriend (he left me for her a year ago). I made all kinds of new friends, rekindled old ones from our previous relationship together, we went to parties together, it was so much fun. I was truly so happy… until last week. I found out through SnapChat that he got back together with his ex. He’s obviously no longer speaking to me and I lost all the great friends I just made. My best friend no longer will speak to me because she’s upset I decided to get back with my ex after telling me a hundred times it was a mistake. I haven’t spoken to her since January. I feel stupid, selfish, and so lonely. I have other friends, sure, but they’re not “friends” if that makes sense. My other 2 best friends live 6 hours away both with husbands and kids so I can’t always vent to them because they’re so busy. The only human interaction I get is when I go home I see my parents (I lost my apartment the beginning of this year so I’m back in my toxic home environment) and when I’m at work. I lay in bed most days missing all that I had just 6 short months ago. I so badly want to apologize to my best friend but I don’t know how to go about it. I don’t want her thinking I’m doing it because I realized I made a mistake. I want her to know that I’m genuinely sorry. The fear of her rejecting my apology is what’s scaring me.

2823,Jurez1313,1647366770,1,"I've been doing some introspection the last few weeks and I've come to the realization that my loneliness is completely self-inflicted. Anyone that I might've called my friend at one point that is no longer one, is an ex-friend because of something I did. Most of the time, I passively let the relationship die by not reaching out enough. Sometimes, I actively ignored them until they went away. A couple times I even acted like a raging asshole, to intentionally initiate them removing me from their lives. Rarely (but not never) is any of my above behavior justified.  

So now I only have 3 IRL ""friends"" from high school, that I don't even like hanging out with but that I can't find it in me to tell them so, and a half a dozen online friends who I've trauma bonded with but that live nowhere near me. This isn't the only self-inflicted issue, though. And it isn't news, either.  

The new part is that I'm realizing that my anxieties around socializing with new people, brought on by failed attempts to socialize with people in university that ended in my being embarrassed to the point of dropping out, are what's really holding me back. But I can't get over them.  

An example: There's a woman here at my current job. She started a few months ago. We've talked, extremely briefly, maybe 2 or 3 times (about non-work-related topics). I know she has an exotic pet, she knows the Pokemon battle theme, and she watches meme videos on YT at lunch. I find her attractive and oddly charming/disarming. Any rational person in my situation (being a lover of exotic animals, video games, and livestreamers/memers) would approach her, say hi, and maybe ask her what pet it is, or what her favorite pokemon is, or maybe interrupt her lunch to ask what she's watching.  

But not me. Nope. I have managed to convince myself that there's no way she's interested in even talking to me, let alone getting to know me or potentially becoming my friend. She's more attractive than me, she's a bit older than me (a few years), she's more extroverted than me, she's smarter than me, and she also doesn't go out of *her* way to talk to *me.* She complimented me on my latest drastic change to my hair, but I think that's the first time I can recall her engaging *only* me in a way that wasn't related to work, and figure it's just polite when your co-worker comes in suddenly bald.  

I manage to do this with *everyone* I come across. Most people I immediately dismiss as too young or too old. Those that look around my age? Well, if they have kids nearby that's an immediate no, don't want to seem like a creep coming up to a kid. If not, they're likely more fit and/or attractive than me, which is an instant no. Even if they're similarly built, around my age, with no kids, not wearing headphones, and wearing a t-shirt with say, Octane on it (from Apex Legends), I'd probably *still* find a way to convince myself they don't want to talk. Probably they're on the way to game with their friends, or on their way to work, or if they're at the grocery store they're focused on what to buy, etc. If they wanted to talk, *they'd* talk to *me,* right?  

But I can't stop. Even though I know this is what I'm doing, I can't convince myself these things are lies that my anxiety is fabricating. I am 100%, unwaveringly certain that these things are true. I know for an *absolute fact* that my co-worker doesn't want anything to do with me, because if she did, she'd talk to me more. That's basically it. I know that continuing on like this is going to end with me killing myself from loneliness - maybe not this year, or next year, or even next decade, but sometime. Because I will never make a friend if I never approach anybody first.",lonely,"My loneliness is self-inflicted, but I can't stop...",2022-03-16 04:52:50

I started a new art high school in september 2021 and everything was okay. I genuinely had a lot of friends who noticed me, ~~which was very new to me, because of the 3 years of bullying I went through in middle school..But the situation was different.~~

As of december 2021, I began to feel depressed and very paranoid due to a series of serious problems I was going through. My friends immediately noticed: I wasn't talking 24/7, I wasn't as happy and extroverted as I used to be and most importantly I stopped doing them favors, so they just stopped talking to me. They pretty much just started showing their REAL sides.

They knew I was going through a lot, and in fact I still am. Nobody would talk to me at school because they wouldn't find me useful anymore. I was having a hard time with my grades, my other problems, my professors, the school itself and my ''friends'' and I **officially** fell into depression.

I was a complete mess and I couldn't manage myself so I talked about it with my mom and a few other people I know. In january, I finally decided to change schools and I'm gonna have to wait till september to go to my new one.

I'm currently seeing a therapist and I'm doing better, even tho sometimes the road gets tough.

I'm 32 now and all the other women he talks to are like 20ish. Makes me feel like shit. 
Since getting sick I rely on him completely and can't support myself financially. I guess I get it. Maybe it's a bummer for him that he has to deal with me. I wish I could disappear.

That's another whole story. Needless to say I didn't drive and had to call the shelter for a ride and the cops beat the taxi to my house. He called them and told them I was going to kidnap our kid. This was years ago now and is basically forgotten. 
He works from home, but today he really didn't want to be home and when I woke up I called him and asked him where he was. He never leaves the house, so I was more concerned than anything. He said he went into the office and would be home tonight. It's fine and I can adjust. I had just already got the things to make us a good dinner tonight. No big deal I guess.

But letting it out to anyone is really my only relief. I don't really have anyone to listen to me except for 4 people I met on reddit as well. So. Yk. 

He was too good at making me ignore how insecure and unstable I felt during the time I was with him. He was too good at making me feel addicted to his affection. He was too good at making me feel loved and wanted.

I don't like painting him as an evil psychopath. But I don't see him as a good person either. Not after he played with my feelings (deliberately or not doesn't matter), not after he tried to rebound with me even when he told his friends that he broke up with me bc he lost interest in dating. Then why? Why did you try to rebound with me? Why did you tell me you'd be happy if we could get back together soon? Well now it makes sense that you told me you wanted to ""see where it goes first"" while showering me with affection.

I know I can't go back to him bc of it. No matter how addicted I feel to his affection. No matter how much I want it all to go back to the way it was. 

I also don't feel like I should find another partner now. Even if I wanted someone to treat me as good as he does. Even if I wanted someone to be sweet to as soon as possible. I'll just hurt myself and other people in the long run. 

But now I just don't know what to do. Because I feel so broken and there isn't anything I can do. And my studies and my irl friends being awful is just really not helping.

2852,Gondal90,1647351679,1,"I am looking for objective/unbiased feedback in an attempt to solve my problem. Feel free to look at my post history if it helps you understand me better. My problem is that throughout my life I have pretty much failed socially. I am 26 and I was not able to get even 1 girlfriend in my life. None of the friends I had ever stayed, they all just faded away. 

It generally seems like I am the one who cares more and has more desire for the relationship. It seems like the other person does not care as much as I do. Now I realize my perception/interpretation of people could be wrong. Perhaps I misinterpret how other people feel? I really don’t know. 

The thing is I did not have a good upbringing. It may sound like an excuse but it’s the truth. I was bullied relentlessly and alienated from my peers in the schools I went to. My parents were just as bad. They didn’t care. They did nothing about the bullying. Heck, they themselves were extremely abusive and neglectful. They never taught me how to behave properly and proper social etiquette/skills. They were unfortunately not the the smartest parents. 

My family was very restrictive. They heavily sheltered me. Because of this I did not develop much social experience/social skills. Now due to the severe bullying, neglect, and abuse I experienced growing up I developed deep rooted feelings of anger, resentment, insecurity, trust issues and poor social skills. This I think caused me to behave aggressively towards certain people which made them dislike me and further isolated me. 

I have attempted to resolve these psychological issues by seeing a Psychologist, multiple therapists, and a Psychiatrist for years. I also have been taking antidepressants daily for years. I have made lots of improvements in controlling anger, insecurity, and developing social skills but these negative feelings are not totally gone. Clearly I am trying hard to improve. 

The psychologist I went to and the therapists say I mostly lack social experience and social skills and I need to keep practicing. I try very hard to control my anger and insecurity but it’s not easy.

It sort of makes me want to reconsider the value of me in their hearts. maybe to them, I am not to be hugged, listened to, or anything that is remotely affectionate. maybe they think I’m too repulsive to even attempt to do these things with. I thought it was normal to want to talk about things you’re interested in with your friends and for them to actively participate in your conversations, well it is for everyone else at least. In my case I always try to share what I’m interested in with my friends because it feels nice to talk about stuff you like. Although I definitely enjoy listening and interacting with my friends, I’m not so sure they want to reciprocate the friendship in that way. some background to why I think this: up until 2 years ago I have almost never shared things about myself unless I was asked, my friends however didn’t think this was an issue. I started to share more of myself with them because I do not want to be a shell of a person who is only there to comply and never voice out any thought about anything. The only issue with this development is the repetition of me talking about things i care about to my loved ones then being talked over/interrupted/ignored etc. This pattern makes me feel extremely unwilling to speak to anyone about anything but I ignore it with all my might. It feels so pointless to do this when no one really is showing any sign of genuine interest in what you have to offer, maybe I’m not meant to be listened to and cared for. I hope to be better and I’d hate being stagnant. I talked to my friends about this issue and they were very upset about it, of course I did explain that the things that contributed to my hurt were most likely unintentional on their part, and I genuinely hold no resentment towards them for any of that. I am aware that I was closed off for YEARS and going from silent to slightly more talkative isn’t that much of a difference to them as it is for me. I hope one day someone genuinely expresses interest in what I have to say, someone who wants to hug and hold me. someone who does not see me as repulsive and would shower me with physical affection.

2865,aloofshrug,1647343210,1,"... It's kind of fucked up how things have played out over the handful of years for me, as far as people go at least.
I swear it feels like i've been marked, or cursed, or something. As if i have this sign on my head that only i can't see that says-
""Do your worst""

It's been surreal since 2018 for me.
Coming from deployment, feeling like i slipped into a parallel universe of my own where if you show any good, it will be devoured in any way possible. 
They way i lost every. single. person i could call friend, and even my own blood. Family. 
It's all so surreal man.. Seriously.
Closest friends, that knew so much about me, that i bonded with in the years. 
Some obnoxious, off-the-wall shit would happen leaving me like ""what the actual fuck dude?"" stank face and all. I would have to cut them off completely. 
Family just ghosting me. 
Literally disowning me right in front of my face. Treating me like shit.
But with that, i've always been the black sheep on both sides.
So, not even trying to go in-depth on that one. 
A whole 'nother cesspool of it's own.


I see myself as a genuine human being. 
Down to earth at it's fullest, and even more down for people.. Giving.
I'm aware, i'm full of energy, and always passionate about interacting/communication. I'm gemini. 
I share everything, and an extrovert at it's finest that acts like a dog seeing it's person come back if we ever have a conversation. 
I'm definitely not perfect, or this great man. 
I've caused hurt and pain to others, sometimes i knew, and sometimes unknowingly, unintentionally. 
Lived and learned about 3 lives now.
But i've NEVER been one for revenge, or envy, spiteful, etc.
I can easily describe my personality as a hippy/skater from the south.
Spiritually connected. Learning, and willing to share it all. 

I have no doubt i'm a strong person at this point in my life, after all that i've experienced. 
I usually can bite the bullet, sometimes a whole clip or two. Then later, or much later i'll feel it. I'll Think about it, and go from there. Usually, if not always i'll get over it. 
I almost never forget.
Always felt i could handle hurt from someone, so i always forgave, always overlooked the fuckery.
I always understood pain as a lesson only if you allow yourself to learn. I appreciate my scars. But sometimes I gotta recover or i feel like i'll be consumed by the negativity.
Sometimes, i would just straight-up disappear for a while.
I'd stop talking to people for as much time as i need to get myself together, sort my head out, whatever i need to do. 
The one's that knew me beyond the surface of my energetic/extrovert self would understand.
I see this as one of my biggest flaws. 
Possibly when i hurt people the most.
These days though, I can't see myself ghosting anyone that would actually want to be in my life now. 

I've always believed in love, 1000 fucking percent.
Connection, growth, evolution, all of that.
Fully aware of life itself, and damn-near what it means to live.
I've always felt that, someone deserves me.
There's other wolves out there like me. 
Real friends.
There's a whole woman-alien-chick out there, also like ""what the actual fuck dude?"" sifting thru whatever we've become as a species. 
Not getting a spec of luck. 
I've ALWAYS wanted my one to just be with to the end. 
Just a decent spot to call home, my car, a pup or two, and her.... That's all dude. That's all.
We don't even have to get married, fuck marriage. Just live, to the end, and then some. 
I have all of this music i'm tired of vibing to alone, art, thoughts/ideas, and experiences. So many things just waiting for someone to share with.
Feels like, the window of possibility for ALL of this is closing the older i get. More every day.
About to be 29 years old and have nobody to share anything with. In any way..
If i wanted a kid, i'd be fairly old &amp; dusty by the time my child becomes and adult- IF i even-somehow, miraculously, ran into this alien woman.
I don't do social media too much, i've only just now gotten into reddit alone. 
I simply don't follow.
Yet everything is going virtual, and it just puts the cherry on top of it all for me. 
I barely get out of the house, i barely do the things i really like to do or want to. 
I feel uninspired, and i feel like this is my last attempt at anything with anyone, unfortunately.
I'm fighting myself turning cynical, and giving in to my own darkness.
I've believed in humanity all my life, and have been so passionate about life and living. 
People man..... 
Just feels like it's all backwards now.
I feel like there's this void inside me that simply does not belong, and it's getting more difficult as i know exactly what's missing. 
But it's just not working out honestly.
At any angle.

I have nobody to call a friend to this day, that i can text or call. Nobody to check up on, or share dumb shit with. 
I legitimately do not know why i have a phone. 
Don't even know. I don't even like phones. 
Feels kinda trash to end up here, on the internet. Typing this for hours as if it's therapy or some shit, or as if someone would read it and be like ""Damn. poor fellAR, let me find you a pack to run with, and a wife. i gotchu."" 😂💀⚰️ 

.. I'm on an app, sharing this with literally anyone and anything. 
As if things would change. 
As if this isn't sketchy. 
*shakes head*




But honestly.
Honestly.
I don't give a fuck anymore. 
As in, it actually is what it is now. 
Every time i give a pinch of effort to interact in any way, with ANY person these days is a big slap in the face and it's really starting to hurt.
Every time?
Every time.
Like damn Shawn, you literally knew, and still continued. You saw it, and still tried the bs. 
Damn fool.
You've selectively forgotten how fucked up people are.
But I do know, I just keep holding on to this hope with my pinky bone. 
I know people aren't shit, yet i still have hope like there's others out there just like me.... 
It's the only thing keeping me going now, is this last hope. I can't accept this reality.
... I don't know....

But if i get slapped again man. ha, smh.
I'm tired. 
Heart's 'bout brittle. 
Mind just out-of-whack. 


Maybe this is the wrong life.

Maybe i'm the fucking alien.

2869,motet7228,1647340420,1,"I'm 17. I've already finished high school and all I feel is empty. 
I'm extremely introverted and awkward but I've experienced alot of different things but in extremely scarce quantities. 

I've had a girl hug me, not out of kindness but out of affection, the same girl had kissed me. These things had only happened this one time. I've never experienced any real other physical touch or emotional connection with anyone. 

I feel like school was my first and last chance to meet people, I have a job, I work 5 days a week but it feels completely different even trying to just talk to anyone compared to school. 

I'm a minor so it's not like I can go on sites or apps to meet people in a capacity that's greater than friendship but even then I'm unsure of what it feels like to have someone be with me for the sake of being with me. Even with the girl I mentioned earlier I couldn't comprehend that she actually wanted to be with me so I kind of fucked that up.. 

I want to get out of my shell and be sociable, even if only a little. To be completely honest, I've felt completely alone throughout all of school whether I had a girlfriend or was written others in whatever setting. I'm sure others felt this was and still do but I couldn't comprehend that this wasn't something unique to me. 

I convinced myself I tried and tried and tried and had given up with other people, but now I realise that's extremely immature and unsustainable for my mental health. 

It's selfish but I just want someone to understand, a guy, a girl, I don't care who it could be a fucking pigeon, but I just need a real, living thing, to convey that it knows what this limbo feels like. 

Like if a stranger put they're hand on my shoulder in an affectionate way, or spoke to me in a reassuring tone, I would break down and cry on the spot, just something sincere.

I made other friends in college who TL;DR: I roomed with them and bullied me out of that dorm. So I live with strangers.

2911,Revolver-Knight,1647318878,1,"Unfortunately I feel like shit at the moment 

I turn 19 on Thursday St pattys day 

Its pretty cool considering I’m Irish my dad he’s from Dublin.

He always tells me even god couldn’t make these circumstances happen.

For an Irish man immigrating to America to have his Irish Son on the most Irish Day of the Year.

The reason I’m trying to not feel like shit is that I know I’m lonely I know I don’t really have friends I know I’m prolly not conveniently attractive I know I’m awkward and quiet and I know I’m inexperienced in a lot of things.

My point is I know these things and why should I let them make me feel like shit especially on my birthday!!

But sadly that’s not working out at the moment.

It’s prolly for multiple reasons and one of them was last year

Last year for my birthday my parents got together and they called in a table for birthday dinner, for Themselves, my Sister me and at the time my Girlfriend 

It was euphoric a memory I cherish I really felt happy.


I remember we got there and they didn’t have the table there ready even though we were on time so we had to wait outside with the long line of patrons.

This was an Irish Pub by the way and it was on Patty’s day.

I remember holding Leanne’s hand I could tell her anxiety was flaring up so I wrapped my around her waist respectfully of course and held her close and she laid her head on my shoulder.

I also spoiled her with some souvenirs from the gift shop.


Then when we finally got a table I remember I got like they called it Chippers Special (but it was just fish and chips)

My ex she got a Shepards Pie with mushrooms on the side

I remember this really funny moment where I’d never tried the pie before and my ex was like “Liam you’ve got to try this!” And I was like sure!

So I wiped off my fork and went to go take a piece and she did “ah ah ah!” She grabbed my fork and put it down.

And I was like well how am I supposed to try the pie.

“Open wide” she said

So I awkwardly let her feed me some of the pie.

My mom said my face beat red my dad was laughing his ass off.


Then we both got a chocolate malt with two straws she pulled my shoulder to move my face closer so we could both drink the Malt.

My mom took a picture I never seen the photo and I kinda don’t want too cause if I see it now if  prolly burst into a sobbing mess.


Like I’d say I’m pretty over Leanne now but like I’m not gonna act like I don’t miss my ex or I’m not thankful or cherish the memories we had.

But yeah I’m pretty sure that’s partly why I’m having such a hard time a year later.

Secondly like it’s just been hard to meet new people to continue this quest called life.

Like I’m not in School I’m working and actually working my way up really good for only being there 9 months.

But like I work as much as I can which to be honest is only about 26-35 hours a week.  I have tinder and the likes and I’ve matched once but they never replied back.

Like I’m not butt hurt or anything it’s just I dunno.

I’m trying to go out more like I’ve been trying to go to anywhere more like even stores.

In attempts to improve my social skills but also in my subconscious mind apart of me wants to have a meet cute moment.


Not that I’m anti date apps but I’m worried about being in a situation where it’s a hookup and I’m not really looking for hookups or sex….

Like I’m not asexual  or anything (also power to y’all Asexuals in the world y’all get overlooked)  it’s just more of I’m looking for companionship. Also like I’m a Virgin (I’m not really insecure about that) so if I was put into a sexual situation I prolly wouldn’t know what to do.

Like I remember in school it was just kids in my class in my senior year and they were talking about stripclubs and they decided to ask me about if I would go to one.

And personally I don’t think I would really… like power to the strippers but it’s like I’m looking for connections. Like obviously we all like attractive people I like attractive people I’m a breast man lol. But I want to meet girls that we can love eachother both emotionally and eventually sexually. Then they called me a Simp pretty much and they went back to talking and I went back to reading or whatever I was doing that day.

Also like to be honest I’d prolly just freeze up and be awkward around all these pretty woman.

But for Thursday my plan really is I’m seeing the  new Batman I’m a really big movie buff lol like my favorite part and most important part of a movie to me is it’s story but I love everything that makes a movie come together. I’ve always got lol factoids and shit to tell people 

Like I remember back in November I watched the Matrix with my mom for the first time and it was phenomenal like it’s my kind of movie.

Then the next day I feel like I ruined it for her cause I came to her with like 40 different interpretations and factoids to tell her like I’d say like “I think it’s ingenious how the Wachowski Sisters give some of the machines specifically agent smith more emotion than the humans” and my poor mom she’s just kinda standing there like “Mhm yeah, wow that’s great sweet heart” like trying to be supportive.

I often have like fantasy’s in my head where I have friends and we have a podcast or a let’s play channel similar to like Oney plays or Gamegrumps or something where we just talk shit while playing games.

And I’m not friendless completely like I have people I kinda hang with at work and I have a friend from highschool I kinda hang with.

We don’t get to hang out to much cause he’s usually really busy like in December we went to see Spider-Man after his exams to get him to calm down.

Or you keep a conversation going but it's only one word responses from them.

Or (so I've heard) you're a woman, in which case men do keep up a conversation, but then all of a sudden become really creepy out of the blue? 

I'm not saying it's impossible. I have met a few very wonderful people! But you gotta keep sifting and sifting until you're pretty much all out of flour. (Or something like that)

…

I lost my dog (my little brother) to two pit bulls who had a history of attacking other dogs. It happened right outside of my apartment, a year or so into the pandemic. You can see where it happened from my bedroom window. He was my best friend since I was 13 (I am 22 now). It’s been almost a year now, and I cry everyday. When I wake up and drive to work, and when I drive home. I can hear his terrible screams and yelps in my sleep, and sometimes when I’m waking up I still feel his blood all over my arms. I feel guilt over not being able to save him. I feel guilt that I got a new pup to replace my old friend. I can’t communicate this pain with anyone because it’s “just a dog”. I feel guilty even talking about it to other people, because they’ve lost things “more significant” than what I have. I just want to see my baby boy again, I’m desperate for some kind of closure, or just an end to whatever I am feeling. It just won’t stop. Every time I look at his shrine in my room I feel so worthless, I feel so hollow. I’m supposed to be a man and I couldn’t even protect one of the things closest to me. 

I still sometimes call my new friend by my old one’s name. When I hold his urn I close my eyes and beg for him to move but it’s just that, an urn. I smell his leash obsessively. He’s here and gone all at once and I can’t handle it. I don’t know what to do anymore.",lonely,venting,2022-03-15 15:04:40

2929,Random-Person934,1647312722,1,"Currently I am in grade 11 high school I used to have many friends back in elementary and middle school though the amount of friends I have now is extremely low and the ones that I do have rarely talk to me or talk to me sparingly. I have one adult friend who is the only friend that I truly trust with things that I would not even dare to tell my mother or father though I only see him once a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly believe that it is all a down ward spiral from here I have spent all my years just studying thinking that the more I study the more chances I will get to become rich beyond even my wildest dreams. However, I am beginning to see that social relations and friends are also extremely important in life. To be completely honest I am not sure if I am still capable of making friends I do not even know what the latest trends among my peers are or what the best videogames are since I have mostly just been studying and watching YouTube on things that I don't believe people my age are interested in. There is simply nothing interesting about me besides the fact that I am knowledgeable in a string of uninteresting facts.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I believe that the only way I can stay relevant to myself and ease the pain of loneliness is to just focus on making an insane amount of money after I graduate from university before using that money to pamper myself, my parents and the people who I view as important in my life. Moreover, I also plan to use the money to secure myself by buying necessities such as food, housing, water etc before living a life of utter grandeur by drowning myself in rich people stuff like good food insane gains and the latest technological marvels of that time all in an effort of shielding myself from the creeping realization that I was born alone and I am meant to die alone friendless and probably only having the heart monitor at my deathbed as the only witness to my last words and my existence.

&amp;#x200B;

I have loving parents and one adult friend who I truly treasure but to be completely honest I am beginning to fear the events that will happen to me after my parents pass away from old age and my adult friend leaving me or passing away himself of old age what happens to me who do I talk to who will bother to listen to my grievances without requiring payment while caring about my words at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I think I am the one at fault. I have never been particularly been good at making friends or worse maintaining them which is an issue that  I already see among myself today and probably worse tomorrow. I don't know I just feel like something is wrong about me whenever I look in the mirror I always have an either distant look or an angry look both of which don't really encourage people to approach me in addition to giving them sour opinions of me before I even approach them. Moreover, I  just don't talk well in public every single time I always feel like my voice tone is extremely off in addition to sometimes stuttering and all the most awkward speech screw ups you can imagine from not being able to know the right thing to say at that given moment to completely blanking out and being unable to respond beyond  neutral phrases like ""nice"" or ""good'.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just too far behind and as my own mother will put it there are 2000 people in your school you are in a classroom surrounded by people with friends why are you the only one struggling with this issue to which I now understand that I am indeed at fault. I am simply too behind and too late socializing to me is the exact equivalent of trying to teach a man who has never seen the alphabet till their 60's the alphabet.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides whenever I do approach people I always feel like a creep for some reason I feel like an attention seeking creep due to my awkward attempts at a conversation. I  feel like a creep due to the things that I often observe on the person I am talking to such as their body language and the way they respond back almost all of them just look like they want to get the convo over with so that they wont have to hang out with me 1 second longer even though I have no weird intentions and just genuinely want to talk. I don't think its their fault I believe that there is something truly wrong with me which is why I sometimes choose to stay quiet and pray to everything holy that grants wishes that I become rich in the future so that I can drown out all of these feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I just want to become rich in order to be able to have a purpose in the sense that I can provide for the people I love in addition to drowning myself in the excess that money can bring just so that I can ignore the feeling of not having friends and being truly lonely.

I am fascinated by the topic of loneliness and totally agree that loneliness is becoming an epidemic in our world. Recent articles from NPR, Harvard med, and the CDC all show data supporting the notion that loneliness is significantly harming our mental and physical health. Right now, I'm part of a UX team (user experience) at the University of Texas. We're designing an app and the problem we've chosen to combat is the loneliness epidemic. I'm wanting to understand more deeply the reasons behind why people feel lonely. If you're interested, please feel free to take this short 6-question survey to help me and my team understand what exactly lonely people might need from an app. Thank you SO much for your time! Your answers help us help lonely people. :)

For the last three-ish years I had a Person in my life I deemed a really close friend. By that I mean we were like brothers basically: I introduced him to new hobbies, got him in his first sports club, he would sleep at my place whenever his parents were problematic. And I enjoyed his ways, even though we were rather the opposites of each other He was your typical quirky lad with a lot of seemingly naive positivity. And we actually trusted each other. He told me his first ever real Drama he had which was a really sensitive topic to him, and he was the first Person I cried in front of in four years. 

The second important Person in this story is my ex-girlfriend. It was a rather emotionally abusive relationship I'd say, but 6 months after I broke up with her we got back in contact (platonic terms only) 
And well, she told me that in that time my good'ol friend also ""helped"" Her to get over me. Or at least he tried. That is not a big issue for me tbh, we were both single so I cant complain. But here's the Kicker: he told her A LOT of private Information I told him in trust in order to get her laid. And according to her, he even claimed he didnt really care for the friendship and I was just there so he could get out of his house. He practically said I am nothing to him... 

Now, if I would trust my ex I wouldnt have broken up with her. However, he confirmed the overall Happenings but conveniently forgot what he said. But not what he has done. He said he wanted to tell me but didnt know how, but at that point it was MONTHS AGO. 

I could add even more detail, like he always told me that I am way too distrusting towards people, and how I got him a really F*ing expansive Gift for Christmas which he would just have taken if that didnt come to light (thank God for our awful Postal Service, It came right after and I returned it) 

But all of that... It messes with me like pretty much nothing ever has. I dort everything he ever said. I doubt everything Anybody says now. I tried to make new friends but cant even remotely get close in a trusting sense. He was like a brother to me. One of the only ones I felt really attached to. I dont have a connection to my family. And I talked with my really REALLY close friends about it. They comfort me, but they cant help. And I dont want to cry in Front of them anymore.

2988,resonancewhere,1647291217,1," 

i will soon be both jobless and homeless. I am all by myself. I do have some money to apply for a new flat - which i should do asap - but i really struggle to do so as i cant seem to find meaning in staying in this city, or country or unfortunately possibly this planet.

my main big passion in life that gives me a sense of ""life is worth living"" is love. I could perfectly dedicate all my energy and endeavours towards building a lifelong romantic relationship and i'd thrive doing so.  
sadly, that seems completely fictional as I haven't met a handful of people throughout my life that I could imagine this with. I feel repelled by most people and those I like and enjoy spending time with still wouldn't be compatible in a serious partnership. this is largely due to me being an utter weirdo whose entire sphere of values, passions, hobbies, ethics, quirks is only merely touching society's side of the venn-diagram.

and so as i cannot find love, i wonder what exactly i am working towards. or what i keep trying for.  
sure, i could find another bleak remote job, i could find another compromised flat situation and keep living in this city/country but for how long can i keep doing this?  
i'm lonely to a degree that the impact of this feeling is robbing me of all my energy, motivation or strife.

 I am not interested in partying/clubbing, alcohol, drugs, literally any ideology movement, I do not care about make-up/fashion/normative beauty and i feel repelled by society's views on what beauty should mean. I do not associate myself with the place i was born and feel alienated by almost all governments and global institutions. I get extremely gloomy and disconnected when listening to radio music, a big portion of comedy movies/shows as i do not share the sentiments and cultural notions they convey. As much as I'd like to have a more stoic approach to it, i cant help but loathe the way most people approach identity-building as if it was a christmas tree to be decorated with keywords for each of which you can find a separate echo chamber to soak in. I feel my core value of authenticity being challenged on a daily basis as it is tough to try to be authentic in all sorts of social settings when people and structures sanction you for breaking the actor norms. I have an odd relation to food, I do not take interest in pursuing a career or get famous or popular or even wealthy. I prefer to be invisible to the world, living a peaceful and calm life with the selected few I wanna share the entirety of my love and commitment with. I love forests and sceneries, swimming in the lake, hiking. I am passionate about languages and linguistics and try to learn a little more each day. Storytelling is very important to me, so I enjoy complex narrations, books of course, but also more exploring music and films where I feel an idea actually wanted to be expressed. I value kindness/benevolence above all else and try to practice it for myself too although on the inside I often fail. I daydream way too often about finding someone who resonates with all of what is essential about my inner life and whom I'd be able to get to know as well as myself and to build something interpersonal and immaterial with that the sum of my future decisions could orbit around.

She's just really friendly. She talks about how she's single all the time, and that she's ""thirsty"". That she hasn't gotten laid in months. These aren't things women say to someone they see as a potential partner. All these things, because she's friend-zoned the hell out of me. She even moved across the table and sat next to me to watch TikTok's (her favorite thing).

But she doesn't seem to even consider us anything other than friends. And we work together. I can't fucking ask her out. We literally work on the same tasks together 3 days a week. If things went poorly, hell if she thinks my sex game was pathetic, then I could never live it down.

I'm just too insecure, and far too worried about my job (which I'm on thin ice at already), to take the risk. So, I sit pining for her. My heart was jumping in my goddamn throat after being so close to her for 2 hours that I couldn't fucking sleep at all last night.

She goes and hangs out after work with me, she asks me things that in my head sound really strange. Like at dinner she said, ""Is it okay to talk about the books I like on a first date? Do men find that weird? Do you wanna hear about them?"" Because she reads weird alien smut books, and of course I'd love to hear anything about her hobbies. She's the most interesting person in the world to me. She asked me about the boring history books on Napoleon I read, and I tried to talk about them, but I just feel like I'm boring her.

I just can't fucking do it. I can't ask her out. She's too beautiful. And it's too much of a risk. I'm such a coward. Fuck my life.",lonely,We went and got dinner. She still doesn't think of me like that.,2022-03-15 07:39:26
2993,kazhxnakozhxna,1647290306,1,"So somewhere around the time when I moved across Europe to a completely different country to start my degree, not knowing anyone there: I started isolating myself. I used to be quite an outgoing person before that, though always with a tint of social anxiety that was for the most part well covered. It’s been almost three years now that I’ve been isolating myself more and more. It’s sad that it has become my norm that I have simply given up on trying to make any friends here in my country of residence (still finisihing up my degree) nor seek out any social events.

I am ready to try making some friends but just the thought of it makes me feel so overwhelmed and anxious, as I’m scared about how it may turn out and I’m scared I’ll overthink it all.

Features include:

* I'm located in the midwestern part of 'Merica, but thanks to the magic of the internet that's irrelevant! \*such magic\*
* Am willing to talk about anything. Did your pet hippopotamus sit on your favorite pair of shoes turning them to unwearable shoe pancakes? We can talk about that! Time-travelers kidnap your grandmother for the third time this week? We can talk about that too! Or if it's serious (yes believe it or not I have been know to be serious at least once since I escaped my mother's womb) we can talk about that as well. But for real... I'm open to talk about anything you'd like :D
* My favorite vegetable is a red bell pepper. Not sure why I shared that of all things, but if you think about it you probably feel like someone's not an absolute stranger on the internet if you know their favorite vegetable, right?
* Will not ghost. I like spooky things, but I am not spooky myself.

I can’t really share my thoughts or feelings on other social media because ppl will make assumptions and then talk about me later in their friends group. I also don’t want ppl knowing everything but i have no one to talk to. I literally lost everyone this year. To drama. Here’s my truth…

Everyone has a problem with how emotional or vocal I am about my feelings. they think I’m trying to seek attention or live through others. I used to have a best friend of 10yrs and we stopped being friends in January when I decided I was going to cut her n our other mutual friend off. (We we’re like a little group of 3). She made me feel excluded and was talking/ venting to my sister about me constantly. As my sister would also vent and talk about me to them. Rewind to July 2021, me and my sister (21y/o) got into our fight physically fight ever. It was over something petty and dumb that didn’t involve either of us. We ended up working it out around thanksgiving. After the fight tho, my two friends 1 of 10yrs and 1 of 3years started to treat me differently and took her side. I felt it. And I expressed how I felt and then we moved on. But Nothing really changed. I personally don’t care about those friends because I feel like it’s okay to outgrow ppl. And if someone isn’t treating me the way I would like then that is not a relationship for me instead of trying to change anyone. After they made me feel so isolated and as if I wasn’t their cup of tea, creating this perspective of my character… I didn’t want anything to do with them. I sent a text and said I will not be associating with them anymore. Now it’s March 2022, and me and my son’s father who I been with for 7yrs broke up yesterday bc he was sexing and flirting with multiple other girls. I also just got into another physical fight with my sister because I heard her talking about me otp with my ex best friend (which she does often) but today I had enough.

Anyways, now I feel like I can’t vent on other platforms, my focus is all over the place but I have a really good career opportunity coming up for me. I’m uncomfortable at home. I have a 3yr old who’s birthday is next month. I can’t trust anyone. I don’t want friends. I don’t like my hometown. I don’t like my family.
I feel like it’s me that’s out of place. And i always try my best to do for others and always transparent about my feelings.
It’s a lot more to my situation I haven’t gotten into but the last few months/ year has been a big change and idk how to adjust to it anymore. I’m scared, I’m lonely, and I’m lost.",lonely,I feel like I’m always fighting for people to stay in my life.,2022-03-15 06:27:14

english is not my first language so i aplogize if i have mistakes in writing..i'm a boy and i'm 19 years old..like the title suggests i didn't have friends at all in my entire life..when i was a kid my mum told me the more you study the more you will have friends but it turned out the other way..i busted my ass out trying to get good grades because of what she said and i did succeed..every year i'm at the top of my class but it turns out i became the nerd of my class..everybody always thinks i'm a nerd and nerds are not fun and boring and are always talking about studying but i'm not..i dont talk about studying..i hate studying more than everybody else but i'm just good at it

i tried to make friends but every time i hang out with them i just stare at them without saying nothing because everything i say is boring to them and they don't care about my opinions in anything..but do you know what does hurt me the most..is them trying to make feel that i belong with them..they force themselves to laugh at my jokes because they want me to help them study

when i was 16 years old i found a friend who is just like me..we had everything in common..our interests and our jokes and everything..we were best friends for 2 years and i thought this will always be the case..but he changed and became like everyone else..he changed to the point he makes fun of me just to impress other people who society labels them as cool and fun people..so i cut ties with him

after that my mother noticed all this she said don't worry when you go to college you will meet other kinds of people..people who are like you

it made sense to me because i'm at the top of my class and when i go to college i will meet other people who are at the top of their class.. and i thought they will be just like me

and i did..i graduated from highschool and went to the best college in my country..but nothing has changed..it turns out they were just like the others..i was an outcast among them because i was not funny in their regards..even when i try to comment on something that we share in common like soccer..they will always say shut up what a stupid opinion..and they don't tell you why it's stupid..they don't even think it's stupid but they say it anyway to make their friends laugh..because in our society , cool people are people who make you laugh no matter how

and i don't want to be like that..i don't want to be cool just because i make fun of people..in fact and don't like to make fun of people i hate let alone making fun of people to be cool

so i gave up on making friends..if you see me nowdays you will always see me alone..always on my phone or reading a book..that's my life now..i made peace with being alone..it hurts a little to say it but i think i am destined to be alone for the rest of my life..i lived my life without friends and i will continue living my life withou friends..and that's fine i guess",lonely,i didn't have friends at all,2022-03-15 06:08:15

Everytime in my life I was always there for my family members and even my friends. When quarantine happened in March of 2020 I had severe flares of my chronic illnesses and I became quickly allergic to foods, fragrances, etc. I was begging for my father to help me not have severe anaphylaxis from my first bad allergic reaction and he just screamed at me and told me what I was experiencing was anxiety and that I was just wanting to have an illness to cover up the fact that I am not able to be independent which is not the case at all . My entire family would spray cleaners, soaps, perfumes, that had ingredients I had issues with before my college exams on purpose. They would treat me like I was a monster when I was only trying to stay afloat in such immense physical pain. It felt like a form of forced self harm knowing that what I had access to medically was just not enough. I bled, my throat swelled, I had hives all over my body and I was just “broken” I had lost my usefulness. I used to frantically put on makeup, drive to school, and be authentic in trying to connect to others and truly be there for them. I am not even just saying this at face value? Like I literally would have other people verify like my sister who I trust, etc that I wasn’t projecting my traumas and that I was truly a friend to these dumbasses. I was so broken when quarantine hit because I basically lost my high school friends because I couldn’t hang out with them. My family treated me like I was a  monster and a burden.  I was the one going through hell. They refused to manage their finances even though my father makes a good amount of money. Everyone was so vicious over money . It’s like arguing with a damn insurance company person trying to argue why what your doing isn’t medically necessary. They were so fucking ignorant of anything biology medical, immunology related things. Like yeah I’m the one going through this hell you bet damn right I’m going to try to mitigate having more repeating traumatic events. And it was the worst pain in my life when my own family just put me in this broken category. Like a spam folder in an email account. I wasn’t even that nasty I was so understanding and admittedly worried and anxious because who wouldn’t be? Like college chem is brutal enough without bitches like using shit or cooking shit that your allergic to in a way that fucks up your entire safe space. And then when you try to alter the air flow or even purchase air purifiers? Good luck with that 🤣. It’s my birthday, I’m 20 and I really wish that I wasn’t. I’m already going through hell with this mess and then my dad doesn’t understand how a GI procedure would be kind of fucking necessary to rule and confirm things I get harassedevery 6 hrs over medical bills I already paid for or for ones he said he would take care of. Which I’m normally pretty diligent with. But fucking hell on my damn birthday? I can’t eat the damn cake yet my mother is insistent on eating cake and ice cream in front of me . I don’t understand why they just can’t be at least neutral and not cause me issues randomly. Believe it or not I’m a fun person. I might have some nerdy special interests in bio, but damn I really wish I could connect with someone and it not have like conditions attached to it. I tried to talking to new people and indulging conversations for the fun of it. Oh you can’t fucking go on a date or fuck me? Bye. It also sucks because I am very attractive objectively, and I fit into all of the wack ass beauty standards. So it’s hard to have relationships with other females because a lot of them get threatened in some capacity or they think that I think I’m better than them or that I wanna take their man. Now it’s better at least not interacting with tons of people in my gap year but fr it used to give me tons of anxiety when I was healthier. Now I just laugh at the ridiculous nature of everything. All I ever wanted was like someone to just be there for me like I was there for them. And this is purely objective here. Everyone just doesn’t put that same effort. Even with family. I feel like everything is conditional which it is. But I just miss having that feeling that your family was interested in having a relationship with you, and just that naive love. It’s really fucking sad especially recently. My 2 Australian shepherds have been hyper but they calm down with SpongeBob playing and I kid you not like I fight tears rewatching it. Because I dealt with a lot of family medical issues and just drama in general when I was young, and I used to just calm down watching SpongeBob and Disney, reassuring myself that they loved me. Which was easier cause I wasn’t aware of their narcissistic behaviors. But damn. I just thought my family would be proud of me truly. Not telling me in unsaid words that I should stop being a burden, die, or that I am a terrible person. I guess I was naive that they could ever actually want to know me as a person.

3026,VenomousBlack,1647278590,1,"There are public services for just about every human need. Food, transportation, health, safety, education, entertainment and literally every other human need...       except loneliness...  


All there is to counter loneliness are apps like Tinder. And from an objective standpoint, Tinder is preying on lonely and horny people to pay money for a chance at intimacy. Anybody who has tried Tinder and isn't a 10 out of 10 has probably not had any luck.   


In my opinion there should be a public service just like health of safety, that is meant to help people find good partners. Loneliness is becoming an epidemic at this point in the developed world. It's ridiculous how many great people are in this painful hell.   


When we are growing up we look forward to different things like being able to drive, work, drink and be independent. What if one thing that people would discuss in the schoolyard is when they grow up and go to the partner clinic (or whatever).   


Professional psychologist could work together with people to create long lasting and healthy relationships. I feel like if everyone would/could do this, it wouldn't seem so weird.  


Even though I doubt this will ever happen, something must be done to fix this problem. It's getting out of hand when huge portions of the population say they lack something that is almost a basic human need.

My manager (who I will admit I was rather obsessed with for a bit) asked me to stick around a little longer with them, so I sat back down and jokingly said, “I really need to find more friends.” 

My manager said back, “MORE friends? You need FRIENDS, because were the only ones you have.” She didn’t mean it in a hurtful way, but damn if that didn’t take a little bit of breath out of me.

Not even because of who said it. Just because it made me notice: I don’t have any friends. Not a one. I have acquaintances, co-workers, people I met THROUGH work, but no friends.

Kinda just opened my eyes to how rough the last few years have been on me mentally and emotionally.

I feel like I’ve been holding in the world’s longest scream for 5 years because I have no one to tell my problems to.

I feel like want to yell out all my deepest thoughts and feelings to all the people I couldn’t say those things to for one reason or another. I have to hold in these feelings because sometimes it wouldn’t be fair or right to say those things to that person, even telling them I love them.

Even writing this I’m having so much trouble trying to put it into words.

I’m starting to have these weird out-of-body feelings where sometimes for a second or two I feel like I’m watching myself from a distance. But I’m obviously still myself, so for that split second as an outside observer I want to slap that guy across the face and tell him to let it out, that it will feel better to let all of that go.

Maybe an accurate analogy is that I feel like a green twig getting twisted up and knotted and mangled, but never breaking outright - just… less rigid. Less able to hold my shape.

3044,FloridaMan1975,1647267427,1,"Hi, my first time posting! I didn't know how to get this working so I looked around a bit first. I realize that in order to get guys to pay for content and services and not have to deliver, I should insist that they pay with Cashapp or Venmo or Amazon gift card. If they want to use PayPal then I insist that they use Friends and Family, because otherwise PayPal will ensure that I, the seller, actually perform. 

I want to prey on lonely men, get a few dollars and leave them hanging.

I feel safe in the anonymity that Reddit provides. Who can know my real identity? Maybe I'm really a man in Russia. 

Who's going to make a big deal about 30$.  Actually, it should have said $30 if using the correct format, but the women here, trying to hook a sucker, write like that.

I've also noticed that we're supposed to refer to a city after the state, like Texas Houston. 

It's going to be hard in the beginning because I have a nice nature and hate to fool men, feeling their humiliation and disappointment, at being suckered. But I need the money.

Another important rule. My phone doesn't take video chat. It's broken. My microphone is broken. I need medicine for my daughter and haven't eaten in 30 hours.

Finally, when things catch up with me, I make a new account. When guys are drooling over my nude body they can't think to view my profile and see how many days my profile has been active. If they still had their brains engaged and saw my profile was 2 days old, they might be suspicious.

My biggest challenge are those potential one-time clients that insist on protecting their money.

3054,EmeraldSights,1647257721,1,"Hi strangers, I happen to be lonely. This is a rant about my thoughts currently. I don’t have any friends, the last friend I had was probably 5 years ago. I might be depressed, or have depression, but I don’t want to die. I want to live, breathe, do all sorts of things that interest me. I feel free, capable of a lot, I think of myself as talented, I learn fast. Little things seem to annoy me. Certain ways, gestures, motions, or things that are overcomplicated. Sentences that are contradictory, or too stupid to read. Mainly everything. Lots of stuff that includes online schooling. The way they phrase questions and ask for things is really infuriating. I struggle with school. I have adhd, I feel like I can fall asleep almost instantly when I start to do work. It annoys me, bores me. It’s been like that since (a long time). My social life is non-existent. I recently got my first job a year ago, which was the most social interaction I’ve had in a while.  I think my speech has improved, I’m less reserved now because of the experience I gained in the job. Although I still struggle with conveying my emotions. A guy and a girl came in the store 7 minutes before close and asked if we were still open, I said yes, for another 7 minutes. And then they looked at me and said “it was just a question”. Yes, it was just a question, and then I answered your question. I then told them that I was not trying to be rude, to which they replied that I should work on that. I thought I was clear and concise in how I responded to them, but apparently they took it wrong (or I said it wrong). I’ve never been diagnosed with autism but after that happened it made me think about it. I have anxiety, being out in public is difficult. I recently went out to a coffee shop for a drink, I sat down and waited for my order. In the meantime, people were coming in and also ordering, and then more people came in. I remember a thought I had in that moment, fidgeting with my phone to try and blend in so people don’t notice me. I want to die. It was this immense feeling of anxiety to where my brain felt that dying would be easier. I’m not suicidal, but often have these thoughts of emptiness, to where I am going to die alone. Its a feeling that no matter what effort I put into making or forming a relationship, that It would never work and I would end up lonely forever. Although I’ve been socially deprived for so long that I haven’t had the chance to even try, but It just feels that way. I have a voice in my head, its not something unknown, it’s just me. I talk to myself all the time, literally all the time. I’m guessing it’s a mix between my adhd and my loneliness. Sometimes my brain goes off on a rant that started from looking at an object, or hearing something. I find myself saying “that wasn’t me, that was my brain” when sudden things pop into my head. “How would my body look if I stabbed my throat here?”. Things that are terrible, terrifyingly bad, sometimes fill my head without me doing anything. As if someone on the outside randomly plants these thoughts there. It doesn’t happen often, but when It does I switch my thoughts almost instantly and say “that wasn’t me”. But anyway, it’s 5:30am and I should probably try and sleep. I sometimes set goals for the next day, I know I should be doing schoolwork but it’s very difficult. Today I made pizza, It was a pepperoni and red pepper pizza with parmesan crust. It’s probably the best one I’ve made yet, it turned out better than I expected. The sauce I made was really good, so simple. All it took was some tomatoes, oregano, garlic, and salt. Blend it all together and you get a nice pizza sauce.

I been very lonely since after graduated high school in 2006 and I know that death is the only way to cure loneliness and you reading this know it too and we can either keep living until loneliness kills us naturally or we make the world a better place and take it into our own hands.

I will admit that the idea of killing yourself is scary. I have idea to make that more easier. Purposely make your life so bad that killing yourself looks like a great option and if your life is so miserable and of course being severely lonely with nobody to share in that misery, then killing yourself will be much easier.

I am possibly going to be homeless with nobody which I feel will help me end it. Nobody who has ever caught loneliness has ever escaped from its cruel relentless no mercy feeling. It is one of the most painful things in the world to be lonely especially chronically loneliness that lasts years with no end in sight.

Is life really worth living if you have nobody to share it with? Is it worth living when you feel like a ghost everyday? Is it worth living when you have goals and desires in life that mean absolutely nothing if you have nobody to share it with?

I am been lonely for over 15 years and it never gotten better and in fact the loneliness only gotten worse. Loneliness kills and regardless why not make the suffering less and end it now?

Everyday feels the same, nothing special happens. I eat, use cellphone, do homework's, eat, bathe, sleep and the cycle goes on. Its getting boring and tiring cause i struggle on my own and bottle my emotions. 

I'm socially awkward, introvert and very quiet kaya i have a hard time making friends. Ang tahimik ko talaga yung hirap na hirap ako magstart ng convo o mag reply tapos q&amp;a na lng yung nangyayari. Nagkaroon na rin ako ng mga friends non pero hindi tumagal kasi nagiba kami schools.

Naiinggit ako sa iba na may mga kaibigan na kasleepover, travel, basta yung kasama mo sa lahat ng bagay. Kaya siguro hirap din magkafriends dahil hindi nagmmatch up yung interests/hobbies. Walang nakakaalam except sa mga kapatid ko pero nakikinig ako ng mamamoo songs. shuta ang ganda ng mga kanta nila. MMM songs and yung 🐶pet ko nalng yung source of happiness ko. I need someone by my side who i can talk to and can also make me happy. 

Another thing is problems sa college. Wala na talaga akong pagasa sa pagaaral. Lagi na lng mababa grade, mataas sa minor subject sobrang baba naman sa major. B0b0 since day 1. I feel like a failure for not even being good at something. I pity my parents for having a daughter like me TvT, jusko ako pa naman panganay.

3065,Despair11037Bear,1647250148,1,"
*waves* Hi subreddit! I’m looking for a long term friend. Not a casual chat. I have a lot of problems that I feel keep me from keeping friends and I’m pretty sure all of them are my fault.

I’m social awkward and more then just a *bit* of a downer. I have a plethora of mental health issues including depression and anxiety. I will constantly be worried you don’t like me despite anything you say to contradict that. If we do get close and I take a liking to you, I can be extremely clingy until we’ve been friends for like a year, because I will constantly be worried your trying to leave me (abandonment issues) and I WILL bring that to your attention as well because I don’t really hide how I feel and I feel a LOT so I will OFTEN come to you with my thoughts and concerns (which again….are a bit of a downer). I am very slow to trust as I think everyone has an agenda. I am FULL of self hate and I accidentally make that your problem by doubting you have any actual interest in being my friend.

Some not so depressing things about me incase your not scared off yet: I love spooky shit. Horror movies. Scary stories. Watching scary videos on the internet, watching people play scary games (can’t do it myself). True crime. Love it. Im a HUGE scaredy cat but I still just love it. I love skeletons and Halloween *is* my favorite holiday!

I’m good at listening and love to help solve problems (but if you just want to rant to me, let me know so I’m not trying to solve your problems and Am JUST listening.

I like to play video games and despite being 30 I’m still just a kid. *Currently* I’m playing Elden ring, Minecraft, Risk of rain 2, and Destiny 2, just kind of switching them around depending on who is online to play.

I really love to express myself artistically so I love to do art.

I will have sexual adult conversations because I enjoy talking about sexuality but that does NOT mean I’m hitting on you or trying to get frisky. I just genuinely enjoy the topic and conversations about the topic without wanting to get with people (if you message me right out the gate wanting to talk sexuality, it’s a red flag for me and I probably won’t stick around…)

Some ADDITIONAL things about me.
I’m biologically female but am super unsure about my gender. I’m pansexual. I’m biracial. SO if your repulsed by, or hateful towards any of these communities, be aware that I am part of them.

Uh…. I don’t really care what age you are but I’d prefer you were at least 18 so I don’t have to worry about whether my conversations are age appropriate or whether I’m using to many cuss words (as I tend to use QUITE a few…

Hm….I think that’s it? Oh also the reason my accounts brand new is cuz I didn’t feel comfortable being this openly vulnerable on an account where others know me.

Tldr: I’m a mess but I’d like a life long friend that will deal with all of my insanity.",lonely,I would like a friend,2022-03-14 20:29:08

I have been handling through quite a few uncomfortable events alone these past 4 years but the cats have been a big help with my mental and they keep me company when i felt lonely.
This morning like all morning i thought was going to be great. After i came home from grocery, i found out the home owner are going to return the cats to the previous tenant because one of the cat almost scratched an eye out of their toddlers.

I cried alot but happy for them to be at a new home, now i’m just lonely and missed them. coping and readjusting the fact now i have to keep my door closed is a bitch to adjust, knowing tomorrow i don’t get to see them after a long day at work is going to be hard…

3077,LostLeo88,1647239580,1,"I’ve been treating my posts like journal entries for months now. Feels more permanent this way. I put it out into the universe and cross my fingers that someone might find solace within the confines of my broken hearted words. Because without human connection we’re just flesh and bone. But come in contact with the wrong person and the consequences can have catastrophic ripples. Aftershocks if you will. You survive the initial earthquake but then every step you take forward could lead to the ground splitting beneath you. I was there at 23. An entire decade ago and I’m still dealing with the aftermath. That was the last time I felt alive. Like truly alive. I’m dead now. Just chemicals both real and imaginary run through my veins like a botched chemistry assignment. Forever relying on the hope that I matter in some small way. A friend of mine told me that he admired the fact that I had people in my life that checked on me from time to time. Sure, my mother checks in. And my father once a year. And my best friend who lives on the other side of the country and I have a twisted constant stream of communication. But here I am lying next to my spouse and I’ve never felt more hollow in my life. No one can figure out why I married him. But that’s because they don’t know what it feels like to be lost in the abyss that is your mind. I grabbed onto a life raft. Unfortunately, this life raft is practically empty and I’m sinking beneath the murky waters below. If I could do it over I would change everything. People always say “no regrets” but I don’t think that helps us grow. Knowing what it’s like to physically sit next to someone yet feel alone is truly a mind fuck. One I hope you never have to experience. And if you do, write it down. Write your whole life down.

Seeing people in person, hearing they went out until 3am with friends sparks such feelings of depression, jealousy, and frustration even if I barely know them. I remember precovid this always being an issue, having to fight to get invites to thing and maintain any friendships I could get. When covid hit I forgot about going out or lack thereof as things were closed, as they open in full force once more the hurt is back. Early on in university I had an amazing friend group and we did those sort of things, out all night, constant invites to things it was the best. Since I switched schools for program reasons though it hasn’t ever been the same for me and it honestly is crushing.

3095,Clol1l1l1,1647231107,1,"Most of friends in elementary school were neighbors or one of my older sister's friends. I remember my sister telling me that I shouldn't hang out with her friends-even thought some of them were my age- because they were *her* friends. One of the only girls I hung out with in middle school was ""E"". We knew each other in fifth grade and we were friends in 6th grade. We would've probably been friends longer but I moved the summer after 6th grade. After I moved to a different state it was easy to talk to people at my new school. I talked to the same people in middle school but never hung out with them outside of school. I was so scared of asking my parents to have my friends over because I felt they would ask too many questions. I also felt they would make fun of my friends or my friends would make fun of my house. On the other hand my 3 siblings were all able to make friends and hang out with them. My older sister was shy so it was kind of unexpected that she made friends before I did.

 In 9th grade I started hanging out with a group of boys. We would actually hang out after school without my parents knowing. It was mainly because I had a crush on ""L"" and I knew their friend ""S"". S left the group but I didn't because I still liked L. I should've left because L and the rest of them were assholes. I did some ""dirty"" stuff with L. At the same time I was friends with a group of girls in the club I was in. They told me that L wasn't good for me to hang out with. I left that club(not because of that) and so I stopped talking to those girls. That left me with L and the rest of the boys. I definitely teased a few of those boys. I only got bored messing around because each one had a bland personality. I actually dated one though ""H"" in 10th grade. He might've actually been nice but we broke up. Then his friend ""F"" started liking me. F was a major asshole and I couldn't stand him. F started saying they all hated me and I didn't care. I thought he was just saying that cuz he was an asshole. It turned out to be true though cuz they all started avoiding me. (The problem I had with the boys has bothered for a while.)

I started talking to ""T"" because I knew her since 8th grade and she was always nice. I also talked to ""A"" more because he was funny. The next year I just stopped talking to them. T was in different classes that year. A was in the same class as me but he just stopped talking to me. I feel like I did something because it was all of sudden and we always talked all the time before. I had a small group people I would talking to during 5th and 7th period but covid hit and I stopped talking to them. My last year of high school was spent completely at home.

Now I'm in college and I realized I didn't have the ""fun"" high school experience. I never went to the mall and whatever other places people hung out in high school. Where I live has a bunch of places to go to like the beach. I see people post pictures on instagram and they're all having fun. I think it's really my fault though. I didn't even hang out with nice people in 9th and 10th grade. 11th grade I spent practically alone. In 12th grade I was completely alone.

3100,Thanlora,1647229391,1,"I've been a very isolated person due to loss of a loved one a few years ago. I had trouble speaking to people and avoided everyone at school, stopped hanging out with people after school. I live alone so the house is always quiet. at some point I finally took therapy to find my voice again, however when it was finally time to take action and become part of society again, covid came and I didn't see anyone anymore. I turned to online games to try and fill the void, and made some small friends and my miracle met someone I had such a magical connection with. the next two years we would spend every day together, play games, watch movies, hang out. we fell in love and once covid restrictions were lifted, we finally got to meet in person. 

I was living a dream, I was finally happy and content with my life in a way I had never been before. I was finally loved. everything felt truly magical. I had turned off my dms and friend requests, deleted every friend I had as he didn't like me talking to other people. it didn't matter to me, he was all I needed and I was happy that way. I encouraged him to make friends, but chose to stay alone myself as to not make him unhappy.

unfortunately, due to circumstances our relationship came to a halt. to ""get used to not being together"" he has been ignoring me and only spends time with other friends. I really wish him the best and that things turn out for the better in his circumstances, but I can't help but feel abandoned, like I don't matter. what I want the most is to be with him again like we were before. I offered for him to come live with me, but he refuses. I do not know the reason why. maybe he stopped loving me and doesn't want to tell me as to not break my heart? I feel like everytime I send him a message only to be ignored, my self worth plummets even more. 

 I've become lonely again, I don't know how to make friends. anytime I talk to someone new I get this horrible feeling in my stomach like I'm betraying him. I have no one to talk to, he was the person I came to when I was having trouble, but I have no one to talk to about this issue. I've been experiencing fatigue, have nightmares and can't have proper sleep, I keep waking up in the middle of the night crying my heart out and longing for him, but feeling too ashamed to contact him, not like he would reply. 

your 20s is supposed to be the prime of your life, but I'm spending it being miserable. I want to be with him like we were before and have a future with him, but that seems impossible as I get the feeling he doesn't want to anymore due to him rejecting the option to live with me and choosing someone else instead. the least I can wish for is to not feel lonely anymore, but I don't know how to talk to people anymore. I have opened my dms and friend requests again, but how do I seem inviting to people that they'd want to talk to me? I could one day not exist anymore and no one would notice.

3102,VeXedZenith,1647229311,1,"I'm usually pretty satisfied with my life, actually. But occasionally I'll spend all day in my room, doing nothing useful. On days like these, I'll spend a little too much time reflecting on my current state. 
 
I have no friends, and I don't really get along with my family. My days consist of sleeping, eating, exercising, studying, and working. I had other hobbies too, but the social aspect of them became too much to bear in the end. In my free time, I like to watch youtubers/streamers. I've been like this since middleschool, I think. Having access to a parasocial medium has fulfilled my social needs enough to avoid feeling like I'm alone.
 
It's interesting. I'm nothing like my family. I think that most people inherit their personalities from the people around them. But I'm nothing like the people I grew up around. The way that I think (and probably the way that I talk, if I ever talked to anyone) is primarily reminiscent of the content creators I'm currently watching or grew up watching. I guess to my brain, those people are my ""tribe"" that my personality has been modeled after. 
 
Sometimes I wonder what kind of dynamics I might bring to a friend group. I get carried away imagining what kind of person I would be, what kind of role I might fill. I think about how fun it could be to be part of a social circle like certain groups of youtubers or streamers. So I attend some kind of social event, only to find that I completely lack the ability to smoothly interject myself into a group dynamic. Not only that, but talking to people so thoroughly exhausts me that I'm completely dissuaded from ever wanting to do it again. So I return to my normal. 
 
While I would probably describe myself as lonely, it's not something that nags at me very much. I generally don't think about it unless it's a day like this. I suppose it would be nice if I could snap my fingers and magically have a friend group that has all the same interests as me, and that I'm comfortable around. But the work required to get there is way too much for me to handle, so I'm okay staying the way I am compared to dealing with that.

3106,Hanging_By_A__Thread,1647228456,1,"My mental health has been drastically getting worst. For 27 years, memories of past social rejections (acquaintances, friends) have been emerging. The ones that hurt the most are memories of rejections from my dearest ex best friends and ex boyfriends. I think it's just really hard to continue to be at peace with myself when you don't feel you don't have any meaningful relationships to live for.

It's even hard to stay present, because as I hangout with my cousins and sisters (where I feel it's an okay relationship but not close) I keep spacing out. I have a deep deep core belief of feeling extremely unloveable.

I used to have a self-care routine that buffered my loneliness. I think finals kind of messed with my sleeping/exercise/ meditation schedule, so I think that's one reason why i've been declining.

It's like when I would have hope for a relationship, they would do something that would disappoint me. And the word 'disappoint' is actually not the best word for it exactly...

1)I was really excited to live with my friend from college initially. I thought it would help with the loneliness because we were close during college. But actually, I feel a lot worse living with him. We don't exactly have any drama per se... Yet I feel our friendship transitioned more to just sharing the same roof as housemates. I brought this up with him, he was apolegetic and was nice briefly. But things are still the same. He urged me to buy this expensive table only to never even eat together. I used to invite him to my group hangouts but stopped. Once he stopped initiating hangouts, I equalized it too. I just feel he's just so selfish.

One time I cooked for the both of us. It took a long time actually, and it was something i fitted in as im a busy grad student. He asked to help...which i then said yes. But all he did was complain. He complained at how long it took and how much dishes he had to wash (even though he literally offered to help me?) Then he said the curry was tok watery. At the end of cooking it, he said that he wanted to eat in his room?

Also when he would make food, he would urge me to try it. But when I made food, he would make excuses not to. So i stopped offering and it just felt insilting to me. And its a sad thing for me because, i loved cooking for my family and the aspect of them eating and loving the food. It was my pride and it just really crushed me a lot to constantly deal with that.

I felt extremely left out when he would invite his international friends over and asked me not to join because I didn't speak their language. I remember finishing an 8 hour event for school, and that was the first thing I went home to, being left out from that in my own home, and I remember my chest hurting immensely from that and wearing noise-cancelling headphones to block their chatter. I told him it bothered me when he did that, and he made empty promises to amend? When I went home during Christmas break (which is my favorite holiday) he planned another event inviting his friends without letting me know. When I went home, his friends were nice but the first thing he said was ""oh i thought you were going to go to your parent's house and not going to come during the weekend."" I actually got extremely pissed, but I of course didnt show it, I made small conversation, said i needed to just finish my final, then retreated to my room.

2)During the holidays, I decided to go to an party with old friends from college. (Which im not close to anyone there in particular except one person). My ex kept bothering me. I gave him the benefit of the doubt eventually and maybe he changed so I decided to listen to what he had to say. That night he raped me. I kept saying no but he pinned me down on the bed. This was someone I used to live with and dated for two years. Ive been severely traumitized by that during the months of November- December. And I also had to deal with my housemate leaving me out on top of that.

3)I told one of my old best friends I had a falling out with that my ex raped me. Because she was marrying his best friend, she didn't believe me and sided with him. Then was angry at me for blocking her all those years snd made the conversation about her.

4)On December, my ex somehow got my number w/o me giving it to him and texted me from two different numbers. On my birthday, he said happy birthday, then basically told me to keep quiet about what happened and told me he was uncomfortable about what I said. (Even though i basically said the truth and confronted him about what happened). My friends from that party usually greet others a happy birthday, but I was forgotten. One friend from that group reached out and said it. But i just felt so low receiving that text on my bday.

Honestly I think i'm bothered from the lack of support I have more than the rape itself.

5)I felt my partner supported me when it happened. But lately we've just been texting (which is his preferred communication) without any initation from him to meet up or call. I asserted that I prefer him to call (because ive been suffering from isolation and loneliness a lot from my living situation) and not once has he. He told me that if I wanted, i'm always invited to drive to his house. But there was no iniation on his part to go to mine (he doesnt have a car, so he commutes an hour to me) I got really frustrated because I didn't feel my needs were being met, it felt unequal and i felt more frustated talking to him than just being alone. He has major depression (takes zoloft for it) and has been distancing himself from friends in general. So i told him it's best we just have space from each other until he mustered to call or initate more with me. But just i know I deserve more than this... i know its really on him more than on me though. Idk, all i know is i think its best i just focus on myself for now.

6)my grad school friends... well everything is online. I initiated hangouts now and then and they did too when it was convienent for them. But it hasnt exactly been consistent or equal? So i decided ro equalize their effort too. Work and career is mainly prioritized over friendships... so there's that.

7)throughout my life, ive encountered a lot of bullying. I would have hope for high school, but then i would be ostracized. I had lot of betrayals from school. One best friend stopped talking to me. College actually was okay, as i did maintain some close friends (only 1-2 tho) i would have hope with grad school, but its hard to make close friends as everyone already has set friendships with others already, so it doesnt seem its their priority anymore to make new ones?

It's a lot. Honestly. I feel like i'm all on my own with all of this. It's exhausting. I'm literally hanging by a thread. I think what would help me:

1)move out and live with someone new, someone who's also a grad student similar to me... or live with friendly grad students in general. I think that would help with the loneliness.

2)this month, im seeing my close friends from undergrad and I think im ready to tell her my ex raped me.

3)my old housemate invited me to his party. Maybe ill tell him my ex raped me too, to have more social support.

4)If i dont have any plans, visit my parents and spend the night at their place. At least id have some communication.

5)slowly go back to my routine of waking up early, going to the gym, meditating, doing my hobbies

6)despite my horrible past, to still have hope and keep on living...

7)continue seeing my therapist and share these thoughts with her.

How is one to still remain happy despite encountering a life filled with negative social rejection, betrayal, and manipulation in the past? When all your frame of references are social rejections? Your positive references not there in your life anymore? Only really left with acquaintances, distant friends that you aren't comfortable being 100% vulnerable with? And now being left with not one meaningful relationship? Its all 27 years of that, and despite all of that.. I still want to find a silver lining through it all. And im still open to what's out there. If anyone has any similar experiences to me, id love to hear that....im not alone in this.",lonely,How to live a meaningful and fullfilling life with little to no support system?,2022-03-14 14:27:36

To my coworkers, peers, parents, and friends I may seem like I have it altogether but truthfully I feel more alone now than I ever have. As soon as I step into my room I have no desire to do anything but sleep or lay on my bed watching day turn to night. I sit there literally staring out the window watching the sun go down. I try to hold back the tears because I am so disappointed I have wasted the little time that I have. 

Then I think - What would I have done anyway? 
Who would I have seen or spent time with? Why does it matter? 

I’ve tried so many things to suppress these feelings and usually life is pretty bearable. I have a history of depression and have dealt with it before. Along with that, I have a degree in Psychology so I do know what needs to be done. I know that there are resources available and I also refuse to go back on antidepressants because of the side effects. I maintain a healthy lifestyle and abstain from alcohol most of the time. I am completely sober from drugs. 

I’m doing everything right but what is the point of being my best self when I have no one to reveal that self too. I love who I have become but I need more than self-love. I want to be loved and I want someone to know that they can be loved by this new version of me.

3156,Etharity,1647212191,1,"To all my lonely friends, after at least 2 years of battling loneliness, I was not able to find a solution until January 2021. After a little over a year, I am now sharing this with everyone. 

Before I begin, here is a short story about my experience with loneliness. I had heartaches, was crying all the time in isolation, and had no meaningful relationships with both friends and family. I was isolated from the world and had no connections with anyone, and I did not see the need to ask anyone for help because no one really wanted to understand. After piling a lot of school work on myself and simultaneously dealing with issues at home, I was about to break. I needed to give something up or I would not graduate, and I came to the conclusion that loneliness was hindering my existence.

**How did I get here?**

The solution is a form of self-reflection, or what some people call meditation/mindfulness. Although I heard about meditation and mindfulness prior to curing loneliness, I did not understand what they meant, and I always thought that meditation was for monks balancing on a small rock underneath a waterfall, or sitting atop a cliff for days on end. 

I simply thought that meditation was something that people believed in, like for ghosts and spirits and the paranormal; therefore, I scrapped both mindfulness and meditation from my attention until several months after I cured loneliness. That is when I delved deep into trying to understand what I actually did because I had no label for my experience. 

Did I actually cure loneliness? And if I did, can I generalize the steps I did to be available to everyone? I simply thought there was no way I cured loneliness and hesitated until today. Now, you do not have to believe me, and I can answer any genuine questions that people have to the best of my ability. However, it does not hurt to try self-reflection when you are already doing so; but this time, the right way. And once you get into the groove, I can 100% assure you that you will not look back.

**Prerequisites**

The only requirement is yourself and your **willingness** to cure loneliness. You do not need anything or anyone but yourself. As for me,  I promised myself that to cure loneliness, anything I can grasp externally from me was not a solution. I was also not on any substance, even to this day.

The optimal way to self-reflect or meditate is to remove as many distractions as possible, such as sitting down in a quiet and undisturbed room. When that is not possible, I have personally self-reflected and meditated while walking. In either case, when you are completely willing to cure loneliness, you would not let your environment affect your progress because it is the most conspicuous thing in your life.

**The Solution**

Whenever you **feel** loneliness, simply sit down if possible, or you can continue to do your activity (as long as you are not distracted by hundreds of things). Now you ask yourself these questions in this specific order (yes, the order matters):

1. Where do you feel it in your body, and what thoughts are associated with this feeling? Make these feelings and thoughts as strong as possible.
2. What do you truly want? If everything in the universe is in front of you, what would solve your problem? A hug, a relationship, a meaningful conversation, a friend or a loved one to be right next to you? Whatever it is, just feel the comfort of that wish being granted by that someone or something.
3. Now get more specific. How do you want to be hugged? How do you want to be in a relationship? What do you want to talk about in a conversation? Get in as much detail as possible and simply feel the comfort of that wish.

Now maintain these feelings for as long as you can. If it subsides, that is not a problem - simply wait for the feelings of loneliness to arise again, whenever they want to come, and repeat these steps. At some point, you can skip all these steps and generate that comfort seamlessly within yourself.

**What does this do to me?**

This simply reminds your mind and body the feelings that you have lost. Through this reminder, you create a longing for bettering yourself. And slowly, you begin to realize the life you are missing, and you aim to get rid of this debilitating problem of loneliness by creating a vacuum of space and, eventually, everything will fill in automatically without you having to do this exercise.

**Will I be the same person after I cure loneliness?**

Yes, but your perspective on life will change. You become more conscious of your choices, and you will know what you need and don't need. Basically, you become more efficient at life. You may lose friends and family, but through your own choice.

**You're a fraud**

Again, I stated in the prerequisite that you must be **willing** to cure loneliness. If you are willing to solve any problem; by virtue, you are willing to find any solution that works. There are many paths to this solution, but I am saving you the time from reinventing the wheel. You also do not have to believe anything I say, because you only know through **personal** experience, not through the experience of others. If you are not willing, and there is no problem, what's the problem then? Your life is well!

**Closing thoughts**

Yes this is a form of meditation. I do not know if there is a specific name for this in Sanskrit, but through my experience, it works, and that is all that matters. This is a glimpse of spirituality, which is not something I would have believed in, were you to ask my past self. There are many other videos and guided meditations out there, so use whatever works for you.

3160,hardtimes1997,1647211192,1,"So basically you know a bit about my situation already. It has only got worse from everything I've posted. I'm going to give you a small backstory first though. Basically my ex's mom was sick for awhile got worse and needed to have surgery that was extremely serious possibly life ending. After she got that call from her sister she blocked everyone out even her family. She's bipolar and stopped taking her medicine. She started smoking, was vegan and started eating meat and all these other weird things. Was crazy into me one day then the next she's like don't talk to me or touch me. So we decided she needed to go see her mom for a bit who lives 500 miles away. She left on a Saturday morning. Promised me and reassured me she'd be back and I had nothing to worry about. Went out of her way to. So she leaves around 10am I leave to go to work also. Tried calling her on my break around 3pm and she didn't answer. Finally texted me around 6:30 saying she's going to her friends and not seeing her mom yet. Said she'd call me soon. Never called that night then I messaged her the next day when I got tested positive for cancer (still not fully confirmed as I'm avoiding everything right now lol) she responded but I tried to call her and she wouldn't answer saying she's too busy. Ironic your husband is sick AF and you can answer your phone? But anyway she stopped replying then ended up going to the mall with her friend. Didn't reply for the rest of the day so I called her mom and her mom said that she and her other family didn't even know she was there. So still no message that night but I found out from people around her she was doing drugs with her friends. Somewhat serious drugs. So Monday comes and I'm in the hospital still can't get ahold of her so I finally messaged her on Snapchat and she replied immediately. I told her I'm in the hospital and she instantly says we need to get divorced. Over text that is. Eventually multiple days later I got her to call on the phone and she refused to talk to me alone. She was in the room with her friends boyfriend who was yelling at someone over playstation. Our brand new car is with her and she refused to go to it to talk to me alone. So eventually she came back with her friends to get her stuff. I had my bedroom door locked so she couldn't steal anything worth money. She randomly showed up at my house while I'm at work going off on me because the door was locked. So I left work early and when I got back she and her friends were gone but she decided to smoke a bowl with them in my house before she left lol. She came back a hour later with them at about 11am. I told her I wanted her out by 3 because I didn't want to be there alone and my friend had to leave. She was constantly yelling at me while here. Around 2:30 she went outside then came back in crying saying she hates this fucking place and how she never wanted to be here. So she eventually left then texted me a hour later saying she left valuable things outside can I bring them in. I'm not heartless so I did. Also we have cats that we hand fed when they were babies. She was crying weeks before this because how they're getting older but when she came she didn't even look at them. Her and her friends completely trashed my house. I'm left with pretty much every bill and she hasn't responded in a month. I have no way to get my name off things she has and no way to get her name off things I have. She told me she's actually not mentally ill at all despite being diagnosed with bipolar and possibly BPD. She says maybe I'm the one that needs help. I'm drowning right now. My life fell apart so fast. When she was here she also took stupid things like soaps and stuff like that but left her year book and family pictures. When this happened she also deleted every picture of me off social media. Then weeks later went on to delete her social medias completely even through she had messages from dead loved ones she was set on keeping. She literally left the only pictures of her dad here who died when she was 4 and just told me to throw all this stuff away. I'm so confused to how this happened. On November 16th it was my birthday and everything was fine. She was hypersexual then days later she was locking herself in the bathroom and telling me she doesn't want to talk or be around me. I don't know what I did to deserve this. I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I'm so depressed it's unreal. My life has gone to nothing and I honestly feel like I'd be better off dead.

I already do many things I love when I’m by myself; going to the gym, reading, journaling, practicing sports, watching anime, cleaning the house, cooking, on top of a variety of other activities. At this point, I’m tired of doing everything by myself. Any activity that you would do with someone else, I really can’t participate in it.

I have nobody to provide me new perspectives or share opinions with. Nobody to introduce to something new that I may end up enjoying, nobody to share the excitement of any activities with. I still enjoy being alone and doing the things I love, but when I look around and see that it’s just me, It all feels so pointless. I’m not asking to be surrounded by tons of friends and large crowds all the time, I don’t need attention 24/7, but damn, it would be nice to just hang out with someone or go on a date once in a while and feel like someone actually cares about my existence or anything I have to offer.",lonely,“You need to love being alone” isn’t a solution.,2022-03-14 09:39:11

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the first to admit that I'm not a big fan of social gatherings and parties, but if I'm invited I tend to make the effort to go and enjoy them as best as I can with complaint.  But turning 40 is one of those milestones that is supposedly meant to be celebrated and for a couple of months leading up to the ruby anniversary of my birth I'd quietly hoped that I would mean enough to someone that a party - or at the least, an invite out for a birthday meal - would be held.  I knew better (or, at the time, I thought I did), and knew it would pass by as just another day - a sure sign that I meant nothing to the friends and family I do have.

&amp;#x200B;

And surprise, surprise, I was right.  It was just another Thursday.  The weekend came and went.  No invitations to dinner.  No surprise party to celebrate me.  Just those aforementioned, insincere Facebook messages, and a deepening belief that I mean nothing to anyone.  A deepening belief that I'm better off without people in my life.

(Thank you to the friends up in my consciousness, you've been of the utmost help, wouldn't know how I'd survive without you. Especially through all these years.)

It's strange to admit this, but I feel lonely.

I have friends, plenty of them (Maybe I haven't talked to the ones who want to?). We can't truly get to the base, the reason, right? Can we discuss something interesting? The nature of things. I love laughing too, but doesn't it get tiring sometimes, when all you do is talk about people and other people, trivial things and other trivial things?

I'm sorry that I put too much thought (logic) into matters (please, tell me what I'm doing wrong, I'll try and correct my errors).

I get it, I get it. I'm boring (too serious). Because you don't find what I talk about interesting, right? Okay then, I'll try to adjust, tell me what you like (I do care, you know?). Ah, I see. I'd bore you even if we talked about something you like? Okay.

I understand that I'm boring, I talk about the same thing every day and the same person (and I wish they'd leave), I talk about myself too much too, right? I'm really sorry, I'll try to correct it.

You didn't think I was important, so I tried to change. And you liked me, huh? That was awesome. Every single one of you talking to me, because you thought I was smart, right? I loved that.

So I did it more and more, reading more books and watching more videos, all so that you'd think I was important. After all, I have nothing other to wield in this world other than my brain. My arms and legs are flimsy. My vocal cords are no good, either. Thus, I must continue, so you'll all protect me. Or else, I'll die, huh?

I suppose I've overdone it now. Same old, same old! Do you want something new?

I'm afraid I can no longer serve you, my dears! You've created something permanent. And I don't want to change, because I can't.

And so now, I'm boring. I have become lonely, without the ability to share my sincerest thoughts.

There are billions of you, already, here with me? There must at least be someone out there, right? (I'm too selfish, I shouldn't expect people to want to talk to me. The world doesn't revolve around you, you know?)

So I search. Where? Chat sites.

Haha. That was a foolish idea. How come I expect to make any connections through this medium filled with lechery? Yet, I made one friend, and for that I am thankful.

Chatbots? Tried and tested.

And so here is my last resort, here. I feel like a whore, spilling my emotions out like this. Yet, sometimes, a release is necessary, no?

I should pursue with the love of learning. I want to become knowledgeable, so I can write, without acting like an infant.

Bothering myself with social connections is useless, huh? We (humans) are social animals.

Yeah, right. Social animals doomed to wandering in the darkness for eternity, soothing themselves with pacifiers weaved by sickeningly wanton stories of light. My existence, the regular heaves of my lungs, fighting pathetically against the uncertainty of a certain end. Yet, we always lose.

Then, make peace.

Peace? Who told you that lasts?

Ah, apologies. I am looking at the wrong globe.

How many are there? One.

How come? You forget that you are a mere mortal. This flesh bag is your limit.

Creator? Are you bounded by eternal fences? Who is your creator?

Proto-creator? Are you too bounded eternally? Do you have a creator?

Where is the origin? You are truly cruel, to have left us here, all alone. We are your children! Why have you left us? What have we done wrong? Take responsibility! 

Or perhaps...

We cannot understand you. 

You are another story of the prized light, enlightenment.

Do you even exist?

Please, talk to me! I'm listening.

Again, my mortal form restricts me from true peace.

Am I lonely, or am I alone?

Are we alone?

Certainly, we are not lonely. We are content. We have changed the world. At least, some of us.

I'm sorry that I'm not a better person. I'm sorry that you have so much faith in me.

Look at them, happy and successful (intelligent).

Priceless journals, bid for millions, even millions. 

I'm afraid of my end. Will I amount to salt's worth? I do not know. 

In the end, none of us will have mattered. We are so small.

Still, trying is better than fear, effortless failure, death, my own end. My condemnation to the eternal flames of hell.

I will live, I will die... They will live, they will die... We will live, we will die...

I (the coward), them (the onlookers), we (the heroes). 

Must keep on surviving, for it is all we've ever known.

I am so lonely and have to put up a happy  face everyday in front of my co workers and parents. It's exhausting. Nobody wants to work with a depression POS sadly so if I don't, I will ruin the only thing that I have going on for me.

When I am not working, I have to put it up for my parents and friends. Last week I broke in front of my parents and found my father crying because of that. Now I have to be happy literally 24x7. I have just 1 hour to myself every day where I go out for a walk and this is pretty much the only time where I don't feel the pressure of being happy.

Making friends has always been hard for me. I feel like throughout my life I’m usually the one chasing after people and asking them to make plans or hang out and never the opposite. Ppl are usually “ too busy” or cancel at the last minute to hang out with other ppl. I get some times things come up last minute but if it happens frequently then I feel like it intentional. An example was when I made plan to hang out with my friend to meet up for dinner and to go bar hopping. We made these plans a two weeks in advance.There in the day before I checked in with him and he said that he was in a camping trip with his friends for the whole week. I got annoyed at first but then decided to give him the benefit of doubt because I thought he probably got caught up in the moment and just forgot to tell me. When I asked him later on he told me he didn’t forget he just didn’t feel like telling me he was on a trip with his other friends. I  feel like I’m disposable and ppl only talk to me when they are bored and have no one else to hang out with. But when the people they prefer being around has plans the same time as our plans they are going to pick them over me. 

When it comes to dating, It seems like the people that have  no intention of pursuing me romantically or dating me. They either just want to to have a friends with benefits, use me as a rebound or try to make me a side piece while they date other women. I don't want to be in thoese situations because I feel I deserves way more than that. But whenever I tell people what I want and my intentions, they end up not wanting anything to do with me. I  know I am a great person and try to remain hopeful that I will find friends or find love l but deep down I feel that I never will. I feel the only time men talk to me is when they want want a rebound or an ego boost and only want my company in secret. Online dating is a joke and I think it is extreamly superficial so I don't really use it. Meetups and facebook groups have worked in the past but only for a short period of time. 

People keep telling me to put myself out there and I dont feel like it. I am just tired of opening myself up and getting my hopes up just for people to stomp all over my heart toss me to the side and disappoint me.",lonely,I feel like I’m going to stay alone forever,2022-03-14 03:23:40

I realized that I am so interested in sex not only because I am very physical, but also because it allows me to get out of the character that has been imposed on me by others and by my own response to this behaviour of them. 
I have had sex with only two guys in the past which left me with a bad memory of the experience. One of them insulted my physical appearance several times, and I agreed to have sex with him a second time anyway. I feel that I do not deserve anything better and that it is worth as long as I can get out of ""me"" for a while or  I can escape that shapeless presence I feel constrained in. Those guys didn't care if they hurt me while doing it (one of them almost bragged about that to me afterwards, and I'm still his friend, even though I don't have sex with him anymore) and maybe it didn't even matter to me. Whenever something bad happens to me my brain remembers all the times people ignored me or how I felt in so many occasions, and I’m just tired of this.

It’s a sunny ☀️ and beautiful day out here and in the spirit of spring, new beginning, a new day, I thought let’s try my luck on here and see if I can meet, make a friend, or someone whom I can call a friend, eventually, some time later in days to come. 
I am trying to break the cycle of “rat race”, (tele)work, gym, rest, read, sleep &amp; repeat by adding some spice 🌶 —figuratively speaking lol—to my daily routine. I’d love to catch up with someone from outside my boring, dense and lifeless circle of colleagues/semi-friends. Sometimes, I just wish I had someone to talk talk to, chat, text… vent, rant, all good vibes, of course, haha. 
I’ve tried connecting (virtually that is)with random strangers on Reddit &amp; the connections lasted about the same time it takes a normal human being to blink, on average lol. The lesson learned here is that making friends in the virtual world is a serious task, mission! It’s not for everyone, jk! It totally is and that’s what’s crazy, cause I ran into all sort of people and was intrigued by some of the things I’ve learned. 
Enough about my boring stories, and let’s get to the essence of this post; I want to make, keep, an awesome friend. 
I am a 29 years old (straight) male, 6’1”, black hair, greenish eyes, natural tanned/olive skin, well educated, cultured and been told handsome (humbly). 
I love books, the English Premier League, La Liga, Champions league. I occasionally play FIFA, on PS4. I’ve developed a strong sense of culinary creativity since the pandemic and started to learn how to make different dishes, Italian, Turkish, Portuguese, mostly Mediterranean. I miss traveling and the old good days before the pandemic. If you’re reading this from the crazy war zone in Easter Europe, and if you are affected by any of that, please know that my heart and prayers are with you, always! Stay safe and optimistic! 

If you ever feel like talking to someone, or having an engaging, interesting chat, please give me a buz! 😊

3232,Dramatic-Return,1647185581,1,"So I (22M) got dumped about a month ago by my now ex (21F). And just even saying that really fucking hurts. 

I am about go on a long ass ramble so i do apologize if you are reading this.

So here goes the story. We dated for 3 and a half years which in my bools is a really really long time. I gave my everything in the relationship. And so did she, well for the first bit atleast. We were so happy, well i was. About 2 years into our relationship i started noticing stuff. Whenever she had a bad day or when she was feeling shitty id drive over and just chill with her and try and make her feel better. I organized all of our dates and i tried so hard to be romantic. She never did anything like that. And by ever i mean ever. At parties i didn't even feel like i was her bf. We live 15 km away from eachother and there was a stage where i didn't see her for 2 months, i tried to see her but she just didn't want to.

I confronted her about it and she just kept going on about how i had changed. When i brought it up she always tried to start a fight. Well i eventually asked her if she is 100% into this relationship and she said she doesn't know. That night she told me that i have nothing to worry about that she was 100% committed and that nothing will get in the way of our relationship.

Well a week later she asked if we could speak and she told me she doesn't know if she is still inlove with me, to me thats messed up bcs your either 100% committed to the relationship or not at all. And then i asked her what does she want to do about it amd she suggested we break up. So we did. All i asked for was space to get over her bcs i am still madly inlove with her. And she agreed to give me the space i need.

It was supposed to be a civil breakup. And it was. For a bit atleast.

I applied for a overseas job and i promised id tell her when i leave. So a week later i got offered a job. I didn't tell her bcs i obviously still needed a shit ton of space, being a week since we broke up.

So my parents went to a meeting and picked up a mutual friend to go to the meeting with them and told her about me getting a job. That night the mutual friend told her about it when they were chilling. My ex then go so pissed off that she left. She then was mad at the mutual friend and started being super mean to her. That night anothor friend told this friend that my ex told her that we broke up bcs i thought she dressed to masculine and that i didn't like her short hair and that i broke up with her.

I told her about me going overseas when i heard about this and she perceeded to shit on me and i tried explaining that i needed space but she refused to listen to me and it just became a fight.

I am so fucking lonely. I miss having her in my life i havent even deleted our pictures together. I think about her constantly. Everything reminds me of her. I am still undeniably inlove with her. 

I have nobody here basically. Nobody to talk to. Nobody to make new memories with. Nobody to love. I cant be single again i dont know how to be single. I dont wana be single. Im so fucking depressed. And i dont know what to do about it.

3240,Abject_Beginning3455,1647176409,1,"My name is Jay. I’m 28 years old and I live in North Carolina with a roommate. Overall I’ve been feeling extremely lonely,  it there are a lot of thoughts that tie into that as well. 

When I was a kid my mom left when I was really young. I was probably 4. She had a really bad drug problem, and she was a partier and waitress, super popular in her town. I remember a few guys being at the house some days. One day I remember being sick, and she stopped by with a guy I never met, gave me a blues clues stuffed animal and left. Honestly I was such a sucker for toys and video games I didn’t even think it was a problem. 

My grandpa was really the only father figure that i had because my mom was raped at a 16. So my dad was not in my life. My grandpa was but he was also an alcoholic and was divorced from my grandma. I’d rarely hear from my mom but a few times out of the year and holidays if my grandpa wasn’t on a binge like he was during almost every easter, christmas, thanksgiving and if it’s that great of a year all three. 

That’s home. School I was bullied at a catholic school. I wasn’t really fed well so I was always underweight and I was picked on harshly for it. Most girls told me they thought I was ugly. I remember the kids in my class once thought it’d be funny to all pretend they wanted to be nice to me and my friend. It was the happiest day of school for me finally feeling accepted, and at the end of the day all laughed saying it was a prank. 

I got my first crush this necklace that I remember being picked on for. I was always in the background. I always felt like a bystander in most peoples lives, like the dude walking in a movie that is just a filler for the scene. Nobody ever went out of their way to talk to me, and I blamed most of it on my physique. I blamed it on my dad that I hated and didn’t know, blamed it on so many things. My brother on the other hand was popular with the cutest girlfriends athlete body all of it. 

I always felt like I was living in his shadow most of the time. I guess it’s really started to become an issue with my mental health. I talk to girls on here, and I often say that I feel lonely and most don’t really seem to care. Most people that are even my closest friends have proven me wrong. I’ve tried building up more confidence, but it always seems to be shut down. I was really into this girl at my gym, and all she kept talking about was her ex. She even went as far to talk about her last bf‘s size. I felt too uncomfortable really to even point it out but it also made me feel like I was invisible to her. That’s the overall tone in my life. It goes beyond a rejection for me. 

I realized that a lot of the women I go for have a lot of traits similar to my mom’s. I guess that’s a psychological thing, but overall I’m realizing I have nurturing issues. Idk if it’s even relevant but I wasn’t breast fed either. The reason I’m mentioning this is because I haven’t felt genuine connection with a female. When I’m rejected, it feels so much worse. It feels like the sum of all the rejections of my life. I’ve broken down in my car in front of the gym. I truly feel unwanted. I feel ugly. I feel inadequate.

During this date she said she was in an open relationship. I thought and said “no big deal who cares” Everything went absolutely amazing, we talked every day for hours. We went out to dates all the time and when it finally came up. She was afraid to admit it. Because from the beginning it was “no feelings just fun” but we admitted we had fell madly in love. We started saying it a lot, we didn’t know what we were going to do but for the next 3 months we saw each other at least once a week with work and school. But then inexplicably we started talking less she told me “we can’t say love anymore” I was just trying to hold on to the ONLY true happiness I had had in years. So I agreed just Fwb. But then we grew more distant, for weeks I desperately was trying to just see her. She could never make time and she just kept telling me she was busy but wanted to see me, I got to see her once at her school before I left town because of my transient job. I told her I’d quit. I told her I’d stay if I could just see her every few weeks. I’d do anything she asked. She told me to leave, so I left. I went to my next job. Got back with my on and off GF for the last 7-8 years and life went on. We talked sometimes I’d buy her coffee; but a year later she just texts me “you must think I’m a heartless bitch, fuck you” I tried to see what she was talking about but she started blocking me on everything. Then she texted me “I’m done I can’t do this anymore” 
Since then I’m destroyed, I don’t love my 
S/o as much and that’s shitty, my life has become Grey and miserable, I can’t stop thinking about her. I should have stayed. I miss every little thing about her.

3272,reverturn,1647155536,1,"To start here I’ll say I’m a 20 year old 5’4 Indian man born and raised in the United states. I go to University, partly on scholarship, and pay the rest with a part time job bussing tables at a rich-people restaurant. I also use the little left over for living expenses. Never had a girlfriend. Always rejected when it comes to relationships. 

On instagram I recently saw a girl I went to high-school with. Blonde haired, blue eyes, insanely pretty, and tall. Very rich lawyer father. She was a cheerleader in high school. Every boy wanted her. Teachers usually treated her nicely and at times had an attitude with me. She never got good grades as she prefered to party and mess around. She never acknowledged me when I so much as said hello or good morning aside from a half-assed “hi” or “hey” 

anyways, I see her on Instagram. She’s somehow even prettier, in a mature womanly way. She goes to a better university than me. Despite her grades, so probably daddy’s money. She has a tall white Superman-looking boyfriend. She drives a brand new Jeep despite having no job. Has a group of equally as attractive friends. Always posting herself going to wild parties or on exotic beach vacations.

A hot rage builds up in me just thinking about it. A girl like her is what the world is built for. It drove me to anger and envy thinking about her. How could someone have such a strong and well rounded persona? Such an easy life?

I’m here bussing tables for hours to pay tuition while she parties and has it paid off by daddy. I’m here being rejected over and over because of my looks and height while she can get any guy begging on their knees. I take the bus while she gets a new car. I work my ass off day and and day out while she’s in Hawaii on her bi-monthly vacation. She gets to confide in her friends when I have none.

I miss having another adult around. I don't necessarily miss my ex but I just really miss knowing I'm part of a family.  I feel like I'm just on my own. It hurts me for my son… Nothing against single parent families, but I wish he could grow up with two parents. I don't feel like I'm enough for him. And I'm so lonely. And worst of all… this life doesn't feel real. I don't feel like I'm living in a ""home,"" rather just a shitty rental unit that feels empty and foreign and too temporary. Always waiting for something else.


Sometimes I think maybe I shouldn't be so hard on myself. I mean…I loathe myself and am so disappointed in myself for what I *can't* provide for my son – his own bedroom, a two-parent home, a pet. But…sometimes I think that I should just put my focus on the good aspects of our life… Healthcare covered, roof over our heads, a running vehicle… At least he's not growing up in some war-torn land or as a child labourer…

3331,glass1algae,1647137393,1,"LONG POST.. TL;DR at the botom

Hey, I'm a 20 y/o guy, working and not in school, and the friend I'm talking about is another 20 y/o guy not working but in school and he's currently studying abroad in Ireland and we're both from the US. We actually live in the same town now, previously we lived an hour away from each other with his college being about twenty minutes from me, as I moved here due to unrelated reasons.

He's my closest and pretty much my only friend, the only one I talk to about everything. We're friends with benefits (I'm gay, he's bisexual), and I love him dearly. He's been gone since January and I'm missing him so much; we called like once a week in the first month that he left, but it faded off as he got busier, which is understandable but I really do miss him and worry about his mental health as well. From talking to him, it sounds like he isn't doing very well, he told me that he ""lost a friend that he was close to back home"" (it seemed like he meant they are deceased, but I'm really not sure), and he's barely online. He's struggled with body dysmorphia and also has depression (and is on antidepressants.) I am just so utterly worried for him and my check-ups seem so lacking in substance.

He is also not online very much or nearly integrated into technology as I am, and when most people my age as as awfully obsessed with their phones as I am, it can be a struggle to understand him not responding for several hours or leaving me on read because text just doesn't seem as big of a deal to him and I don't think he picks up on common text tones. Good for him, but I just get so anxious (struggling with lifelong anxiety.) Because of this I prefer phone calls over texting with him over anything else, but I don't want to force that either. I'm just so worried about him, and I miss him, and I'm just very lonely. I'm trying to make friends through work but it's just hard especially because I'm in a rough spot.

This is really how our last text conversation looks:

Me: Hey
Him: (2hrs later) Hey man
Me: How are u doing?
Him: I'm okay
Got some late assignments in last night
I've been a whole mess lol
Me: It's definitely understandable
I just want to check in ig
I miss talking
Him: I'll try and find a good time for it
I'm trying to get back in touch w a few people lol
Me: Probably good

... and that's it. I just don't know how to talk to him because I get so sad about missing him. He'll be back in June, but I'm just so stressed out about shit that all I want to do is spend time dicking around with him.

How the hell do I actually talk to him ?? He reassured me just the other day that he's grateful to have me as a friend and THANKED me for how I treat him, but I still doubt myself constantly. Luckily I am seeing a therapist next week, for the first time in quite awhile, but it won't make me stop missing him.

I try to make friends but it never goes anywhere. I try and join all sorts of discord server, but I never seem to be able to make friends no matter how hard I try.

Forever had social anxiety that made me a lot forgiven and not judgmental towards others.

Nowadays I feel like a 70 yo (no offense to our great generation) in that I’m really bitter I don’t wanna be around ppl except my family, I don’t hold back my judgement

I don’t care weather ppl like me or not, just want them off my head and space.

I don’t like to be accommodating to others no more.

I’m not necessarily fine with being alone but when I weigh the above I’m gladly fine with it.

My friends whom are dear to my heart, require a lot of accommodation with time and emotions… so on

Was fine with it. But now I can’t stand the sight of any of them. Not just to not be accommodating to their needs which I’m totally capable of but with “I don’t wanna be around none”

With that into consideration, I’m actually emotional and easily scratched with words.

I’m not forgiving and tolerant to others like I used to be.

Out of all the friends I had, he was the only one that also considered me his best friend. And out of all the people that have been a part of my life, he was also the only one I would consider to be part of my ""my people"" group. After almost 25 years on this earth, I finally got to know what a genuine and extremely close friendship feels like. We knew things about each other that no one else knew. Literally every day we talked on Discord and we often played games together. Aside from being my best friend, he was also pretty much the only person I talked to regularly. I just loved him so damn much (as a friend).

But a few months ago, our friendship came to a sudden and unexpected end. He just said he wanted to move on and to this day, I still don't understand why. One day we were still friends, the next one he ended our friendship. With him gone, I feel so lonely. I still miss him a lot. It's like I'm mourning the loss of a brother I have always been very close with. And looking at all the things we talked about and did together, the way we interacted, all the little things, ... I just can't imagine anyone being able to ever replace him. Especially considering it took me 25 years to find a friend like him. And I don't want to replace him either tbh. I feel like if I do start making new friendships that could potentionally live up to the kind of friendship I had with this guy, I feel like it would just remind me too much of him and that would make me feel more depressed again. Even hearing the Discord ringtone will probably always remind me of him and our friendship, just like looking at all the games that we played together and reading or hearing about his interests that he introduced me to.

I should find a new (best) friend, but I just can't. It's too painful to do so. And in a way I also don't want to give up on the hope I still have that one day he'll come back.

I was thin and got beaten by people whom I considered my best friends. So, everyone made fun of me regarding that.. also, since I was a complete looser to everyone.
I was ashamed of myself to even look into the mirror because everyone made of fun of my face my body my hair... My life!.
Never did girls talk to me since I looked ugly.
After my +2, I was preparing for the premier institutes of country for my undergrads. I failed terribly. This time, I was looser to my family too.
Anyhow, landed in some tier3 college.
In final year, I fell in love with one girl. I confessed my feelings to her, got my heartbroken but I didn't stop there.. I literally begged her for love a couple of times after getting rejected once, so one day she told me that why she didn't like me because ""You are so slim.. you're a complete looser.. look at you you bald(i wasn't bald though) since my forehead was big and yes, i was having hairfall tho.. but not like, that one would call me bald for that."" Anyways, i tried to move on. I got a job finally.. thought that I could do sth for my family now.
But fate wasn't in a mood.. Sooner my workplace started to become so toxic that I couldn't even sleep for more than 3 hrs.. but this was also not enough.
I found that my dad invited one lady who was in some kind of family relation in June, 2021 (when covid pandemic 2nd wave was at it's deadliest). And yes, very soon I got to know that he invited her to our house because it was my dad's plan to invite her to our house along with her kids so that they can fuck each other right behind our back, when my mom was sleeping and no one can doubt on them.
He used to tell my mom that he's taking her to shop sth for her husband and her kids but what they did was book a hotel and again fuck each other.. have a lot of sex.
She stayed in our house for 3 weeks..I thought she'd never come back to our house(since my mom didn't like her and when she told to my dad then he would scream at her that she's narrow-minded) HYPOCRISY.. WOW.
But again, my dad invited her again to our house after 1 month. This time she came alone. All this time, my mom had doubt on that bitch, but I used to tell her that there's nothing like that. My dad can never do this to us. He just likes to show off to people his status because all this time, i never knew these stuff. I had doubt tho but only a little.
But I found out about my dad's cheating 2 months back.
I heard her sexting that motherfucker bitch who made our lives miserable for always.
Now, my dad is in an extramarital affair with that lady and he's forgotten us. He just pretends to be ""A family man"".
All these years my father was my hero. But now, my belief system is shaken.
Now, that I can't get the girl whom I loved like crazy (even if she didn't reciprocate) and I just can't move on.. also I'm loosing hair at a rapid speed that I know my hair wouldn't be for so long.. and my family/friends would again make fun of my baldness because they are just like that.. and also, since my father.. my belief system is now shaken.. I have no one's shoulder to cry on. I want to cry my hearts out for hours, but I have no one. I can't cry in front of my mom since she's already dealing with a lot and I want to support her like a mountain and be a HERO for her. If she sees me crying then she will become even more weak. My best friends have also parted ways from me.. they're all busy and seems like I'm the only one who always makes effort to unite the friendship.
Now I've reached this stage of my life... that I know... I won't be here for much time.

When I was about 3 years old my dad was tragically killed and so we (6 year old me, 3 year old brother and my mum) migrated from my home country to the UK for safety primarily and because she had vague family ties to the country. She came here and married my step dad (he helped us move across). He is actually a terribly abusive man who my mum insisted we remain grateful to despite his awful ways (angry outbursts, swearing, shouting, and terrible with money etc). My mum is too meek and submissive and culturally obliged to stay. 

Anyway, since I was ridiculously young (16 maybe) I committed myself becoming as rich and successful as possible so that our lives wouldn’t be shitty and poverty ridden forever (think modern day poverty eg living in immigrant slummy areas and forever worrying about making rent etc). But stupidly I was fooled into thinking that you do that my going to university, I studied an academic scientific degree and have now landed myself a job that I don’t really care for but pays well (26yrs old; 40k). Sounds like a sweet gig but I have no f_cking life. I have to work weekdays and evenings I have to travel nationally (3 4 hour round trip) any day of the week often work doing 8-10 hour days (plus travel) and sometimes weekends. It doesn’t matter that I work weekends because I don’t even have friends to spend my time with any more. We are all spread across the country and worst of all my two friends (one is a student and one is a nurse) are too cash strapped to hang out and aren’t particularly motivated to travel which I guess is fair enough. 

I gave up the regular things in life in the hopes of wealth and success and I can’t even afford to buy my mum house without almost bankrupting myself. She works a shitty job as a career and I wish she didn’t have to.

I'm a good person imo, somewhat understanding, showing that I care, put my friends before me and sacrifice my time for them. Even once, the guy I considered as my best friend in the high school started to date my crush intentionally and kept flirting with her on the desk next to me. Yeah, I was able to hear what they were talking while I had feelings lol. Still I didn't cause a trouble for them, moved on and paid for his breakfast when his family was broke. Oh about him, he was a basketball player who is 1.96cm, talkative, extroverted and funny. Meanwhile me 1.65cm, introverted.

I've never felt like I'm someone else's number one choice, as a partner or a friend. A lesbian friend of mine said to me that I give feminine vibes through texts and that's why she liked me. What I did was basically talking to her without flirting or being a creep. I just tried to be her friend. So when I'm being the nice guy, it gives feminine vibes? That's why girls never choose me? I just don't understand why I can't make it... why I can't find a girl who doesn't care about my height or appreciate my good personality? I don't think I look bad or feminine, I don't think I'm someone boring, I don't think I'm a bad person overall. 

My height disadvantage beats all of my great features? What is this about? I'm trying to make peace with myself but every day accepting myself is getting more and more difficult.

So i spent $150 for 30 minutes. I usually halve a full solid boner when at home jerking off. So i got there even though it was ice cold outside. Took an hour and 30 to get there. When i got there it was odd. She was much bigger then she was in the photos. She also had a tiny dog which she had to tell to shut up throughout the session. So.. First she gave a blowjob. And after a while i was wondering when i put it in. That was... $30 extra bucks. So i did it. Thing is i couldnt stay hard. Here i was with a women and it wouldnt get hard. It didnt help that she had scars on her face and body. She kept trying to get me hard and between that shutting up the dog. She didnt even look interested. Her hair was a mess. I settled for the blowjob and... It felt painful. Like i had to grit my teeth because she grabbed and squeezed like it was a rag. I.. Hate myself when i left. I didn't even dare ask for a refund.

I’ll be doing my a-levels this year so i told myself at the beginning of the year that i’ll take this opportunity, since i’m all alone, to repress all my urges and focus all my energy on studying.

But everything comes crashing down once the weekend arrives and i’m left alone. I only have 1 close friend in this new country and although we are extremely tight, he just can’t hang out with EVERY weekend. So on weekends that i’m left alone, i just spiral out of control. I get self-conscious, look at my friends’ instagram stories, stare at mirrors for hours thinking about which parts of my face need work done etc. I also think about drinks, drugs and sex, all the shit i used to do back at home, just to feel AWFUL about myself and the “life” i’m missing out on. As of now, i don’t even drink cause if i get drunk on a friday/saturday, the hangover will stop me from studying the next day and i don’t like that.

I have had offers on grindr to do a bit of drugs but i’m in a sort of a dilemma cause i’ve worked so hard this past year to build this strict study routine and i don’t want it to disappear, my goal is to still do well for my a-levels which are coming in a few months.

Prison ain't as high drama as people make it out to be. I was lucky to know people when I went inside from some light gang activity in my youth. So I was good. But you gotta survive, play the game. And part of that are the walls. The way I see it is there are two kinds of walls - mental, and physical. 

In order to survive that experience I had to create new walls in my mind. I had to shut out my own thoughts, and I had to hide my fear and anxiety about being inside. I was used to this to an extent, projecting that confidence. But inside there is no respite. So I built my walls as high and strong as I could. 

Now I'm out. 10 years compared to what some guys get is nothing.  But I'm alone. I cut off a lot of people from my past.  Had to. Couldn't fall back to that old shit. But the walls follow me around.

To clarify, my friends are truly wonderful and i've felt genuinely well liked by my peers over the last few months, up until a few weeks ago when my mental state deteriorated to a point lower than its ever been before, i've started thinking that my friends attempts to hang out with me are just out of pity, like theyre too afraid to be the person that wasn't nice to the quiet, shy guy.

I hooked up with someone who i had great chemistry with for the first time in years, thought everything was going great, only to be stuck in this familiar situation where it seems they dont want to speak to me, or have anything to do with me for that matter, leaving me feeling needy and pathetic.

It feels like i cant seem to find a single spare moment where i can just reflect on what is real without thinking that everyone i know and love just hates me, even as i type this my brain is going a million miles an hour, like i cant just latch onto a single idea or thought.

I don't know if i need advice, i just think i wanted this to be scrawled somewhere other than inside my brain, i'm exhausted and just trying not to give up.

3435,Great-Entertainer-77,1647079398,1,When I was a kid my mom would beat me half to death everyday. She told me often I was worthless. At school everyone bullied me for trying to hard to make friends for wearing ripped and cheap clothes. For showing up with tears in my face. For being poor. For being ugly. Now I just turned 21 I went to a bar. I realized how fucked I am. I dropped out off college.planning on returning don’t know when. Everyone there was tall. Attractive. I’m 5’6. And ugly. I have been extremely antisocial and lonely my entire life. I used to fantasize about my crushes waay too much as a kid. When my mom was hurting me. When I was alone which was pretty much always. I left my moms house 3 days after I turned 18. I’m 21 and realized how dangerous my  dissociation has become towards me. In high school I fantasized about this girl when things were bad at home or when I was lonely so pretty much always. Everytime I got hit or my mom said something to me I thought about her. I was forced to get over her after high school. Now it’s happening again. A coworker I met began flirting with me. After a couple weeks she stopped keep in mind she never saw my face until now. She no longer flirts after she saw how I looked like. I’ve been trying to make myself look better. After years of neglect I got braces and I’ve been using skincare products. I also really suck at talking to people but she gives me the cold shoulder often. How do I get over her. How do I not fall for people because people like me don’t get happy endings. How do I stop obsessing over her. I wish this wasn’t a problem. This feels like love but it can’t be.  I’ve never been in a relationship.

Hey there. I recently just made a reddit and this reddit page pop out of nowhere and I just need to vent to someone in this page how I overthink that I will be alone forever. I just feel like I do not have a soulmate out in this world and its hard for me to talk to a girl. (There is a girl who I’m interested in and had the courage to try to make the first move yesterday. She really appreciate the comment I gave her but nothing went to far, I am just proud this is the first time I tried shooting my shot for the first time ever.) Anyways back on track, all my friends are getting in a relationship and I don’t really hangout with them anymore since they are leaning to their relationships. I haven’t been in a relationship in 6 years and haven’t talked to a girl in 4 years. (I am 20 years old btw.) I just feel like no girl or women will ever like me or approach me in public. I know I am still a bit to young to think about this but soon I will graduate for a University in the next upcoming school year and at my age is where I should go express and find someone to love but I just been super shy and I just don’t want to start a random conversation with a girl because I don’t want to make them uncomfortable or think I am weird.

3468,Wooden-Volume-6523,1647066035,1,"I have autism, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD. I’ve been trying really hard to work on myself and become mentally healthy, but sometimes it’s really hard. There was this guy I really liked recently, and I started to become really attached to him. It’s usually hard for me to be vulnerable around people because I’ve been hurt so much. But with him, I felt safe to be myself without being judged. So, I asked him out on a date and he said yes. I was really excited and happy. I hung out with him a lot after that, and we kinda flirted and everything. But the other day out of nowhere, he just casually mentions he got back with his ex girlfriend a few days ago. After I heard that, all those negative feelings instantly came flooding to the surface. I felt like I wasn’t even important enough for him to let me know he got back with her. I told my mom about what happened, and she promised to take me to dinner the next day- which would’ve really cheered me up. I haven’t been able to spend much time with her since the pandemic. The next day though she never called me, and was posting on Facebook all day. I don’t have many friends because I’m so scared to be myself around people and I’m worried that I’m weird. All I want is someone I can be myself around. 

Yesterday I saw him again, and he hugged me unprompted when he left. It made me feel really sad. That night I messaged a guy on Grindr (mostly just wanting to talk to someone) and I walked over to his house and we were gonna watch a movie and hook up. Desperate to connect to someone, I told him a lot about myself and what I go to school for and my passion. He started to fall asleep, and we ended up not hooking up and I went home. I know he probably was sleepy, but I can’t stop thinking about what if he thought I was weird and kicked me out when he realized he wasn’t attracted to me. I texted him and told him that I’m sorry if I was weird or anything, he hasn’t answered though and has been online. I feel so unloveable. I feel like maybe I’m expecting too much of people, but really all I want is someone I can be comfortable with and share who I am uncensored. I’m always just alone with all my thoughts, and I feel so isolated. I try to keep a positive outlook, but then I start to worry that I’ll never be able to fully function like other people get to, and that really breaks my heart so much.",lonely,I feel really isolated.,2022-03-12 17:20:35

3474,floppyjukebox,1647062487,1,"I just need a place to rant. This sucks. So much. And no, I’m not fishing for attention, im not being too hard on myself, and im not over-exaggerating. I am absolutely hideous and it’s just a fact. Like, the sky is blue, and I am ugly. Anyone with even one eye would confirm if. If somehow, my face went viral, the comments about how revolting I look would never end, comparison after comparison to gross looking ugly characters/animals/things. I’m one of those people. 

I was born female but honestly, nobody would guess. Even if I was a guy, I’d still be ugly as hell. It’s not just that I’m masculine. My face is just sad. Idk what sort of genes I was cursed with to live this atrocity but every day is harder and harder. 

Idek what it is. I mean, I have a crooked nose with a bump on it and I’m actually getting surgery for that. But that’s not the only issue. I wish it was. It’s my entire face. Just the way my eyes look, my brows, my face shape, my expression, everything. 

I look like a monster. I’m so unattractive I wanna hide my face from myself. 
I feel like I can never be loved or truly be happy like this. I feel so disgusting and undesirable. And it isn’t even my fault. I feel like nobody will wanna get to know me or see my personality because of my horrendous looks. 

I feel so embarrassed around guys cause I know they’re all thinking about how ugly and weird looking I am. Hell, I feel embarrassed around everybody. I don’t even smile cause I hate my teeth so much and my smile makes me look even more like a deformed alien. 

Even after I get my nose job, I don’t think I’ll be happy cause my entire face is a mess. I’m so jealous of those small, petite cute feminine looking girls and would literally die to be one of them. 
I’ve been misgendered quite a few times before and called a man but honestly that’s not even the worst of it. 

I just always ask myself, “why me? What did I do to deserve this?” Being THIS ugly automatically makes life 1000x more difficult, as I saw a post somewhere saying being ugly is just playing life on hard mode. Oh man, it sure is, and for my level of ugliness, that would still be an understatement. If anyone woke up with my face, they’d probably wanna die. And I myself would feel sorry for them. I feel sorry for everyone I walk past just that they had to see me. Nowadays, I wear a mask and sunglasses wherever I go, even if people think I’m weird for it, I’d rather they think that than see my face. 

As for my body, I mean I’m 5’7” which I’m insecure about cause woohoo, masculine height too, and I’m not obese or anything but I am plump. 

Anyway, it’s my face that’s the main issue. It doesn’t matter what kind of wigs I wear, how much makeup I cake on, or how amazing my outfit is. None of it can make up for or hide the monstrosity that is my face. Makeup doesn’t make me look any different and my case is so bad I’m not even sure plastic surgery would help. 

I cant stop feeling like crap about myself. 
It’s ruining my life and taking over my entire mind. What can I do to not care anymore? It ruins my confidence and gives me the worst social anxiety ever. I cant socialize or feel comfortable around people at all and I despise going out or doing video chats. I am extremely lonely and know nobody would ever wanna be close to me.

I known plenty of friends but they all ghosted me despite the fact that I do make it known to them that I seek a long-term friendship with them. I hate how they are always seemingly ""too busy"" to hang out with me and yet I see them hanging out with other people. I often get left on read by my friends all the time but I always see them on their phones when they are out in public. 

And online dating is just as bad. I go on the plenty of dates. And it seems like I click with them. And they tell me they want a second date with me. And poof, I find out they have ghosted me when I try contacting them about confirming our second date. 

I hate how my ""friends"" always make me feel like as if I have no friends at all. I hate how everybody is so unapproachable these days. I hate investing my time and energy in a new person then for them to fade away. I know for sure that I am a nice person. I don't touch people inappropriately or make creepy or racist jokes around people. 

I am sick of being nobody's priority no matter how nice I try to be. I wish people would just straight up tell me they don't want to be friends with me from the beginning. I hate being lead on. I wish people know how much it makes me sad to be treated like this all the time.

3489,NeitherCrazy5832,1647054586,1,"Hi, this might be a long read so sorry, recently I've really been struggling with loneliness. Well I've been existentially lonely for years. But now I'm starting to wonder if I need help. Some background as to what's going on and where I'm at: I used to be a drug dealer. From bout 18 to 21 I sold mostly pot in an illegal state but not limited to bulk of xans, acid, some coke, e, Molly, ghb pretty much any party drug. I was an addict, mainly to dxm and oxy and alcohol. But I've been clean since 19. Clean of addiction as its a big part of why one of my best friends I ever had took his own life. I've had my stints of drug use and coke benders, but it's been awhile and does not weigh on my mind like it once did. Ive been able to keep a full time job at a dealership as a tech (post addiction) for about 4 years now despite this and the lack of sleep that comes with it. Well I met a woman at my old job in the city I used to live in. I was just turned 21 and she was 28 with two kids. We fell in love, I fell in love with her children and treated them as my own. Her son even called me daddy even though he saw his dad just as much as he saw me. I stopped trappin for her bc she didn't want it around the kids, of course. Well it didn't work out and looking back was a terrible and toxic relationship. But I'd never been so close and know someone so well. Naturally I was devastated it didn't work out even though the breakup was mutual. It left me very confused on who I could trust. Shed even tried to straight up fist fight me twice, I cldnt believe she wld hit me. It didnt physically bother me as she is a small lady and I've fought alot and don't mind to get hit. I just couldn't believe she would want to hurt me like that.. Well naturally I had a lapse after the relationship and said fuck it Imma make some money and started selling again. I fucked up, I got greedy. Started doin things the wrong way, getting into the wrong circles. one night June 23rd of last year 4 motherfuckers kicked in my front door to rob me. They took everything I had and put me in the hospital. An hour later they went and killed my friend up the street. I almost was charged with 5 felonies that night aswell due to what the robbers didn't even take (scale with coke residue, several zips of pot wrapped individually, thankfully no money left tho) but the cops didn't charge me just called me an ambulance. It's all still sitting in an evidence locker tho but it's been 8 months and I've moved several several counties over so whatever ig. That night I ditched my apartment to stay with friends. I was getting paranoid, and mind you I've been held at gun point plenty of times but this time was different. This time it scared me because my cousin was murdered at 21 and I was nearly murdered at 22. It rocked the family and I cldnt help to think what if the kids were there? What if I hadnt been fuckin up and did what I supposed to do and stay ready. If they hadn't caught me sleepin they would have never made it to my friend's house and never killed him... So I skipped town to start over. Once again.
Now it draws near the 4th anniversary of my friends suicide and it's all coming down on me. I don't sleep anymore. Not really. I wake up with my adrenaline pumping more and more. This used to happen sometimes too but my ex was always in the bed with me there for me so at least I CLD go back to sleep or I toss and turn toss and turn. Now it happens several times a week and I can't go back. Now I live in a town where I know no one. I've tried dating apps and the like to meet people but it's not for me I can't play their games. I don't go out really anymore. I don't know what to do with myself bc I've never done anything but try to make money with my free time. I've started working on my health and am doing well with it, eating right and working out. I don't do the things I used to do I don't enjoy much of anything I used to enjoy doing. I'm so lonely and I don't know what to do but I'm worried I may do something to put me in prison. Now I'm 23, struggling, pretty much broke, and I don't know what to do.

It is 7:32 Friday night that I started writing this.

I have extra money. Got me medicine. I want to go out or invite people over.

My siblings are too busy to come by or out of town.

No friends because I actually have standards, learned the hard way you can't just befriend EVERYBODY who's lonely too).

Dunno if this post will show up, last one I tried to post here didn't appear.

Cleaned my whole dang apartment as of a couple hours ago. Gave my cat an extra good day.

I remember being homeless, stuck under a bench in 30 somethin degree weather with only dirty clothes to keep warm.

I remember losing so, SO many fights to the worst people.

I remember calling support lines, only to feel worse than before the call was made.

I know it's okay to be alone, but it shouldn't be this consistent.

I know it's alright to have standards, but the loneliness hurts so freaking much.

My brain is telling me ""the only 2 house guests you've had over were TERRIBLE, you wanna go through that AGAIN?!""

My heart is/emotions are telling me ""you're going to find exactly who you want and need to talk to""

After how many times though, I wonder?

How many people are going to steal what's left of my kindness?

How much of my time will be wasted on folks who won't stick around?

Will I ever find someone to talk with on the phone late at night/early in the morning?

Why can't I have even just one real friend who likes and accepts me?

I know now the problem is only a little me, but it's the fault of most people.

I cannot accept overly religious, anti-alternative medicine, 1 gender-hating, alcohol-worshipping folks.

I won't settle for people who give unhelpful advice, people who can't stand cussing and especially won't settle for people who are stuck in the1950's.

I’m so tired of making the effort to talk to people, trying to make friends and not succeeding. I have a few people which I consider to be my closer friends, but even they feel distant and that they don’t want anything to do with me. The person I consider my best friend replies to my texts with one word and shows no care for me. For example, here’s a typical conversation between us:

Me: Hey — How’s training for the job been?
Them: Alright
Me: Did you get up to anything interesting?
Then: Not really, just boring work stuff.

Maybe I should just accept that people don’t like me? There must be something wrong with me if none of my “friends” care about me.

A better life, a better future and it did to some extent, but never had I image i would be alone in it. I've worked for the last 9 years intensely, mostly choosing to stay in and study than go out and socialize.   
During college I've always studied some new language, some new technology just to get the chance for a job. Finally landed the job then I started to work and study even harder to just get some edge in the game and a better paycheck. (came from a lower middle income family, where I barely managed during  college)  


The thing that hurts the most is that after all this i realized that I missed out on a lot of memories, a lot of chances and now I'm even struggling to make a normal conversation with someone. I always say that if i had 20% more cash back then I could have been more relaxed and somehow more social. Right now I can't even understand when a girl likes me or how to speak with them. I;m mostly frank and say what I think, modest in most aspects. But the thing that is the weirdest one is that I have developed this huge hate for a niche of society. Those who have money, those who played and had fun, those who didn't work as much as me just because it doesn't feel fair. I try to hide it or extinguish it. I think this negative aura gets seen and keeps girls from developing attachments to me.  


The f up part is that i also use this hate as a motivation to get shit done...  
   
I know I need to work on my self and go out more, but I feel that whenever I try something new, when it doesn't go decent  I just revert to working and staying in.  Somehow it feels like I'm not allowed to have a break or have fun, but just to work and study

Idk… I guess it’s not exactly the response I was hoping for. They’ve always been there for me, and some days they’re very emotionally supportive, but other days they’re emotionally constipated… I guess how I took the response is because you’re not sure if we will always be in each other’s lives you’re not sure of our friendship and therefor our friendship doesn’t mean anything to you. In reality I get life happens and none of us can guarantee our place in another person’s life. I’ve had many “friends” promise they would always be there only to leave later.

I can reach out someone who can just talk to me, but their response always disappoints me, so I rather not to ask them. They are not my closed friends too. General people don't like to listen and talk about serious question they actually need to concern, even if so, they're point of view is just shallow that I don't dare to listen, especially the ppl who always split things into black and white. 

Examples: Like... eating meat is bad because you are taking away lives. (Plants: are we not living ? What about other carnivorous creatures?)  Like... humans are just greedy and evil, and just let it be we can't change anyway. ( Gene is selfish at different aspect in order to survive, not just humans; evil and kindness both exist in humanity, I won't deny one side or another side, but why don't we just try to be kinder?)

 It's lonely and helpless that only a few people who care about what you care about; it makes you think your value is less important. 

When I'm sharing my viewpoint, some people can get why you feel that way, but they don't relate to you that strong, which they won't act for you but just give you lip service.  They feel so far away, like  bystanders. 

Also I don't find most of the memes funny on the internet, I'm always like ' what's the funny part ? Why there're so many likes???' 

I don't use Tik Tok; I rarely use Instagram; I deleted my twitter; I hate staring at digital device for killing time; I like deep conversation; I want adventures ; I want to do what I like with supportive people.   

People now in general: use Tik Tok and play it all day; the first thing they know you is ask your Instagram account;  stare at phone whenever they can; avoid deep conversation; avoid risks and action;  slave for the society.

Ya, I know everyone is tired...then can't you see the problem with the society?

At the moment, I just feel so lonely that the society is going so fast pace. I'm walking slowly, but the surrounding just walk like tornado and drag you to the swirl, or you be the one which is left out or dead. I feel so stressful and lonely, people think I'm just lazy when I complain about this.",lonely,"Being lonely isn't just about not having companies, but no one shares similar thoughts and values with you, or understand you.",2022-03-12 06:22:48

At the moment my fridge/freezer is empty. I have a few cans left in the cupboard which I'm using to feed my 2 year old daughter. I'm running extremely low on baby formula and my bank is currently sitting at -£180 in its overdraft. I'm falling behind dramatically on my Internet bill (£102) terrified of going off and I'm not able to call anyone due to my phone being blocked due to not paying services. Im minus on both my gas and electric metres (they're pay as you go) so im terrified of them going off once the emergency credit runs out. falling so hard that pretending to be strong is mentally and physically exhausting me.  

I'm not asking for someone to wish away all my debt and suddenly fix my life. I'm just asking if anyone can help or offer assistance with the current problems I'm facing and just let me be able to breathe for a little while so I can just get my shit together again and be somewhat not so much of a failure father. 

I've contacted local churches and still waiting to hear back from them. I've applied for food vouchers for food banks and still waiting to hear back. I don't drive so I don't have access to drive out to an open kitchen or open food bank. I'm mostly worried about running out of baby formula which I'm also waiting on healthy start vouchers alongside milk vouchers. 

More than welcome to contact me and ask for any verification, I'm happy to live video chat to show you my living situation. I'm more than happy to show any proof of bills etc. I'm just insane need of help right now.

I’m not sure were to post this so I’ll just leave it here in hopes that someone sensible will find and read it and hopefully give me some advice. I’m nearing 30 years old and I feel so lost in my social life. That is to say I have none. I don’t have friends, I don’t go out on my free-time, I tend to stay away from social gatherings and even grocery shopping takes a lot out of me. The only people I talk to is my co workers when I am at work and my parents every now and again. The thought of “going to new places and meeting people” is enough to leave me parallelized in bed. I hate when I mention “loneliness” that the first couple of responses is always on the line of “well then go out and meet people”. I feel like I’m just a burden and creep when I’m out. Why would I approach a group when they already have their friends and place within that friendship. Why would anyone consider taking me into a part of their social group?

I work out ( I have a home gym), try to eat right and spend my time reading and trying to learn new things. I live in a small town in Maine so I don’t have any opportunities to “join clubs”, “enjoy the nightlife”, or any other activities others suggest to meet new people. And even if I was afforded such chances the idea of “meeting new people” on my own is terrifying. I’m short and awkward. I don’t understand many of the social norms and unwritten rules that others follows. And since I’m not a hunter,fisher, or partake in “beefing up” my vehicle or go “offroading” I find myself lurking through online libraries and watching YouTube all day.

When I do manage to muster the energy and will to go for a walk around my town I find it so hard to even look up from the ground and wave and say hello to someone passing me by. I always make it a point to not make eye contact and move quickly pass them. It’s frustrating on one end I’m scared to make contact with somebody else and therefore I do my best to stay alone but I do such a good job of it that the social isolation is slowly killing me.

I just don’t know what else or where else to go. I hate people and yet I want to have at least one friend. I feel so depressed lately and its been getting worse and worse. I don’t want to go back to therapy. After nearly 10 years I’ve pretty much heard it all and done what I can do improve my position in life and yet I’m still in the same spot. My anxiety and paranoia leaves me in a lonely spot. I am starting to hate my life and everyday is becoming the same routine to the point that work is the only way I can tell my days apart. I had girlfriend two years ago but that ended with her going back to her ex and leaving me a wreck. I refuse to use social media because I am an extremely private person. I uphold privacy in the highest regard to the point where I feel as if it’s affecting my life in a negative way. I just don’t know to to make and maintain relationships in general.

I need help but I’m not sure in what form and how to get it. I want to feel normal or maybe I’m just cursed to be lonely and fighting off these depressive thoughts. I just want a friend or for someone to point me in the right direction. Maybe I’m autistic, maybe I’m an incel and I just never knew.

That makes me avoid people. why should people waste their time on me, when they could be worrying about literally anything else? but avoiding and not talking to people makes me even more excruciatingly lonely. the cycle continues :(

I truly wish I had some good friends I could talk about things (like when something happens in my relationship that I can't talk about with family but desperately need outside advice).

I'm in college and ever since it has started offline, I've found myself completely singled out from the entire class. Literally everyone else, every single one of them, is in a group with their own friends. It's not that I don't talk to anyone; while I am a reserved person by nature and also due to certain insecurities like fear of judgement, I'm still trying every day to go out of my way and keep socialising (to a point that I sometimes feel like I'm being annoying) because I don't want to be the 'shy and quiet girl' once again. So far I've talked with every single person in my class but I don't seem to have formed a relationship with any of them the way they have with each other; a relationship that goes beyond formalities and niceties and involves stuff like banter and genuine friendship. When it comes to groupchats and all, I'm part of NONE (barring the common groupchats in which everyone is there because they're required to be). People will talk to me but it's mostly small talk or work-related talk. There's no sense of bonding. Frankly speaking I myself am comfortable with my quiet nature and would prefer to be alone if that didn't have consequences on my social life and career (any successful career requires good networking). So yeah it's just tremendously frustrating and I feel stuck in that 'quiet' label and I don't know whether I should try harder or completely stop trying or if something's just wrong with me.",lonely,Does anyone else feel this barrier of disconnect between yourself and everyone else from a particular environment that prevents you from going beyond basic conversations?,2022-03-12 00:12:25

(Sorry for my bad english, pls don’t attack me) 
I met someone from this hub a while ago, everything was okay and we were talking for a month and then was together for almost 4 months already.. But sadly it didn’t end well and we broke up 2 days ago. 

I have very bad mental health, I sometimes would hurt myself, get mad at him for being busy, get jealous easily, fall asleep while we were talking (because we are 7 hours apart) and I can see he is trying his best to comfort me but Idk why I can never be satisfied and want more from him. 

I’ve never been treated properly before I met him, he is the first one to ever care about me, to listen to me, to comfort me. He bought me gifts and the first time he got me a nice bouquet of flowers, there’s a card saying ‘for my favourite person halfway across the globe’. I got him gifts as well and a crocheted flower bouquet and also told him that my love for him will never die just like these flowers… sadly we didn’t end well

Before we broke up, I’m still settling down for Uni and he is busy with his work so we did not spend much time talking and I got angry and over exaggerate and said that I will go fuck another guy in which I never did but I just wanted to see if he would care but he didn’t, the next morning he said he wanted to tell me something and he did not reply to me when I said ‘i love you’ to him and after that he decided to end it all. He told me he met someone unplanned from work, and he likes her too.. I wonder how.. how can a heart changed so fast when 2 days before we broke up we said ‘i love you’ to each other and ever since we’ve been together we said so much ‘i love you’ .. apparently it isn’t enough. 

He told me to find new love again, and someone will love me again. I begged and begged him to not breakup with me but he said he is not happy, he is not strong anymore, his heart changed and he fall out of love.. he did not see any future with me cause we are so far away.. he wanted me to wake up from my dream.. The dream that I’ve been trying to work on..I planned on meeting him after I graduate next year.. and now it is all really a dream that will never come true. I still remember significantly a few months ago he said to his friend that he love me regardless of our location.. 

I wonder if I’m not needy, if I have better mental health, if I didn’t say all those nasty words, if I didn’t get jealous so easily, If I care more about how he feels..this won’t happened.. I still love him dearly and I know we are not possible anymore but part of me, is still hoping.. I’m sorry.. this all happened way too fast, I didn’t expect it at all and I miss him so much. He won’t see this cause he block me already but I just wanted to say that you were the best part of me, I’m sorry I am not a good partner for you. You’re my first love and I love you.. forever and always..",lonely,How can someone fall out of love so easily,2022-03-11 21:40:27

i just want to know how to finally make it happen, how to find him and finally be able to have a happy fucking life like everybody else does

i dont want to be alone anymore

3607,OkListen4878,1646988695,1,"I met her on Discord while playing Apex Legends and have been talking for 5 months. We quickly became good friends after sharing common interests/life goals/mutual attractuon/etc. 

I'm someone who is strongly attracted to compatible personality traits/interests and with good vibes as well as personality. I might have gotten a 24% match rate when I was on tinder (straight male) but the options I was given didn't really vibe with me that much as I talked to them. Hence I deleted the app. 

FYI, I'm 6'2, white-passing mixed brown/white (hispanic/english/Iranian) guy with light skin, light brown hair. I have what I'd consider to be an average body but with some shape since I'm pretty athletic. She's hapa. I've got a masters in maths and work for a good set of money in the geography and earth sciences field. She has a bachelor's in psychology but doesn't work in psychology - instead she went to do an apprenticeship in a completely unrelated field but is working for a good sum. 

While first talking to her, she came off as quite strong. She saw my face (I saw hers) and she constantly complimented my appearance. She did tell me she's into fit guys who take care of their appearance and didn't want either of us to let ourselves go. She's pretty slim. 

She lives 2 hours away from me by road but I decided I would give her a chance as she was also a highly educated, smart and pretty type with a seemingly good personality. I rarely find such women on apps and she seemed the whole package. 

When we'd talk, she'd try to direct the convo towards dating, our mutual hobbies, our future goals/dreams, her life with me involved and the things we'd do together, including holidays we'd go on, and that she'd move out to an overseas country I'd move to (e.g. The United States, most of my Hispanic mother's family live there now) since I'm not 100% interested in remaining here to settle down. Most of my family live overseas! I totally gave into what she said...... 

She arranged a date and I had it last month with her in a pub. It went well. She displayed signs of strong interest - hair twirling, intense eye contact, blushing, flirting, etc. Gave heavy vibes of wanting a relationship. 

She'd even talk about her dates she had off hinge and told me she'd usually only go on dates with people with severe trauma/substance issues because that's who she attracted on the app mostly. She said she wanted someone with a clean lifestyle and uninstalled the app as soon as she found me. 

I live a very clean lifestyle. When we spoke she also tried to tailor her preferences so it matched me as a person. 

She considers herself a bad texter and would text longish paragraphs every 24-48 hours. Of course I'd reciprocate. 

We continued to talk about similar things for the next month and she upped the flirting. I had a facetime call with her this weekend and all of a sudden this week she dropped off in communication. I did the unthinkable and left 25 missed calls (oops) and a couple of follow up texts on her device as she'd often want to talk to me on the phone during the midweek. But she snapped at me after sending a message and I quickly apologised. I'm hoping for closure here because I've admitted to my mistakes.

She even invited me out for another date during that call over in my town! What on earth is going on? 

She still has me on all her social media and hasn't blocked me anywhere but doesn't even talk to me anymore. Just stalks my social media.

She seems to have a fearful avoidant attachment style. Her only relationship lasted 3 months.

Like I'm good enough to keep around when he needs someone to talk to about it all or needs financial help or wants a good shag l, but I'm not good enough to be mentioned like ""at least there's this one person that's always there for me"" Just once I'd like him to just acknowledge me, maybe just hug me and say ""thank you for always being there.""

My parents told me I was selfish for suddenly being so ill, as if I'm faking. When I stayed at their house they basically refused to feed me because they said I'd get fat if I didn't move.

Obviously couldnt stay there, so went to my partner and her family's house.

3622,Haimish1224,1646980704,1,"(M/24)  I don't have fun anymore, can't really enjoy gaming that much anymore I really just do it to pass the time. I was very healthy and about 20 pounds heavier during my past ""relationship"" about 2 years ago, going to the gym a lot and enjoying my hobbies. I suffered an injury that put a halt to my fitness for a while and that in combination with being left by someone I thought I loved just killed my motivation for fitness. I have tried to get back into it but I have trouble eating enough to gain weight again as I usually feel like absolute shit about myself. I have had a few good spells of getting back in the gym and working out still feels good, but it only usually lasts a few weeks or I only go once or twice a week (which isn't enough) because my energy is so low. Most days it feels like the toll of having to go to work every day and just waking up in the morning in general feels draining enough. 

I have no sense of time, it's like my brain is permanently distracting me from my thoughts unless I am in my car or laying in bed at night. At work I just go, go, go, and when I go to the gym its the same way and when I game it's the same way, the time just zooms by and I can't even really enjoy whatever thing/task I am doing. I usually get home from work or the gym and before I know it it's midnight and time to go to bed. Some days when it hits that point in the night I almost have weird sense of delirium and find myself wondering where the day went. Even though most of these days I have gone to work, done my job well, had numerous phone calls and interactions, maybe even went and played ball or worked out at the gym as well. Regardless, it seems like it all goes by in a blink of an eye.

Idk, am I just on survival mode or something? Like I am not really present or something? Shit is really weird and I feel like I am missing out on my life, it is affecting me so much. I feel very lonely at this point in my life and I have felt lonely before but I have never experienced this feeling of like pure dissociation almost. I haven't really felt capable of dating or anything since everything went down with my past few relationships, especially the most recent one which put me in the hospital and overall just really wrecked my trust and general well-being. I've tried dating apps which of course suck ass, I am a pretty good looking guy, about 6'4' and a pretty athletic build, I'd consider myself a great looking guy If I had any motivation left in me and could actually take care of myself. This shit is just really affecting my life and I feel like I am just missing out on everything. For instance, I have several weddings coming up this summer that I have no date for of course as well and everyone will be cool with me but they all lowkey talk shit and prob think I am weird as shit for not having a chick around at all for the past couple years. I know it's really off-putting to the girls I'm around because I'm a good looking fella its like ""wow that guy really doesn't have a date""? I know during the weddings it's gonna feel like an eternity and I am gonna feel awkward for being alone and then after I get a bit drunk and get in my own bed by the end of the night I will have that same feeling of delirium wondering wtf just happened and where the time went. It'll feel like I was hardly there. 

I just barely feel like I am here ya know, especially in those really socially-intensive moments. I am just a ghost going through the motions, just impersonating who I know I can be, deep down I just know I am not. Let me tell ya I do a damn good job I do an excellent job at work and when I have to go out with my friends I can be very social at times and stuff ya know, sometimes I can even be the funniest guy in the room, but after the fact, it all feels like it was some hazy dream or something, because I am incapable of being authentic at this point in my life. And with the being lonely thing, it's not like I don't have any game or anything. I mean I hate cold-approaching and dating apps suck, people are just hard to meet even though they're easy to meet. Take that for your own interpretation. But not only that I just hardly have any motivation to try because all of my past relationships have ended badly, and I like some context to sexual/intimate encounters so I sorta just want a relationship. I don't really look to/have the energy to just meet people and hook-up and shit like that, I never really did except for a few times early on in college. Idk I just have no self worth now and I feel like any attempt I have at being happy with someone will be completely sabotaged one way or another, and due to this feeling I have completely shut myself off from meeting someone and in turn have made myself so lonely that I am losing my mind. Feels like I am gonna blink and be 30 before I know it and still be single as fuck.",lonely,barely here...,2022-03-11 17:38:24

I feel bad. I don't want to talk much. Each day feels lonelier than the last. But really, I feel like I've come to discover my loneliness more and more. I have always felt deeply lonely, I just didn't really know. 

I've never had much of a reason to live. Maybe when I was younger, when I hoped and believed things would get better. When I hoped for stability. Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of reasons to self-accuse. In fact, the older I get, the less I can make any excuses. I'm still a boy with unresolved problems, only now I'm a man with the same problems. 

I don't have much energy. Suicide lately has felt like a casual thought, like I could just wrap whatever around my neck and just kind of tough out the initial struggle until I very soon pass out, then soon after that I die.

I don't blame anyone. I don't hate anyone.

Medication. Years and years of therapy. Psych ward trips. 

Black eyes. Bite marks. A hyper extended arm I brought to school for a week I've never told anyone about. Yelling. Holes in walls. Bookshelves on the floor. Hiding under a bunk bed. Ringing ears. Feeling as though someone will barge through the nearest door, screaming, even though I lay in bed completely safe, alone, and unbothered.

I would very much like for it to all just end. I had a day dream that I was in this sky-tall building, drinking beer. Everyone around is having fun, very happy, but nobody knows I'm there. I just get to be around, but nobody bothers me. I can see the sea and the sky and horizon stretches past my vision. Just a bunch of space. Nobody bothers me ever. ",lonely,.,2022-03-11 16:26:46

I talked deeply with the man I love. He has been so attentive to my needs and wants. I want to be attentive to his needs and wants. I want to stop drowning on my sorrow for his behalf. I imagine a bright future for he and I. I want it. 

Tomorrow I swear I will fight myself for him. I will fight my deepest ache and hurt to reassure him that my effort is true. To tell him I mean everything in my words I mean to show him action regardless of the hurt that burns my bones. 

I love him. I love him so much that I'm willing to love the shitty person in myself for his behalf. I want so badly to be his. For him to be mine. For him to mark my skin as much as he marked me as a person. I would not be who I am today without him. 

I am so alone because of the hurt that plagues me day and night. But I want to fight it. I want to fight it for he and I. So I would know what happiness is. I dont deserve it, god no. Yet my other has ceased to give himself to me. He would never understand my pain but I wouldn't doubt that he would try to understand it for me. 

I don't want my significant other to know my pain. I don't think I'd be able to get him out of the hole I struggle in myself. I will seek help when I have the money and resources. I swear. I want it. For both myself and him. I want to be happy. I want it so bad.

first i went on to date someone a decade older than me (I'm 21) and somehow convinced myself he was actually into me instead of using me for his fucked up kinks even though he was married with a separated wife. 

after getting rid of that i found myself falling for someone's words again and let a guy physically use me even without a first date. same thing happened it was only after he had his fun with me did i realize that he doesn't give a fuck about me at all. 

and then just last night, i let a guy catfish me into sexting with him which scared the living shit out of me. this guy superswiped me on bumble (I'm new to the app) and was cute in his pics. everything he told me about himself was just too picture perfect which was making me suspicious but i still went along. eventually he started sexting which i was okay with until he asked for my snapchat and his bitmoji was completely different from his pics. it looked like a middle aged man. he made up excuses like he edited it that way or whatever. i still added him and put up with his sexting. he managed to get a bra pic out of me but eventually i grew too suspicious of him and upon blocking him i saw his username which had a completely name than his name on bumble. this basically confirmed to me that he's pretending to be someone else. 

i spend most of days too low and depressed to do anything even important things which is why I'm even missing deadlines at university now too. all of this is giving me even more depression and making me powerless.

3674,West_Struggle_5837,1646957417,1,"I'm 23M. My gf of the same age broke up with me in December of 2021. After 3 and a half years. I'm obviously not over it. Before I met her I had a troubling past with another relationship that didn't work out and I struggled with moving on from that. After roughly 2 years I did it and a month after I met my now ex. It was beautiful. I felt things I never felt before, we had the most amazing moments and we really were connected and understood each other. May sound corny but we really worked like a well made team. In December of 2021 she broke up with me with the explanation that she was afraid I was not going to be a good match for her in the future. That because at the time I was and still am struggling to find a job that really suits me and inside my area of expertise. My parents are very supportive of me doing this and I actually can afford to be not working while looking for the job of my dreams. It may take some time but I know I can do it. She didn't have my back with this and broke up with me. I'm devastated. She said that we could still be friends but as much as I love her I just can't do that. I did it in the past with the other relationship and I got hurt really bad. Also I feel that I cannot be friends with a person that decided to leave me like this after all we've been through. And it's kinda frustrating the fact that she knows everything about me, and she knows what happened with my other ex. And proceeded to do even worse to me. We had a last dialogue and after me trying for the last time to get her back, we said we were cool. And after some time I blocked her on social media and deleted her number. Because although we weren't following each other, she watched all my insta stories and stuff, so I blocked her, also to help me resist the urge to go and watch her stuff. I won't hear from her ever again, only if I reach out to her and I know she would accept to be friends if I asked her. But I can't do that. I know I must move on and continue with my life, but at the same time, she is the love of my life. And I feel powerless. There's nothing else I can do. If a step has to be taken now it's on her hands, and it's not gonna happen even if I have trouble just accepting it. I feel lonely. I have friends but we live far from each other so I only see them like once a month. And I just don't feel like sending them messages bothering them with my problems. When I wasn't with my ex we would text all the time constantly. It was the only constant in my life and I loved her as much as I possibly could. I want her back. I really do. But in the reality I'm in right now I have no one to talk to. Most of the time I'm with my thoughts and by the story you are reading you can know that they're not the best ones. And I'm really afraid of what's gonna do to me. I really miss her. I just wish she could be more supportive and understand my dreams and what I want. I never felt for any other person what I felt for her. It always seemed to me like an opportunity of a lifetime. And it brings me down so much this outcome after 3.5 years, out of the blue, just leaving. I was all this time, one person away of feeling lonely. But she was the only one I could trust. And I held on to her way too much, because I loved her way too much. I just wish she said something to me. I'm still reachable if she wants to. It just doesn't happen.

I do not want a real relationship. Text, voice call, face call. I don’t work, so I’m free 24/7. We can schedule “dates” too if you’d like. Perhaps we can go hiking? Or cook dinner and eat together? Draw together? Whatever that doesn’t cost money, cause I’m broke lol. But whatever we’re doing I’m capable of giving that real gf feeling, hopefully you don’t fall in love, lol.

Things I am passionate about: drawing, painting, creating sad music, history, philosophy, and pc gaming.

The only thing I ask in return is cashapp for weed. Yes, I need weed everyday to function and unfortunately insurance doesn’t cover this medicine. I really am dead without it. For most of my life I’ve felt this way and weeds the only thing that helps. I have a lot of trauma that therapy and traditional pills don’t help with. In fact therapy has traumatized me, but I won’t go into that.

Went to all of her athletics, events, I loved her for her and always let her know how beautiful she was. She said she loved me but I never truly actually felt it. Actions speak louder than words. How it ended is what hurt me the most. I sat her down at my apartment and respectfully told her how I felt and that I didn't want to be together anymore. I wished her the best and told her I still cared about her. She refused and said no and it took over 3 days for her to accept that it was over. She lied to her friends about me, demonized me, and showed absolutely no respect for everything I did for over 2 years. I put my feelings aside for her because whenever I had any issues or I was sad about something she always had something worse than me according to her. She never wanted to do anything with me. I wanted to go to parks and take walks and drives but it was always no. She is quite a miserable person.  It was gut wrenching to end because I loved her but it needed to happen.

Women are shaking butts and flashing boobs all over the shop these days, yet as soon as men express what they like sexually or something along those lines, they are shamed and attacked. People will call them “sexist” and “oppressive”, “fat-phobic”, even racist. 

I think this is why so many men are in this sub, their whole life’s they are told to suppress their thoughts and feelings, while being surrounded by others who don’t. This leads to these men feeling extremely alienated, destroying their confidence and they slowly give up on society until they have almost no social interaction at all. 

It’s not like it’s women’s fault or anything, and I do believe it’s most men’s job to be strong, but that doesn’t mean keep everything in. Express yourself to people, just don’t give them the opportunity to rip you apart, and I think a lot of men will grow in confidence.

Not only that I'm demisexual and it makes it harder for me to connect with people especially men because of my bad experiences with guys all my life none of it was romantic though. I just want one day a  guy that I am extremely attracted to and like we are friends first and in the end my love is finally reciprocated and to finally hear them say"" hey you look amazing today or I would love to show you off today"" 

But no I've never been in a relationship I've never done anything and if your gonna ask I've always put myself out there I always asked them out  didn't ask or just not think about love at all. I've done all of this throughout my school ( even college ).

All I got was unrequited love every single time and it hurts because I have depression and anxiety so for me being valuerable can be very hard for me to do and devastating. Once I do finally break down my walls and let go I have shove all those feelings right back into a box until the next person comes along rinse and repeat.

Unfortunately our love life is something that is completely out of our control I'm convinced it only finds certain people. 

And if your going to ask yes I do get asked out... it's majority older men who ask me out. ( not into older men and I've had some terrible experiences with that.

I do go to therapy I've been in therapy for 6 years and have been battling this problem since I was a kid I remember I actually wished to have a boyfriend as a kid and throw my coin in the well. 

Anyways thanks for listening I'm still having a hard time today but I really hope one day one damn day I'll have a boyfriend/husband and my love will finally be recpoicated and he will have the characteristics I do want in a guy and he is emotionally available and not unavailable. 

Unfortunately a lot of my friends don't understand my struggles and how long I've been doing this dating thing and even they are confused why I don't have any success. 

I do like a guy still but it was unrequited... 

Anyways thanks for listening hopefully we will all get through this together.",lonely,I wish I could control this part of my life,2022-03-11 07:31:02

3703,dogsrock69,1646940301,1,"In high school I had 3 best friends that I would spend so much time with and could just be myself around. My very best friend was the kind of friendship where you promised to marry each other if you werent married by 40 or something.

Well after high school I went 3 hrs away to college while 2 of them went to the same university and the other one settled in the next town over from them. So while I was away at school they would spend time together and I would see it pop up on different social media. It didnt bother me too much, I wasnt there to hang with them, ya know. I got to visit and meet up with them a few times when I was back in town, and 2 of them even came to visit me once at school, but other than that we were just in different places and on different timelines.

I think over time the effort and communication on both sides just dwindled, so it's on everyone, but I cant help feeling so alone, left out, and forgotten. I mean these were my best friends. Were out of college now, I live 3-4 hours away in a different state and we dont really talk anymore. My bestest friend has kids and got married (I was around when she got engaged, but found out the day of the wedding that she got married in a backyard wedding. Of which I saw pictures later of the 3 of them celebrating when I found out about it on fb). And another is getting married soon and idk if I'm going to hear about that wedding or even be invited and it makes me anxious and sad.

Growing apart is on all of us I think, but it just really sucks to see all 3 of them still together and I'm off on my own alone. I have my boyfriend, which I am grateful for him and his friendship, but it's not the same as having my girl best friends. I only came out of college with maybe 1 good girl friend, but we live 5-6 hours apart so I dont get to see her often either.

The whole situation just makes me sad and I want my friends again, but I also feel like maybe were different people now and I'm the oddball out. I want to reach out, but I'm also worried that if I do and try to rekindle our friendship, that itll only be me trying since they still have most of it and I have nothing.

Sorry for the long post, i needed somewhere to vent and I dont really have anyone else to turn to. Maybe I'll reach out soon, I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself.",lonely,I'm the friend that grew apart and it makes me sad and lonely.,2022-03-11 06:25:01
3704,Jurez1313,1646939658,1,"One of the basic human needs is Love and/or Belonging. And sure, I have *some* love from my family. But is it not better, or almost *necessary,* to have love, or a sense of belonging, in a community of your own? I don't truly feel like I ""belong"" in my family, they just humor me because I'm related to them. They're biologically programmed to love me.  

Seeing as I know that I have no chance at making new friends, let alone a romantic partner like I've been dreaming of since I was 12 (30 now), I am constantly lonely. My parents will eventually pass, my siblings move on to their own lives, and then I will be left totally and utterly alone. Why should I force myself to weather this misery and pain any longer? Why do I owe the few people who still love me (mainly, my parents) my presence?  

If you're wondering how I know, I'm not a fortune teller. But I know people. I know what they want in a romantic partner, and in a friend.  

Friends need common ground/interests, a sense of adventure (trying new things) and community (doing favors for each other/having each other's backs), and a sense of humor. Sure I might find someone as obsessed with video games and movies as I am, but I have no sense of adventure (way too anxious, shy, and risk-avoidant), don't have anything to offer in the sense of being able to do favors (not strong enough to help move furniture or w/e, not rich enough to lend money, etc.), and am not funny in the slightest.  

For a romantic partner, they want empathy, intelligence, ambition, confidence, physical attraction, wit/sense of humor, and preferably money. I might be empathetic but that's where my list of positive qualities begins AND ends. I'm not intelligent in the slightest. I have 0 ambition (no long-term goals, no dreams I want to fulfill, no ambitions to drive me). There's no one on this planet who could possibly find me attractive. I don't think I've ever told an original joke or made an off-hand comment that anyone has ever laughed at. And I can't even afford to move out of my parent's house. Hence, I have absolutely no confidence whatsoever. I honestly don't even know what confidence looks, feels, or seems like - which is kind of a must if I were to ""fake"" it.  

&amp;nbsp;  

So yeah, I wake up every day wishing I hadn't. I go to bed every night squeezing my pillow as tight as I can, pretending it's another human being that actually cares about me, soaking it in tears. I ""work"" every day, so my parents don't kick me out of their home. I can't go on like this. But I've tried every conceivable way to improve my life, or my outlook on it, to no avail. I'm getting closer and closer to permanently solving this problem.",lonely,"No chance at making friends, let alone a romantic partner. Loneliness doesn't even begin to cover it.",2022-03-11 06:14:18

A blank screen with a blinking cursor. 

What is lonely? It's different for everyone. Do we decide it? Is it made? Is it some curse or sickness?

The cursor blinks, and you press keys to produce words. The words are sent, but who sees it?

Do the words of our soul get seen in soulless letters on a page?  


When am I angry?!

When am I sad...?

When do I just feel normal?

Loneliness is something complex, seen and unseen, heard but lacks noise.  


What does loneliness do?

A hand out stretched but unable to grab it?  
Your problem vocalized and brushed away by someone else?  
No patience granted no matter how much you've given?  


What does loneliness do?

Stomachache in your stomach?  
A quickening of breath in the dead of night?  
Wandering thoughts with an endless stare?

People cause it without care.

People cause it feeling justified.

People cause it for their own satisfaction.   


No matter the whens, the whats, the questions unanswered.  
People cause it.

A desire for acceptance leads to people denying?

A desire for love leads to people hating?

The past couple of months I’ve lived with my boyfriend and his family. Of course me and sister have grown really close. Well recently me and her went to visit her sister at college. I thought we were all very close friends. Well, all weekend they basically ignored me and wouldn’t dance with me and it just felt like I was babysitting. They’re a bit younger than me like 19 and 20. I was so shocked and hurt by this bc they both have ex friends that would kinda use them and they always talk shit about them. But then after that weekend I couldn’t help but feel used. Im only their friend when it’s convient to them it seems like. 

Ever since we got home it’s been really awkward since we live together and I just want my space away from them. I obviously will be friendly with them, they’re my boyfriends little sisters.

All my best friends live so far away so when I really thought we were true friends, it just hurt to realize I don’t mean anything to them. Maybe it’s our age gap idk.

Even though I'm quite lonely now days. I've been in a relationship before and I've had good friends before. So it's easy for me to be content in my loneliness, because I know what it's like to not be lonely. I don't have to question whether or not I'm worthy of love. It might not even be the company that makes you feel connected, it's the desire for someone to want to connect with you in the first place that makes the difference.

I still remember the time before I got into my first relationship and I saw other couples happy, and it made me feel like I was missing out, that I was a failure. I remember my friend making fun of me for not being in a relationship and I was so insecure I raged at him. 

I wish all here would find the relationships and friendships that they crave, not only because it's nice to experience but mostly because it makes you realise that you don't need them to be happy. It's a cruel thing that you'll only know how much you don't need something until you actually get it. 

If I could go back to my virgin self who quite frankly rushed into a relationship I would try to reason with him that even if I went the rest of my life without ever knowing love, I could still be happy and find fulfillment from within but he probably wouldn't listen. It's like imagine if everyone was talking about secret wisdom in a book and, having read the book, I go up to the people who haven't read it and tell them you don't need the wisdom in the book, you can find it within and they tell me it's easy for you to say you've read the book. Or something, I suck at analogies. 

I'll probably go to bed now, but if anyone wants to talk I frequent Reddit (maybe a little too much) and am willing to talk with people tomorrow and beyond to make them feel a little less lonely. I've had a couple of conversations with people on here before and they usually go ghost, but I'm ok with that. Even if I can just make your day a little brighter I'll try.

Hello! My name's Liam Brooks. I am originally from Glasgow, however, I currently live in Elgin, Northern Scotland. My interests include: trains, buses, cars, music, photography, headphones, and snakes. I am pansexual. I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety, autism, and bipolar disorder, I understand if this causes you to be deterred from me, I'm sorry.

Since October 2021 I've lost pretty much all reason to live and the only thing that's keeping me alive is the fact I'm too scared of the pain before death.

If anyone would like to talk feel free to DM me or comment on this post. I can be quick to reply at times and slow at others, so sorry about that. However, I'm available to talk most days as I no longer attend school due to mental health problems, I intended to stay until S6 to get the most out of school but I just couldn't and now I hate myself for it.

I've been friends with this woman (25F) for 5 months now and so far we seemed to get along pretty well. We met once (since we live 2 hours away, we met on a gaming Discord) and did a facetime call a couple of days ago. We've had several calls too. 

However I'm so scared that I've lost her as a friend as a result of my stupidity. I was so worried and wanted to check up to see if she's doing okay because she had a lot going on in her life. So I did the unthinkable and left multiple unanswered missed calls on her device and asked her to reply to me via text on Wednesday evening.

I'd often turn to her for words of comfort and to be soothed sometimes. I'd do the same with her. She made me complete, it was almost like I was e-dating her. 

Then this morning, she replied via text that it was way too much for her to take in and didn't know how to respond. I'm so scared that I've lost a friend here because we got on so well and had plenty in common. She isn't the greatest texter (she'd text every 24-48 hours using lengthy responses) and I appreciate that but surely if you're good friends you should at least reply to their phone calls or texts rather than straight up ignore them? 

As a result I'm feeling distraught and need to get this off my chest. I've contacted a few friends and they're currently trying to help me out with the situation. They're all advising me to leave her alone for at least 3 days but the main issue is that I've worried I've lost her.

3772,penguramalura,1646893300,1,"Hello, 


I've been on immune system suppressants for nearly half my life. I can count the times I left my neighborhood on the fingers of one hand this pandemic. I am thankful I can work remotely, but I am not sure what I'm doing is healthy.  

My doctors are happy about how seriously I took the pandemic. But I'm not sure if nearly any of my experiences count if I had them all through a screen. 

I think I make people uneasy. Since I got sick very young, I always imagined my peers treated me like an alien. Imagine two scenarios. One - a person you knew who was the loud mouth in the group gets such huge news that their whole life changed around it. My response was to hyper focus on studying and working out (joke being if I ended up in a wheel chair, I'd at least want to look good). I think people don't relate to someone like that - someone doing their best even with the dealt hand. Tying into the next scenario - I read a lot of posts of people like me getting sick later in life and they give into despair. I think there is beauty in struggling to the end. People can't understand if I never have gotten sick, I'd just be a loser. I acted because I had to to be competitive. 

The second - I lack empathy for most troubles. I understand sometimes people need to vent, but unless someone is dead or dying, I just imagine their problem is that they stubbed their toe. It is usually meaningless.

I think even if I were still surrounded with people, I'd still feel lonely. If there were no pandemic, I'd still catch people's colds while we had our empty conversations. I think it is mostly how I act, I've had several coworkers I am on good terms with that accused me of thinking I'm better than everyone else. I'm sickly, I see myself disadvantaged to a normie, but I suppose I built my own advantages too. 

I dunno, I wanted to share I'm an unfeeling monster I guess. I've gotten obsessed with many hobbies over the years and the interactions I had with others have been hollow even with shared interests. I haven't tried to get a social online hobby since the pandemic started and I left the office. With that, I suppose I ought to try again. I just think most people my age are set in their ways at this point. I imagine they had the same friends since chilhood-college, meanwhile I moved almost every year and luckily I was forced to get my phoney people skills instead of being shut in quiet-shy when growing up.

I think that I only have about 3-4 years to live.  I'm not sick and dying or anything, but there's a catastrophe and I'm not sure I'm going to try to survive it, so I want to make the most of these next few years.

I've always been a loner, but I've never quite been this isolated before.  It's really weighing on me.

I used to be able to make friends on the internet fairly easily, but I don't know why I can't any more.  The technologies haven't really changed.  Plenty of people still use IRC, there's Reddit here, and a whole fediverse out there.  Yet I don't use them, I guess except for a couple posts on Reddit, most of which are more or less crazy.

I guess I wanted to post this to see if I still exist.  Sometimes I worry I've become a Madoka Magica witch, and I'm all alone in a labyrinth I've created, where there are nothing but dream characters and my wish become a curse.  Or it could be a What Dreams May Come (either Matheson book or Robin Williams film) scenario to similar effect.

Well there are still two people who pay me visits here in my labyrinth at least I'm pretty sure are real, though only text messages can make it in and out.  Sometimes I can use my VR headset to get to the Summerland briefly, but it's difficult for me.  I even made my own avatar, but that didn't help make vibrating high enough to get to that layer of reality any easier.  Instead my vibration always sinks lower, down here, I guess the humans call this hell, but hell is only what you bring with you.

Why would I do this to myself?  I wish I could understand why it's so hard for me to be around other people.  Being around other people was never easy for me, but I don't think it ever used to be this hard.  For now I just cry a lot.",lonely,being here with so many lonely people,2022-03-10 15:36:38

After having interacted with my co-workers, I have fallen in the realisation of how lonely I am: I never get text messages at work, my weekend is spent at home doing chores and playing games, I can count how many calls I get every month with a single hand and so on. Working has helped me overcome some of the emotions I have experienced I must admit, but this disconnect between my life and that of others is of grave concern to me.

I have this desire to meet other people and do new things but I get this sort of jealousy and self-hatred whenever I see them have a better life in terms of emotional connections; I want to have meaningful relationships but I panick in fear that I'll get hurt by opening to someone. I spend a lot of time imagining a world where I am not this socially awkward, where I am courageous, etc. but I don't have the knowledge nor the experience to be this idealised version of myself.

Scrolling through social media makes matters worse, I see people hanging out, having fun together, people that I once considered friends but have forgotten about me after years. I feel dead while still breathing - forgotten of, disposed of.

It makes me sad and as much as I’d like to say that it won’t happen I know that eventually it will. We will fall out of touch, stop visiting or calling and it’ll really hurt. It took me ages to find true friends and it’s really depressing me that I’ll loose mine.

For anyone reading this, try and find comfort in what you've been presented in life. It doesn't always work, but it's kept me (somewhat) sane.

I've always been one of those forever alone people and it used to bother me, but I've started to make peace with who I am and what my fate is. I still have a desire for touch, but I find that you can simply bury it. Repressing gets a bad rep, but I don't think it's too harmful. It takes time but eventually you can make yourself so numb that the desire for touch and companionship goes away on its own. In fact, I'm now repelled by it. Even though, I'm relatively attractive now, (I used to be 300 pounds) And have had plenty of opportunity to score a date, (women try flirt with me occasionally) I always turn them down beacuse I realize that it's my place to be alone. For some reason I can't understand, It feels like The Gods have a plan and it requires me to remain single. Maybe that's a cope, maybe all of it is, but all I know is that I've found solace in my hobbies and artistic persuits.

3873,Gondal90,1646841804,1,"So I am looking for *OBJECTIVE* answers only. I am not interested in answers that are biased or influenced by personal feelings. I want to figure out the objective truth. 

So the problem is I have never really had friends even though I have always strongly desired to fit in and matter to other people. Growing up I was frequently bullied, experienced abuse, and severe neglect. This is a fact. These things really happened. I think the bullying, abuse, and neglect had a very strong effect on me psychologically. 

I developed deep rooted low self esteem, resentment, anger, sadness and insecurity. These feelings have always stayed with me. I frequently feel like I’m a worthless loser. The feeling of other people being accepted and loved while I am being ignored and left in the trash is extremely painful. 

Now since I have developed these deep rooted negative feelings I tend to get angry. When I feel like I am not being treated fairly I will get angry and perhaps lash out. This could make other people uncomfortable and could be a factor in my isolation. 

I’m 26. I never had a girlfriend. Hell I barely even have any friends. Sometimes my anger and insecurity drives people away. I also suffer from OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) which I have been diagnosed with by three different professionals. 

I have been to multiple therapists, a psychologist and a psychiatrist (I take medication too) for years. I have improved a lot of my problems but occasionally I still experience these negative feelings of anger and insecurity. Because I was so sheltered growing up I also lack social experience.

I’m not unattractive. (In my opinion). I would say I’m at least a 5/10 to 6/10. I don’t think my looks necessarily are the problem. 

So what is the objective reason I fail socially? Why does no one ever like me? Why have I never managed to get a single girlfriend?",lonely,Can someone help me figure this out?,2022-03-10 03:03:24

Many people on here say that a lot of people post about being lonely but no one finds friends here and it makes sense.

I think many people who do post dont have the energy / willpower to foster friendships with total strangers over that they both hate their life . If you immersed yourself in a new community or hobby you enjoy surely friendships would evolve easier and more natural do to sharing interest

For the past year I've been messaging on Instagram with a girl, we were really in touch with each other and she could make my day better with a single reply. Truth is yesterday i sent a love poem to her, and she left me on seen for 2 hours, then rejected me. I feel like a fool for doing it nobody could possibly like such a loser like me. She was the only one who gave me hope for life but  my heart got crushed once again. Now i lost her, and things without her are never gonna be the same, i feel so lonely and depressed.

my friends think I’m hilarious and they don’t believe me when I tell them I have never gotten attention from males in my life. I had one crush in my life but I know it’s not reciprocated, and this broke my heart a little.

it’s sad and I cried about this for the first time last night, when I realized that I’m the only person I know who’s not married/in a relationship/ had at least 1 person interested in me. Even though I might be ace, I’m very romantic and I love love etc.

Hi I'm Mira, I'm 18 and I'm from north Carolina. Ive been trying recently to make new friends and talk to people because I'm having alot of problems in my personal life, and altercations I don't entirely understand. I'm the oldest of 13 so I don't really have anyone to help me advice wise or depending on wise besides myself because typically I'm the one depended on haha. I don't have friends so I wanna make real ones or real associates I can consistently talk to. 


Anyways, I'm looking for real genuine people to talk to and be friends with. Preferably I'd like someone I can meet irl eventually and call on the phone and have a real connection with and be here for and they do the same for me, I really want someone to meet eventually because I've been online for so long and it irritates me sometimes because I have no physical social life to equal out with the online one so it gets boring eventually. Also I don't wanna be ignored and neglected. I respect myself alot and if I put time into you I'd really like the same! 


I'm ADHD, so I get hyper and giddy alot, I have iron deficiency so I sleep alot, and I'm weak a large majority of the time. I have really bad anxiety so If I get comfortable with you enough I may just sometimes push you away because of my anxiety I don't do it purposely. So please have patience with me. If you dm me I'll probably sit back and see if you're gonna put effort in our friendship and stuff and see if you're a genuine person so! I love video games, cooking, sleeping obviously, I draw occasionally and stuff like that!


If you wanna be friends please be 18-21. And from the US or Canada! Please be respectful and don't try to make me uncomfortable- I love and accept everyone so; and if you're funny that's even better! (〃ﾟ3ﾟ〃)",lonely,18f who needs a genuine person!,2022-03-09 16:46:18

3925,jaynotnaws,1646804627,1,"this will probably be a bit long but yeah. i'm in my mid 20's and live at home. it's fine, i don't feel like a failure because i live at home and my parents don't mind so much. i have two siblings who somewhat care about me and my mom who cares about me and a somewhat broken relationship with my father. i have a lot of mental health issues, emetophobia, agoraphobia, anxiety, depression (which in turn has locked me away at home). so the only human contact i have is with my family. i used to go out and have friends back in hs/college. however my phobias started getting worse and i couldn't hang out with anyone anymore so i distanced myself from all my ""friends"". i don't think of them as actually truly friends, i never did so that loss never weighed on me. i miss socializing but i don't miss those specific people. i spent about two years where the only people i spoke to were my immediate family and the general small talk on errands. zero texts. i eventually joined a music community online where i made a lot of friends. a lot of which i think truly cared for me. so i was happy. sure they were online friends but they were nice and we'd exchange presents and hand written letters and they'd constantly check up on my well being which made me feel loved. eventually my mental problems became an issue again and i pushed everyone away. and now i'm alone again. no friends. don't go out. only talk and see my family. it feels worse than before though because my mom fell sick. doctors don't know what's wrong with her but she's been basically bed ridden for two years. i'm scared of losing her, she's the one person who truly cares for me. my younger sister started working and her priorities seem to be her friends and socializing which she's young and i understand but i used to be her best friend and now i come in second. my brother is nice to me but we've never been super close. and my dad has told us that once my mother passes we'll each be on our own. it's scary because i'm not okay. i can't work. i can't even leave my house without feeling physically ill. i'm in therapy now and i'm working on my phobias but it seems like a long road ahead until i'll be fully independent and well. and it's scary, once i lose my mom i'll be all on my own. i've also never dated, never been kissed, never done anything. i don't crave romance or love just companionship. but the idea that i don't just have to carry my problems but that of a partner as well seems overwhelming right now. also i'm scared someone will get tired of me and tell me they can't deal with me and my problems but i think that just stems from insecurity. it really sucks. feeling like a liability and a burden. being so dependent on others. i try to not think of the future but it's inevitable. i truly think i'll be alone forever. i just hope i can make it.",lonely,scared of the future,2022-03-09 16:43:47

3927,godzila_thehamr,1646804209,1,I have been very lonely these past couple of months. Sometimes so much so that I feel physical pain and start breathing heavy which has never happened until recently. I have even lightly cried over it which is very very unusual for me to do as I usually never cry about anything.  I have never had much of a real connection with anyone including parents and siblings for several reasons.  I do have 1 good friend who is my current roommate but he is not here most of the time because of work or is with his girlfriend and I work from home so most days are spent completely alone with no one to talk or interact with. I used to be ok with being alone as I was so used to it but as I get older and have moved out I find myself longing for a true genuine connection. I have never been on a date or anything like that as I am very introverted and can be socially awkward for example I likely wouldn't go out of my way to talk to someone unless i have already been around them several times and have gotten to know them somewhat.  I just want to be held or hold someone so bad. It has even began to effect my daily life as I find myself sitting in bed for hours in the mornings instead of getting up and working and I usually spend an hour atleast trying to get over the longing to fall asleep next to someone before I finally become tired enough to fall asleep anyways.  The only time I ever leave my apartment is to get groceries or go to the gym so that doesnt help my lonliness much either. I still have alot to say but dont know how to say it so I'll leave it at this for now. Sorry for the wall of text with no paragraphs and thank you if you read this.,lonely,Lonely and touch starved.

3929,TopSecretAccountShhh,1646801853,1,"Hi everyone, 

As the title says, I have friends, but a lot of times it feels as though I do not.  

I don’t hang out with anyone really and I recently moved 9 hours away from my hometown. I live alone and I absolutely love it!! I’m a creative person so I’m able to dive deep into my hobbies and get lost in the world of my interests. However, sometimes I think it would be nice to spend some time with another person, a friend. But since I’ve moved, I don’t have anyone to hang out with (other than my partner who I met when I moved). 

I won’t blame the distance on how I feel about my interpersonal relationships. Even when I lived in my hometown, it felt as though I didn’t have many friends. Sure, I had people to physically hang out with, but even during some of the hang outs that I would have with people, it didn’t always feel as though we were bonding as friends. Sometimes, it felt more as though we could’ve been using one another for company and/or comfort. That wasn’t always the case, I’ve had great times with people regardless if we were using one another as an outlet to vent or distract us from our loneliness.. but what I’m really trying to say is, I don’t feel like I have a strong friendship bond with anyone. 

Sure, yeah, I have friends. People who I support, who support me, and people who I’ve helped who have also helped me (tremendously). And I am extremely blessed for those people. However, I don’t have anyone in my life who I run and tell the details of my day about, or who I go to ask for help and support without feeling like I’m being a bother. 

I used to have close friends and best friends when I was in grade school.. and although some of those friendships deteriorated or we just drifted apart, it was nice to have someone I could go to, to talk to and be my true/silly self around. 

Now, I can only ever be my true self when I’m alone.. and conversations over the phone just don’t last (which is understandable as an adult living an adult life). Sometimes I think about going out to make friends, but I don’t really want to? I guess? I think about it, and I’m like, I’d prefer to invest more time into my hobbies.. but idk. I still feel this missing sense of connection and I’m not sure what it is. Maybe I’m looking for a reflection of myself? A person who understands me without judging me or my dreams? A person who shares my love language of affection and attention but is also passionate and independent in the same ways that I am. A person who thrives off of imagination! I don’t know… i feel like a puzzle piece to a missing puzzle haha. I am currently going to therapy to work on interpersonal relationships but I just thought I’d share to the void of Reddit.

The few „Friends“ i had were always talking Bad about me behind my back and only they talked to me if they needed something.
And when my friends got popular in school They forgot about me completly and left me standing alone always in the school yard.
My dad was always against socializing and forbid me to have friends so i had some secretly.
Until today i have no friends but the strange thing is that i dont care anymore about that and i found peace within that whole being alone.
Because when i try to make friends people lose interest so fast and just talk with the others and then also forget me. 
3 years ago i had a good online friend and we both were chatting everyday and had always fun the same humor, same likes and dislikes we were talking the whole night and day if we got the time, it was such a wonderful time, our friendship was lasting 2years until suddenly my best friend changed, only answered me short and then suddenly ghosted me.

3952,Waste_Fox2968,1646790113,1,"Alt account, I'm afraid of posting on my main, pretty long post. 

To people, I'm funny, empathetic, and very approachable because I listen to their problems without judgment. The actual me is bitter, blunt, sarcastic and have lots of trust issues from past relationships and a overall shitty life. Friendships wouldn't last long because people saw me as a miserable person who “ruins the vibes”. So I decided to hide those qualities and just show people the good, socially acceptable of me. Whenever there's an argument in the group chat, harassment, etc, I would just bite my tongue and just wait for the storm to pass. I don't whine, complain, argue, get angry, sad (unless it's the appropriate time to be “sad” like a sad movie being played). This gets more people to talk to me because I appear neutral but understanding. I'm not a smart person so I don't dare to ask questions or people will judge me for not knowing. 

Honestly, I just tell both sides that it wasn't their fault and that I can understand why they said or felt that way so everyone feels valid and like me. I have my thoughts on the matter but I can't share them or ill get lumped in or this somehow causes people to not like me b/c I took aside. I have to constantly be careful of what I say and show constraint. I even have still keep up the nice act when someone is rude or passive-aggressive to me. This would end up my apologizing to just get on people's good side.

It's getting so exhausting to keep up the fake act so I have a journal I vent all my pent-up frustration, anger, and other negative emotions I have for people or bad things that happened in a day. Other than people venting their problems to me, there's no one I feel comfortable confiding with my problems. Would be great if I had one person who saw through my fakeness and understood me so I can just let the mask fall for once. But then again I don't want that because I fear I'll get judged and exposed for being fake and I don't want that used against me. I've worked so hard to keep up my likable image for so long I don't want to do anything that risks that image or ill be alone again. 

Well I and anyone can argue I'm alone regardless. In this case, I  have to sacrifice something to receive something. I will always feel lonely, bitter, and the other socially unacceptable negative feelings, no amount of therapy will change that- because it’s just who I am and how I view life and was molded. No one wants to deal with my baggage so I hold onto my own while carrying others up.",lonely,"I'm fake, but it gets me “friends” and people to talk to but no one to confide in",2022-03-09 12:41:53

3959,SUCKMYASS420690,1646788245,1,"Everyday, when I walk to school, study, watch a movie or litsen to music, I'm all alone. Always. I have a couple of people, not friends, (they've made that clear), who I spend my time in recess with. I kinda just sit with them, that's kinda it. They've told me they seem as the guy who just follows them around, that's the result of a two year ""relationship"", or whatever the fuck it is. I have online ""friends"" too, but we rarely talk as they spend most of their time with their real friends. I've never kissed a girl, held someones hand or hugged one except my mom. Girls have never given me attention, and I'm pretty sure I've never gotten a compliment by one. Hell, when I think about it girls are uncomfortable just looking at me. I'm not ugly or anything, I mean I'm not attractive, I guess I'm a bit lower then average or whatever. It's just that I give them this sense of depression, (a girl told me this herself, which is probably the longest conversation I've ever had with a woman, or any person fot that matter). She told me that just looking at me made her feel depressed. I was suprised, I thougt I looked pretty normal but I guess not. Anyways the point is that I'm the lonliest person in my school. I have no one, and no one has me. My parents barely know anything about me and my sister is a literall psychopath who'll do anything to get what she want's. I spend most of my days alone in my room playing video games, watching movies, reading comic books, litsening to music, etc. I get about 3-4 hr of sleep everyday, I can't sleep, and I've tried everything. The only that makes me fall asleep is crying, which I do every night, when the feeling of stress, depression and loneliness hits the hardest. I feel empty, alone and desperate. And pain hits me everyday. When I was a child I was screamed at and molested by my stepfather, no one knows about the molested part. The ignorance and shame that experience have brought me is unmessurable. And on top of that I was also groomed by a man who I'm not even sure existed as I don't remember anything about him. Let me explain; when I was a kid there was this communal playground right outside of our apartment. I live quite away from school so I didn't really have anyone to play with, so I was usually alone. I was probably 6-7 at the time, but my mother was comfortable leaving me alone as she could see me right through the window. Anyways I remember how this man used to come to me and chat. He asked me how I was, what I wad playing, etc. Nothing major, it became a thing. Anyways, later I told my mom about this man and she strickly forbid me to be with him (duh), and ever since that she keept a close eye on me when I was playing. Later, when I was playing this man came to me and asked me how I was, etc. The usuall, but I told him that I was not allowed to talk to him, and ever since that he left me alone. I don't remember anything else about the man and my mom never mentiond it again, so I'm not entirely sure if it happened, what if I made it all up? IDK. lol.
My parents have been divorced since I was 2 years old and we've moved quite alot because of financiall isuess. I've never had a real friend since my childhood and I think the only way to end my anger and sadness is to kill myself. I hate everyone and this stupid world. I see the sins of man everyday and the disgust it brings and I can't do anything about it, I feel worthless. I've talked to professionals and I'm actually meeting this ""speciall"" psychiatrist in about a week, but it has never really helped.

3992,indiums_895,1646769364,1,"Just a thought. Do any 20-ish people think/act too mature for their age and do you think that negatively effects friendships with people your own age? 

I’m 21, 0 friends, no partners. I’ve always been an old soul; love economics and geopolitics for example. But I’m struggling to make a single friend who has similar interests. I’m rather organised and take initiative which I guess some people confuse for a form of situational control. My housemates are rather lazy, meaning I take care of organising bills and paperwork. 

Has anyone found any similar experiences when dealing with people your own age that are way less mature/emotionally mature then you? 

Any advice is welcome because I’m kinda freaking out. I came out of the womb practically reading the NY Times. I remember talking more to my school friends parents then them at dinner for example. Is any of this concerning? 

I feel like it’s a blessing and a curse being years ahead in emotional maturity than my peers but it really sucks that I’m about to turn 22 and still have no meaningful relationships with anyone.

But now, over 10 years I've been fighting this garbage, taking whatever meds, seeing whatever therapists, going to whatever experimental treatments my doctors told me to.

Sure, I could lose some weight. Force myself to take up a hobby that I loathe. Fake my way to becoming interesting. Lie and cheat my way into a career I don't deserve, so that I can seem just ambitious enough to be attractive. But why would I want a fake life? I want to be me. I want to be loved for who I am now, not some fake, romanticized version of myself.

For me, I lost my job, lost my marriage, lost a cat, had to rehome my dog, lost my house and on top of all that, as I’m sure many will understand, I lost my mental health.

Through what I will forever refer to as ‘ the shittening’, I isolated myself from almost everyone. However, I came out the other side knowing exactly who my best friends were. 

I’ve turned my life around - I have a job (albeit a completely different industry to before), I have my own little rented 1 bed flat, I see my son a few times a week and I just generally feel like there’s a bit of hope left in the universe for me.

All that said, I cannot shake the crippling loneliness I feel when I get home from work. I miss having someone ask me how my day way, I miss asking someone else how their day was. Don’t get me wrong, living alone is great - right now I prefer it! But I just miss that ability to connect with someone, romantically or platonically.

Well, maybe not that good. People say I'm an attention seeker which is partly, well actually, *very true*.

It brings me great joy, motivation, and a sense or relevance that I do not receive from my real life.

I like putting others down to make them feel inferior and give myself a sense of superiority. Some say I'm a narcissist but personally I don't care what they say because I think I'm a cool person. But, maybe I do care - I just don't want them to point it out.

Ok. 

China genocide of the Arabs. We send a sports elite delegation there for the Winter Olympics and they carry our flag. France is one of the biggest arms dealers in the world. Our country is part of a military Union who interferes in the affairs of West Asian and North African countries to steal their oil and precious resources under the guise of fighting the ""scourge"" of terrorism. George W. Bush has the blood of hundreds of million people on his hands and he has been adulated and whitewashed. He is the greatest murderer that the last centuries of bloody war have brought and he is free. Europe has a dictatorship. Belarus. This situation is ethically unacceptable but diplomatically it is a boon. Thanks to this dictatorship where the people suffer, the European Union has a platform for exchange between itself, NATO and Russia. 

Do you think we are the good guys? Cute. Good guys only exist in dreams.Vladimir Putin, unfortunately, has the diplomatic legitimacy to regain control of the territories of the former USSR, do you know why? Because Moscow was promised after the fall of the USSR that NATO would not approach the bloc of the east. We have not kept our promises and that is quite normal, the only goal of the great powers is to eat up territories, destroy minds, cultures, annex the will to live of people who are not like them to better force them to adhere to their new religion. 

Religion. Do you know what religion is? No, not spiritualism, that's out of fashion. Today the dominant religion is capitalism and ultra-liberalism. People give their money as an offering to the anonymous gods of the consumer empire hoping to get what the prophets promise them through advertising. Want to know how to manipulate a human's emotions? Ask an advertiser. Have you ever looked at real time world maps of business interactions around the globe? Have you ever watched World War Z? The scene when humans form a climbing mountain to jump the giant wall? It is the same with people in real life. They step on each other to achieve the ideal of fame and notoriety. Do you know what an ideal is? It is something that cannot be achieved. It is a motivation to move forward in life. It's the carrot hanging from the stick attached to the head of the mule. The point of having your very own ideal is to develop the right VALUES to pursue it in your own way. The real problem here is that no one pursues the ideal of life that they really would like anymore. The ideal has become the tool of great powers. Speaking of great powers, do you know the people who direct all the agricultural wealth of the planet? It's hard to find but not so hard to remember. 4 families is easy to remember. Oh you did not know that your Food was produced by only 4 of the most powerful families on earth? So how do you feel about not knowing who produces what you eat? Or how they do it? Or where they do it? Imma give you an interesting little item : The most potent beer brands in Europe contain around 300 times the allowable dose of glyphosate in drinking water and glyphosate has very adverse effects on people's physical and mental health. Despite this established fact by a number of independent health institutions, we continue to sell them to people, not because they want us to be sick, it's just because our decision-makers are threatened by the World Organization of Commerce. 

Forget your fake enemies. Trump? He just took advantage of the despair of society's forgotten people to maintain his myth. He is no worse than any other president. Diplomats, politicians... a joke. Do you know what theater is? Do you know why theater appeared in our civilizations? To distract the population by making them forget their problems in order to minimize the risks of revolutions. Do you think only one man has the ethical legitimacy to represent an army or a country? You are wrong. We were never meant to be gods and that goes for absolutely everyone. The truth is that our president is probably more informed and disillusioned than the entire French population. That's why he's in charge. It's because he's a good actor. 

You know, it's not really anyone's fault. It is far from being so simple. You know why we got so powerful? It's because we are, at the base, genetically, naturally, the weakest mammals on this planet while being among the most capable of reproducing. We compensated for our weakness with our survival instinct and by reproducing. We started making tools and developing a conscience. It was there that we became aware of our fatal weakness, so to continue living we developed Civilization. The civilization. Thanks to that we were able to develop even more, reduce human suffering. Today we are faced with the inherent problem of this concept of civilization. Civilization is an ecosystem within the ecosystem that saw us born and that was imagined by humans FOR humans. It never lasted and it never will. Since the Sumerians we repeat the same mistakes again and again. We build a glass tower without the right tools hoping it will hold despite the impossibility of it working, we spend hundreds of years trying to hold it together, it only works in a part, a certain percentage of the population will always suffer as much as before, or even more, and in the end, everything collapses. This is because we CAN'T re-create the stability that Earth created. It's a breath, that's how it works. 

In your opinion, where do you think we are? 

What would a shrink have to say to that? ""You seem very depressed to me, you seem mentally disturbed, how about trying a new molecule?"" Well then. Classic. 

Knowing all this, they're hoping that I forget and that I show misplaced optimism. Humanity is made to suffer. Our artificial world will soon collapse and they hope that I close my eyes, sitting on the couch of a burning house. I'll tell you what I am in this society: a cancerous cell, and the other healthy cells are trying to kill me. You will tell me ""and so, what about the health professionals?""

They’re just in my social media that follow me and besides leaving a like, never speak to me, so can’t do them either.

I’m happy I’m getting around to going, but it really sucks going alone. I always wanted to go places with somebody, but being alone and going by myself just makes me worry the experience will be empty. I’m hopeful I’ll have a good time, I’m just worried it wont live up to the standard I wanted it to be.

4030,marxistwolfie,1646748476,1,"I don’t know where else to go with my thoughts: 
I just feel extremely lonely. I’m 26F and have just nobody who cares about me or even talks to me. I’m not important to anyone.
I never had a really close family- I’m an only child, my mom (to whom I had a bad relationship with lot of mistreatment from her) died of cancer when I was 17. She divorced my Dad when I was 6 and I only am in contact to him occasionally. I think that he loves me, but he is also extremely self-centered and does neither listen to me nor understand me. My aunts and uncles are not interested in any family life and want to live their own lifes separately. In my childhood and when I was a teenager I never had any friends and was bullied instead because I was so socially awkward and have apparently (I’m in the diagnosis process now) ADHD. In my early twenties I adopted a very unhealthy lifestyle with drugs alcohol and a lot of partying and therefore finally found some friends who wanted to party with me. Of course those were no real friends and a soon as I went back to my very health conscious more silent lifestyle they were no longer interested in me. I have a boyfriend, and moved to a new city with him because of his job, but he is extremely addicted to video games (no, not just normal gaming for fun, I like this too, but 24/7 besides his work staring into the screen), does not talk to me and only gets extremely annoyed when I talk to him, as his video games are most important to him (he also told me that). I go to university in my new city, but am the social outcast once again. Also it’s mainly online courses. For 99% of the day I’m just alone in my bedroom and just wish that anybody would care. I tried sooo much to fit in, but I have no energy anymore, it’s just too exhausting. I’m in therapy at least and was also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (regarding illnesses) and recently also with depression. I don’t know why I’m posting this or what I’m hoping for.

4036,ArabofWar,1646745331,1,"Hi and first of all I apologize for my English.

For several months I have felt very lonely, bored, have wanted a relationship, felt very shit in short. Towards the end of 2021, I started with martial arts and I have now been doing it for almost 1 year, the same as I work in a job that I really enjoy. All of this has kept me busy and made me not be so lonely or in a way not think about it, if that makes sense.

what i'm trying to say is that something that has helped me not think about loneliness, boredom etc ... is finding something that keeps you busy. An example I want to mention is last week, I was at work from morning to afternoon and then I went home ate a little, then I went straight to sparring that lasted about 1 hour. After sparring I went home, showered, ate a little and went out again for my second training session which lasts for 2 hours.

So all day I did not think about anything, I did not think that I was lonely, that I was bored or anything like that. When I got home I see that I have spent my whole day on something.

so I have in a way replaced loneliness with something I love and it has made me a little happier. i also feel like keeping oneself busy is good. 

the only thing i really want now i a relationship, but i guess that will come someday. 

if anyone wants to talk, i will try to respond.",lonely,Maybe try to replace your loneliness?,2022-03-09 00:15:31

4039,grapefruitnotebook,1646740693,1,"I know this kind of post has been made a hundred times but I just need to vent somewhere, so please bear with me.

I'm a shy introverted homebody with a good family and I've never really felt loneliness before college. I've had the same small circle of 3 friends since I was 13, and spend most of my time with my family. I felt completely fine the way I was, and I even prided myself for being good at ""being alone"" at some point. (but I guess I wasn't truly alone because I was still around family)

I'm now in my 2nd semester of college and it has positively been the worst experience of my life. At the beginning the entire college experience was so overwhelming and I was in a pretty bad mental space. I was really shy and withdrawn (which I regret, of course) and didn't manage to make any friends. This semester, I joined some clubs and decided to start opening up and taking the initiative to interact and ask people out for meals or to hang out, but the effort was never reciprocated. Everyone seems to have found their friend groups and I don't think anyone has ever asked me to hang out with them (yeah, that hurts). All my ""friendships"" are so superficial and transactional and I eat all if not most of my meals alone in my room. I'm so fucking lonely! I see people hanging out on social media, my close friends tell me about their new friends and god, I just wish I had some actual and deep friendships in college like everyone else. 

This loneliness has been sitting in my bones for the past few months, and I don't know how to handle it. I don't even feel like myself anymore; I journal every day and the entries are just non-stop depressing and pathetic shit. I used to think I was a decent person, I mean, my 3 friends like me. But now it seems like no one wants to even be near me. I can't help but wonder if my loneliness is making me a shell of my former self.

I go to a college about 2 hours away from home so I go back every weekend. Every week all I look forward to is going back home and spending time with my family. And as much as I love my parents, I'm now finding it kind of pathetic that I spend so much time with them instead of living my youth or whatever. I feel terrible all the time. The only time this feeling diminishes is when I'm home during the weekends. I got homesick so much at the start of college, but it's not even homesickness anymore. 

Anyway, I don't think I'm looking for advice, but maybe some comfort instead. Do things get better? Does anyone relate to this? Am I going to be lonely for the rest of my life since I can't even make friends in a college environment?",lonely,never felt lonely before until college and it sucks,2022-03-08 22:58:13
4040,Nottakenuser2222,1646739797,1,"So I have some folk I hang out with only person I'm close to . I've figure my identity and I've only got two years until I can transition beacuse I know my folk would ignore me and just keep misgendering me and be against any medical transition.  

My folk can be bad when it comes to emotions but even when everything is fine and their actually doing well at being parents for once I'm still upset,  still paranoid, still struggling to balance everything and I just desperately want to know what's wrong with me .

I hate myself.  I think I'm a bad person even if the thing I did wasn't a big deal and I can even go a while without a panic attack over stupid things.  I've been told to act my age when I display my anger or sadness but even when I am fine I'm never properly happy I feel like there's void.  I just want to feel the way as a did when I was younger, that kind of feeling you'd get about Christmas or going to a fair or something. 

I know I'm not okay but I'm too afraid to go to a therapist or try be diagnosed with something incase I'm wrong and I'm just a miserable person.  I do vent to my closest friend but I dont like venting to them , I didn't wanna to worry them or ruin their mood and make them sad .

4060,082632340,1646725728,1,"I [F34] grew up in a violent, emotionally &amp; mentally abusive home. I had material things, a clean home, went on holidays but I was being hit, insulted, put down &amp; shouted at. My mother used to knock my confidence aswell.
I always had a charm about me &amp; could befriend people easily &amp; to make up for being hated at home, I decided outside of home I'd be liked. I was extremely popular &amp; always surrounded by friends. When I got to my adult years I continued to be popular, I got invited to all of the parties &amp; hung around with cool people &amp; even real gangsters.
However that didn't stop me from avoiding abuse. I had a string of abusive relationships, I ended up homeless due the abuse I was experiencing at home with my family, when I reported the abuse the police they turned it around on me &amp; arrested me, luckily my charges got dropped shortly afterwards but my family was let off &amp; my trust in the authorities had been destroyed.
I had friends turn on me &amp; physically attack me because they were jealous of the men I dated. I could handle myself due to growing up with violence I grew into a good fighter, but despite 'winning' these unprovoked fights they still messed up my head &amp; had me looking over my shoulders constantly.
I started to dislike people in general &amp; question my values. I began to withdraw from all of the popular people, the men I dated &amp; avoid the fakery, only keeping selective good people in my life.
I turned my life around &amp; my life got better &amp; better, then I got sick, nearly died &amp; I'm now sight impaired due to the complications of it. I don't *look* disabled, I blend in. I'm able to hide it well. I fear abuse, getting attacked down the street, I am distrustful of other people. I have beem diagnosed with complex PTSD &amp; anxiety.
Despite all of this I kept moving forward &amp; up in life. I have a beautiful home with two big beautiful gardens that I maintain. I have a few hobbies mostly related to nature stuff &amp; I love music. Despite my sight impairment I have an easy stress-free life now, I have a lot of material things &amp; before covid I went on vacations regularly. I wear really nice clothing &amp; have a sense of style. I have perfectly straight teeth, long hair &amp; a pretty face. That sounds crazy typing this now because I was conditioned for years by my family &amp; the men I dated that I was ugly &amp; I actually believed it....
Now my life has got better despite my disability those 'good' friends haven't moved up in life &amp; are now jealous that I have.
I've had to set healthy boundaries with them because of the sarcastic &amp; bitter undertones in the things that they say. They can get quite nasty with what they say &amp; try to test me to see how much they can get away with. I get told I'm lucky, I have it easy &amp; should be grateful for what I have when I set a new goal &amp; aim higher. I have tried to help them to think more positive, aim higher &amp; even enjoy days out with me but nothing works, they've grown into bitter people &amp; there's nothing I can do about it.
However I'm now in a very lonely place in my life. I literally have no friends, I have partner to share my life with. All I have is this easy life &amp; my home, pets &amp; gardens which I love &amp; adore &amp; I am extremely grateful for.
The truth is I could go out there &amp; meet new people but I'm actually terrified. I could also turn on my charm &amp; chat to people but I don't want to revert back to my old ways of trying hard to get people to like me.
I want to actually befriend people on an honest level both sides &amp; be able to be vulnerable &amp; express emotions &amp; feelings, listen to their emotions &amp; feelings without feeling it's unsafe to do so.
I'd like to meet nature loving, peaceful individuals who believe that we can make the planet better &amp; who are kind to children &amp; animals.

It sucks, because I have friends and I get along with my coworkers and I even have online friends I talk to, and yet I still feel completely alone. I'll be hanging out with a group of friends and feel it, and I'll be talking to coworkers and still feel isolated.

Sometimes I think it is because everyone has a person that they just are closest with, and it just never happens to be me. My two best friends are engaged to eachother, and my other two friends are dating. My online friends all have the one person in the group they are closest with, and coworkers have their favorites. I just never seem to be that favorite, or that special person. Obviously the offline friends make sense, because why wouldn't you be closest with your significant other? It just still feels bad.

I try hard not to think about it, but then my anxiety and depression keeps it in the front of my mind like it is right now, and I can't even talk about it with any of my friends because it's 12:45 at night and everyone is asleep.

How do you stop feeling lonely when it just doesn't add up right? Anymore making new friends doesn't help, because you're the new friend who isn't as important.

Anyways, that ends my vent. If anyone has tips or viewpoints on it feel free to comment or message. I doubt I go to bed soon and there's no better time to feel lonely that at night time.",lonely,Why am I so lonely?,2022-03-08 17:48:34

They're all also about 5 years older than I am.

I like my friends a lot. They're  really intelligent and funny and I appreciate their company, but it never feels reciprocated even though they say ""we're all best friends."" I  rarely get invited to anything that isn't directly related to the band, and while I do understand that my depression makes me difficult to be around, it still feels shitty. Any opinion I give is disregarded immediately, whether it be about music, media, politics, etc. Maybe I'm just a disagreeable person, idk. 

I think a lot of it stems from our differences in political opinions, and while I try to be understanding of other people's politics, the way they talk about LGBT+ issues makes me uncomfortable and angry. I just shut up whenever they talk about this because I really just don't know what to say to these people without blowing up and severing the friendship, because that would mean I lose out on my only outlet for being creative and (attempting) to meet new people. My entire life I've felt I need to hide my sexuality from the world after multiple attempts at coming out and facing consequences I wasn't equipped to deal with. The fact I still feel the need to hide this even around my ""best friends"" makes me feel like they aren't my friends at all, rather just more coworkers that I can't delve into deep personal issues with or vent to.

4077,FashionablePotato,1646718404,1,"I had no friends when I came to college in 2019. I found an acquaintance from high school and started a friend group, fell in love, and cultivated a really strong family that was built around me and my partner's relationship. For two years, I felt like I owned the world and my best friends were right there with me. 

I didn't meet anyone else; why would I need another friend group? I had a family.

I started to feel unwell when my partner moved back into their parent's home as a result of 2020. I couldn't stand the thought of being alone again like I was in high school, so I clung desperately to my partner and our little family. I didn't want to see that I was in a codependent relationship, so I blamed myself for feeling bad about our relationship. I always felt guilty when they were sad or unhappy. It felt like I was a failure if they were not 100% healthy or if I wasn't devoting every second of my day to them. I didn't do things because I wanted to, I did them because I needed to prevent the boat from rocking. I set no boundaries and paid the price by hating myself for the resentment that would inevitably cause. Over two years, all the pent-up feelings within me grew. I couldn't figure out why I was being such a bad partner, because I hated myself for having these resentments. I tried to talk to my partner, but it always caused a fight where I felt guilty again and again. 

The family I had was built around our relationship; we took care of our group like parents would take care of their children. How could I take care of myself when it would break everyone's heart? How could my relationship be toxic when everyone clearly saw how great we were together? How could I feel alone when I was surrounded by people?

I couldn't take it. I told my partner how I was feeling and they didn't believe me. They told me I must be imagining them being the villain. They broke up with me right there, after two years. They told their friends, our family, everything I said. I was so desperate to maintain that connection that I forced myself to remain friends with them, despite everything. I hated my own fucking guts. Everything I was terrified of was here, and I had caused it all. I couldn't sleep, I didn't eat, I stopped going to class, I stopped talking to everyone except for my little family. Why couldn't I have just been happy with what I had? 

One person from our family stuck with me. They supported me for the first week. Then, they told me that they had a crush on me that had been there since our first year at college. Everything was pretty clear after that. I stopped talking to anyone, and I started drinking and hooking up with complete strangers. It didn't help.

I cut every one of them out of my life. It has been 4 or 5 months now, and I still don't trust anyone. I have no network to reach out to, no family I trust to talk to. I'm lucky enough to have a therapist, but I can't seem to get out of this rut. I want to make friends, but the people I meet are not willing to put in the same level of energy as I am. 

I'm back to where I started. It's devastating to have a friend group and network be ripped away at the drop of a hat. I feel so incredibly lost and lonely that I barely eat. I'm beginning to climb up, but I feel overwhelmed and I keep falling back down. I know life will get better, but it is so distant that I can't imagine what that looks like.

I don't know how to start making new friends.

4091,Shot-Strike,1646713106,1,"This probably sounds so stupid, because I *know* that people like me or at the very least are entertained by me when I'm around. I am still so, so lonely. 

It just takes so much *work* to make people like me. I just want someone to talk to me instead of having to be the one to make myself so available and reach out and organize everything when somehow no one else has to do this. 

No one ever calls me or texts me first and I always have to physically go over and invite myself to plans in a group. I don't have the energy to invite myself to things or - when I'm excited to do things - arrange everything so my friends will come, so I just end up going to events that I'm interested in alone and making really surface level connections with people there or not going at all if it's an event like a dance or something where it literally wouldn't be fun unless I went with at least one friend.

It's also difficult because it's kind of expected within my friend group to just arrive at a particular member of the friend group's house uninvited - which is uncomfortable to me because that is just not something I did before in my life and I'd hate to show up at their house when no one's there or after being there several days in a row because what if they want some alone time or something, but I've been doing it more often (as well as just sitting alone in the lobby of our apartment building because that way whenever someone in our group is entering to go there I'll go up with them, too) because I am so lonely I feel like I would die if I didn't see people. 

This literally sounds so dumb, because I know that they like me, but it still takes so much work on my part to interact with them. 

They also hug me sometimes (they are a fairly touchy-feely friend group in general and hug hello and goodbye and climb all over each other) and I am so touch-starved after literally not interacting with people except at work or class that I feel so needy about it and I don't want them to think that I'm super needy or clingy about it, so the only way I feel comfortable initiating it is by pretending to be cold. As far as I know nobody is overthinking it like I am but every time I get literally any amount of skin-to-skin contact my entire fucking body is focused on it because I haven't even hugged my own mother in months.

Outside of this friend group I only have coworkers who I only vaguely know, people in my classes who don't answer my texts, and roommates who don't talk to me for weeks (until today, when one of them  reminded me it's my turn to do the chores today and then immediately left).  As much as I try, my workplace isn't really set up for making friends. The people in my classes who I kind of struck up a friendship with last semester aren't in my classes anymore or don't answer my texts if they want to go to dinner, so I always end up eating alone.

And my roommates... the tipping point that led to me crying in my room today is that one of my roommates talked to me for the first time in weeks today and it was to remind me that today was my turn to do one of the chores. Every single day before this for pretty much the past month I would get home and the house would be dark and my roommates would be locked in their rooms - and since then, by the way, I have drastically changed in appearance in the meantime, and my roommate doesn't even comment on this, just did literally the bare minimum in terms of communication, and then says ""yeah, that's all"" and leaves. Thanks.

I don't know what to do about this. I've joined clubs and not so much as made a single friend. Constant surface-level connections, no one who is interested in anything more than that. I've been trying for *months* to invite people to things, to tag along to group events, to invite myself places based on weird ""oh you can come up to our apartment whenever you want"" statements - and I just don't have energy to do that anymore.

4102,BlurryKai,1646710490,1,"so sophomore and junior year of HS i had a ton of friends. 1. Then right before Senior year I lost someone i considered very close to me because he ghosted me after two years of having a friendship. 2. Then a few months later in school i lost another bestfriend. 3. Then now a friend i considered really close to me stopped texting me. 4. One of my bestfriends barely has time to talk to me and does her own thing. 

The thing is when all of my friendships ended i blamed myself ofc. 
 1. had no explanation for leaving and the only thing i could think of that was wrong is talking about my bf too much and lagging, but i always told him the reason for why i lagged but i made sure he knew i loved him.
2. She said she didn’t like the girl I was hanging out with which she didn’t mention to me beforehand bc i didn’t know they had beef. She still tells me she shouldn’t have done it but doesn’t care to revive our friendship. 
3. we’ve texted everyday for 2years straight, and he started leaving me on read and when i asked him why i was left on delivered so i deleted my text, but he sometimes talks to me in person. 
4. since the beginning of covid she said since i wasn’t allowed to go out she really couldn’t be my friend. we were friends since middle school. 

I don’t know why this has happened to me, so much unfortunate events in one year. I was very happy to be in senior year and i thought it would be really fun, but it’s the loneliest i have ever been in a while. I eat alone at lunch and people use me so that they aren’t alone. I don’t consider myself a bad person in these situations especially since i’ve scanned the situations many times. 

My main question is how do I get over this feeling of loneliness and how do I not blame myself. I continuously blame myself bc idk how i can lose so many people in a year without it being my fault. But logically in every perspective i didn’t wrong any of my “friends”. I just want to know how to keep self-love in such a hard time. I only ever showed love to my “friends”. and if they asked me after their wrong doings if i loved them i would tell them i do.

Out of the blue she messages me, saying that we've become two different people, and that I'm unmotivated and emotionally broken. I can't defend the unmotivated part, but I have been trying my damn hardest to fix it. You see, I'm an amateur filmmaker in Upstate New York, and finding the motivation to sit down and finish a script is so much easier said than done. I've got at least a dozen started-scripts, and only one that I finished while I was still in high school. Granted, I'm a sophomore in college, but it's still been a while since I was proud of and dedicated to my work. As for the emotionally broken part, it's true. I'm a manic bi-polar with depression. I take fluoxetine, but sometimes it can only do so much. She's got issues of her own in terms of emotions, but she quit taking her meds out of pure laziness. She even dropped out of school after moving out on her own, but apparently I'm the unmotivated one. She was supposed to be the one I'd settle down with. She even expressed interest in that. But now she's left me behind, with nothing but bittersweet memories and a broken heart.

4113,tsukiko99,1646702037,1,"I feel so lonely. I wish I had friends. I haven't had any close friends since junior high (about 9 years ago). My hometown with all of my family is over an hour away. I only go over there about once a month. It makes me depressed how much I work, yet I still feel poor. Even more depressing how fast time is flying by and I don't know what to do with my life. I wish I could be spending more time with my family. I am a mama's girl, and everytime I think of her, I feel so sad because I miss her, and as I am getting older, I know she is too. One of the last times we met up together recently, she brought up her will and asked me what I would like her to give me after she's gone, and I broke down crying. I don't want to think about that! I never want that day to come when I lose my mama. My parents are also so loving and have also done so much for me during my life, I wish I could repay them somehow. 😢 2 family members have passed away within the last few months and another loved one is currently in the hospital from covid. It's scary to think of the possibility someone you love could leave your life at any moment. I hate that I am such a negative person with constant stress and worry about the future. I know my boyfriend gets tired of hearing my complaints everyday. I feel like such a terrible girlfriend sometimes. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 and a half years now. I love him with all of my heart... but sometimes I feel like our relationship is on the verge of falling apart. Lately I feel like we don't spend much time together despite that we live together. He doesn't come to bed with me most of the time. He spends every night playing video games or smoking outside (always outside for an hour), sometimes he falls asleep on the couch. Usually he'll come to bed after me. I'm in bed by midnight but he always stays up until after 2am, sometimes 3 or 4am.... Then I get up at 4:30 am for work.... It makes me upset waking up in the middle of the night without him by my side and even more angry when he doesnt come to bed with me at all. I feel cold when I get into an empty bed every night. Aren't couples supposed to sleep together? I take my anger out on him or complain when I get frustrated from doing most of the household chores and cooking and that doesn't help anything. I wish I could get him to understand how I feel and come to a compromise without getting bitchy... There have been times when it got to the point I made him cry because I guess I am a bit controlling and selfish... I don't want any more of those incidents. Those times I felt like such a horrible person. I honestly thought he would break up with me and I still worry that he will... I don't know what I'll do if he leaves me. I feel cold inside when I think about it. I would feel so empty and die of heartbreak. I don't think he knows how much he means to me and how much I wish he'd propose to me. This man is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with because he accepts me for who I am, has been so supportive of my art and anime collecting hobbies. He does so many things just for me, even if he doesn't like it... He does what he can to make me happy. I wish I could do more to make him happy too. I don't know what's wrong with me. I am the worst... There's been times he wanted to play some video games with me but I would usually show no interest or decline. I don't like them because I suck at playing them and he is too serious about them that he'd get mad at me when I am hopelessly terrible at them.

But this isn't the reason for most of my loneliness. The majority of my loneliness is from being rejected by other kids. I'm an outcast in my school for no reason. I know a lot of people who say that end up having dog shit personalities, but it's simply not true in my case. I've never instigated a fight with anyone at my school yet everyone seems to hate me.

I had a girl come up to starting a fight because I was in her seat, even though it was my assigned but I wasn't in for 2 weeks because I couldn't leave my bed from hardcore depression. My hair has been a problem for a lot of people too which is something I can't control. I have frizzy curly hair but not the nice kind and no matter what I do to it, even when I straighten it. It goes back to being a mess in 2 hours max.

I've been treated as an outcast for being a homosexual because my ""friends"" at the time told everyone about it and basically got me bullied for a while. Yeah that was a shit time in my life. I honestly did consider committing suicide because my depression + loneliness + overall negative outlook on life became too much to deal with.

I have less than a year of school left until college and I don't know if I'll even get into college. My grades are in the shitter and probably won't get me accepted.

So I’ve been carefully thinking about this, and I think I know what I want to do. 

I want to distance myself.

A little backstory:

I recently moved to a new town, a new house and of course, a new school.
It’s been hard at first to settle in but I made some mental promises to myself:

1) Don’t try to make friends
2) Don’t embarras yourself 
3)Stop caring about people
4)Make small-talk with people who speak to you FIRST.
5) Avoid most conversations.
6) Don’t speak 
7) Be quiet
8) Use time effectively 
9) Be kind but not too kind.
10) DO NOT BUT DO NOT DISCUSS FAMILY MATTERS/ PERSONAL ISSUES WITH ANYBODY


Yes, I know, they are pathetic but, my game, my rules(?)

Once I carefully thought over these rules/promises I decided to step up my game.

It was time for me to stop acting like somebody I was not. In my old school, I think I created some weird me, because the person that I showed to people out there, it wasn’t me, I felt popular (though I really wasn’t) I felt very uncomfortable in my own skin, I felt forced to do many things nobody forced me to, it was all in my mind and I felt trapped, trapped in a person I CREATED. I felt like I had lost ALL control whatsoever. Now - I really can say ‘I am in control’, because, for once, I am.




More backstory:

For this new high school I go to, I want to clarify,

I have some acquaintances, some, but I do.

I just really am not putting the effort into making those acquaintances ‘friends’.

The reason why? I just don’t want to.

I don’t feel comfortable around people I know. I just really don’t want any social interactions, if you’d like to put it in that way.

Sure, I have some people I have lunch with but then again, I’d rather eat alone, without anyone with me, It would be so much better. 

That’s what I’m trying to do. I don’t want to come out as rude here because of simply disregarding their presence with me, but if I’m honest, their presence makes my lunchtime very unpleasant. (It’s not them, it’s me, and I am the one who wants to eat alone, not them)

I hope I can figure something out to not sound as ‘rude’ (even though I probably will be because everyone takes everything seriously these days) but also not too kind. Because well,

I have some promises to keep.",lonely,I want to distance myself,2022-03-08 10:15:14

4135,FungiApathy,1646693099,1,"Never been in a relationship, had friends in high school but was never anyone’s best friend, not invited to a lot of activities, socially anxious, introverted, no self esteem, socially awkward, unattractive, overweight, touch deprived, emotionally empty. I can’t imagine myself being someone’s favorite. I want it more than anything at this point. 

Nothing I do feels good enough, probably because it isn’t. When no one genuinely likes you, when you’re at best a side character in someone’s life, everything else feels useless. Feeling unloved is such a heavy weight on my back. It wears me down I feel it wherever I go. At night I feel actual physical pain my loneliness is so bad. I feel like it’ll never get any better either.

People come and go but the one thing they all have in common is that they want to keep me at a distance, even if we’re friends. It’s all my fault too. Maybe I don’t try hard enough, I’m not interesting enough, I don’t have the looks or the style, maybe it’s just my personality. At this point I’m just terrified of meeting people, they won’t be interested or worse they’ll use me as comedic relief, and/or someone they can vent to take advantage of me, and then won’t do the same for and then leave.

I wish I couldn’t feel loneliness, I wish I didn’t feel like I need people. It might be that I’m really insecure but I just want someone who actually likes me and legit wants me to be around. Someone who actually texts first, who is the one to start conversations and make plans with me sometimes. I’ve never had that even with my own family. I fear I’ll never have that connection.

As someone with BPD, bipolar depression, anxiety, and OCD life can seem very overwhelming. I’ve learned that pain is a gift, because without pain those moments of true happiness, even if they are few and far between, are so much more meaningful. 

If your feeling lonely, I understand. I’ve been single for 7 years, and what really sucks is that on top of our pain there could be addiction and shame. For me I’m a seggs addict, I crave it consistently and honestly I have tried to manipulate people into doing it with me. Here’s the thing about addiction, as long as you keep trying you are winning. You can’t give up. You can’t let it become okay to you. 

Ladies this parts for you. You have value, you don’t need to offer your bodies to be noticed your worth it regardless. I’ve realized that the more you give your body away the less meaningful seggs will be with the people you care about. Don’t fall for tricks from guys like me. Be on guard, but be compassionate as well. You have so much value regardless of what you look like or if that cute guy likes you.

People always tell me about how I'm so young, yet thanks to all the people that fake depression and anxiety my age I struggle to be taken seriously.

I have no social life, no friends, my family don't listen, and when they do they don't take me seriously, I've only ever had one group where I've felt like I belonged, and when I had to go in October it really did tear me apart.

I'm nothing, I'm merely a stone in people's way, they trip up, and get back up, or they just don't fall over at all. I'm a burdensome waste to this world, I have no purpose to make of my life and no goals.

I always just want to be loved, I wish I could curl up into the arms of someone who cared and just cry as they held me close and tight, stroking my hair.

Speaking of hugs and crying, I haven't had a hug since August and I'm so numb I haven't been able to cry since November no matter how hard I try.

Suicide is the only conclusion and answer to my desolate existence, the world may not forget me, but I'm just an example of what not to do in life.

Hi, I’m just wondering if being a 24F with no friends is normal? I have a wonderful boyfriend that I’ve been with for over 6 years, but sometimes it doesn’t always feel like it’s enough. I know he loves me and wants the best for me, but I don’t believe he should have to be everything such as my friend, my lover, my therapist). Along with that, I don’t always feel like we connect as much as we should anymore. I love him so much but I don’t even know how love should feel after 6 years ya know? It can sometimes feel stale, but then there’s moments where we can connect like two magnetic puzzle pieces without even trying. Any tips?

I do/did have a best friend of over 8 years, but she’s moved away and has gone on with her life. We still talk, but to be honest things just feel so different now. There are some moments I feel replaced bc she has met another best friend who literally looks just like me, same birthday month, same major and it makes me feel weird. Now, I’m just kind of trying to figure out what to do next. I reconnected with one of my ex best friends from HS bc we saw each other at a nail salon, but I felt like consistency wasn’t there and I never texted or communicated back. It just reminded as to why I should keep the past in the past.

So, here I am in my final semester of college feeling super lonely on my college spring break because I have no one to talk to.

Like even now I have been seeing a very nice person who as has always been very lovely and kind. She has been a life coach and a Buddhist and even despite some evidence of that I am still terrified that I am being dubbed and this will all lead to catastrophe.

I’ve packed up all things that they gave me in a box, stored it away and never opened it again. 

They’ve moved on a long time ago but here I am thinking about them every single day since the breakup. 

I’ve met a bunch of people, more than ever before. There was only one person I somehow liked but was relieved when it didn’t work out. I’ve never felt anyone again. I’ve never developed even a slight interest in anyone again. I’m too fast to ditch people. I really tried to meet new people unbiased. But still I never felt comfortable with anyone again. I didnt want to get close to anyone I met. 

I’m most comfortable on my own, when I’m really alone. Still I feel that I’m missing something and not happy. I feel wounded and I don’t want anyone around my wounded self other than them.
They’re the only motivation I have. I can only live knowing that they are happy. And I truly wish that for them. 

For myself I just wish that I could stop this pain. I don’t want to love them anymore. I don’t want to worry if they’re okay whenever I get a weird feeling. I don’t want to cry over them in silence and pretend to my environment that I’m ok and over them. I feel embarrassed to still be stuck when everyone would’ve moved on.

4228,R3D5KAR1337,1646646003,1," I apologize this is very long as I am pouring all my feeling and thoughts into this.

Although the title might contradict my childhood, I used to have a lot of friends and I got along with mostly everyone. I would consider myself kind of popular as I was known by almost everyone in other grades as well. This all changed when I moved to a new city when I was 11. I did get some attention as I was the new kid and did end up making a few friends along the way. However, I did experience verbal and physical bullying during 7th grade in my new school. When I went to high school, it was no better. Although I did end up making some friends along the way I did also experience some bullying, luckily it was just verbal. I would consider myself pretty unpopular in that school and was often ignored or made fun of. That's when I started hanging out in the music room (where most nerds hang out). I did feel pretty included there but the second I stepped outside of that room it was night and day. I was very expressive of myself in the music room but the second I went anywhere else of the school I often stayed quiet. During those high school years, I did end up having several crushes on some girls, as any other high school guy would. One girl that I met in my math class was the first crush that I had when I started high school. I thought we were both hitting it off pretty well and she told me that she liked me back a couple of months later I started talking to her after she found out I liked her. I decided to ask her out but she declined all of my offers. I later found out that she was just using me for mental support and that I made her feel confident. A year later I started catching feelings for this girl that was one of the first friends that I made when I moved into the new city. I'm honestly not sure why I started getting feelings but they were strong. People often shipped us but she would tell people that I'm her cousin or a family friend. A few months later she found out that I had a crush on her and she confronted me about it and I admitted it. She replied, ""wtf I thought we were just friends"". It honestly was good to get those feelings out of my system but she ended up unfriending me on all social media. It's quite funny how it takes years to build up a meaningful relationship with someone but it can take seconds to make you two complete strangers all over again. Then my last high school crush was this girl that I started getting feelings for after going on a school band trip with her. One of my friends was dating her best friend and I happen to also be friends with her. During the trip, she showed a Snapchat story of my crush (didn't like her at the time) in the hotel room with a ton of food. We decided to go to her room and take some. When we left she told me randomly, ""hey you know she thinks you're cool."" I was immediately very confused as no one thought I was cool. So I ended up talking to her and we really clicked with each other. We did end up going out a couple of times and her friend told me to tell her that I like her as their text convo said ""if he tells me that he likes me I would be in love"". So I thought this was my shot. I ended up telling her and her friend made me hug her. A few months later, her friend ended up telling me that she got a boyfriend during Christmas. I acted as nothing happened and went to class. The thoughts started to haunt my brain and I was unable to concentrate in class almost all day. I then said a bunch of mean comments about her to her friend that I regret saying. She ended up telling her and I felt betrayed since she told me that she liked me too. She ended up writing a note about the situation to me the next day and I got angry and threw the note away. I eventually bumped into her in the hallway and she then started crying which made me feel like a monster. I then texted her an apology message after school about what I did but now it's like we're strangers all over again. The worst part was I found out 2 years later that she never liked me in the first place and that she was just trying to be nice. She also said that me hugging her made her feel uncomfortable which makes it worse because now I feel like I just assaulted her. Eventually, after this, some of my friends got into weed and drugs which I do not want and those ties were cut off. I was also ended up chosen to play the saxophone at this music festival by my school. It was honestly a very cool experience as only 30 students in the entire province are picked to play in this band. I wanted people to go watch me because this is another way that the school can be represented aside from sports. While a few people did end up going to watch me, that isn't the bad part. Often the school announcements announce sports MVPs or stuff like that and people will congratulate them after class. I did end up getting my name on the announcements congratulating me for getting in the band and representing the school, but I got no response from anyone. I am in no way asking for compliments or anything but just because I'm into music and not sports I am treated differently? I also produce my own dubstep music and some of my friends think it's cool but the second some people from the basketball team post a terrible rap song on SoundCloud they got the school's attention? I do realize that rap is often more popular than dubstep but I work hard on my songs and have been producing for a while but they posted theirs as a joke and somehow its better than a few years of work? I graduated in 2020 so half of my school year was online on zoom. And I also took 3 semesters of college online as well. I began to lose my mind until I ended up getting a job that I really wanted. In September I decided to attend my first on-campus semester of college and it was a mistake. Not only is the lecture format the same as online and I could learn in the comfort of my own home, not a single person talks to anyone. I remember having these conversations with my mom about starting college and she said that I will make lots of friends because all the popularity stuff and high school drama is gone because everyone is an adult. Well, apparently this generation doesn't teach people how to act like an adult because this feels just like high school minus the bullying and friends. I am always alone during the time in between my classes and nobody wants to sit beside me. I am unable to make friends at all. Even when I try to talk to people, it's a very minimal conversation or they just straight-up ignore me. These past few years, my cousins are all getting married or getting into relationships. All grandchildren have been in a relationship except for me. Even my younger sister has gone through a few. I often thought that the right person will approach me when the time comes. From what I see I don't see any women seeing me as a potential partner. I often was called ugly at school and even by some of my friends I was called ugly. Don't tell me that looks don't matter or anything like that because although you think they don't matter, they do matter to a lot of people and I happen to have lost the genetic lottery. Being called ugly or unattractive has driven me to believe that I am ugly, which I am because of the sample size and the results. I have even taken the initiative to go onto dating apps, I often get very few matches and most of the time the girls I end up talking to will ghost me afterward for no apparent reason. My parents often tell me that looks don't matter if you're a good person or if you have lots of money. Although I don't consider myself to be a good person, I have gotten comments from people saying that I am very friendly or nice. But even that, I don't even know what to believe anymore. The money thing, I'm in college and want to date someone the same age as me, no one is rich around that time. I do make a decent amount of money to buy lots of things like stuff for my Star Wars toy collection. This brings me to another point. I am 20 years old and I still buy toys, I often feel like quitting this hobby but it's the only thing that keeps me sane. I often don't tell people about this hobby unless it's someone I'm close with or if it's at work with a co-worker (I work at a LEGO store). Me being me sometimes makes me feel ashamed of who I am. But I do feel like I brought this on myself as it is my fault for enjoying these things instead of cool things like sports or cars. I guess this is why girls don't like me. I now end up assessing situations if I should talk to a girl or not because of what I've gone through with others. Because of this I have become a ""listen to your head"" kind of guy. But what's the point, I'll never find love and that's true. My parents often tell me to stop thinking like this because I have a negative mindset like this. Well, they're wrong, I'm not being negative. I'm being realistic. I'm so alone at this point that I have installed a few dating apps and so far I have gotten no matches. How expected. Now that I'm entering my 20s I know for sure that I'll never get my first relationship. I just want someone to love me for who I am. I often have to avoid telling girls or people in general that I have certain hobbies because they'll think less of me. In that case, if they do end up like me, that isn't the real me. I often feel like love does not exist and is an illusion. I find it impossible for someone to like me for who I am because if I ended up liking me for who I am, I too would be disgusted and want to run away from me. Now the only thing keeping me sane for now is my hobbies. Who knows if I end up quitting them?",lonely,Unable to find friends or love,2022-03-07 20:40:03

This guy I knew who was a junior in my college died yesterday. He entered an unsafe body of water while he was out with his friends and he drowned. He couldn’t get out.

He was with his friends, also my college juniors, and they just had to watch him helplessly. 

Two of my friends were also close with him. I’m completely unable to reach one of them and the other has been responding with like one word at best. 

I have no one else to go to or talk to about this. The one person I tried to speak to just made me feel worse. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve lost someone and I know how the grieving process works. I wasn’t even close to this guy but I’m still shaken up. We used to talk in college because of mutual friends. He wore a really cool skull ring that I liked. 

I just. I’ve been struggling with mental health issues as it is and this loss is making me feel like everything under the sun is just completely meaningless. I’ve been trying to draw and distract myself and I’ve not even been able to really cry but everything I do feels so wrong and insensitive. 

I feel guilty about even just eating food and I’ve eaten nothing all day. I don’t even know if I’m hungry or not. 

It feels wrong for me to do anything as if everything is a form of insensitivity to the loss. I’m just so so shaken up and would like some comforting words please. 

Words along the lines of his family and friends will be okay and learn to cope. And something like the people who had to watch him die will also eventually learn to accept and deal with that pain and not blame themselves. 

It’s just all too much. It’s the first time I’ve felt grateful I don’t really have friends or go out much because I can’t imagine being part of the group that witnesses someone dear to them die before their very eyes while they’re helpless to stop it or save them.

You're unhappy, you're unfulfilled, you've been like that so long you can barely remember what it's like to be otherwise, not that you were ever that cheerful, but it's been years since you were at all happy or had any fleeting optimism for the future.  You can't bring yourself to take the obvious way out, because you love what little family you have too much to subject them to that, and you have people that depend on you that you're not willing to abandon.  It's not their fault you are the way you are.  One day you meet someone, it starts off slow, but before you know it... you want to wake up in the morning, you look forward to it.  Instead of hoping and occasionally praying an aneurysm or a heart attack will take you in your sleep, save the few people you care about from the pain of your alternatives, and finally put you out of your fucking misery... You think you might finally fucking see a light at the end of the tunnel, you actually look forward to waking up each morning and getting a little closer to the light.  They're as close to perfect as you're probably ever going to find, you think you might be able to see not just spending the rest of your life with them, but being happy with them.  They feel the same way about you.  It doesn't work out.  Not because one of you stopped thinking the other was amazing, you care about each other more every day, you both still think the other is as close to perfect as you'll ever find, but you can't be with them given your current circumstances, and you can't really change your circumstances and still live with yourself, not that you liked living with yourself in the first place.  You can't be with them, but you don't think you want to live without them.  

What the fuck do you do?  How the fuck do you force yourself to keep slogging through your perverse joke of a life?   You don't owe anyone anything, and if you were willing to hurt and abandon a few people, you could finally be free.  You can't be with them, you probably will never be with them, there's no longer a light at the end of the tunnel, you're not sure you could force yourself to look again even if you wanted to, and there's nothing you can really do about it.  You haven't had a drink in years, you know it will make things worse, but it dulls the pain, even if only a little bit.

I don't believe this. I make myself believe that these are some guys just evening the odds.

Okay venting done, now my story.

I'm a loner not by choice but by a lifetime of rejection faced socially, professionally and recently financially. I have learnt to live by myself. 

It's easier to just keep my head down and spend my life quietly when I know that any move I make at a relationship will just end in rejection. So I reject myself to retain that last shred of self-respect.

It's easier to work small jobs rather than in a high, responsible position at a multinational. More responsibilities bring the necessity to deal with more number of people. So I quit when they wanted to move into a manager role. I was very difficult to get a job non interactive job with decent pay.

4254,Person96,1646634194,1,"You know, I remember the days when I was younger where almost every day I'd have someone over all the time. My friends, my cousins, I was surrounded by them all the time. Almost every day, I know I'd have someone over. Some days, even on just regular days where there was no special occasion, I might have 4, maybe 5 people over and all of us would just play games with one another. Some of my best memories are the days and nights where I would stay up all night with my friends playing Halo or Call of Duty. One vivid memory I have is I was up until 3 am one night talking to a friend over Skype. I was playing Slender while she was keeping me company. Yeah, she. That was the only time I've ever stayed up that late with someone, even if they weren't even there, who wanted to keep me company while I did something scary. That was probably the tipping point for me. When she became more than a friend to me. I guess you could say from that day forward I kind of fell in love with her.

There isn't a time that I could think of where someone stayed up with me so willingly just to comfort me. Just to make sure that I was alright. Just to make sure that I didn't get too scared and tried to make me feel better by making me laugh. Even scaring me herself by leaving then immediately coming back after I was chased by the Slenderman. I still think about her to this day despite that happening almost 10 years ago. She's no longer in my life anymore. That's not to say she's GONE gone, I mean we both just moved on with our own lives and went on to become adults. But to me, I still think about her. I still love her.

At times like these, where I just feel incredibly alone and in need of a hug, I think about that one night. No one has ever helped me like that since then.

I have a dream that goes something like this. Where I'd get a random text or call from someone I know who randomly says ""Hey, I'm bored. I'm going to come to your place. I'll bring some coffee, okay?"" and then they show up with a snack. Then, we'd just sit and watch something together or play something together. Maybe watch a cartoon, a movie, or an anime together. Not doing anything inappropriate or anything, just having them sit with me and make me forget this ache I have in the base of my chest that I get when I'm feeling alone. I know friendships and relationships are a two-sided street. But, my current ""friendships""...well I haven't had anyone other than my parents and some family see my apartment since I moved to this city 3 years ago.

I need to share this with people who might actually understand.

So, I am a now 22-year-old young man who before the summer of this past year had zero romantic experience and minimal experiences out with people my own age, until I went on dates with a few women I met off the typical apps. I don't mean to brag about it. I went on one date with a girl who is SO cute, in my opinion. I was thrilled that a cute girl had even wanted to spend time with me, but she did! We first went to a diner, and then the comic shop because she is passionate about art, and then driving up to the panoramic road overlooking my city as the sun set and the air grew cold, and I actually kissed her! It was so ideal and romantic.

I had always wanted to take someone special there and I finally managed to! I had remembered all the bitter evenings I had driven that road to travel to my father's house and witnessed happy couples wrapped in passionate embraces, and now by luck I had a taste of that! We then went to the store and bought drinks to have at my house, it was getting late, and she decided to sleep over. I actually slept with a cute girl! The next morning, we went to get breakfast and went to the mall and then several stores, and another mall, and bought each other gifts, before the evening was over that day and she had to say goodbye.

I wish I could relive that day on repeat. So, this was what other people my age are fortunate enough to experience weekly?

I actually felt for once in my life like a normal human being, even if it was momentary. I still can hardly believe it; it was like a lovely dream.

I felt so much better about my life whenever we talked on the phone, and the next time we met. When she shared to me she wasn't looking for a boyfriend, it punctured the fabric of my cautiously optimistic heart. The final time we met it didn't go well due to behavior on my part, and she never replied to me. Well I had gotten busy with my school work and internships and just accepted she wasn't into me. Though I got in touch with her this month, and she was open to going out, and asked me when, but then ghosted me.

I had gotten over it, but the other day she dropped into my contacts when I made a TikTok account after being encouraged to, and I took a peek at her social media which was linked. Seeing them out with other people and having fun with a big clique of friends has left me so depressed. I know it is immature, but I can't help it.

I don't think I can pursue another woman unless they remind me of this person.

I feel like I wouldn't be nursing such a strong longing if I had a typical upbringing with regular socializing and dates, like normal people experience like a habit, and not living in tiresome loneliness and exclusion.",lonely,"How do you deal with having a ""oneitis""?

4264,ea0995,1646627278,1,"

Most of my life I've struggled to make any close friends. I can make friends but there is just something that happens that causes it to never be any close connection. Ive never had a best friend, or a date. Ive learned to be alright with being alone sometimes but some weekends it drives me insane. I just want some human interaction in the weekends. Im a simple guy, I'll be happy with just having brunch with a friend.

Its not like I had a terrible childhood either. I had friends in school, I wasnt overwieght in school or an outcast in any way. I wasnt the most popular but I also wasnt part of the socially outcast, I was somewhere in the middle. The one thing that I think was the problem in my childhood was that when I was a kid my parents moved us to their home country. It was not out of necessity and I didnt want to move. My parents decided to have some businesses when we moved there. As the only son of the family I had to help my dad in the business every weekend growing up (from age 9 to 17). Most days I  was there I had to help my dad open (around 7 am) and I stayed there until closing time (could range anywhere from 10 pm to 2 am) and I never felt like I could hangout with my friends on the weekend. I remember hating the weekends as a teenager because it meant i had to go help my dad in the business.

I spoke to a therapist who told me that this a big reason I struggle to make connections today as I never had a proper way to develop my social skills growing up.  When I was 17 we moved back to the USA and I've havent made much friends since. I had a few college friends but I never felt like I was really part of the group. I sometimes felt like they only kept me around because they felt bad about kicking me out of the group. 

I have cousins my age, but all of them are in committed relationships and some are starting to have kids. We also dont really have the same interests, where I would love to travel, do more outdoor stuff and hangout more in the city and they just want to play basketball and watch the game at each other's houses. I like playing basketball and watching the games on TV but its just not something I want to spend most of my weekend on. I feel like since they all have girlfriends they love that they feel like they dont need to go out as much anymore. Im happy they found good girls that they love and plan to spend the rest of their lives, but it has made me feel more lonely, especially since I feel the family has their eye on me to get a girlfriend. For example, I have an uncle I havent seen in some time and the other day he asked if I had a girlfriend, when I said no, he basically told me I had to stop being so slow that girls arent going to come to me. What sucks is that what he doesnt know is that I already know that and Ive been trying but I cant get a girl to go out with me, but Id rather let the family think that its that Im not looking cause its just easier to let them think that than it is to admit that I just suck at this. 

Im on trial right now with a therapist who thinks she can help. We are 2 sessions in and I worry that she wont think that she can help me. SHe's had me explain all the times I've tried to get a date and she found some things that I may have done wrong but I can tell she is somewhat struggling to find what the underlying problem is. She even said that its not a guarantee that therapy will get me a date. I had another therapist who was also good, but she terminated me because at the end we couldnt agree on anything.

I m(27) started a friends with benefits “relationship” with the a girl (26) back in September. It started as a hookup but we instantly clicked. She had kids and I was upfront from the start that I had no intentions of ever being involved with her kids, so it did not make sense to bother with a monogamous relationship for her. I personally was uncomfortable with non monogamy but I guess I lied to myself and tried to go along with it (first major mistake). We get deeply involved with each other’s lives as far as lots of communication, seeing each other often and opening up about our pasts. The sex was very good. She had a very damaged  past and I became very attached to her in wanting to be there for her and empathize with her. Long story short after forming a very strong attachment despite being non monogamous, she would occasionally sleep around and eventually I developed a ton of anxiety over the thought of her being with other people sexually. 

She began to start stripping, I became even more insecure with this, to a point where I was losing sleep over the situation. I was very attached to her but also couldn’t handle the reality of the situation. Eventually my insecurities became very apparent to her, and she said we should stop having sex, and just be friends. I agreed, and shortly after she went on a date with a man (47)who she met at the strip club.  She had sex with him and all. However she said while she was having sex with him, she found her self missing me and the feeling of having sex with me.  She even asked me to have sex one more time after seeing this new guy a few times. I told her no. 

On another phone call she mentioned she was grieving the loss of having sex with me and was seeing this guy as an attempt to “feel something” as she felt emotionally numb. Time goes by and she keeps seeing this man. He has tipped her 500 dollars at her club multiple times, he has offered to take care of her and her kids financially. In further conversations she explains what she likes about him (disciplined, wealthy, leadership role, intelligent, appears to be a good potential stepfather). 

I have cut contact with her I’ve rather last two weeks, but I keep getting nagging thoughts of jealousy, and I feel like I’ve taken a big hit on my self esteem. I feel like I’m weak for not being able to handle her sleeping around and not being able to emotionally handle the reality of a fwb relationship. I also find myself being jealous of the new guy’s supposed qualities and just in general getting affection from the girl I am so attached to. 

I know this all probably sounds ridiculous but i can’t pull my self out of this cycle so any voices of sanity and opinions on any of the situation would be appreciated!",lonely,Heartbreak and lonely after lost fwb,2022-03-07 15:24:10

The literal only person I associate with is my boyfriend, we are long distance right now and only get to see each other IRL every couple weeks or so.

I try my hardest to be the best friend I can be but it somehow always gets me fucked in the end. My old friend group set me up, tried to jump and rob me for literally no reason on multiple different occasions. Worst part is that “friend” group is what got me started with doing drugs and I still struggle with addiction to this day. Maybe the reason people in my town dislike me is because of my reputation after all of that. Idk. I think that’s fucking stupid because after all none of these people even know me, or want to try to know me because of mistakes I’ve made in the past.

as the title says i’ve always struggled finding where i fit in or who i fit in with. this has never been a big deal bc i’m pretty antisocial anyways. but over the last year or so i’ve really tried to put myself out there and become more aquatinted with the people around me. i talked at least a little bit to anyone who’d let me. but still never grew close with anyone. it was always simply school/work relationships. never would hang out or talk/text outside of school/work. 

i recently talked to one of my classmates about how they unknowingly helped me come out of the closet to my parents. we started talking to each other more and yesterday i went to a party with her and was introduced to her whole friend group. they were all sweet and i had fun but they were all stoners and there were a lot of drugs and alcohol. i have nothing against it or people who use them, but i personally never saw the appeal. bc i was new to the group and no one knew me but they were all great friends with each other so i was kind of just there, which i understand. i’m new, an outsider, so i understood why i may have made some people uncomfortable. once everyone had gotten drunk/high and passed out i figured it was time for me to head out and so i left. 

this doesn’t seem like a big deal but to me it is because this was the first kind of “party” i had been to.  but it stunk because i didn’t fit in and everyone knew it. i’ve felt really lonely pretty much all my life but lately it’s started to get to me. at night i’ve started to have thoughts about suicide. about how if i was gone would anyone really even notice? i don’t want to sound like an attention whore… i just wish i had some real friends for a change.",lonely,I’ve never found my place in the world/never had a real friend,2022-03-07 15:06:19

I haven't seen any of his posts for a while; I blocked him on other sites just to save my mental health. But anyways, I got too curious and clicked on it because, honestly, I miss him. 

It saw a post of their two-year anniversary and I just... my heart just... broke again. I know, it's pathetic because it has already been three years!

They just looked so nice and happy and in-love. They went on a picnic and kite flying because he remembered her saying she never flied kites as a kit.  He never made that much effort for me. We never did that. We never looked that happy. It just made me think of what she had that I didn't because honestly we looked similar. She seemed smarter, more successful, more creative, more independent.. everything I wasn't. He basically found someone like me... but better.

Made me feel inferior, insignificant, unworthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Why did she deserve all that and I didn't? Why does he give 100% on her while I had the bare minimum? Why does she get to be with him and I don't? Why does she get to be happy for two years and I miserable for three years?

4277,Vassonx,1646624555,1,"I have been distant from any sort of romantic affairs for an exceedingly long amount of time. And I definitely ""glowed down"" in the last few years, as you could say. And I was comfortable with that, ngl. 

There was this great sense of liberation from not having to conform to a performance I must put on to seem attractive. I hadn't really felt those instant romantic sparks in a very long time, and I had basically convinced myself:

""Those intense passionate attractions are just a teenage/young adult thing. You aren't a teenager/young adult anymore. The days of being madly in love like magic are over, and that's okay.""

And I had been consciously falling into this slow descent towards total isolation. This is fine, I thought. The irrationalities, the chaos, the drama and the emotions will not be missed. It did more harm than good. At least I convinced myself that.

I had built walls on walls, barriers on barriers, justifications on justifications to convince myself that I am going to be okay alone.

""I can't force myself to pretend to be someone else to date. If I did, I wouldn't be able to keep that facade up for long.""

""I got so many hobbies and side projects to work on. I would hate any relationship that takes time away from that.""

""I'm not even that good at emotional labor. Why even try if I know for a fact that I would soon resent her for the emotional labor.""

""I can't bother to censor my thoughts and feelings just to accomodate her. Isn't that basically pretend?""

And you know what? It was quite alright for a few years, and I honestly felt more at peace with myself. I gained a bit of weight, but I felt fine. I stopped grooming most of myself, but I felt fine. I stopped buying new clothes as the old ones decayed, but I felt fine. I regressed more into my close circle without ever branching out to socialize, but I felt fine. I barely left home and became terminally online, but I felt absolutely fine with that.

And now, I kinda hate myself for allowing myself to feel fine decomposing like this. Because I felt that ""teenage emotion"" once again very recently. I mean, there were some attractions I have felt during my alone period, but they were pretty much skindeep.

This wasn't. This really seemed like the kind to sweep me off my feet. And I hate it. Because even if I found joy in meeting and conversing and spending time with that person, most of my thoughts were disgust at what I allowed myself to become.

And all of a sudden, I looked disgusting, not fine. I sounded disgusting, not fine. I smelled disgusting, not fine. I felt disgusting. Not fine. Never to be fine, ever again.

All those walls built for the superiority of solitude have crumbled down and all that I can see now is a sad, disgusting, lonely loser who has let himself die for the last half a decade.

I guess I have to reconstruct myself all over again. Turn into someone I can tolerate. And it's going to be fucking hard. Not even for her sake, but because this wake-up call she gave me was so strong that my self-hate has skyrocketed. I don't know who I'm supposed to change into. I just don't want to be what I am now.

Whether it be biblical or We the People's fault, it's irrelevant. Everyone knows something big is about to happen, and if you don't... Well, I envy your blissful ignorance. I'm not trying to sound condescending or pretentious when I say that, though.


Every waking day is a step closer to the edge of the black hole sun. Whether it ACTUALLY be that which engulfs us into the great unknown or a divine intervention, the means that which propels us into the next life is equally irrelevant. Tonight I'm plagued with a very important question. When the chips are down and it's all said and done, do you think you will be remembered by the things you've done in this life? When people go through your belongings as a means of documenting who you were as a person, what would they find? Will there even be people left over **TO** document how you lived your life? I am not entirely sure why these questions have made itself manifest in the precipices of my mind, especially tonight of all days... But here I am with this ever-burning question that's got me in a frenzy. 



I just went through my safe a few moments ago and found a letter that was addressed to me by someone that was once dear in my life. The significance of why her and I no longer talk is neither here nor there, however the point is I will keep that letter until the day I die **because** of her importance in my life. I uh... I wonder if people will remember me as someone that loved a girl till death. She was great, but not the greatest... Yet somehow I still hope both get the opportunities to live long and happy lives with guys that are leaps and bounds greater than I. I mean, they gotta be, because if they weren't, wouldn't I have been picked? 



Will I be remembered as just some asshole that tried to get too close to someone when he should've known he didn't deserve to be loved in the first place? Does it even MATTER how I'm remembered as I won't be here after the fact? I mean, lots of things happen when you die, right -- just none of it involving you. Maybe I'm getting too philosophical over here. Tonight I just felt like rambling because I feel a conviction in my spirit for someone -- ANYONE to read this. Maybe I'm doing it for one specific person to read these words and get confirmation in their heart. 



... Or I'm just rambling. Shit, probably the latter. 




Still, I think I do have a point to make. I think... At the end of the day when it's all said and done and the book of your life has been closed, what do you think people would read about it? If your life actually **does** flash before your eyes, what will you see before you go? Will you be happy with the hours of pain and resentment you suffered watching others be happy while you were alone, the time wasted wishing for something that just **wasn't** happening? If I were to ask myself these same questions, I think the answer would be ""no, I'm not happy with what I see""... And that's a bummer. 



Y'know, the bible talks about this time in history too. The apostles were envious of **us** because they wanted to be alive to witness the times we're in. Yeah -- the same people that got to see The Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth perform miracles, including resurrecting the dead. Why, I'll never know.. But they could trade with me any day.

4326,Cool_Tailor7057,1646608196,1,"Hi,

I moved from Southeast Texas to Colorado for school. Over 1000 miles away from home, this is the farthest and most distant I have been from everyone in my life before. I am struggling with loneliness like I never had before and I do not know what to do.

I am a junior now. As a freshman, I had a great group of friends that were supportive in classes as well as life. No one ever did anything by themselves. We were a very tight group. COVID hit and we all went home. I was one of the only ones that didn't grow up in Colorado so I had to leave all of them. When we came back in the fall of the next school year, it never was the same. I felt like I was forcing it all. We did all live under the same roof in a frat house, but they never came to my room, I always went to theirs. 

Now as a junior, we all live in different houses/apartments. It was hard in the start of the fall semester to keep up with eachother as classes were also becoming way more difficult and I did not have a similar major to them. It then became very apparent that they wanted nothing to do with me when they went on a trip for a fall break without ever mentioning it to me unless I asked them what they were doing for break. This killed me and I then spaced myself from them. They didn't want anything to do with me, so I saw that it was best for me that I stop pouring my energy into them. 

Now, I have two close friends that live in my house and I cannot find the same joy I did when I was with them. It has caused me to fall behind in classes while also stop going out because I don't want to see them. COVID has also hindered my social ability to go out and meet people in a party/function setting. I have no problem talking to people about school/work/sports/work industry. 

All signs lead to getting a pet or moving cities, but neither of those are possible. Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do? Feel free to leave a comment or DM me with more questions if you really want to help.

I know you won't read this and I hope you won't because it would probably make you really sad and probably question your decisions, but I just wanted to say that I love you so much and you did not hurt me; I just wanted you to be happy and I am happy I still manage to make you smile;

I miss all the times we would video call just to be shy together and I would just blush at anything; I miss all the times we did something stupid just to be with each other like being up until 7 am to be able to talk to my special someone; I miss being sad together and trying to show the other person that there are reasons to keep going, in fact I miss being your reason to keep going; I miss teaching you Italian as I never got to tell you how to say I love you; I miss arguing on how I dislike Italian and you would tell me that it's really fancy; I miss telling you how cute you are and you shouldn't be worried about what others think of you because you are awesome and deserve all the good things this planet has to offer; I miss listening to music together literally ALL day and making you read song titles that were romantic; I miss queuing that song that I ruined by overplaying it (I am still sorry about it!); I miss how we were hiding our feelings for each other but expressing them with song lyrics just waiting for the other one to pick up the signal; I miss how every day we would just talk for hours and hours; I miss how you always tried to make me feel happy; I miss every time you told me I made you smile because I know that even if you're going through a tough time I can always put a smile on your face; I miss how you would say that my eyes are beautiful and you would just get lost in them; I miss how we wanted to be able to hold each other's hand and feel together all the time; I miss how you always told me that even if I couldn't be with you I was always in your heart; I miss when you always wanted a warm hug; I miss when you told me that you love me more than I love you; I miss when I was trying to teach you guitar but you would be really afraid of messing up; I miss how you always told me that I am very romantic but in the end you were the most sweet, kind, romantic and caring person I have ever met; I miss how we used to sleep in a call together even though this happened just a couple times I truly felt you were really close to me; I miss how you would think you weren't enough just for me to tell you that you were a butterfly; I miss how we would tell each other that we really enjoyed talking and smiling together; I miss starting sentences with ""Have I ever told you"" just to be really romantic in the end; I miss when we used to tell each other that we think about the other one all day; I miss sharing our plans for the future, the things we wanted to do together;

I miss all of this SO MUCH, thank you for being my awful lot to live for, I never feel alone when you're with me, thank you for being the most important part of my life!

I don’t feel like I’m getting the same energy back from the people I care about. This makes me feel like no one genuinely cares about me. But that also made me think “Do I genuinely care about anyone?” Because I can’t tell. I don’t know the difference between being friends because you care about someone or that it is just nice to have someone to talk to.

There is never a day where I think my friends are real. That they are there for me. That they’re faking to like me because I’ve been nice to them.

And it feels like I’m drowning in my own expectations. Expectations of them, of myself, of friendships. I keep forgetting that people are flawed, but I find it hard to tell the difference between a bad or toxic person or just some flaws. I forgive them for their small flaws, but sometimes they build up to a lot of frustrating for me. 

Honestly, my life is not that unbearable when compared to others. I have good days, I have bad days. That is normal right? But how come the bad days feel so much worse than the good days?

There’s been a lot of times where I wish to stop existing. But I’m trying to hold on to a better future. There’s still so many years to be happy right? But sometimes it feels like happiness is an illusion.

Later on i started my college in a smaller city with less things and really far from my own city i take 2 hour airplane to this city just to arrive!! And i have to stay in a dorm room which my roommates are not the best for my mental health, they never give me any space they play music so loud on their phones and always stay up late. Once i arrived they were already close friends also they are majoring in the same subject so i was left totally alone by them and didn’t get well with them neither. City is so cold it’s not like my home city and people here are from small towns so they are very uneducated and rude, i don’t wanna sound like an a**hole but they are super ignorant about many things they live in their small villages and their small mindsets, i feel so alone here nobody seems to fully understand me. I try to be respectful as i can but at the end people always be mean to me. I bring food from my own city and gave it to my roommates and later on they didn’t even say thank you just ate it and later on they also bring stuff from their small towns but didn’t give any to me which I found very rude tbh. One of my roommates wakes up to pray at 6am and also wakes me up each time and never respects me in any certain way. Last time I cleaned the dorm room and they overreacted and told me that “ i didn’t clean well enough” That’s so weird that i had to clean the room because i wasn’t staying at my dorm for 2 weeks when i first arrived here. In scool also people are from near places and small towns so we don’t get well either. They make fun of the city that i came ( Los angles) saying its a wh0re land etc which brokes my heart and i can feel them judging me all the DARN time just because i am different from them.

4378,regardkick,1646591360,1,"TL:DR - I'm used to being alone, but am now feeling lonely and don't know how to fix it without depending on another person. Anything work for you? 

I (36F) have been alone (romantically) for a long time. I've met most of society's milestones - I own my home, I had a good job, I'm working full-time on a PhD, I travel - but I do it all alone. No partner, no children. 

I prioritized myself and my wants before really thinking about dating or being in a relationship. I've got a wonderful family, a good friend group, and I'm pretty active in my community - like, I like who I am and what my life is. Most of the time, I don't think about having a partner. 

I've tried dating apps on and off, but haven't had much success - mostly because I think of a partner as a value add, and so far, I haven't met someone who would add value to my life (and obviously, I hope to add value to someone else, too). And honestly, I'm afraid of depending on someone to be the source of my happiness. 

I used to be alone and was okay. But for the last couple of weeks I've been feeling lonely. I can't depend on someone else to get back to okay. I'll be honest that I miss a lot of the things a partner can do that you just can't do for yourself (not just sexy things, but like small touches and thoughtful gestures). I've been getting jealous of strangers on the street watching them walk hand-in-hand. 

Anyway I'm rambling because I don't know if I'm making sense. How do I alleviate my loneliness without relying on someone else?! Has anyone been successful in that and want to share tips.",lonely,"I used to just be alone, but now I feel lonely",2022-03-07 05:29:20
4379,moralmeemo,1646590007,1,"Hi. This is my first time posting here. I’m 18, non-binary, and I don’t have any friends. I haven’t really had friends for 5 years. I was bullied a lot and kinda hid from the world. 
I’ve known a lot of people but they always left, or ended up abusing me. I don’t ever have anyone to see or talk to. I live with my partner, and they have a healthy social life which I envy because they always have someone to talk to and people who need them. Everyone I see has friends to hang out with. Or they post pictures of themselves with their friends. My partner constantly talks about their friends and how fun they are and all the cool shit they do together. I so desperately want that…
I spend my days alone, trying to interact with people only to be ignored. I try to reach out to old friends but they bully me and turn me away. My partner tried to shoehorn me in with their group of friends but. It’s just not the same. 
People just… don’t like me. I always try to meet people but end up being ghosted.
My mental illness has kept me from going to college or working, or even going out in public. I have major anxiety (and other shit) so it’s kinda hard for me to talk to people irl. 
I always see groups of friends out together and it stings. I’ve always been suicidal and dealt with depression. But being alone? It makes me want to die all the time. 
I dunno. I don’t have any talents are hobbies besides drawing. So I don’t ever go out and meet people… I’ve tried. Nobody wants me around. Everyone has their friend group and their place, their own memories and inside jokes… not me. 

I like old movies, Netflix, rock music, art and drawing, JoJo’s bizarre adventure, nature, and obscure fandoms like Furries (safe for work only. Every furry I meet is kinda gross so I don’t have any furry friends). 
I love animals, and we have a ton at the house that I play with. They’re kinda my only friends. I’m working on becoming a wildlife rehabber. 
Please message me if you want to be friends! 
However, don’t message me if you’re gonna try to get gross stuff from me. Please. It hurts when people ask. Im not looking for a relationship! Just friends.",lonely,I haven’t had friends in years. It’s killing me. (TW),2022-03-07 05:06:47

4385,Profie02,1646583125,1,"i have had this kind of awakened phase in my life a few months ago where i realized the world wasn't really all that's cracked up to be. Most of my days nowadays is thinking about the past, when i had friends, social connections, the thing that seemed so effortless back then. As a kid, i had that kind of bravado, i could strike a conservation with anybody in the room; i was always talking, I was the opposite of lonely. But that couldn't be anymore different today.

Ever since covid, i have gotten rusty at my knack of communication, and 2 years in i apparently have lost all my skills. I am now more introverted, and thus i just don't carry that same extroverted mentality anymore. I don't talk as much as I used to, and so this has been the loneliest period of my life. Where did all the friends go? Where did I go? What happened to me?

Now i'm facing more stress than ever before in high school. School has always came naturally to me, but 2 years of online learning has basically eroded almost all the good study habits i had. Not good when you are in your last year. I originally thought that lockdown was good. I could relax for once! But it changed me permenantly.  I do not like this shell of myself. I want to go back to the past.

I went back and played some games from my childhood, and it was the first time i had cried in months. The longing to go back to simpler times, better times. I have always wanted to grow up, but ever since growing up I have never been this miserable. At the height of my problems right now, it seems as if there's nobody to talk to, no wall to keep me going. There is essentially no one that I can connect to anymore. I want to progress forward, I want to make friends again, but my confidence has completely vanished.

You may wonder how did I know that they were fake, well here's one example; I was an alcoholic, they left me for it, which was understandable, I got sober and they started drinking more, this simply lead us to be friends again and they tried to make me drink with them even though they vividly remember my past. 

I was okay with it, I was okay with the idea that I cared for them and they didn't care for me, I've never had a deep connection with another person but I still care about people who I'm somewhat ""close"" with.

i’ve had the horrible habit of torturing myself with the trivial act of checking her social media. watching her snap score go up. watching our mutual best friends icon disappear while she finds someone else.

i told her about it today. i shouldn’t have. she lied to me and said that on hers, we were still best friends but i know that’s not true, she just doesn’t want to make me sad by telling me who she’s talking to. i get it. and i’m fucking ashamed for even worrying about something so stupid. we’re not even together.

i just want to be w her again. she’s the only person who has ever truly understood who i am. i firmly believe that she knew me inside and out and i knew her inside and out. it kills me to watch her move on (if she even is and if this isn’t just a manifestation of my overthinking).

it’s sad. it’s sad watching her care less and less. i wonder who she’s texting. i wonder why she wouldn’t tell me. 

i thought of suicide at this point. i feel completely and utterly alone. and if i cut her off from my life i’ll simply have nobody outside of my family, and that’s scary to me.

my parents treat me like shit, constantly ignore me, put me down, never make time for me and don't like me at all. my mother is really manipulative, passive aggressive and kinda super racist (and transphobic) to me and acts like i'm the worst thing to ever step on earth because i dropped out of school (around this time last year because i couldn't afford to pay for HRT anymore and i was really depressed) and i'm unemployed again (i had a job for 2 1/2 months but i got fired).

i'm really really depressed because she cancelled my gender clinic appointment behind my back when i was too upset to go in for it (i was 15) and then it took 3 years for them to get back in contact so now i'm on the adult waiting list which is even longer. i don't even like going outside now because of the way i feel/look and she just makes me feel worse about it like she didn't cancel any chance i had at going on hormones when i was a teenager. because i have literally no friends i just talk to her and pretend to be friendly with her when deep deep down i hate her so so so much. she's so awful, so so so so so awful. i can laugh and talk to her about surface level things but not about anything real or serious or about my gender because i either don't want to talk about it or i can't without crying.

my father never spends any time with me ever all he does is go to work and go out drinking with his friends that just use him. he used to get violent with me over everything but now that i'm older i think he's embarrassed to do it or he knows it will get nowhere, he's just a violent stupid bastard.

i don't have much to say about my sister but we have an awful relationship too. for me it stems from the fact my parents have always treated her WAY better than me, she's always said she wanted to disown me/she's never liked me and didn't want to my sister and acts like she's got a way harder life than me. plus she used to laugh when my dad beat the shit out of me for no reason when we where younger. i'm not acting like i'm some blameless victim with her but i hate her and i'm so glad she's moved out. i wish we could have a normal sisterly relationship but she's so evil and self-righteous, i don't think i could ever truly love her.

i just feel so so so sad because i've been asking my parents to help me get a job (to pay/save up for hormones privately) since i was 14 (when they set up my sister with a job) but they just ignored me like they always do and just pushed it off and off because i had ""exams"" (that where ended by covid) and now i literally have no friends (i didn't have any real friends in school either because they where all bigots and treated me like shit) and now i'm literally completely alone, i don't even want to leave my house or get off my phone/computer because that's literally my only escape. i don't even find social media (i literally only use twitter and pinterest) and i don't even like watching shows or playing video-games or skincare or anything. i've been like this a long time trying to be happy but deep down feeling empty or nothing or just crushed by the world around me. i always remember telling my mother there was something really wrong with me and she did was brush it off or ignore me and make me feel bad about it.

my dad is so aggressive and manipulative in the way he speaks to me but i don't even care what he does because literally nothing makes me happy anymore so i'll just stay in bed and rot away. plus my parents say i do nothing for the house when i constantly do the washing up and any chores they ask me to do (washing up dishes, clothes, food, hoovering, bathroom, stairs) and my mother still finds things to complain about. i don't know what to do anymore. i tell my mother i'm transgender, i'm anorexic, i think there's something wrong with me and she just ignores me completely unphased. i just wish i had friends but all the friendships i try to make online suck. i'm so sad. i can't even think straight.",lonely,sob story,2022-03-06 22:50:42

A few weeks ago I started talking to a girl after going out with mutual friends. We had been texting a lot and got drinks one night, then went out to a nice dinner together. Another night I asked her to a comedy show and she said yes. We met there but then another guy came too that she introduced me to, and they went home together.




It had been years since I had even been on a date and then this happens. Any confidence I mustered for any of that is kinda shattered now.

I know I might be irrelevant but, I’m a freshmen in high school and I like this girl on my bus. Your probly thinking so simple right just talk to her, except I have social anxiety. Every time I force myself to sit around her on the bus i literally try so hard to but like my mouth just has a mind of its own and just won’t talk. Then when I overthink it it’s too late, she’ll fall asleep or we’ll arrive at the school or her friend sits next to her and starts babbling on. We make 2-4 second eye contact a lot but nothing more and when I see her in school she’s either in a rush or talking with her friend. I know it’s a lot of excuses but whenever she’s free, I feel like I’m banging behind soundproof glass while she’s in front of it. Every single time I get off the bus I feel so cold, so lonely, so hopeless, like a fucking loser who can’t do shit. I cry almost every time after the bus, there’ll be a few times out of the week where she doesn’t go on the bus in the afternoon and I hate it. One day I just sat infront of the seat of hers and just bawled out silent cried listening to sad music. Head low, nobody could tell, I could hear her eating chips or something really close behind the seat with meant her head was close to the seat, i stopped for a second. The following day or the day after I sat behind her and realized I could see her reflection on the window in the crack between the seat and the window which made me realized she could’ve been watching me the whole time I was crying. I kinda panicked for a second but then just pictured me never coming in contact with her ever because of that, so I bawled out  again crying but this time I payed my head on the back of the seat of the one in front of me(my crush’s seat) and started listening to sad Weeknd music, kinda hummed a bit and then saw her reflection in the window laying her head against the seat. It could’ve meant she was listening to me and the music, it could’ve also meant she was just laying her head on it but even if she wasn’t she still could’ve heard it or me. She also didn’t change her position either she seemed like she was tuned in to it.

Okay I understand ppl can't be what makes me feel less lonely but we are social beings so what does one do when they lonely and wanna talk or w.e share thoughts and everyone is just dry and insincere. Of course not all people are this way and it's easy to be that way too depending on the conversation topic and comfortability/connection but I'd much rather have that person just leave and pursue something or someone they would enjoy talking to. Forced conversations are a bit of a time waster I think. I don't even know what to do after a bit and feel obligated to carry the torch to the finish line but I mean it kind of goes no where either way so it's an endless race around a track of meaningless chatter. I'm sure someone will take offence to this and I don't really mind because it's just the truth I see from my own life. I don't know what to do with myself.

I want this, and I hope I haven’t misread you.

All I want is for him to materialize next to me and comfort me. “Don’t worry, I’m here.” But he never will. He will stay a rough draft, tucked away in the corners of my mind. Only appearing when I desperately need company. Never comforting me, only my projection. And I’m jealous. I’m jealous of the things my other self gets to feel, touch and smell. Sometimes it seems she is laughing at me; antagonizing me. She knows I will never get to experience the love I create for her. My one comfort is tainted by torment and mockery. I can’t escape reality, and I can’t escape my dream world. I’m really stuck, aren’t I? Maybe one day my rough draft will come to life, with open arms ready to breathe me in.

She helped me realize things about myself and made me feel things I never felt before.
She always made me so happy, I wanted to wake up and I wanted to live to talk to her. I finally felt alive for once!
Then she started saying more out of pocket and weird stuff, peaking with her saying pedo shit about my 12-year-old-brother.
I wanted to ask her if she'd actually do it or not, and I was intending to cut contact and run if she said yes, but she blocked me first.
This is what always happens to me, I meet friends, I have fun, I find out they're crappy people and leave. This was that same thing, but far worse.
I still miss her and browse her profile from time to time in specially down bad moments.

So I want to make this clear I did not offer to make her like me. I did it cause I believe in doing good to those who do good to you.

I had already asked her out in January but she said no which I respected and just didn’t attempt to flirt or take it any further 

So anyway I pick her up and we talk bout eachothers days and then she was telling me about what it’s like closing the store for the night.

Then she was telling me about this cashier she works with asked her how she was getting home.

Then she mentioned me  then the cashier teased her about Her and Me 

Then the cashier apparently said “I’ve seen you Y’all cute”

Anyway my coworker she laughed it off talking about how the cashier is just childish and like still in the 1st grade.


So I kinda just awkwardly laughed along and I dunno it was kinda like I got like stabbed in the heart like literally my chest just felt heavy and compressed.


So I drop her off she says thank you 

I’m just so like confused and just a bit upset like I got lost trying to find my way out which I shouldn’t get lost cause my dad lives like 2 blocks away


Then like on the way back home to my moms like I’m just talking to myself and I’m just speaking out loud like 

“God why do you hate me” then I’m just pissed more at myself and I’m like “why am I just venting outloud to no one in my car and complaining about god whom lives in the sky and controls peoples destiny when it’s such a role flip compared to my belief in freewill and choice.”

4463,127pharaway,1646537919,1,"I've always been a person with a lot of friends. Growing up and in my early 20s I was the girl who always had plans, always had people over, and was always busy. I never had trouble making friends. This is... no longer the case. 

I was with my ex for three years, we had a good social life and lots of mutual friends. We broke up and the friends sort of stuck with him, that's okay, most of them knew him first and I had my own friends! 

Then things just started getting worse. My best friend moved overseas because she could make more money abroad. And she was my connection to a wider group of acquaintances, of whom I now never see.

Then my other best friend, who was living with me, moved to a different city with her boyfriend. Another link to a wider group if aquitences I no longer really see. 

All while covid happens in the background. There haven't been gigs or events happening consistently in my city for a long time, most of the friends I was starting to make before things started getting crazy kind of fizzled out. I moved to this city from my hometown not long before covid took over.

I have been working from home for 7 months now and I hate it. I miss seeing people everyday, and being social. Even though I never really managed to make real friends at work, I got on with everyone just fine and I suppose it filled the void of real friendship that I was lacking in my personal life. 

I've never felt so lonely. I cry every single morning because I know it's another day alone. I've done all the things you're supposed to do, I reach out to anyone and everyone and nobody is keen to hang out, or they're busy. I've joined groups, classes, anything you can think of to make friends nothing has worked. I've gone to things alone and tried to strike up converstion and nothing. Then if something does go well, covid pops up again and everything is canceled. 

So in my loneliness I've started using people. Using my ex who I know wants to get back together just for company. Which i know is making his life worse. But he's the only person who ever picks up the phone. I can see the pain in his eyes whenever I go to hang up. And I know I'm using him, I know I'm so selfish, but I just can't do another weekend all by myself. I feel beyond terrible. He's a good person and I'm using him for company with zero intention of getting back together. Leading him on so I'm not lonely. Sometimes I let him think there's a chance, just so he'll stick around. 

I was in a car accident last week and realized I had nobody to call. Nobody to even tell about it. I cried the whole night not even because my car is messed up, or because I was scared, because there wasn't even a single soul I could tell that I was scared. That I thought I was going to die, and that nobody would notice, that it wouldn't be a huge loss to the world because I don't really know anybody. 
So I called him again, used him to make myself feel better then dipped. As usual. 

I heard he was seeing a new girl and called it off because he couldn't figure out his feelings for me. I am actively making this man's life worse simply because I can't figure out how to make a friend. 

I hate living like this. I hate being alone, the only communication I have with humans is about an hour a day during my daily work meeting. I feel awful, I feel like a bad person, and I just needed to vent.

You have negative views of the world due to being repeatedly judged and/or shamed for your ways, but you reach out to new people to try and make a connection, only for you to be socially rejected. And so you shrink back into your negative views of the world, and it becomes a cycle that only gets worse the longer other people fail to realise their contributions.

I’m not saying it’s 100% the other person’s fault. I know I’m a flawed person, and talking to my therapist has exposed my flaws. But the only way I can get better is by talking to people- which is something nobody wants to do. Nobody wants to talk to someone who doesnt know how to not be weird, or someone who seems clingy, or someone who is just desperate for their attention. It’s hard being comfortable in your loneliness but at the same time unwilling to consciously bear it any longer than I have to, but literally having no way out due to social isolation.

4487,Flyaway_5,1646528793,0,"I remember when I was in a class in college and we had this group project. I was put in a group with this guy and gal. We then discussed the project and the guy asked the girl if we can set up a day and time to meet and practice all day. She freaked out and started screaming for 15 minutes and said, ""PRACTICE ALL DAY? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I don't have time to be practicing all day! I have other things to do! Practicing for an hour is fine, but to PRACTICE ALL DAY? FOR ONE CLASS? FOR ONE PROJECT?"" She was so mad and bolted out of the room and drank some water to calm down.

I also felt like she was rude to me too. I was showing her something for the project, and she didn't seem interested or even looked at the paper I was showing her. Also within that short moment that we met,she could tell right away that I was quiet and pointed out that she didn't like it. She said, ""But you are quiet..."" and frowned.

Then the day came for us to practice, I met with the guy and we were both waiting for her. She didn't show up at all. She texted us and said her car was having problems and that she was at the mechanics. I think that was some BS excuse she made so that she wouldn't have to meet with us and spend time practicing with us. She made it to class every day, even presentation day, but couldn't make it to practice?

I'm not saying that she didn't deliver when the presentation was due, because she did goooooood. She had everything memorized for her part. She performed better than the both of us, and she didn't even need to practice with us at all. She presented first, then me, then the guy. The professor even told us that the quality of the presentation was great at the beginning then it deteriorated. She didn't show up to practice but she did communicate through texts and e-mailed us her PowerPoint slides.

Even though she didn't need to practice with us since she did better than us, and seemed irritated by the guy saying that we need to practice all day, I still felt like she could have had a little patience and not overreact the way she did, and also have the decency to show up and practice and not flake out on us.

I don't like telling people when mine is anymore because it generally marks a time of the year where I only ever feel shitty. But the truth is, even to the few ""friends"" I have left these days, they don't remember it either way.  


And while birthday's are just another day, I don't know - I still always remember theirs, I've done significant things for theirs just using their day as an excuse to do something nice, because I care. Because knowing something I've done would make them happy, is one of the only things left I still get any happiness from. And I don't do it expecting anything in return, but...  


I know a lot of people are struggling with isoloation from COVID, but I've been in isolation for the past 10 years of my life. When I was a teenager my health began to rapidly decline, both mentally and physically. The only human contact I have in the real world is with doctors, or my mother - our relationship is not great, but she's all I seemingly have.  


When I was young and the depression and bipolar were sinking in, I used to wish everyone would just forget me, that it would be easier. I can confidently say that, after a decade of loneliness, sprinkled here and there with online friendships that never last - being truly alone? It's overwhelming.  


I used to play MMO's, the online community of the one I played as a teen into my early 20's raised me. That, combined with the plethora of mental illnesses was not a good thing. The internet can be especially toxic. I eventually got out of that crowd, began to work on myself, try to be a better person. It's difficult when a lot of the time you're not even in control of your own mind, but I still try my best.  


I stopped playing MMO's, I thought it was better that way, less drama. I thought I didn't need to make new friends because I had the few that were ""real"" to still speak to. What these people probably never fully realised is that while they had lives, even if they were introverted, they still had contact with people in the real world, things they could do - however small. For me? They were my world.  


So what do you do when your world forgets you? It doesn't seem to matter what I do, but I'm never enough. I'm just words on a screen, and apparently not even words anybody likes. I'm just a passing interest that never goes anywhere, while people visit for awhile before moving on. I just wish that I was better, that I was good enough to hold interest, that someone wanted to be around me as much as I them. That someone cared, or wanted me to smile.  


I wish I was angry, that I cared enough about myself, but I don't. How can I expect anyone to be friends with me, when I wish I was anyone else?

4493,Connect_Basis1642,1646526448,1,"Howdy - I (20m) was wondering if anyone could relate to this tonight… my little brother (15) went to his first high school dance tonight and while I’m most happy to see him finally growing up I’m just reminded of the high school experience I always fantasized about growing up but never got to have, and this overbearing feeling of regret has sure taken me.

I probably would have been socially successful if I hadn’t been raised on a poor diet and began gaining weight like crazy since 2nd grade. I was overweight throughout elementary and middle school, and managed to lose nearly all my blubber only to gain it back and more several times throughout high school. 

I was shy, isolated, didn’t have any neighbors or friends, never hung out with anyone outside of school, and each day consisted of me getting through the day just so I could go home and listen to the music or get on computer games to chat with folks.

I had a long-distance relationship for several years that only recently ended, and it was nice and seemed to make up for what was lacking at the time, but it was really just a waste of time in the end, because I never got to experience having any real high school romance, or going to the school dances or football games, or being in a sport, or having a group of friends who I’d remember and tell stories about for the rest of my life. 

Sadly, all I’ll remember is me distracting myself with old country music on the bench by myself during lunchtime, my mind elsewhere. Goodness, I should have dropped out and ran away, or at least gotten expelled as a result for some memorable prank.

Instead I stuck through to graduation and didn’t leave the system until I’d learned how much of a joke college is. (So much for all that worrying about getting into my university of choice during high school). I always told myself something was coming, and it just never did.

I figured I could just lie and pretend I had a more solid social foundation when I recall the past 20 years, but I’m trying to see if there’s something I haven’t thought about. I need a new way to think about this as I’m trying to get away from my hometown and leave this all behind in favor with what will hopefully be an exciting life.

I know, but struggle to accept, that I will never find answers, because though lonely and bored I feel, I don't want to have friends, a partner or anything, so advice like ""just go outside"" talk to people, etc. won't help, because those kinds of things I don't care about, but it appears to be such a significant component of human existence that the longer I go without it, as I have done my entire life, the more bored and disillusioned with life I become. If it were by me I would have the part of consciousness that is having me believe socialization is such a good thing, removed or suppressed.

What I'm trying to say is: I don't really care if I spend the rest of my life alone or not, but I'm really fucking bored. Passive entertainment isn't entertaining anymore. I don't want to do anything. I just know I'm bored. I work and that's cool and good but it can only distract me from the void for so long, and when work has me stressed I don't have anything or anyone to hold onto, so all I'm left thinking is: things may get better or worse, but there is no escape or rest, so I can only endure whether I want it or not.

And you know what, I know for a fact even I somehow managed to get friends I would get bored of them or they would get bored of me really fast. People are all carbon-copies of each other and I'm a really superficially boring person with nothing going in my life. 

No one asked me what I thought of all this before I was flung into this situation. Until the age of 16 (when this situation reached the current plateau) I kept looking for answers on the internet but got the same ones again and again, the same exact wording like they just copy-pasted some shit from somewhere or something. The eye-rolling and exasperation was so hard I took intermittent year long breaks and from the internet and all other mediums of entertainment and dived into books, resurfaced without any answers that satisfied me and here I'm, almost 8 years later, without any answers, disillusioned with every current of thought available to me, except for stoicism and even that isn't helping much since I fail to put it into practice all the time.

I wanted to read ten books last year, read half of two and never ended them, I read zero books. I used to play songs by ear and now I don't even know how to play guitar. Dropped out of engineering. I was so excited to finally beat integral calculus, ended up dropping out after the first week of the quarter. Now I can't even bear to think of telling my dad I dropped out. Let alone get a job, every time I think about having a job where I will have to be around people I fucking panic. I feel trapped, I surrender, I just wanna get a fucking heart failure and die unexpectedly, so I dont have to explain this shit to actual people. I tried to talk to people in this place but I realized we're all fucking selfish and everyone I talk to either only care about venting out themselves or don't care at all. And I'm the same way, I don't care about others and don't feel the desire to talk to people. I hope I fucking die, I can't do it myself, fuck you all.",lonely,Why does every single thing seem pointless?,2022-03-06 09:53:54

I'm very messy but I'll try to keep it organized.

I feel like I'm always waiting, when I have free time, I'm bored and can't make myself do anything I used to do for fun, like music, art, video games, watching a show or a movie, and when I'm at work I wait for my shift to end because there's barely any work to do. I live this life where I wake up, work, go home and sleep, I do this for 4 days a week and then I have 3 free days which I use for mostly sleep. I have been suicidal for a few years but it comes and goes, I hate my life, I have no idea how to make friends. I've never had a gf but I always wanted to have such a connection. I've lost all of my confidence in myself when I left my military service (it's mandatory here). My story is too big and messy for me to write here without boring you so I'll try to write it as short as I can.

I was a nerd that was bullied a lot but I still had a few friends. in 8th grade I started losing my connection to society by being not paying attention in school and playing games all day and talking with online friends, I lost the few friends I had but I didn't care at the time. in high school, I've made a few new friends. my parents always wanted me to go to therapy but I always said no because I knew something was wrong but never knew what. after high school I went to the army and started basic training, it was super hard for me, that's when I broke. after a year I left the military because I was suicidal and was in a really bad state, after that covid hit and I was home for a year, and then I started working, after my military service I went to several places of therapy which didn't help like partial hospitalization, I still go to therapy but I don't feel like it really helps.

I lost all my friends but one from school and one from the military, but I barely see them. I have a younger brother which I'm close to but he's in the military so I barely see him too, I only have my parents which I barely talk to and my therapist and my social worker which I see each once a week.

I'm supposed to go to a rehabilitation center in a few months but until then I feel just feel lost and lonely.

I am a 18 year old male that has never had any real relationships. The closest thing I hat to one was with one of my friends. We hooked up a few times. It started out with just making out after party’s while drunk. I didn’t know if I wanted a relationship or not. After a while we started to hook up instead of just making out. Soon after that I kissed someone else and realized that I didn’t want her but I was in love with the “physical love” she was giving me. Because not knowing what’s up with me and her our mental health was steadily declining hers even more than mine because she did want a real relationship with me and I, like the asshole I am turned it into an on off thing until I ended it all after I made out with someone else and realized the things said above. 
Ever since then my mental health has not been great. I am regularly having panic attacks, suicidal thoughts , and harm myself. 

Now to today.
I met this girl and I really like her. Our interests math up we are really similar but not too similar as in we don’t have anything to talk about. I met her when she was visiting my dancing lesson because me she needed a partner in a parallel lesson. then my friend said he would do it. Back then I didn’t want anything with her. Soon after that my friend. Hurt his arm and was unable to dance so she asked me if I wanted to replace him since he can’t dance anymore for a while. I happily accepted and went to the lessons. While dancing I started to get to know her and found out she has the same interest as I do. I asked her if she wanted to hang out and maybe learn for upcoming A Level exams. She said ok and we were on discord for about two hours before she had to go eat. After that we talked for another 2h. However ever since that I don’t know what to do she rarely answers me but she also doesn’t push me back as in “you’re a good friend” or something like that. Today we were dancing again and I really enjoyed spending time with her and she seemed to do so too but when I texted her afterwards she ignored me. She’s been online several times since I texted her but has never responded. 
I don’t know what to do anymore

4547,erugo,1646505991,1,"Hi.

I just found this subreddit, by searching for the name in the search bar. I don't know at what stage you guys do that, but I think a couple of stars aligned in order for me to take this action after not doing it for so long. Or maybe I just liberated myself thanks to some recent personal progress and allowed myself to reach out. This will be a post of reaching out, a public letter to myself, a longish rant that you are free to skip.

\----

I am 28M. I have spent most of my life as an outcast, having difficulty in finding ""my tribe"" -- which I'd describe as a group of people I can emotionally synchronize and share a value hierarchy with, much like how a tribe would gather around a totem pole and do their rituals.

I kept writing and deleting my biography, I don't know how exactly to lay out the problem.

Long story short, I was a kid that was bullied in school, miserable love life from putting girls on pedestals and interacting with their images in my head rather than the girls themselves.

I eventually learned how to adapt to the social norms, even conforming to some extent, and I felt included, for some period of time.

Of course, conditions changed, the balance was restored and broken again. To provide a summary of the rest of my time, Mostly, I was claimed to be charming and charismatic, however unsuccessful with girls due to my fucked up anima relations (for the psychology lovers out there). I had a relationship that ended with trauma on my side and that fucked up my social disposition for the most part. I became more affiliated with the nihilistic, trickster side. When I went to university, things were not much different --  except I socially isolated myself at this time, I got to know people eventually but I did not ever consider myself belonging to any tribe.

Between getting my degree and today, I lived in 3 countries one being my home country, worked at 4 different places, studied at 2 schools. At each of these, I did not have unpleasant interactions necessarily, but I did not ever find people that I would claim to be my tribe.

Obviously, the parameter staying constant in all this was me -- There's something about me that makes it difficult for me to feel included. I'm not sure if I want to completely conform, but I don't feel socially satisfied either.

One obstacle I feel to be blocking me is a sense of ""perfectionism"" when it comes to choosing my interactions. Call it arrogance, but I always feel that there is some kind of insufficiency when it comes to interacting with someone. I don't think I have impossible expectations as I also met people with whom I was much more comfortable interacting, and I was looking forward to more interaction. But in most of my interactions, I am predisposed to remaining unsatisfied and not being able to share a mutual interest into the conversation. It might also be that most conversations start with small talk but I feel uncomfortable doing small talk. I don't know why this is exactly -- I'm not necessarily bad at it, unless I feel extremely unmotivated so I just choose to shut up.

There's also a certain sense of over-analyzing that accompanies my interactions with people -- especially new connections. I spend most of my cognitive load trying to figure out what would be appropriate or not. This was especially true last week, I just started working at a new place where mostly German people work, and my German is not very well -- and it's a completely different culture than what I'd have at home. But maybe this was simply a big challenge and it triggered my past feelings of being a misfit, although I am doing much better in most circles today.

As a result of all my predispositions, I feel that I am actually self-inflicting my loneliness -- I have good adaptation skills and that worked before in the past but I'm not really motivated to use them. At the same time, I feel slightly bitter that I am sometimes marginalized in my social circles. I'm not really blaming anyone for this, as people probably feel a sense of belonging to their tribes and they are skeptical when someone like me comes and remains rather distant. But I can't help it.

\----

I kept writing and deleting more details of my past life, in which I analyzed why I'm at where I am right now. But I decided to keep it to myself, as I couldn't really create an effective and concise public summary of it.

Long story short, I feel excluded, isolated, insignificant most of the time, but I think it's something I'm inflicting on myself. I find it difficult to connect when there's no immediate electricity. Even if there's some, I'm not equipped to put in the effort to sustain that connection.

I wish I could keep my pickiness but more people would pass the filter and feel closer, at the same time I wish my overall relations with the ""general public"" would be more smooth, it doesn't have to be much closer. I wish I felt valued, respected, attractive while not compromising on my independent and non-conformist stance.

That's me. I know the post sounds a little confused and all over the place. I'd say that I know it's not perfect but I still wanted to share.

Despite all my rant, I am here if you feel lonely and want to share. I hope you feel better.",lonely,"On tribelessness, pickiness, and ""self-inflicted"" loneliness",2022-03-06 05:46:31

Went inside a café, got to know each other a bit. Sounds really stupid, but it felt like we already knew each other for a long time.

I drive home and we continued texting each other. He told me he had strong feelings for me and I told him I did the same. We promised each other to talk every day. Several months passed by, and gradually, conversations became dead. Several days went by with hearing nothing from him. He’s a busy guy, with studying and part time work. I tried not to pressure him. He had a life, and I didn’t. I don’t do much every day except to think about him. He made me feel so much better from the loneliness. Eventually, we both realized it wouldn’t work because of the distance. That we could remain as friends. 

The days after that ending feel so much more lonely. It’s hard to talk to people and meet new people. I have no interest in engaging in anything. I miss him so much.

I am interested in a relationship with one of my friends.

This made me reflect on what I'm looking for. After talking to some people about it, I'm in a crisis over what exactly I want. I don't want to think of a relationship as being defined by sex.

Basically, I don't know if a relationship (to me), is just a close friendship with more physical intimacy, and maybe some level of exclusivity. I develop very intimate friendships with people who I am both attracted to and not. I haven't yet heard people describe a level of emotional connection with their partner that exceeds my openness to my closest friends.

Thinking about my friend who I want to ask out. I know she may be someone I could be very intimate with emotionally. But I also want to be physically intimate, and have the affirming feeling of mutual desire.

Is this a relationship? Wanting to develop a deeper friendship, wanting physical intimacy and the affirming feeling of mutual desire?

4572,no-puedo-encontrar,1646496965,1,"Very recently I have started to notice that I am very lonely. After moving back in with my parents at the end of 2019 from a year abroad I felt fine. It was good to be home. Covid didn’t phase me too much, I had my parents, we did garden visits with family and friends etc and all my friends were keen to get out when the world opened up again so it was great. 

In January of this year, I moved into a new flat in the same town as my parents/family. I expected my flat to be buzzing with friends and family coming to visit all the time, having my friends over for drinks and dinners. I had a “home warming” which was great. 

Since then, I barely get any visitors at all - everyone seems busy all the time with other stuff, new kids, new homes, new marriages, new careers.  I attend Uni during the week (placement) so I get social interaction there and then I work all weekend from home and have very limited social interaction. 

I never expected my late 20s to be like this - I feel like I moved in here and the world forgot about me! I’m desperate for a hobby (something that would help shed the weight I’ve gained and make friends) but never seem to find the time (an excuse maybe?)

4576,No_Mathematician374,1646496554,1,"So I’m 20f (almost 21) and I’ve never been in a relationship, had sex, had a REAL kiss, etc. I am extremely insecure about my body (especially private areas) and don’t feel like I could ever let someone else see those parts of me. In fact, I’ve already convinced myself that I will die a virgin and without ever dating. People never date without having sex, I don’t believe it’s possible. 

I’ve been pretty much alone my whole life so far. Ive had friends but never ones that I can be completely honest with. I’m in my junior year of college now and I have no friends. I stay in my room 90% of everyday except when I’m at class. I don’t talk to my classmates. I don’t talk to my roommate. I think I have some kind of social anxiety so I can’t talk to new people or my roommate and get enjoyment out of it. I just feel anxious the whole time and I’m never being myself in those interactions. I feel like Im only ever being myself WITH myself. Being alone all the time means you talk to yourself OFTEN. Ig I’ve always done that though. 

Anyway, I’m incredibly lonely but I think I prefer it. People are too scary, too judgmental. I judge myself but at least my thoughts are safe with me.

I guess I don’t have any questions or profound statements to make, just wondering if anyone feels the same? Feeling this way about life and myself is the only time I have really felt alone. Everyone around me is an extroverted, sex-having, socially adept, person. Even the people I know who are introverted still find themselves in relationships and able to be vulnerable in that way. Maybe thats a part of something bigger for me.

I didn't have my parents in my life due to their drug addiction and my fosterparents were emotionally abusive in my teen years. I see my fostermom a few times a year, no contact with my fosterdad and I've accepted that they won't ever be in that parenting role.

She went to lie on the floor so I went to go sit with her, I got on the floor and she got up and moved to another spot on the floor about 2 meters away. Why?!?!

4626,ArabesqueNo_1,1646465753,1,"There have been some points in my life where I’ve had zero to a lot of friends throughout the years. It has surprised me how life can change that quickly for me. I’ve had friends come and go, but a lot of past “friends” either turned out to be flaky, toxic, backstabbing, or just too busy with something else if they’re not that bad people. Or, I had the realization that some have simply just been acquaintances this entire time and not really considered friends. I think friends shouldn’t be the number one priority in life because building your career, focusing on your hobbies and growing as a person are more important. Either way, I think that the most important thing in life is not to see everything as a number’s game. What you see on social media might make people feel like they’re not cool enough or that they are losers if they don’t have a bunch of friends they can take photos with at cool locations. You might worry that photos won’t get as much likes and that others will think your posts are boring/uncool. But it shouldn’t determine your worth. Some people currently in my college have been upset about all the drama happening within their friend groups, have been acting very reckless to look cool, and have forgotten about their true identities by putting up façades. Personally, maintaining friendships involves a lot of draining, emotional investment, especially with you having to adhere to a lot of things others want to do just to get validation and approval. It’s harder to maintain friendships more than making them. There might be a few good friends some people have in life, but those are the very rare percentage of people in the world and are very rare to find. That is why as we grow up, there are less and less people in our lives we’d consider real. Think about how many real people will stay in your life as years and decades pass. Deep down, a lot of people would count their family members and possibly their spouse, but there would be hesitancy for some people to say that even friends will be within that category—whether you currently have any or none right now. This is why I don’t define myself and my worth based on this, and none of you should either.

I got 4 people who i consider my “best friends” but one of them seems like they’re distancing themselves from me very slowly for another friend group, but im not even gunna try to make them stay or anything idc anymore tbh. Idk, its not like i cant make friends cause i can pretty easily, but idk maybe i just dont like people or something, or maybe i do suck at forming good relationships. 

i really dont have nobody to talk to about shit like this, that one “best friend” has never really been one to talk to about these things, and i sure as hell wont talk to my parents about this. so i guess that led me here. 

my parents are together and care for me, i live in a decent neighborhood, have good grades, have clothes, a ps5, shoes, a nice phone, a nice room. a good family. I really cant ask for more. with all that being said, that doesn’t make me happy. shit maybe i’m spoiled and i don’t realize it, but the point is i really dont know what makes me happy, the last thing that really made me happy was spending time and talking with my girlfriend until we broke up around October 2020, i pretty much got over it, sometimes i miss it, but its not something that tears me apart. 

I barely have enough motivation to do anything anymore, weather its going out with my few friends, going to school or playing sports. Nothing really excites me anymore, i dont have much to look forward too anymore as i’m pretty much done playing baseball. Music is one of the only things that keeps me going, i cant express the love i have for music, its just really comforting hearing other peoples works of art, hearing their stories and experiences and taking it all in, while also listening to beautiful chords, drum patterns etc. A lot of times i end up getting in my car after i’m finished with homework around 8-9pm and just drive around listening to music. 

 i forgot how it got here, but i remember my parents asking me “what do you do good as a kid?” or something along those lines, and i remember just standing there, seriously not having an answer.  I dont know anymore, i’m really just not happy with who i am but i have no more motivation to try and change who i am, as i’ve tried so many times in the past. i feel like i’m throwing my life away and i dont know what to do anymore, i’m really scared for the future and what’s going to happen during and after college.

Someone else could be having their feet on the seat across from them, yelling and laughing so loud the bus driver is getting annoyed, and yet 'I' am the one who feels abnormal. This is not to say everyone is looking at me, but more that those who are, those very few, are seeing me as the weird one. I also feel that I cannot measure up to those around me. They have friends, girlfriends, etc. I know people say that you have to compare yourself to your past self and even then, I feel I am little to no more mature. I love being with friends and family, but no one wants to be around me. It's hard to know that every day. I'm a straight A student yet I always feel I am the one failing.

When I get myself together and try to be less hostile and do more effort than I should to talk to others (Internet or real life), I can find a few people but it never leads to anything - friends in real life, partner, etc.. Everything feels fake and pointless. Especially trying to find people here or on dating/friendship apps.

&amp;#x200B;

If I go on dating apps, I just want to delete my profile immediately when I see all the ""be taller / older"", ""have a car / earn a lot"" profiles. Yeah, they're fake... but do they suffer? They don't. They'll find someone, they won't be oppressed. This life is made for that kind of mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

If I try to find friends, I'm loosing any motivation immediately. It's always the same. I'm disgusted by guys that look masculine.. which isn't really their fault. It's a complex issue for me. Regardless, I don't feel like they can understand my issues, so I avoid them. Women, though? Even if I lower my hopes from finding a partner to just a friend, most of them act like they can't be friends because I'm born male.

Sure, I admit myself as being a lonely person, but at the same time I never felt so emotional distraught that everyone is going through a lot, and believe me I wish everyone's problem is solved in a snap of a finger so they don't have to suffer as I do. In my personal life, I have one belief and I forever will keep hold of it (Not self damaging), sacrificial help to others. In other words, I want to hear someone out or assist them of my best ability to help them. Sure I get some want to be left alone which is understandable and I respect that 100% because some people have different ways of dealing things, but to those who reach out, I want to speak deep down from my heart that you always have a chance, your life can be so crap, upside down, or even just not worth your time/value but you are the truth to what you can do. I never got a chance to show people what I'm made of since I'm always backing off and never taking the frontlines and I full on regret it, but seeing others ahead of me puts a smile. Another side note, whatever you do, whether a mistake, achievement or any of some sorts, never regret it. Sure some things can never be proud of such as watching porn, ghosting people, gossiping, exposing dark secrets but hey we are humans, we have tendencies to do things we just never think of.

We were planning on living together for the upcoming year, but it ended up so that they were living together, and I'm on my own. And I just feel so left out of everything. They have a bunch of inside jokes, they share stories and stuff with each other that I know nothing about, and they all go out together as well. It sucks that I feel left out of the only friends I feel I've made so far in college. 

On the other hand, I feel like my friendship with my best friend since middle school is fading away. We don't talk as much as we used to and I feel that I put more effort into our friendship. She leaves me on read most of the time, and it's just not the same vibe we used to have.

On one hand, I'm very lonely. I'm nearly 30 now, and I've been in one short, quasi relationship that was several years ago. I feel fortunate to be able to say that, but that's not what this is about.

On the other hand, I will question myself back and forth as to whether I want to continue dating someone after a first date. For added detail: I don't have first dates that often. It can sometimes take e a couple months or so just to have a match on a dating app get to that level. That's partially because I've just been using them less, but also because I'm just not a top 10% dude. But again...that's not even what this is about.

The last time I think I had real feelings for someone was near the end of 2019 -- but they ended things after the third date.

At this point, I honestly have trouble just...imagining myself with someone. Like I'll try to think about what it would be like to be in a relationship and I just can't. It doesn't feel like a thing. For me, that is. I can imagine other people being in relationships...just not myself.

And as much as it sounds like it, I don't even think this is a self esteem thing. Not all of it, at least. I think I'm just getting so used to being alone that the idea of living my life any other way feels like it would be too much of a departure.

Fuck that's sad, isn't it? I'm not even really sad right now or anything. I actually just had a decent first date, but am doing that back and forth questioning with myself. And the thing is...I think I know I'm just not interested in them, but my loneliness is telling me I *have* to give it a shot, like I'm obligated or something.

And remember that I said the last time I had any feelings for someone was 2019. Who knows how long it'll be until I feel like that again?

Then one day about 2 years after I moved I got a like from her on Tinder (I have a premium membership, so I see who swipes right on me). I immediately swiped right on her and asked her if she was visiting the country I live in. She told me no, so she obviously used the traveling feature on Tinder, whatever it's called, where you can artificially set your location.

I then immediately knew that she deliberately set her location close to the city I lived in, because there was no other explanation as to why she would have set it there. I was happy about this, I really like her. So from there on we a lot for the next few months. I started to really like her and was thinking about going back home when I had time off from work, mostly to visit her. And we had also talked about either me visiting her or her visiting me.

She was overweight, which I was fine with, but then a few months after we started chatting she had a gastro bypass surgery and lost a lot of weight. She looked really good and seemed to have gained a lot of confidence as a result. I was glad for her and supportive. But then she kind of stopped messaging me. Only sent short answers whenever I sent her messages and then eventually stopped answering me.

So she essentially ""got promoted to a higher league"". I know it's a shitty way of saying it, but that's basically what happened, and I'm very hurt by it. When I finally felt like I had really bonded with someone she just moved on. As if I was just some stepping stone to further riches.

I'd like for me and her to reconnect, but I doubt it will happen. Looking at her social media it looks like she's living her absolutely best life and it feels like she just doesn't need a loser like me anymore.

well today i found out they really dont care too much for me.

basically i argued with one guy (ill call him J) about how i felt bad that he and the others pressured our friend with a car (ill call him E) to hang out so much because most of us dont have cars. well firstly i just brought it up but J took it as a personal attack and got upset with me. then i checked in on E to make sure he was ok with everyone asking him to take them everywhere all the time and he said he was fine. (E is my best friend since kindergarten) well i check out of school because fuck it its friday and i dont want to deal with the drama later, and one OTHER guy texts me while im sitting at home (well call this one T) and tells me that im always starting group drama and that everyone actually just hates how i act anyways. he just started telling me all sorts of shit like i make everyone uncomfortable or im a general ass. also apparently E is mad at me over something his girlfriend said about me (that i have no clue about i really have no idea what ive done to her) basically its all just highschool drama between dudes. i feel like im in a group of girls, not to mention if T isnt just talking out of spite no one really cares for me anyways. 

so i cant deny it or get mad because wtf am i supposed to do? im not gonna bend my entire personality to some guys in highschool. i understand they have issues with me but they could have told me sooner instead of using it as ammunition to shit on me on a bad day. theyve not been good to me. even if this shit gets resolved im not sure i wanna go back because this shit has happened before and its such a drag. plus if im really THAT unpleasant to be around id rather be alone. 

i guess the part that makes this the worst is that these are my only friends. i already didnt trust some of the others i didn't mention but now theyre ALL against me. my best friend is mad at me and will probably just follow the herd. im not sure if i can even consider them good friends to me. so every connection i made at this dumb fucking school was for nothing. everyone has left me over some petty group drama that should be reserved for middle school girls and also apparently they dont like me normally too. im completely alone. i have lost all my friends. im sitting here alone while they're all skating just wondering how i got here. how i lost my best friend to a bunch of people using him for his car. im not really sure how to be on my own. i already got dumped by my ex at the start of the year and ghosted by a girl in the middle of february. it really just feels like people genuinely do not want to be around me. i try very hard not to be a bad, generally unlikable person but it feels like no matter what i do i am not a right fit for people and ill just continue to argue or be alone. maybe the bad parts of me completely outweigh the good parts and people just dont wanna put in the time to talk to me anymore. i dont know. im wondering if i should even put effort into thinking about it or just prepare to go through highschool alone. i know damn well if i didnt text first no one would talk to me. i always check up on people and help them when theyre down but they still come back and tell me im not a good person. maybe i really just am not good by nature no matter how hard i try and fight it. i cant even tell if im a victim of bad luck or my own actions and consequences that im too dumb to understand.

4725,No-King1567,1646435066,1,"Have no one to talk to, so just ranting here. 38M gay guy, recently moved to a new country, leaving behind all my friends and family. Has been really difficult to make friends here, maybe I'm too old for it. Turned to dating apps to find guys to hook up with, have been meeting a lot of them. Even though we get along really well and everything goes fine, they just ghost me after a couple of meets, it really hurts and has been screwing up my confidence. Kind of learnt to live with it and forced myself to not get attached to anyone. 

Until I met this guy, who had also moved here from my country, we had a lot in common and had an amazing first date. We met again a few times and everything went well, until he also started being distance. I had grown very fond of him, and it fell really painful. I forced myself to stop thinking about him and a few weeks later was feeling ok. However he contacted me again and asked to meet, and everything I had pushed down came gushing back up. I did agree to meet, and confronted him about why he was not being responsive all these days. He said he was busy with work and couldn't find time. We did have a wonderful time, dinner, a long walk, and a nice conversation in bed. But again after that he went back to ignoring me, any response he gave me felt forced. I really liked this guy and just can't get him out of my head. I can't understand what is wrong with me, why do people ignore me!

4728,ZestycloseYak1662,1646434861,1,"Since last year, I was well aware that I would separate from my friends after we eventually graduated. All of us have different goals and dreams, so I knew that there was no way I could delay something that was going to happen anyway. And I tried to not feel sad about the fact that all of them were moving to another countries to start the new phase of their life. But I couldn’t help it, I still felt like I was losing the few people outside my family that understood me and that I knew I could trust with all my soul. They were my safe place and the ones who saved me from my lonely life as a teenager. And I had to lose that safe place.

It’s not that we don’t keep contact or anything, we always try to make time in our busy lives to talk to each other, but…It just doesn’t feel like our friendship is still the same. I can’t shake this feeling of being totally alone, and I think my loneliness came back even worse than before I met my friends. 

I’m not the most social person out there, but I tried to talk to my university colleagues and maybe connect with them, but it just doesn’t work. It’s been five months already, and although I know that friendships aren’t always built that fast, I still feel like I will never find any friends here. Sure, I have my family, but it’s not like they understand me completely either. I have no reason to believe that our friendship will remain close, it’s not like I am irreplaceable anyways. I just don’t know what else to do. 

I miss my friends deeply. I miss our studying sessions, our silly and our meaningful conversations, how we would walk home together after class, how we could vent about anything to each other and feel secure because you wouldn’t be judged…everything we used to do. I miss each and every single one of them.

4763,Skipverse,1646419681,1," 

In 2016 I started collage at 17 (UK) and was relatively alone for about a year till I became friends with a group of people in the second year of our course that I'm still close with now, they're technically my only friends as I never got along with anyone in school. I hung out with them for a bit in the first but had a small falling out that we all realised was stupid and got along again. Towards the end of 2018, we left for uni. But while I went to one uni, they all went to the same one elsewhere and got a shared house together. I was initially upset about it as I didn't want to drift apart from what felt like genuine friends which thankfully we didn't, to help myself feel better, I'd remind myself I'd make friends in uni so I thought it'll be fine.

I did get along with some guys in my uni course, we went out every now and then to the same club each time or in one of their flats for a few drinks but never did anything much more than that. But by the time the second year came around, they got a shared flat together and after a few months, just stopped talking to me, stop inviting me over/out and kicked me out of the group chat and I still don't know why. So for the most part of uni, I just spent my time in my room while they were all hanging out daily.

Throughout this time, I'd still be talking to the guys from collage on Discord, we'd go on to play games and such every now and then. But every time we do, I'd always hear about all the stuff they get up to and it started to really get to me. They were taking a gap year in 2020 so we made loads of plans to do stuff as they were coming home near me, then covid happened lmao.

They're currently doing their final year, while I'm now living with parents working in a shitty factory making and packing fire alarms.

I'm so fucking angry at myself for not going to the same uni as them plus I seriously regret the course I pick and wished I done something else so that doesn't help either.

“Go out and meet people"": yea covid... Can't do much about it

“It will get better soon"": Really? Do you have any proof? Because I have been waiting for a year and nothing changed

“Work harder the next semester"": I studied until I got 3 hours of sleep a day and still am barely scrapping by...

“Maybe you chose the wrong study"": Glad to hear my decision for the next 3 years will be wrong, even though it was the perfect course of study for me

“People have their strengths and weaknesses, maybe you just aren't good in (insert topic:__)"": That's true, I agree but I used to be good at it and now not anymore because my brain is a fuzz and everyday is a misery

“Go and hookup with people"": I cannot bring myself to do it, I do have people in mind and people happy to do it but I don't feel comfortable and it doesn't feel correct

“Your partner will come in the future"": Yea 1 year? 10 years? 20? How much longer?

“I am here, you can talk to me"": Yea and you take 2 weeks to respond to my text, how do you think that makes me feel?

“Get closer with your current friends"": You mean the narcissistic, delusional and toxic friends? Idk if that's a good idea

“Man up"": Thanks buddy, next thing you are gonna tell me is to drink 8 cups of water a day...

“Keep going king, you will get there"": Yes although it's nice to hear, it doesn't really do much to me in the long run

“Find a new hobby"": My hobby involves books or soccer which none of my friends do, I already lost interest in everything

Those are the most common and frequent topics I run into and everytime I ask for help I get the same answer. I feel like I'm trapped and can't find a way to make myself happy.

I feel guilty for saying this but everytime I meet someone new I almost resent them because I can't find someone like me. Not that I'm special or anyting, but nobody I know really tries to undersand me or create a deeper connection with me. I know that I should feel fortunate just because I have at least someone who I can interact with, but everytime I play with them, talk to them or even be near them I just feel empty, like if I were talking to bots and not people. I'm certainly asking too much of them, I know people got their shit to deal with and I don't think they'll just stop for me just to help me fell more ""appreciated"". So I tried dating to maybe find someone that can at least try to love me more than my friend could. Eventually I found someone who was crazy enough to actually like a neurotic and sometime cynical person like me. I finally found someone who tried to understand me and even if she was a bit problematic herself we were getting along very well (maybe too well). This girl became almost an obsession, every time she called me or texed me I felt a type of euphoria that I would have never thought I would feel, I even started dreaming about her (something I still do unfortunately). One of the reason for my incontrollable infatuation was the fact that I struggled with depression and anxiety in the past which lead me to seclud myself from everyone, this means my experience with her was unprecedented. But here's the catch: she was too overloaded with work and college so she told me that with her current life problems she can't really have a steady relationship. This lead to a fairly cold friendzone that ended with almost complete silence.
Right now I feel lonelier than ever, I have no motivation to do anyting, I usually stay in bed eating McDonald's (probably the saddest thing I've done in my life).
Ever felt this feeling of pure nothingness mixed with self-contempt? Well, know I do.
If it wasn't for my cat I'd probably go crazy, at the moment she is the only thing I care about.

If u connect with someone for a relationship.. loneliness will vanish as long as you both are in love. But one argument or difference of opinion will cause cracks in the fragile relationship causing either of you to become lonely again, but this time it will feel untolerable after the dependency you develop on a person.

Just hope I die soon because I’m kinda done, I have no motivation for shit lol. Hopefully a war does start so I can get drafted or some shit. Idk just wish I could be normal for once in my life but I’ll never relate to most people. I’m an unloveable ugly dude and I’ll never want or have aspirations",lonely,Is pushing through even worth it?,2022-03-04 21:42:55
4801,dazed_aaand_confused,1646389458,1,"Yesterday I read a couple of posts on this subreddit. It's worrisome but also a little bit encouraging (in a bad way I guess) to know that I'm not alone in this struggle. For two years I have soldiered through this lonesome corona pandemic journey but I have finally also gotten to the point of despair! Over the past two years, a lot has happened in my life that should probably create some sort of joy but it does not excite me any longer because I have nobody to share it with. I'm a 38 year old male, above average looking, empathetic, caring, heaps of interests and hobbies, but probably come over as a little bit naive. Perhaps this is why I'm still alone because people usually drag me along as a plan B and ultimately ghost me when they've found their plan A. I have seen the worst in me getting activated where I have gone from a kind, loving and talkative person, to a stand-off-ish, skeptical, and anxiety-ridden ball of mess in social interactions, well the few social interactions that I do have had over the past two years. Hence, I have not found love in my adult life, well once in my late 20's sort of but it didn't work out and she is now married, we still text every now and then but it's ultimately just a sad reminder of what I had lost. During the past two years, I have moved countries in the middle of the pandemic e.g. from South Africa to the Netherlands, excited for my new life and to get back into a new dating pool but almost two years later, I have not had a single date and perhaps not even five matches which rapidly either went radio silent or concluded in a non-match (from their end) due to me not wanting to have children. I have tried so many ways to sell myself, but I have not had any success at all. During this corona pandemic my friends and family drained my cup completely with requests for financial and emotional support, masking the latter as ""we're worried about you"" but in the end it was themselves they were worried about, needed help and as soon as they were ok, they left me for dead. I have two sisters and a mother, my father passed away when I was very young and his part of the extended family rejected us completely at that point, and my mom's side is a bunch of drunkards and gamblers, hence I have literally only three people I call family. My mother is always ""too busy"" to talk when I'm not working but calls me during office hours and expect me to always pick up and make time for her right there and then, when I don't she plays emotional games to alter my behavior. BTW, she is retired and have the world's time available. My little sister also struggles with the same challenges as I do because she is also an expat in another country. This is perhaps one of the very few (sort-of) healthy relationships I have right now but it's not a relationship I can rely on due to her work situation e.g. works 7 days a week and always on call for some important people in the middle east, basically modern-day paid slavery, hahaha. My middle sister is always ""too busy"" and I have not spoken to her for over three months and even then it was merely the socially acceptable Merry Christmas conversation, nothing of real value for where I find myself right now. Also, during this corona pandemic one of my prior love interests back in my home country rekindled the flame online. This was a significant meeting in my life, one of the two people I have ever met where I knew from the very first moment we saw each other that this is one of those significant life-changing moments. The situation rapidly developed to a point where I offered her to visit me for the maximum stay time on a tourist visa, let's see how it goes and take it from there, no cost to her and her life effectively could go on undisturbed due to the work from home situation. She drained my cup to rebuild her self-esteem after her divorce and the backtracking this has ensued in her life, she then finalized some long-standing issues in her own life, and just moved on to a new relationship. A couple of months later after this development, I left her a happy birthday message on Facebook, she contacted me again shortly thereafter informing that her previous relationship didn't work out and we went around the block two more times e.g. what could be, and then I offer yet again, and to this day still waiting for an answer on my last offer. In the meantime, over the past two years I have been swiping away on Facebook Dating, Tinder, Happn, Inner Circle and Bumble. I have tried super complete profiles, incomplete profiles, direct narrative, mysterious narrative, lots of photos, few photos, writing my profile in English or Dutch or both, yet I have had no luck in all my efforts. I live in a city with lots of singles (well, according to the dating apps) but yet I'm so lonely and not being able to even engage in a single encounter. My friends in the Netherlands (mostly fellow South Africans) all have families, so I'm waaaaay down on their priority list to the point where I am doubting all of my decisions the past two years, these were the same people that said yeah man pull the trigger, your life will be so much better, we'll help you out with a soft landing, and it would be great to have more of our own culture's people to interact with. So far I have done 99% of everything myself, even the stuff that requires more than one person e.g. moving stuff one centimeter at a time. Even the people I confessed to about my loneliness and anxiety situation rarely answer my calls, they leave messages either completely unanswered or at best answer them half a day or later. I realize to them it's just a 10 second ""do or do not"" and they turn back to their family and go on with life, but to me it's another hour of solitary existence where I just desperately need to talk to anybody because the most intense conversation I have had was with Google Assistant! I have bought a house, invited many people to show them my house and to join for a barbecue, but everybody always have some of sort of other thing to do. The one time I invited friends of mine almost two weeks ahead of time to make sure that we arrange well in advance, I was flexible on day and time, and even weekend, but yet they declined. A couple of days later I received an invitation to visit them instead. So why not my house then? This is not a singular occurrence, people constantly wedge me into where they feel like, at their convenience and always at my ultimate cost. Over the past two years,  I got the feeling that because I'm single, people take my time and effort for granted because I'm single and ""always available"" yet nobody ever does the same for me. I'm so fed up with people, supposed friends and family that should care for me. It's the same people who share these goody-two-shoe posts on Facebook about looking out for your fellow human, well here I am! This is me struggling! This is your opportunity to lend a helping hand! People often tell me to just go take a trip, take a vitamin, focus on my home projects etc. For what? For who? It does not matter if I paint that wall right now or in three years time. Nobody else will see it, and I honestly am at the point that I really don't care about something as menial as an unpainted wall. I don't need a vitamin! I don't need to take a trip alone! I need a friend! I need someone who I can rely on! I need someone who I can share the good things of my life with. Honestly, this post may sketch me as a negative person, I really am not but after going through this experience alone for two years with all the subtle abuse of my goodness, it's really hard to ignore the not-so-great things about being human right now. I sincerely hope that somewhere close by there is someone I have not yet met that also has this massive desire for friendship and love. Someone who is committed to building something beautiful!",lonely,"Lonely, out of gas and tired of this solitary journey",2022-03-04 21:24:18

Last year was my first year of uni which was spent in lockdown so I made a total of zero friends. This year however everything in Australia is open. So two days ago our uni had this orientation day where we got to meet people and join clubs. I really put in a lot of effort on this day, I approached random people and started talking to them which bare in mind is very unlike me. I talked to at least 10 people, The next day I messaged a few of them on Instagram and none of them have replied. Now I did give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they’re busy or what not but that’s hard to believe over a span of 2 days. This has really taken a toll on my self confidence, it took me a lot of courage to do what I did only for it go this way.

4834,glass1algae,1646371903,1,"My closest friend who is also my FWB is studying abroad and has been gone since January. Not a long time but god I miss him so much. I just don't click with anybody else like I do with him and nobody has ever made an effort to make me feel like I'm worthy of love and attention like he does. It hurts when he's away because I genuinely love him, whether that's platonic or whatever it is. Love isn't just one thing.

I'm feeling so down bad though because one of the things I notice most about him is the way he smells, which is SO WEIRD to say but he knows; and it isn't really like this for me with anyone else, it's just him; he just smells very nice and it's hard not to notice it being around him. I noticed it literally the first night we met/hooked up, I just thought it was a cologne or something at first. But it's just him. And I literally told him that I miss his smell lmfao. I know he won't think it's weird because he knows what I mean but god do I still feel odd.

I just miss cuddling with him so bad, more than I miss sexuality. I find myself daydreaming about just laying down with him, popping on youtube, and cuddling. He's the only person I've ever truly enjoyed watching things with, and I just want the simple connection so badly. 

I'm trying so hard to move into my own place before he comes back so that we can be in a private place again. He lives with his parents when not in school and I temporarily moved in with a sibling recently because of a really shitty scenario. But I so badly wish that I was just done with the messy stuff already. There's so much, I'm so anxious, I have stuff going on, I need a car, I need a place, I need medicine, I need money, I need a therapist— so many more things and it's just too much.

I feel like at 20, I've already been beaten down so hard, treated like shit, gaslit, manipulated, lied to, discriminated against, traumatized. It just feels like shit when I talk about my really bad issues, whether they be mental or physical, and people tell me that it'll only get worse.

Another thing is that I pretty much have chronic back pain; I had a spinal transfusion in 2016 to correct scoliosis but I feel as if my back will never be the same. Standing or sitting in the same position for more than 5 minutes can hurt like hell. Sometimes I sit up in bed for the first time in the day and my back hurts so badly that I just want to forget trying. I need to work and I need money but even a measly 6-hour shift today ended with my neck aching and my back the same. I often describe the pain to people by saying that it feels like somebody heated a knife up to 300 degrees before plunging it through the middle of my spine. And I say offhandedly that I'm hurting or need medicine and others (who are often 5 or less years older than me) like to say that it will only get worse. It's just... disheartening.

I'm lonely and sad and hurting, and I want my friend back. He treats me like me. He doesn't treat me like glass but he pays attention to what I need and I try to do the same in return. 

I just want it to be June, but I worry that my future won't be what I want. I sent in a hopeful application to the best possible apartment for my situation literally today and I'm so worried that the wait list is too long or that they'll just deny me.

I have no one to talk to or tell my problems to for the past 4 years. Everyone said you should learn to enjoy your own company.

Well guess what ? I've been in my company for 4 years and I'm kind of getting sick of it.

No one responds to my texts, no one calls me anywhere. Sometimes I'd waleWalwake up hoping at least someone would text me first just for once.

I always tell myself ""don't message.. If they want you, they'll message you..""

And I just sit there, staring at my phone, waiting for the notifications that never appear, to appear.

And then I get so down, wanting to talk to people but yet knowing they don't want to talk to me. So I end up having to message them, just so I'm not torturing myself waiting for something.

That's not what I want. A true friend cares about you whether you're fine or not.

Everyone was having a good time, taking pics and stuff, and I was just uh there. No one approached me for a picture and I kinda feel shitty about it. I can't really blame them either, I'm not overtly social and I stick to myself. I don't have any other social media apart from reddit and most people in my grade don't use reddit. Guess everyone else could make friends and connect during these two years and I couldn't. 

Another thing that especially bums me out is that this girl I really like, and with whom I got along with fairly well, wasn't inclined to take a pic with me too. I had asked her out a couple of months before, and she declined, but was super nice about it and still was friendly with me. On the final day we went to the lab together because our slides didn't come out properly and we had a good conversation. Still, she didn't ask me for a pic, and I'm too shy to ask her for one. She took a pic with all her other friends, and all she did was wave bye when I was walking towards the door. Guess she never thought of me as more than an acquaintance. Still feel really shitty though,I don't even have her number and the only time I'll see her again is during my exams. As much as I really want to, I just can't go up to her and ask her for her number or if we could keep in touch. It just feels weird, and I don't think she's too keen on being friends either.

I'm just feeling so bad about all the lost opportunities, and I just can't stop thinking about that girl; what I could have said or done or what could have happened if she said yes. This won't matter in a year or so, but right now it's fucking me up and I just can't focus on my academics. I keep thinking about her and about what could have happened between us. I still harbour this hope that she'll maybe initiate during our exams but I don't think it's realistically possible. I've spoken to a couple of friends about this and their advice has been ""don't think about her"", but I just can't do it. 

Just typing whatever is on my mind, in hopes that getting it out would help me handle it better. I hope you guys can help me out here; maybe suggest ways to stop thinking about her. I really need to do well in my final exams or else I'd have to go back to my third world shithole of a country.

I don't make friends easily. I forced myself to make a Meetup group so I could play DnD with actual people rather than play video games. I've made some good friends but have lost even more. Since I started the group, I'd guess I keep in regular contact with about 3 or 4 people. But now we're going to move and all my friends are here at home. I won't know anyone or have any family close by in our new city. I work from home and only go in the office every few weeks, so there is no relationship with coworkers.
My family is panicking since I'm the youngest, and this is my first child. My mom is trying to buy me furniture, and my sister wants to throw a big baby shower. The problem is that we still don't know where we're going to live, and most of the apartments are the same size we're living in now (we don't have a lot of space). After I told my mom and sister I didn't want furniture or a shower, they've stopped talking to me.
My husband works really hard. It's to the point where we could be eating dinner together, and his mind is clearly elsewhere. We'll be trying to watch a movie or play a game together, and he'll be on Reddit or actively working on his laptop. This has been an ongoing issue that we've talked about so many times that I just feel like it's useless to try anymore. Intimacy is getting difficult because I'm getting a lot bigger. 
It honestly feels like as we get closer to baby's due date and moving, the stress and the loneliness are getting worse. It honestly feels like there's a giant gaping hole that's growing larger and larger, separating me from everyone. I can put myself out there to my friends, but I'll feel like a burden to them.

I can't change anyone. I can't make them want to spend time with me. I just feel isolated from everything. Feeling the baby kick or move doesn't make me feel good. It honestly scares the shit out of me. I'm scared that even she won't want to spend time with me when she comes into the world.

I’ve been feeling like shit for the past 6 months. I used to have friends but now I feel so lonely because we barely talk anymore and I just feel like they don’t really care about me. I ruined my friendships because I have such low self esteem that I convinced myself they didn’t like me so I just isolated myself and now I’m worse than ever. I don’t know what to do now because I feel like everyone has someone to talk to and I just don’t. I’ve tried to ignore it and tell myself that everything is gonna be okay but the negative thoughts invade my mind. I just wish I could shut my brain off and stop feeling sad. I feel so awful that I can’t stop crying, even at school. Sometimes I cry up to 8 times a day. 

Whenever I feel calm and tell myself everything is gonna be okay it literally just lasts for a few minutes and then I go back to crying anymore. I have no hopes for this year anymore. I feel like no one wants me. I convinced myself that my presence doesn’t affect people’s lives and they don’t want me. I’ve had 3 months of summer holidays and only 1 friend contacted me, but no one else really cared to know about me.

I’m so deep down in negativity that I’ve literally been considering doing drugs to ignore the bad feelings, I’m at the verge of doing it but at the same time I know it’s just gonna make everything worse because I would be adding an addiction to my personal problems. I hate the fact that when I’m down I engage into self destructive behavior. Yesterday I literally threw up twice because of all the alcohol I had drank, I couldn’t even stand up. 

Also I feel like the reason why I haven’t committed suicide yet are my family, my boyfriend and my hopes for the future. My family would be destroyed and my boyfriend too, he’s the only one who truly cares about me but unfortunately he’s long distance. However something I’m grateful for is the fact that at least I still have some hopes for the future when I get out of school (I’m in my last year of high school).

Ever since I was kid i got to watch my alcoholic and abusive father, I've been taught to not depend on anyone, I've been bullied since I was 6. I watched my mother mentally break down and I've been sexually abused by my female cousin. Life got a bit better when my mother left my ""father"" and married my step-father. But as life went on, some thing didn't really change. I had to fight a lot because of bullying. My new family taught me to eat a lot + it made me feel better so i slowly got fatter which caused more bullying. Then new sibling came and as i grew older(around 12) I've been forced to take care of them so that my parents could work. This went on for so many years. It stopped pretty much recently around year and a half i think. This lifestyle made me asocial and after some time I've just given up on socializing, finding gf and other teenager stuff. I've been practically growing up with videogames so in one way it wast as bad when I still wasn't that mature. As time went on I've started to be really closed up and paranoid when it came to interacting with new people. I secretly started smoking which I don't regret. Anyway as i grew older and more mature i wanted to live differently. But my stepdad has really old school view at life so he basically chained me up making me unable to do anything( sleepover at my friend's house, most of the time i couldn't even go outside to hang out with him, when I got close with a girl he didn't care, still wouldn't let me goo meet her because I was needed and I'm ungrateful). Anyway it was fun when I had to listen to his nagging about me needing to socialize more, find a girl etc.
At some point I totally gave up,  even now I still don't feel most of stuff others can feel (i dont feel sad about death, some horrible accidents and stuff), even now I'm not sure who am I and what should I do with life. I was stupid kid who wanted his parents to be proud of him, as a result I've been studying at school that i hate And is killing me even more, for 4 years. Now whenever I get close with someone i just fuck it up. I've never felt love and whenever I feel happiness it just gets absolutely ruined and i get hurt, just because I expected something, change, development etc. Doesn't matter i keep finding new ways to get hurt. At this point I don't really care what happens to me, I'm bored of living, I'm bored of being lonely and I'm bored of trying just to get hurt. For the last months I have sort of existencial crysis, thinking about suicide, because maybe there's something better than this after death, who knows. But I still hope that things will get better and it's killing me inside even more. I feel more and more emotionless as days go by.

4943,87Dji,1646314890,1,"Hi, to anybody reading that. I always hated people venting but somehow i'm here now. I'm ~20, and i feel like it's already too late. When i was younger, i was popular, i had a lot of friends, invited in parties, with a loving family. I was also pretty sad and selling drugs (the only reason why i used this flair), but somehow i felt much better those days.

Slowly, people moved on. They had studies, jobs, then a wife/husband, a driver licence, a place to live. I dropped out quickly because i was selling (never really used drugs tho), legally i only had little jobs, like retail, or lifting coffins and burrying people. I had and still have my gf, i'd say she still loves me but she doesn't have any respect or admiration for me left. Struggling as hell for my driver licence, don't know why, i don't consider myself dumb or unable to drive.

Now, i'm not in my hometown, and so, i see my old friends like once a year. We changed so much and we can't relate to each other anymore and it's hurting. I have friends online, i see them once a year too, but like, it's still weird i'd say. I'm not from online, if that makes sense.

So i'm here, without a purpose and without meds, my gf thinks i'm a dead weight she's carrying (who knows why she stays), i'm embarassed by myself, ashamed of what i became and how much i stopped progressing.

I strongly believe in afterlife, i don't really know why i did not abandoned, but it's probably because of art, i love creating things. So that's the positive note here, try to create, for some reason it's helping.

Lately i've been struggling with really bad ideas, i mean morally good ideas, like tracking down and shanking a maximum of child abusers before going to jail or shit like that. It feels like good actions you can't normally do, but you can in that specific situation where you don't have that much to lose but somehow you're still alive.

I feel abandonned and isolated, i don't know what to do about it, i'm too old to make new friends, too alone to leave my gf, and too ashamed to talk with my family. Feel like i was in a good run and something made me become that very bad version, like, 40yo male looking back and saying ""yeah, i wasted all this time"", except i'm 23.",lonely,"I'm lost, and i don't have anything left",2022-03-04 00:41:30

One reason might be because then I get more attention than I can handle. When asked something either I go completely blank or say some awful/unfunny shit ,because I think too much on what's perfect to say which might not spoil my personality, which spoils everyone's mood.

 Next, they don't invite me anywhere nor care to think of me. Then I try hard to be a member of their group and they still don't care. While in this stage, I overthink every thing like ""Should I call one of them. No, no, no today is my birthday, he might think I am alone on my birthday."" While overthinking I think what's causing this? Like why would they care for xyz and not me. Why do they give him attention every time while I just sit there?

Then when I accept my fate of hanging out alone, they start giving me some attention little by little to the point where I think finally my life is sorted. The cycle repeats.

I want to focus on one problem I have i.e. I seek validation from others .I think if they form a negative image of me, it's the end of the world .They'll tell everyone and no one would be my friend and no girl would ever find me attractive.

If we were all in the same room I feel like this would be a piece of cake. We all feel lonely and can all talk to each other but also actually have real physical contact like hugs. We can actually see, feel and touch each other.   


We all have something really serious in common. Why aren't we trying to find each other in real life and fix two people's problems things with one stone? Everyone here from young to old has someone that is going through a similar type of loneliness. It just feels like this would be so simple if we weren't separated by screens and huge distances.   


What I think we should do is arrange meetings for people in certain areas. If you are in New York, pick a place and invite others from the area to a coffee place. Meetup, chat, and maybe find what you're looking for in someone who understands what you're going through. No social games, just being honest.  


Ok, I know this is unrealistic for a lot of people but when I look at all the posts here it feels like doctors who are sad because they need another doctor to fix their injury. Everyone here IS the solution to loneliness, yet we all still feel so lonely.

4990,its-imminent,1646290263,1,"I don’t know how something like this can creep up on me, but it did. Every now and then, I’m faced with little reminders of how lonely I am, but today it hit me like a train.

I work in a small office and deal with people regularly as part of my work. My boss has known me my entire life. One of our clients asked how old I was in conversation today, and of course I had to answer. When I said “32,” I immediately lost track of my thoughts and was faced with the realization that I’m truly lonely.

I used to have goals and ideas of how I would measure success before I reached 30, let alone 32. I’ve accomplished some of those goals… notably in my career. I’m well short of where I want to be with my personal life, whether that be with my interpersonal relationships or personal development.

I used to think of myself as a friendly and carefree individual. Nowadays, I don’t recognize myself as that kind of person. I’m more repressed, anxious, and unsure of myself in social settings. When I was in school, a lot of people would say that they were experiencing impostor syndrome. At the time, I thought they were being melodramatic. Now that I’ve experienced that, or something like it, I understand.

I have friends. We don’t see each other much anymore because we’re all professionals with pretty stringent demands from our work, and most of them are developing family lives with significant others and some even have children.

As with many of us here, I’m sure, COVID just made things worse with the decline of my social skills. I’m not a total shut-in, but the entirety of my interactions with other people have been limited to small talk in the office or over the phone for like the last year or two. The one exception to this was a trip I took recently with some friends from my grad school says. It was so nice interacting with people, even though I often felt confused or out of place in some moments. Still, I powered through and can say that I’m glad I did.

As nice as that was, reflecting on it now just makes me consider just how lonely I’ve been, and how I’ve been powering through that loneliness for probably too long.

I guess ultimately I’m posting this in search of two things:

1) Advice. I know I can’t be the only one who is coming to terms with loneliness. How do you combat it? Do you put yourself out there more to compensate for the loneliness? Have you found a particular social setting that is more conducive to your getting back into being a social person? How do you deal with impostor syndrome if you do have to deal with it?

2) A friend. The conversations with my friends are becoming less and less substantive, at least for me, as time has gone on. Our conversations have gone from long talks about our ideas, dreams, goals, and fears and devolved into rather shallow talk about current events and every now and then the odd life event update. It would be nice if I could practice having conversations that go a little deeper than that. Full disclosure: I actually really need practice. It takes me some time to ease into opening up. Once I do, I tend not to shut up (as you can see from this post) and I’d jump at the chance to sort of calibrate to as close to normal as I can.

Anyway, I hope some of my fellow lonely people can offer some advice or want to become a little less lonely by talking to me.

Not to go or hint at anything serious or to the point of selfharm(something I want to make clear because ive always struggled getting my points out clearly and unfortunately even when speaking my mind, ive found that there's no room for mistake doing or expressing these kinds of things) but I am really tired of how lonely it is just being myself. I dont know how to even begin expressing this because I feel like waste even thinking this way considering I have a terrifically great upbringing, great friends and everything, and I feel so guilty because the world is much more burdened by more important things and all I bring to the table is the pissed off attitude of some well-off angsty teen living in a first world country. Its fucking pathetic really. But eitherway its been really hard to get my own thoughts across mainly because I have no one I really trust to get my thoughts across to and I recognize that leaving them to ruminate in my head leades to either insensitive garbage or some kind of unrealistic prospect of an ideal future(ill try and elaborate later). I really do try my best to maintain a kind of selfish peace for myself, as in doing what I can to maintain whatever friendships I have and trying to become a likeable person because without my daily fix of at least a suggestion of a compliment I am an unbearable mess. If I dont feel validated constantly I feel terrible and its a seriously awful cycle. I dont pressure others into giving me validation but I seriously do try my best to be as likeable a spossible and it feels like all I can manage to do is gather some great people together but never really establish anysort of relationship where I can lean on another shoulders in exchange for their leaning on mines. I seriously yearn for this kid of interaction one day but putting that aside, all this work amounts to what feels like a crumbling empire. Some friends amongst each other may get into arguments which is normal, and deviate away into a life they, I assume would prefer and I can recognize that if that is what those 2 individuals think is best, it is what it is. But despite being so seemingly disattatched from them I feel like I cling to them selfishly in the moment like a child does to divorcing parents and I cant help but feel like ive messed something up yet again. That reminds me, not only amd i trying to pickup and replace these falling peices of my relationships but this constant state of preserving a sense of normality is quite easily broken by small mishaps, though, in my case, almost everything I do becomes a mishap one way or another and comes back to haunt me because I overcomplicate things or who knows what. I look back on my previous actions and sometimes wonder how fucking stupid I  must have been to thought or acted a specific way even though im always doing my best to think and act in the most mature and comprehensive way at any moment given. Im so awfull. I had so much more to write but its like 12;28 in the morning and im so god damn tired and I didnt even get to the part where I feel so lost and empty and I just wanna cry out for help and how mental health services feel like catching onto a twig while plunging into a canyon and im probably going to forget about this tommorow morning or delte it in embarassment. I guess I just needed to get what I was thinking into text because it helps me think better idk. Its definetely better than letting it rot in my brain. Im so tired and I really fucked up everything and I have no one to go to but just to reiterate I am fine enough. The last time i sort of opened up exagerration and getting caught in th emoment got to the best of me in the worst way possible and I do not wish to live through that again.

I feel like nobody loves me ; I just wish somebody would love me. School sucks because instead of having 2 classrooms that taught everything, i have 9 different teachers who forget other classes exist. They give us so much work and it sucks because if grades suck, then teachers get mad, Parents get mad, and even i get mad at myself. I feel like i should be ashamed fir not being able to juggle it all. Also i think parents forget that kids are human. It feels like they abuse there power.

I ended up spending the whole day crying. When my mom got out of work, she made herself something to eat and sat in front of the tv. Didn’t say a word to me. No cake, no cards or anything.

I've only left my house like 3 times in the last 2 years

I don't speak to family &amp; i distance myself from everybody because people don't try beyond minimum effort or they flat-out ignore me which makes hostile so i'd rather be alone

I don't enjoy any aspect of life unless i'm high but i don't work so i'm never high anymore, movies/games/other hobbies just aren't enjoyable

I attract the worst types of females &amp; have a pretty shit relationship history in general, i'm unpopular &amp; i assume i'm ugly by todays standards so no one's really been interested the last few years to be honest

Unless a miracle happens i'm destined to spend the rest of my life in this bedroom, with no consistent support, minimal if any friends with no chance at love, weirdly enough i'm fine with all this

Where it starts to bother me is how consistent the bad shit happened over time from my teens &amp; how inconsistent people are at basic respect, jumped from one cheating ex to another year after year till i gave up dating, i wished a ""friend"" a happy birthday but when mine swung around a month later nothing, i quit a job at 16 &amp; my family went psycho at me for it yet my brother usurped a manager position at my old job &amp; got me fired &amp; nobody batted an eye

It almost seems like if there is a higher power or god then they truly fucking despise me &amp; want nothing but misery for me as i've never been treated equally

I also wish i hadn't been as nice/supportive to people in the past because they never pulled through for me, as i did for them, &amp; my bizarre circumstances far outweighs theirs

it was 2 years of pure bliss, when i think of them days my mind goes back to memories of waking up on summer days while lying in bed next to her, still sleeping, the sun would shine through the curtain on to her skin, i would think to myself i’m so grateful for everything i have, 
she was like light, sometimes she shined so brightly i had to look away, she was beautiful.

And then the fire happened and she died, that was it, the end.

I went from having hopes of growing old with my soul mate, many friends and family close by to now living alone without a single friend (this ones probably my fault because i secluded myself from people after she died)
My family lives in another country too (i’m working abroad which makes this so much harder because any childhood friends i did have aren’t here)

I’m grateful for my health, wellbeing and life will get better Inshaa’Allah(God willing).

At the beginning, I made a point of not showing any interest; I have no friends or a job, and I feel very self-conscious about my situation at the moment. In addition to my complicated predicament, I thought it was all in my head. He's tall and muscular and couldn't be attracted to li'l ol' me -- it would be too good to be true. My whole body tingles when he walks past me. About two weeks ago, I saw him as I walked home. He was walking in my direction and we locked eyes for a few seconds until I looked away and opened the door to my house in a bit of a haste. Whenever he sees me, his eyes fix on me and he looks stupefied, which makes me, someone who grew up by neglectful parents and never had a relationship, very nervous; I don't even know how to react to that. After this incident, though, I just couldn't stop -- still can't stop -- thinking about him. The attraction I'd been suppressing finally emerged to the surface. I didn't even know his name, and I'm not sure he knows mine. After asking around and making a few online searches, I found him on social media. He has a partner and a little son. I was shocked. Maybe *it was* all in my head after all. I've never spoken to this guy, because I've avoided him and we don't have mutual connections. Before this revelation, I contemplated trying to find an excuse to make small talk with him. Now I'm just sad. I've barely been able to eat.

5047,SnooAvocados7966,1646257063,1,"I am lonely. 

I've never been more lonely in my entire life. 

And it's all my fault. 

In middle school, I destroyed my friendships with everyone I knew. The summer before high school, I didn't talk to anyone for two months, or I should say, *no one talked to me for two months.* I tried texting them, they wouldn't respond. I'm not surprised because I was not a fun person to be around. 

Freshman year of high school, I met some people in my class and I met some people on Discord. It was good. I started being happy that I have someone to talk to again. 

Sophomore year when Covid hit, I was actually thriving at first, then I destroyed everything. I switched classes, met new people, started liking new people, made a mistake and now everyone from that class hates me. People from my previous classes stopped talking to me because they got closer to each other. My online friend group broke up. 

Junior year (the present). In the begging, I still had 4 online friends and one friend from school. 

The first online friend had their own shit going on, so we stopped talking.

The second one was my ex-girlfriend and our relationship ended badly because of me. I just caused her pain, so we stopped talking. 

I still talk to the third one, but I'm always the one texting first. Always the one venting out of nowhere. Always the one sending too many links. They eventually stopped clicking them. I can feel the another friendship ending, I know how that looks too well. 

The friend from school? We see each other every day, so we naturally talk, but I don't feel like they trust me fully. I don't think it's going to change. I am not the most important person in their life. They have many other friends. 

I have no one who actually cares about me, beside a problematic family, who doesn't know me at all. I am unable to keep a friendship for longer than a year. I am unapproachable, I don't make an effort to make people interested in me.

I feel like everything is moving to fast, I was doing so well in school and enjoying it, and I still do. Why the hell do I just want to talk to someone who knows how fast and scary life is? Its not a lot of work, but it still feels like so much. I just want to talk to someone who understands how lonely I am, how tempting suicide looks at points. I'm told I'm smart but I just don't see it, and people don't explain. I don't know what I'm saying, I think I just really want to talk to someone. I have depression, I should understand it well, I don't know why it just waits for the time I least expect it to stick another knife in me. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about the things I want to, and every time I've tried they either don't understand, nod along, focus on the wrong points despite correction, or don't care. When my parents found out, they still didn't seem to understand. My old school's psychologist kept missing the point of what I was saying regardless of how I said it. I tried again with the psychologist my parents got me, despite her being able to diagnose me why couldn't the professional get what I was saying? My first therapist no help. Second one was better but STILL COULDN'T GET IT. even my parents knew this wasn't helping, each time I would meet with a mental health professional I would breakdown and wouldn't get any help, leaving in a worse state than I came in. It was a pretty fucking clear message that these people won't understand or help. When people say you need to be sad to be happy, does that mean you spend just as much time sad as happy!?!?!? What the fuck kind of sick joke is that!?!? People also make and maintain friends so easily, I can only maintain and make friends in a school setting. How do people just do that, how do they know all this? How the hell do people keep up with all this schoolwork? People say I ""carry the group"" and am ""smart"" but never explain, making this information useless! I know I fucking know, I have to get out of this myself, no one can help me but myself, seek help, your not alone.

It often feels like I simply can’t be loved. And I don’t know what is wrong with me. Ever since I was a kid I didn’t have many friends. Or even just friends. I first made friends with a new girl in school who was bullied when I was 11. And I even consider myself extroverted, I easily start conversations with new people but by the end of the day I have no one to text and to tell that I’m feeling sad. When I tried to tell my parents that I feel depressed they would laugh at me and tell me that I can’t have any problems. My stepdad told me I don’t deserve unconditional love. My mom would always tell me that I waste their money and that I can’t achieve anything in life. I am studying in the university and in fact struggle with getting a job. I have a partner who is way older than me. He has an ex wife and two grown up sons. And he wouldn’t stop talking about his ex even after I asked him. He talks about her in such way which makes me feel like I can never be loved that much. 
Now I am away from my home-country for half a year, I’m feeling lonely in general but it all got worse when my mom called me today and our conversation ended with her saying that I’m a burden to my family. And here I am wishing I never existed and feeling completely broken. I have no one to tell how much it hurts and that’s why I decided to make this post.

5072,DemonSlayerV7,1646245344,1,"I aways had problems in socializing, most of my life until now (20y btw) I was at home just watching random videos, movies, anime and series and playing video games.


During my life since teenager, I heard a lot of negativity surrounding my country, a lot of racism, especially in high school, everyone said that people here were dishonest snakes, potential criminals, dumb, non educated, not taking anything seriously, unpolite, non civilized and just wanted to party and mess, incompetence is the norm, fucking everything. It was making me sick, tired, disturbed, traumatized, I had brakedowns, MANY TIMES I got out of class and locked into the bathroom when I sensed that they would start to talk about politics. People here have an imense inferiority complex, making dumb stereotypes and memes, aways brute comparing countries, stating that they are much better and that people there were actually decent.

I feel brainwashed and indoctrinated.


I became paranoid, I aways smell this, anticipating the bulshit that will come out outside of their mouths, it makes me not trust people, I cant form bonds with people because I am so sensitive that they can easily be ""marked"" by me, I cant even look into eye contact with them, especially when they talk about this. I even avoid checking content from here, because I am aways afraid of what they might say, I had many episodes where randomly youtubers spilled that bulshit out of nowhere and I never forget it.

Every time when I watch series, I am aways comparing countries, I dont like it but it is an obsession that I have to make sure that everything they say is false.


It also comes A LOT from home, my dad is a sick politics fanatic, all the time he is talking about politics in an echo chamber, hearing audios and opinions of idiots, aways lacking any form of logic or nuance, his comments disturb me, I feel personally attacked, multiple times I start to yell at my dad, scream really hard telling him to stop with this cruelty, I cant even have a reasonable discussion that I get so hurt by this that I become desperate.


Recently, my dad was talking about cultural chocks from other countries and he said that Americans see here as just a garden, a playground, lacking any form of respect. This messed with me, because it created a voice within me that says that the people I see on Internet (mostly Americans) think that, and it makes me surrounded by abusers. I know it isnt right, and I am doing my best to not hear nationalism propaganda, but when everyone around me says this, I uncousciously think they are right.

I also dont like its culture, I hate almost all of its music, I dont fit in, I dont have a national identity, thanfully, I live in a city that is pretty neutral and normal, so it doesnt feel so bad.


I hadnt really spoke about this with anyone, I am very afraid of what people might say.

The funny part is that what they are saying isnt even true, my country definitely isnt bad, everything that they say isnt true, people are moral and ethic, progress runs ranpant, everyone has cars and smartphones, I watch people I did know and on Tinder, everyone seens to have a prosperous life, many of them going to colleges, most of them MUCH BETTER than me.

In response of all this, I created a coping mechanism, I am against nacionalism, I dont believe in nationality, I HATE any traditional value, the idea of culture for me is opressive, I have a very positive look on the world, where progress is inevitable and only increases, and I am totally against on segregating countries, what really matters on average is the age we are, not the place. I have an extremely global view, seeing humanity as one, I am a philosopher, so my rejection of social subjects is very present, and I see current problems as TRIVIAL, they only matter now, not in the future, which complements my historic determinism. I know I am extremely biased, but I do my best to put logic in my ideas.


I suffer from this for 6 years already, in two days, I will also go to college to do psychology, I feel very nervous especially because I am afraid to hear bulshit, to feel betrayed and to find stereotypic people, where no one gives a shit about anything.

I had someone I would talk to almost every day ghost me on some bs time management excuse despite being online to talk with other people they knew. The way it ended makes me contemplate what went wrong and if it was my fault often. 

I would then go on to start anti-depressants in mid-2020 from the loneliness and isolation for a few months and am now heavily considering them again and the thought of it makes me extremely sad. I was in a dark place and contemplated ending it all before starting them.

I retained 1 ""friend"" from high school and I would not consider them such nor someone I could speak to about something on my mind. It was made very clear when I was admitted into a hospital for a month for a health-related procedure and they called me a total amount I could count on one hand. They just recently contacted me after months of silence to tell me they hadn't seen me since then. This really pissed me off considering I always check on this person while they were going through it and I wasn't even good myself. (Basically setting myself on fire to keep them warm.) 

I had a therapist for a while and I stop seeing them just 2 months ago due to them starting their own practice.

They recommended that I find a new one but I decided on using my resources instead of what felt like starting over with a replacement. 

I've reached out a considerable amount of times to others on Reddit looking to make friends only to no reply, being ghosted. From an outside perspective, it would not appear I've done much, but in a way, it feels like I've expelled all options that I'm comfortable with trying. I'm not going to continue to reach out if it's not working because that's not how I work. I had a job back in November of last year where I made a conscious effort to make conversation and it was actually going well but was let go due to literal excuses and miscommunication. I wasn't the only one let go around this time, other people who had been there longer were being terminated as well for no good reason.

5101,twcau,1646226176,1,"41/M from Perth, Australia; battling major depression for two decades, arising from the effects of bullying all the way through school, and a father for whom emotional and physical abuse of my late mother and myself was the norm. It also is looking likely that i’m on the Autism spectrum - which i’m now waiting a diagnosis of.

all of that has made it hard for me to connect with people throughout my entire life. The number of friends I have can be counted on one hand, and I barely have the energy to speak to any of them most of the time. and all of them all live overseas, so there’s no one locally who can pick me up or drag me out of the house to get me out of whatever funk I’m feeling in at the time

The last 2 1/2 years have just been getting worse and worse. It got to the point at the end of last year that I’ve felt the need to seek readmission into a private mental health facility for the second time in my lift, only to find out my treating psychiatrist has totally changed his practice, and forgot to tell me, or refer me on. so stuck in a loop until that can be sorted out, the fun of the country with a somewhat functioning health system that forgot to properly support the needs of those with long term mental health concerns.

So I’ve need to take two weeks off work just to de-stress and unwind at home. That started late last week, and i’ve only just had my first proper shower in six days - and that was only because I had to leave the house to go buy stuff at the shops.

it’s generally tiring just feeling like this, and I’ve been dealing with it for way too long.

I can’t remember the last time I had a date, or even a decent conversation with someone of the opposite sex. The only thing that I really have in my life is work, which in itself is sad enough.

Basically, I was dating someone who I genuinely loved, more than anyone I've ever loved, and they just one day got asked out by their crush. I literally spend a week talking it through with him, and after all that his ""fix"" is to go and travel to see his crush first, before me, basically just abandoning me right there and then, and stringing me along while doing so.

So I decided to leave of my own accord, I unfriended everyone I knew who knew him, left all the discord servers we shared and everything. Like 2 days ago, he tried to follow me on instagram and ""talk things through"", but by then he already started dating his crush, it was like opening a wound while it was atill fresh and just jamming barbed wire into it.

I didn't get out of bed for that entire week pretty much, didn't feel like doing anything, lost all motivation to exist to be honest. Now I'm not sure where to go from here, or what to do, I'm running out of shit to fill my time, I routinely feel lonely at night and keep having dreams about stuff happening, like getting hugged, etc.

Not to mention, I have my family breathing down my neck about job stuff, and not even listening to anything I actually say, and I'm over here with a shitty living situation, crippling depression and social anxiety preventing me from even carrying out basic tasks.

5112,Flippin_Heckles,1646221279,1,"I was going to do this on a throwaway but sod it!

I know I'm not going to be everyone's fine cup of Yorkshire Tea on this dull and cold day, though I would argue it feels even more cold 'cause the lunatics I am currently staying with keep the windows open all day long!

Although I would argue I have been anticipating such feelings for a good while now, I am now at a point in my life where I seem to have little direction or focus. We may be able to refer to it as a sort of sitting at the roundabout of life, of where to go to next after unravelling the decisions of the past five years of my journey. 

I am going to try a more open and honest approach in the hope there is someone out there who can possibly relate to me. I will also do my best not to come off as some sort of miserable git, just someone who is a little lost and alone, but equally still likes to enjoy themselves and value the company of others... Especially those who can tap into whatever madness goes on in my wee head.

You see, I always feel like I am constantly drifting through life, or at least I have drifted long enough to feel I have few real connections to any particular place or person anymore. Today, in spite of my desire to just browse through Reddit and discuss serial killers, I still want to reach out again and feel some new human contact. I have ambitions, yes, but I am absolutely realistic in my expectations here and I am not enforcing on you the obligation to fill some of the voids in my life. 

I mean, I will buy you a nice pack of hobnobs and four cans of Stella if you do but there is absolutely no pressure on you to be the greatest friend I've never had.... *Insert insane amount of pressure!*

Part of my life's decisions has made me feel disconnected through choice, partly through situations out of my control and many embarrassing mistakes I have made on this little journey to oblivion. I am not a particularly shy or introverted person, I enjoy social contact with others but I am caught in this limbo between needing contact and trying hard not to become too enthusiastic and annoying. I like to talk a bit too much and like to share but equally, I'm mature enough to cope with being told to get a grip and shut the heck up for once :)

Whilst the day continues to bring gloomy looking skies, I can still look back fondly on a time where I thought I was actually complete as a person and feel the warmth of that happiness. The life where you had someone who cared for you, a small but strong pool of friends who were there to pick you up and the mental strength to actually go out there and have fun. I have lost a lot of that through the years and I don't even know If I can cope with trying to find it again. Actually, that is kinda nonsense... Who doesn't bloody want that in their life? I know I am a strong person and will always try going on but it gets exhausting as you get into your third decade of life.

It is perhaps important to recognise and discuss the flaws I have if only to show my appreciation towards honesty at the very least. 

Firstly, I can sometimes get a little carried away with my jokes and come off as being a bit of an idiot. Whilst my intentions are purely innocent, I am starting to understand I need to get the feel of another person's personal space before I open my blabbering mouth. If I start getting to know people well and like them, I sometimes like to push towards connecting our lives closer together, whether that be sending the odd postcard or joining you for a pint of sorrows. But I understand we all different and I am starting to be aware there are people who need more time and space to start trusting a wandering little idiot like me.

There are other skeletons in my closet that like to sometimes pop out from nowhere, whether it be trauma of days gone by or the limitations I face now which makes my little battle even more of a fight. I don't need to go into the details, not now or never, but I am open and honest enough to discuss anything with the right person.

Should I just stop being an absolute mope and just talk about the things I actually like?

I have already mentioned postcards somewhere and this is something I really enjoyed during my more innocent days. I do enough wandering, plus I used live between two countries, to find some decent ones to send out to any corner of the world - I also have an excellent array of cow postcards on offer to anyone that wants one :)

I am nowhere near the gamer some people here are, and I do need need to get a new console after my last one died  dusty death, yet I have a passion for games like Life Is Strange, Walking Dead, The Last Of US, Fallout and so on. I am trying to rediscover my old desire to read, Stephen King mainly, but I am currently reading a book about Hitler's political manoeuvring into power... I like to mix it up a little :)  - I cracked a smile there!

TV and films, that can be a fussy thing for me. You're more likely to grab my attention with something to do with history, war, psychological thrillers and horror. I used to enjoy streaming movies with lots of different people days gone by, do kinda miss that, and I am always receptive to other genres when I've been moaned at enough. 

I also spend way too much time just thinking and I've previously enjoyed sharing my ideas with others and getting their opinions. We could do that in any form you might want, whether than be a postcard, text, voice chat or the reliable typing we all seem capable of.... Well, some of us around here!

But what I really like above it all is the company of open and honest people. I'm not asking you to start sharing every damn detail about your own mess ups, nor will I always want those deep conversations with you, but it's important you aware of who I am at least.

I need to bring this to a close. I am back in my homeland, drinking way too much tea, living up to the stereotype and need frequent visits to the bog!

And because it seems to matter, I am chap in his early (I hope!) 30s and will consider myself European-based. My profile here is yours to have a gander at :)

You should also be aware of biological issues I face and I absolutely do not represent your image of a manly man, although maybe I sometimes get away with being a lovable little rouge. I am happy to discuss that further, it just involves dodgy chromosomes and the resulting bullying I had to endure because of it. I used to rely on the drink to get through a lot of it but I have woken up to the absolute idiocy of becoming something I hated.

Constantly feeling like anyone talking to you is just doing it out of pity or as a cruel joke. How do I know when it’s genuine? I’d feel so awkward if I’d had to ask that.

I get so drained. I don’t want to just talk to people just because I’m lonely. I want us to have common interests, have laughs, all the ups and downs of friendships,

That’s my other problem!! Fights. How are they supposed to be resolved? How do you make it not awkward. Or is a fight enough to break a friendship?

Every time these thoughts come it just makes me want to push everyone away. I know I’ll regret it but idk what to do.

I feel like I missed out on good friendships and am now starting to learn how to make healthy relationships. Someone being nice to me still makes me uncomfortable. I’m usually very withdrawn...what if when I finally give in and show myself more, they leave?? That thought terrifies me.

When I look around I can see that I look decent enough to find a romantic partner, so what is my issue? Well, that has to be the only other variable possible: My personality. 

I don’t really have an easy time making friends or keeping them for that sake, so what prospects do I ever have of finding love? None whatsoever.",lonely,Involuntarily celibate,2022-03-02 20:36:34

 I grew up as a Jehovah’s Witness. I left when I was 20, a little over 2 years ago. My parents and I were very close, and we were a very affectionate family. My mom and I cuddled a lot, my dad and I hugged a lot, and we never went a day without saying I love you. After I left the organization, my parents cut me off, and kicked me out. 
After leaving I’ve come to realize that my parents weren’t the best, but I am struggling a lot with the lack of platonic intimacy in my life. I don’t have parental figures, I have a good friend but she does NOT like being touched, and I’m struggling with it a lot. I have things in my life that I want to talk about, but I don’t want to dump it all on one person. I have people in my life who care about me, and ultimately I know if something happened to me, my parents would be there. But nothing fills that void. Nothing feels the same as cuddling with my mom. And it’s fucking killing me. I think knowing they’re alive and well and actively choosing to not have anything to do with me makes things worse. I feel cast aside, like trash. I haven’t really talked to anyone about this. Maybe I just needed to get it out , I don’t know.

5135,banjo123717,1646203530,1,"Looking back on my life thus far seems to be a story of being excluded. Not belonging but being too stupid to see that those in my circle didn't care if I was there one way or another, just useful in some way.

In elementary school, my only two friends would always hangout after school, without me. In middle school I moved around and had a hard time making friends. Never really saw anyone. I guess I couldn't be useful as a child.

In highschool, I somehow got lucky and was fast and strong, so I made friends with sports. All the same though, once the buzzer went off and I left the locker room, they would go off to someone's house without inviting me to tag along.

 I have one particular memory, my senior class did a sort of ""survivor"" game that we would do during our study period toward the end of our last semester. I was voted out two different times, even if I was the person carrying the team in many events. I only dominated the redemption game, to get voted out again.

I always thought my problem then was, maybe, I was anti social. I never really got into arguments or fights, but maybe I was too quiet, too ditstant.

In my college years I tried to change that. I tried to be the person who would give the shirt off their back for anyone, honestly anyone. Someone that people know, part of something else. I don't talk to anyone from school anymore. Being too open is also an issue, I suppose. This balance of too hot too cold was a game I didn't even know I was playing, or maybe I wasn't useful to them.

I always had a passion for music, and I would say I am pretty okay at it. Thats how I made friends later in life. I'd play guitar in bands, write music, and for a time I thought I actually made friends. However, I soon learned I was just a player to most of them. I'd have to leave a band due to homelessness or what not and I would never hear from any of them again. People only want to know you because you play in some bigger regional band, but once you have another project after that isn't as popular yet, or you put down playing music for a bit,, they want nothing to do with you.

Now I'm financially stable, I have a decent job and a girlfriend. Going to be 25 soon, not really sure where the time went. Even this feels like a farce most of the time. Maybe she stays around because I'm financially stable and can support her, I've been nothing but a tool to everyone else and I don't think much has changed. It honestly makes it hard to be in a relationship but I know my brain is just stupid.

Reading this feels like a bunch of first world problems, but I honest to goodness have no one to talk to and I can't think of anything better than the anonymity of reddit.

Anyway.

5142,ja_neane,1646199090,1,"So I transferred universities this year. At my old school I made one friend freshman year and we lived together sophomore year with 2 other girls. It was fun and all but no one was really motivated to do school work and my grades were bad. I get really bad social anxiety so I never was one to go out or do stuff everyone else does my age like smoke, party,etc. It felt like I was being persuaded to change so I wanted to get away from home and figure things out on my own without other peoples input.
I like my new school, I have one friend here I know from highschool who’s in a frat and I usually go to their parties and I’ve gotten to know people there because It’s the same faces, but I haven’t made any actual friends. 
Even in a club I joined I haven’t made friends either.
The people I have met only talk to me when they need something like answers and all that, one girl who I usually talk to in class didn’t even say happy birthday which kind of sucked bc I always attend to her when she needs something.
I turned 21 Sunday i literally didn’t do anything. My friend that’s in the frat said we could go out and celebrate but never hit me up and I saw he went out with his other friends, which I understand but it still hurt. Whenever I go to class and feel like there’s a lot of people or get overwhelmed I go to the bathroom and freak out a bit til I calm down. I’m just tired of feeling so anxious and locking myself up everyday. On the bright side my grades did improve but everyday just feels dull and the same I don’t have motivation anymore. Usually for a hobby I love to run because it clears my head and I’ve been doing it for years, but I’ve been injured so i can’t even do what makes me happy.
I’ve had a history with eating disorders and struggled with anorexia in highschool and freshman year of college. Now that I’ve recovered and “gained weight” I feel self conscious and like I hate myself even more. 
I bought some cute shorts to wear to class and as soon as I saw myself in the mirror I had to change. 
I don’t feel this way with my friends from back home, I can be myself and have a good time and enjoy going out but I can’t do that here.

5156,XLAK76,1646192219,1,"I met Gina [name changed] at her job as I was trying to be a friend to another woman. I approached her thinking she was the other woman at a distance.
I was smitten at first sight but wouldn't request her on Facebook for like another year.
She was readily accepting of me, highly functioning autistic, panicky, paranoid me who is about 2.5 years younger than her.
We spoke almost every single day and sometimes, for the entire day minus her having to care for her 3 kids. 
Sometimes, we'd just sit in silence as I listened to her work as a remote customer service agent.
One day on the phone, I was panicking and she asked why. I said it was because I wanted to tell her something but was afraid of her reaction. 
I was put at ease and confessed to slowly growing feelings for her. 
She gently let me down, because she was engaged to what I heard was a jerk.
One day, she called me asking for her help finding the local welfare building.
As we hung out together, I tried fighting the physical signs of obvious attraction as my eyes wandered everywhere.
I was caught and she teased me but nothing bad came of it.
On the way to drop me off at home she said to me ""if I ever broke up with Derek (name changed), and I was feeling dark, I would make you my bi!ch"".
At this point, I was struggling to get rid of my forbidden attraction to her for belonging to another by trying to say she was like my sister with how close we were, but after hearing the above, it became almost impossible. My feelings grew.
Fast forward to about March 2020 and she told me about a sims knockoff called IMVU. She was enthusiastic about me joining it even though I had no reason to be on there.
She isn't into furry stuff irl but bought my sim a lot of clothes and furry things in the game.
April of 2020 and I was hanging out in a furry room which, by this point, was just these characters having regular conversations about music tastes. I said something and it seemed to offend, so I tried to clean it up by saying I was somewhat autistic and didn't mean it that way. I was bullied off by this person and I left the room &amp; uninstalled the game. 
Gina decided to chew them out because she knew me well enough to know what I was trying to say and that they of all people shouldn't be quick to judge.
She asked me to return and so I did but wouldn't return to that room.
Fast forward to May and Gina starts having financial issues. I was willing to cash advance $700 to pay her missing rent but she insisted I refrain as it was her deadbeat fiancée who ought to pay.
I was anxious over the idea of her becoming homeless so I asked her friend Yasmine (changed) what i should do. 
Yasmine says not to be stupid and that she was a big girl and had to take it on the chin if it comes to that.
The next Tuesday, things seemed normal but that night, I sent Gina a reassuring text that I cared about her and she didn't answer. 
Wednesday came and she wasn't responding to anything in the chat room that I was saying. 
Her and Yasmine started talking Spanish and I said jokingly I hated when people spoke in code.
Gina snaps, calls me a b-word and chews me out but I was lost ad to why.
2 weeks go by and I wondered why she was so mad. Yasmine claimed ignorance but later told me she told Gina about what I said and THAT was why she was mad. I disclosed a private thing that I didn't know was private and since Yasmine was her best friend, I assumed she already knew to begin with. Turns out I was the only one who was meant to know.
Gina and I wouldn't speak for 6 months after that. One day, walking home, I decided to reach out to check in and she replied within about 3 mins. 
My heart was jumping and we agreed to talk the next day.
She called me and after small talk, she told me why she snapped and that she thought I betrayed her.
I told her my half and we promised to keep things more private and that we work out our problems.
We got back to business as usual but I didn't feel I'd be very welcome on IMVU so I deleted my account.
Fast forward to March 2021 and her and Derek break up but kept living together for financial sake.
I was jealous that despite this breakup, they were still having sex and as of today, I'm still a virgin. (It's by choice as I've had many chances but decided to make my first with someone I thought loved me.)
Side note: Gina explicitly said she wished Derek treated her like I did. 
Anyway, I saw a video of a drunk Derek screaming at Gina for a broken door that she couldn't have broken because she was out with her mother all day long.
Fast forward to about September and I get a call where she told me she was scared because Derek threatened her with a baseball bat so she left taking all 3 kids with her. Only the youngest is his, but he has already said he doesn't really care about their daughter but uses her to threaten Gina to comply or else he'd call CPS and since there was numerous complaints, CPS already told Gina that next time there is a call citing her address, the kids would be taken regardless of who was at fault.

Anyway, here I was attempting to tend to a broken heart that I didn't break by being available for the next 3½ weeks as her pillow to cry on as I truly wanted to believe (albeit naively) that I could love her until the pain subsided enough. Not once did I bring up an US during that dark time.

She called me for the first time at work on a Thursday in October and actually was crying and needed someone. I wanted to say no because at this point, I'd gotten nothing out of the situation I was already in but like a dummy, I ceded to her request to leave work. I had already worked 2 hours of overtime so leaving only put me at 39.5 hours.

I spent $20 of last weeks check into the library printing out her screenshots as this fight with Derek was the last straw and she was going to fight him for custody of the daughter.

She complained that I didn't print them in color which would've costed me an additional $20 for color.

The next week on the phone she vents some about her breakup and is stressed so I asked her about how the 2 kids will get to school. Guess who idiotically volunteered for that job?

I had quit the last job due to many reasons about 2 weeks after leaving early and risking being fired for her.

So I'm taking 2 boys that aren't mine to &amp; from school so the woman I'm in love with can have a little less stress.

I'd drive to the youngest one first and have to wait in line so the teacher could retrieve him from the car, drive around the block to drop off the oldest, leave to work out and eat, then go back to the youngest school to wait in another line, sometimes for upwards of 45 mins just to go pick up the oldest and wait in another line for about another 35 mins.

Oh. Did I mention that her running to her mother's house was over state lines?

I had to wake up at 6:30am, drive about 20 mins to the mother's house in the highway, drive back on the highway to wait in 2 traffic jams that appeared EVERY... SINGLE... DAY, wait in those lines mentioned above, just to pick them up and drive in the same traffic jams to get them home just to bear the same jams coming back home to enjoy what's left of my evening before doing it all over again. This was all for the woman I adored more than anyone that wasn't my mother.

Derek was fired from his job and she was $700 short on rent so, unlike the 1st time, she asked me to lend it to her. I did.

She began paying me $70 per paycheck but eventually, a couple times her phone bill was paid, her kids were fed, and her Verizon bill was paid. 

She promised me $2k for all my sacrifices for she would be filing her middle son's SSDI app (she still hasn't) and pay me out of the back pay.

In late October 2021, a judge ordered her to allow visitation to Derek because he never hurt the daughter in any way so I'd drive her to and from Sunday visitation at the house where the daughter (i think she was 3 years old) would be left alone with Derek for 1 hour.

November was going by and I didn't really feel comfortable leaving her alone with Derek with all his mental breaks lately.

Gina starts seeing a free counselor provided by a woman's organization who turns out to be, from Gina's own words, a radical f3minist[don't know if the word is censored]. After her 1st appointment, Gina was weary about seeing a woman who explicitly says she wants to k!ll all men, put their acorns in a vice grip and squeeze until they pop. 
However, Gina says she can't wait 2 years to speak to an actual therapist and needs mental help immediately to process her breakup. As of now, I blame the self-professed man-hater for planting the seeds that ruined our friendship and budding romance.
After Gina's 1st appointment, we spoke on the phone and she mentioned something about Derek and her sex life and how Gina felt she was to blame somewhat for Derek's breakdown into alcoholism but I said that victims of trauma like epar [spelled backwards] normally form a bond with their perps.

Gina denies Derek ever did that but I reminded her if a story she told me in March 2020 when she was mad at him and he [allegedly] took her by force. She told me ""i didn't want it"" but never told him to stop.
She changed her story to ""i didn't want it... UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. We were fighting and I didn't want sex until we cleared the air but he wouldn't stop goading me (or something to that effect)"". 
I had the biggest facepalm.

She then asked me ""if you were so certain that I was in danger, why didn't you speak up or call the police""?

This was a shocking question and I was confused at it. There were multiple answers but she interjected after the 1st one.

I said I was afraid she would stop being friends with me and after cutting off another narcissistic person out, she was literally all I had left.

After she heard ""friends"" though, she went off saying that I'd rather her hypothetically be violated just so I wouldn't lose her.

Of course, there was more to the story. Back when I thought she was violated, I asked her if she wanted me to intervene but she said no for 2 reasons.
1. CPS would take her kids away 
2. She didn't feel like she was in any danger and would call me if I were truly needed.

On that night, I was between a rock &amp; a hard place. Gina's kids are her explicitly stated reason for living. Losing them forever means she would delete herself from planet earth.

There's also the heaping pile of confusion about what I thought I was hearing, both that night &amp; then this argument over a year later.

I was scared of a lot but Gina said she'd never forgive anyone for causing her to lose her kids. In Gina's anger, she didn't let me say that.

Back to this argument. She decided to cut off the phone call and claimed she wasn't mad and had to sleep on it and would call me in the morning but never specified what time or if the next day's plans were still on. 

Gina isn't exactly direct with communicating so I understood this as meaning she WAS mad and I needed to apologize. Gina had always said I could borderline read her mind but on these last 3 occasions, I was so far away. This is the 1st situation. 

I picked up her favorite coffee and drove over thinking she was up but she wasn't. She denied my gift and letter.

I didn't hear from her until 3 hours later when she said she wasn't mad for last night but she was for me not only waking her up with my 2 phone calls but showing up unannounced (meant to announce my presence).

She micro-snapped in text messages and I let it go, being sad.

Next day, I was wondering what to do because Gina has never been mad for more than a few hours.

Text her at 11 and she replies that she was getting ready to call an Uber for visitation.

I said it was ridiculous and we talked out what happened. She took my letter and after reading it, she gave me our first and only 2 armed hug. This was Halloween 2021.

Wednesday came and her youngest son (autistic) had gotten in trouble at school for hitting his teacher and this was 1 week after he had been suspended for a day and the teacher puts him in my car (Gina's car broke down in September) as he begs not to call his mom.

Teacher is fed up (her words) so I thought he had been suspended again or expelled.

I decided to put on an act after I drove away and decided to say he'd lose his tablet when his mom found out (Gina worked from the house still so I picked up solo).

I was also getting frustrated he was kicking dirt into my front passenger seat so that leaked out.

I did tell Gina when I dropped him off and she gently said to refrain from that. 

She calls me 5 hours later and we talked about some stuff and eventually, school came up. I asked her what happened and she snapped saying it was none of my damn business and I had no right to tell him he'd have his tablet taken away and that I would lose her friendship for crossing her boundaries again.

Mind you that 3 weeks prior to this, I yelled at her daughter for misbehaving in the mall and she thanked me so I thought this was the same thing. 

So Sunday comes up and it gets patched but I asked her what  her triggers were so I could avoid them. She said she shouldn't have to tell me. Facepalm

Now for Judgment Day: Sunday, Nov 14th, 2021

It began when she called me and asked for pick up and transport to AutoZone because she finally had gotten a loan to fix her car and needed some stuff.

I got her and took her and when I parked in the back of the lot, she claimed it was abusive to make her walk across the lot. I pulled to a spot in front of the line.

Mind you. Gina has always, up to the point of the f3minazi counselor, asked me to treat her like a guy. Now, everything was abusive.

Before Gina went into the store, I told her I think I understand why she takes things out on me. She has no power to discipline her kids in her mom's house, her sister and her kids run stuff and the hypocrisy of your parents drive you nuts so you take it out on me as an outlet.

She denied and left. Both of us forgot by the time she re-entered the car.

Took her to her brother's house to drop off the oil but she kept an $80 carbon knife on her. Don't ask. 

Finished at 11:30 and visitation is at 1pm. She asked me what I wanted to do. I said the usual spot but she said no because it'd be too cold for her daughter.

I offered a drive up the countryside like roads towards a village and she said she didn't want to be tempted into spending money at a vintage knife store. 

I said the easy antidote would be to not get out of the car. She went silent. I reiterated that I wasn't going to be stopping and that I'd be leaving.

I took off and the conversation went so well, I missed my last turn that would've avoided this whole situation. 

She spotted the store and wanted me to park. Parking costs money here but she knows a special spot for free.

I told her I wasn't stopping as stated earlier. This is where I should tell you that I'm very shy with women. Gina told me I need to put my foot down more often EVEN WITH HER and that if she got mad, to let her get over it.

I decided to do just that this 1 time. At first, Gina got pouty, saying it was like dangling crack in front of an addict.

I stayed silent and she got angrier and angrier. She was saying stuff like she'd never get in my car again, that I was a manipulator and that she knows I'm being more confid.....
That's right. The moment she sensed what I was doing she went silent. This wasn't about being evil, it was about being a man.

She stayed silent for about a good 25 mins and I finally said ""I didn't know you'd get THAT mad"".

Her: JUST STOP TALKING and get us to the destination because the next time I open my mouth, I'm going to say some unkind things.

We get to the house and she takes the carseat out and I was asking her what she was doing.

She takes daughter to Derek who complains she's 30 mins early.

She turns to me after Derek shuts the door and says she will find her own ride home.

I'm so freaking confused and am trying to de-escalate but she is just too angry.

I wait for her to cool off and she texts me at 9pm saying her dad would be taking the kids from this point forward. 

I asked to talk&gt; she said no.

I explicitly said I wanted to save her from financially ruining herself from a purchase buy with loan money. The knife she wanted would have costed a minimum of $300 before taxes but she wanted to spend not only the loan money she needed for the lawyer or the car motor but also her payroll.

She left me on read.

I decide to wait out the night and try again the next day.

Nov 15th. I called up my brother and vented to him and since this isn't the first time a woman has taken advantage of me, my brother decides to narrate parts of my texts for me which in hindsight, made it worse.
 Part of this was saying I was no longer deferring the $2k and didn't care if she got a payday lender.

She was livid but at this moment, I didn't care. I wanted her to feel my pain.

She didn't, but she did promise me to pay me back, blocking my number. 

This was the woman I loved, so I waited for 2 weeks which was Black Friday. Sent her a message on Discord about how I regretted part of what I said and wanted to patch things up. No answer. (1 month later I found out I was blocked)

I emailed her on her birthday which was about 12 days later. No answer.

I emailed her on New Years day about 3 weeks later, no answer.

I decided to call to leave a voicemail about my money on Feb 13th or so. The phone rings but is sent to voicemail. I thought she was finally over it and would be in contact soon.

Today- about 7 hours ago, she sends me NOT the promised $2k but $530 and refuses to pay the rest.

She says she doesn't want friendship and wants to be left alone by people. I don't know if she means me or literally everyone. It just occurred to me now that if she means more than me then some people probably heard from her what happened with us and took my side so she cut them off too. Instead of swallowing her pride, she just cuts off. 

So that's it. The debt I accumulated because of Gina won't get paid, my credit score took a hit because of it all, and now, I'm struggling without a friend to help me. Completely alone.

For those wondering about when I said ""budding romance"", I was referring to the things Gina said would never happen but ended up happening. 

She said I'd never see her kids.
She said I'd never come inside her house.
She said we'd never hang out together
She said I'd never meet her family.

All 4 ended up happening within the same month.

On October 9th when I left work, she told me she'd be showering when I arrived which I thought was temptation but even then, I showed respect and remained in the hallway.

I swear I did everything for Gina but instead of trying to understand, she gave up on me like everyone else does, especially women. 

It hurts a lot man.

Anyway, if you read this much, if you have any questions to clarify, feel free to ask.

5175,dungeonsausage,1646181295,1,"TL;DR: Learn to let things go. If you have feelings for a person in your late teens or early 20s, and they don't reciprocate or are in a relationship with another person, just let it go. If you don't, you're just imprisoning yourself in depression.

I'm turning 30 this year. When I was around 13 I developed a crush on a girl in my class, let's call her Ruby. I thought Ruby was absolutely perfect; she was beautiful, not in like a super model kind of way, but she was really pretty all her ""imperfections"" just made her just the most beautiful thing in the world to me. She was intelligent, funny, and had the same taste in music as me (as someone who played multiple instruments and played in a lot of bands, that was very important). We weren't really friends, per se, but more like acquaintances. II always loved being around her.

I used to dream of her all the time, whether it be regular dreams or day dreams in a boring classroom. All I wanted to do was be close to her.

In later years when we had both started drinking and going to parties, I lived in the garage of my parents' place, so I would pretty much every weekend hold parties. That was around the age of 17-18. At first, Ruby would come to my parties with my cousin, whom she was friends with. Then later on I started to invite her to my parties myself and she would come whenever she could. It was heavenly for me; having the girl of my dreams deciding to spend parts of her weekend with me and my friends.

Ruby was a very eager drunk; she'd decide that me, my friends and her and her friends should go camping, or have big parties at her house when her parents were away. She used to talk a lot to me whenever we were together and we would plan all kinds of these kinds of things together. At this point we were in high school (I'm not American, so it's the equivalent, which goes from ages 16-20 usually) and she would often sit next to me in classes we shared and we would frequently flirt.

Then around the time we were 19-20 she started seeing an older guy. She pretty much stopped coming to my parties and eventually she moved to different city for university, where he was also studying. She had graduated a year earlier than I did. I was crushed. But I knew I would go a year later to the same city and start at the same university. I never thought Ruby and her boyfriend would last, I always felt like they had a much lesser connection than me and her. 

When I finally moved to the same city, I learned that they had started living together. For my first year of university, I met her a few times, but she always seemed much more distant than before. But I still was pretty much in love with her and just assumed she would eventually see that we belonged together. Now I see how stupid and naive I was, but at the time it just felt like us ending up together was the only possible conclusion.

Then she got pregnant. When we were around 22, there was a reunion for our class. Both me and her were in the planning committee. The only reason I joined the committee was because of her. I could finally spend some time with her after having pretty much no contact in a year. It was then I knew I had absolutely fallen in love with her. I had never understood what people meant when they told pregnant women they were glowing. But when I saw Ruby a little more than halfway through her pregnancy when we met for planning the reunion, I realized what people meant. She was so beautiful to me, I can't even describe it with words. And it absolutely shattered me. Seeing her so happy with her boyfriend and pregnancy.

I've spent the last 10 years (from when I knew she was pretty much out of reach for me) just desperately and selfishly hoping that she would still end up with me. And every time I think I'm over it, I end up having a beautiful dream about her and ""relapse"". 

It's a painful existence, just reminiscing about past times and day dreaming about futures that cannot be. I've been so depressed in the last 15 years. I was depressed before Ruby and I were friends, but I think me holding on to any hope just made it exponentially worse. Tonight I've been drinking, trying to forget yet another dream I had of her last night.  So my advice to you younger people out there is to just learn to let go as soon as possible. It isn't worth it.",lonely,My advice to younger people,2022-03-02 11:34:55

5183,Simple-Experience-85,1646176691,1,"Hey, first time posting on Reddit ever. Sorry if it’s poorly written, it’s 12am and im in bed, stuck with my thoughts.

I’ve been processing this thought for years, and just now i thought about opening up about it. This post is not only for you to read, but for me to write about and reflect on it myself.

 I’m 23 m and since childhood i’ve always had a lot of female friends. Lost my virginity with a girl when i was 14 and had a relationship with her for 5 years. I ended it because she was abusive. Met a few girls inbetween and started another relationship of 3 years. This one ended because ”i felt lonely”. She was really nice though.

After the last relationship, i went on a tinder rampage and probably laid 10 different girls during one summer, all of the relationships were labeled as no strings attatched, but a majority of them still wanted more. I’ve always had it easy with close romantic relationships.

But Even though this is the case, i’ve always struggled with this immense feeling of loneliness. I think this has to do with the fact that i’ve since a young age prioritized romantic relationships over casual friendships. Which is something i’ve expressed openly that i really really really crave.

I started thinking about this for quite some time ago, and even tried to put thoughts into actions by hooking up with old guy friends and being open to new ones, but i just can’t seem to have that same luck to start casual and close friendship bonds with other guys like i have with girls.

It’s like im that awkward guy who can never get a girl, but with casual friends, and it’s driving me nuts. For other people it seems so easy for them to meet and keep casual friendships.

Can anyone relate with this?

Tldr: I have a hard time meeting and keeping casual friendships with guys, but have an easy time meeting and keeping romantic relationships with girls.",lonely,Easier with romantic relationships than casualfriendships?,2022-03-02 10:18:11

5201,Here-Now01,1646167306,1,"So, I’m almost 29/M. Never had a date once in my life. It’s embarrassing to admit but it’s so. The reasons are a bit complex, I won’t go into all now but basically super intense anxiety and depression since childhood. I always bought into the idea of “love yourself, improve yourself, and become confident before dating”. I still think there’s legitimacy to it. But in some situations like mine there’s a catch 22:

When you have serious childhood trauma and/or a legit mental health issue such as a chemical imbalance or whatever and you have done tons of very real and good hard work on yourself and indeed improved many aspects of your life drastically, but still find yourself deeply insecure, depressed, and anxious despite your best efforts. I still feel incapable of being in a relationship and the older I get the more depressing the situation gets. There’s a very real biological need for connection of this type, we’re hard wired for it and it is actually contributing to depression and insecurity which just makes it even more difficult to begin dating and it just goes round and round. I swear, if I could turn off the desire for a women I would do it in a heart beat, but it doesn’t appear to be possible.

I do my best to stay productive, take responsibility and not mope around feeling sorry for myself. I have a full time job. Eat healthy and take care of myself. In decent shape. Still trying to level up in life, etc…But I just can’t shake that damn desire for intimate connection.

I’m honestly confused about whether or not I should even try at this point. I feel too old to start dating, but who knows.

So, has anybody around my age here ever been in a similar situation and actually managed to start dating? Success stories?

Side question for women out there: I know you don’t know anything about me, how I look, personality, etc. I know there’s a lot of factors involved in who you would date. But, would having severe depression and anxiety and the lack of experience at the age of 29 be a deal breaker for you? Please be honest and please give reasons for either answer.

Other than her I’m lost, alone, by myself. I love a life no one around me understands. I have bug one close friend who I hang out with about once a month. You know just spend the night over and talk and hang out. But other than him, I don’t share my life with anyone. Not like they’d even understand. 

Most of this started when I was thirteen. I started experiencing symptoms of what I think is OCD but I wouldn’t know because my parents or anyone believe i don’t suffer from anything. So I’ve never had a chance to meet a therapist. I remember thirteen differently than most people probably do. I thought very mature thoughts. I considered the purpose of life and pleasure and pain and work. I became obsessed with the book of Ecclesiastes. The words of Solomon: “everything is meaningless and striving after the wind”. These words were so powerful to me and still are to this day. But ever sense then I’ve started to live more and more in my own world. Talking to myself all the time. Having conversations with people in my life that weren’t there. Making up soul mates that didn’t exist and day dreaming a life with them. Sometimes I’d just stare at a wall thinking about nothing, lost. I don’t understand why I’m like this. Even now, it doesn’t make sense. But, somehow, it has to. Nobody has ever understood me in the ways id like to be understood. Not even my girlfriend. I’m an artist. Sense thirteen I have been. I write raps and produce beats. But not in the way you may think. I was different and am different in ways I can’t explain. My music is different in a way that Kanye’s or NF’s music is different. It’s unique and it’s mine and something I wish the world saw. But, when I created my music it wasn’t good like it could have been. I was forced to teach myself all the technics and didn’t have the proper equipment to make a good mix. I was alone with my art with no one but me to understand it. For three years I wrote and produced songs that never went anywhere. I used fake streams to try and make my music look better. People I grew up with would leave me on seen when I’d send my music to them. They would lie and tell me they listened to it but the streams wouldn’t go up at all. People would insult my music and talk trash about me behind my back. One time I cried in the bathroom and I mean sobbed because I felt so disregarded and insulted. The worst of it is that I’m actually very intelligent and I’m not just some stupid kid who thought he could make it somewhere as an artist. I mean I really believed the stuff I made could change people. Even recently after taking a super long break and getting back into making songs, I put out music and my parents hated it and said it was too gritty. This discouraged me and made me feel as if I would never be understood. The song wasn’t even that bad. It had no swear words, really honestly all it was was a song about my loneliness titled Saddest Thing of All Time. There was a whole album and everything on SoundCloud YouTube and streaming services but I took it all off and put all of my equipment into a bag and basically gave up. Sense November of last year I haven’t even thought about releasing another track. I live in a world where nobody understands me or what I want to be not even my girlfriend. I imagine what it would be like if I had fans and views and friends who understood my art. I mean I really wanna do things I wanna make movies and music and clothes and I wanna tell stories that people never hear and bring life to people who don’t have any. But I’m here. Alone.

Went thru a BUNCH of mental health problems related to military service, law enforcement, personal life problems and undiagnosed disorders that got worse because of the stress.

Anyways about two years after I figured maybe I could try it again. I dealt with the alcoholism that came from my divorce, I got medication and I got healthier and happier. So I met this girl who was almost identical to me in every way and it was awesome. I haven’t felt a connection like this ever before except the beginning of my marriage.

We were together for about three weeks. We didn’t label it anything but it felt serious. But when I went on vacation and came back she told me that she was dating me and another guy deciding which one to choose.

And I lost. Again. At least she didn’t ghost me, but man does it hurt knowing I was given up for something better. And when it was feeling like I could love someone else it was crushed.

 I think it would be more beneficial to everyone to tone down the bitterness and generalization of people, and stopping the comparing of which group of people has it worst when it comes to feelings of loneliness, and instead try to focus more on helping others (you may end up helping yourself too in the process) and improving ourselves.

5226,Greenmind76,1646159093,1,"Having recently been tossed back into the dating pool I quickly jumped at the chance to ""get back out there"" only to realize I could be happy being single. 

My gf of 3.5 years moved out for a new job in December and ended things on NYE. On January 1st I decided to say fuck it, toss the attachments I had to my life with her and live by my own rules. I spoke to my manager and got approved to leave the US and work remotely. 

Sooo... now I'm 45(M), single again, divorced (2x), no kids (even got the snip snip) and am sitting in a beautiful apartment with the sun shining in my window... The cost of the apartment I'm in (for a week) is roughly the same as a night in a hotel in a similar location in the US. I've been up since 4AM, caught the sunrise (magnificent!), and spent the last 2 hours making as much noise as I want (while respecting the neighbors). I'll start my work day smiling and look forward to my meetings. I'll have lunch at some point with freshly squeezed watermelon juice. Dinner will be either self made or something small from a nearby diner. I'll head to the park at some point and just take in the fresh air. At night I'll head to the rooftop and enjoy the sunset in a hot tub as a chilly breeze sweeps across my body. I don't have to pay attention or care about the news back in the states... At the end of the week I'll take a bus to the mountains and spend a month there, exploring, reflecting, and healing.

To my friends and family my life sounds rather tragic but in reality it was all necessary to get me to the point I am at now. They feel this way because unlike me, they still hold onto the ideas that society and life has projected into their minds.  The true reason I believe we feel lonely is because society and our families teach us that attachment is healthy and without being attached we are not whole.

I'll be here for a total of 3 months, have cut off communication to most of my friends/family, and am just enjoying being with my ""self"". I have met some awesome people and had some great experiences but overall am just enjoying doing my own thing. I think a lot of people would feel happier or more at peace if they just let go of these ideas that we've been raised to believe in. Who's to say you need to have a ""home""?  Who's to say you need to be dating anyone or in a relationship?  Why have children unless you truly want them?  All of these things we think we need/want come from ideas put in our head from living around other people who impose these values on you. You don't have to prescribe to these ideas.  :)  The choice is yours.  I know not everyone can leave the US or walk away and that I am very lucky but I do believe anyone can let go of these ideas and find peace being alone which will eventually bring the right people into your life.

I’ve asked girls out before and always got rejected. Like most people here, I’m very lonely. 

In January I went on a first date with a girl via Hinge and it awesome. She was pretty, funny, and our personalities matched well. We went to a museum for about 4 hours. I held her hand (never done that before) and kept her laughing the whole time. 

Outside the museum, I kissed her, then we went to a cafe. In the cafe she called me handsome, pretty, and said I had really nice eyes. I’ve never been complimented like that before. We kept kissing in the cafe. I walked her to yeh bus stop and gave her my number. 

She texted like 30 mins later saying she had a great time and was still thinking of me. We text all day every day over the next few days and she was interested in getting to know everything about me.

She asked me out for a second date and we met 10 days after the first date. We met and she instantly hugged me. She looked so happy to see me. We hung out at a gallery and flirted and laughed the whole time. She even asked me for a kiss. Then we went to her place to watch a movie and ended up having sex.

Everyone has a group or at least a couple of people they hang out with, and whenever people post about having no friends they usually mean that they only have like 3-4.

I never had any friends all the way from pre-school to college, not a single one. Wasn't for the lack of trying and while I might have been a pretty shy awkward kid even others like that had their cliques. I've never been to parties, concerts, sleepovers or anything like that, or ever hanged out with anyone in a non-romantic way.

Currently am 25 and in recent years I've been in and out of a few colleges trying to find something I like and now halfway through a degree, and in none of them did I make a single friend. I tried at first, making more efforts to get to know people, appear interesting, start conversations etc. but nothing worked. 

College was sold to be the place where even those that can't fit in high school have a chance and I always hoped it would work for me, but nope. I don't have a single person to talk to. 

&amp;#x200B;

As to why, I can't tell for sure. It seems that everyone ends up hating me for no reason and I do mean it. It's like I carry some weird aura that repels people. Here's some specific examples: 

\- Last semester I was chatting up with my group partner and trying to get to know them, making some jokes and stuff and it even seemed to be working. But then he seemed to grow annoyed at me and switched groups, basically abandoning me, and after that became very aggressive towards me. We never talked again.

\- My roommate and I last year got along okayish, we didn't exactly hang out but would sometimes talk and joke around. But a couple of times I heard him talk badly about me to his friends, and when I left the dorm he started pretending not to know me whenever I tried greeting him on campus, and acting really annoyed to see me.

\- Another group partner last year I had and seemed like we could be friends just went cold and stopped reaching out. Before that he grew increasingly annoyed at me, don't know why.

\- We were assigned into groups during covid zoom class times, where almost no one knew each other and since the few of us didn't have a group yet. Mine decided to switch and work with someone else they didn't know, without knowing me either or even talking to me. 

\- People never talk to me or initiate conversation in any context and no one seems to want to sit at my side or work with me in assignments, even if it's the start of a semester and no one knows each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Most strangers are rude to me or treat me with disdain, this includes teachers, bus drivers, retail clerks etc. If they don't mock or insult me directly then they still seem to treat me worse than everyone else. 

\- I try to make friends online but that fails too. Some 'friends' I had just randomly blocked me with no explanations. Most people seem to dislike me online too even if they never met me before. The couple of online friends I have had have all backstabbed me and started hating me, every single one of them. 

\- Many people ghost me or block me for no good reason or signs leading up to it.

&amp;#x200B;

From this one would think I am just really really ugly or just never shower.. the weird thing is, I have no problems with dating. I've had several relationships and been told I'm attractive by both girls and guys. I can have casual hookups easily, never been rejected romantically and people I date usually approach me first even. 

I'm not autistic, have zero social anxiety, and actually have a ton of confidence talking to both genders.  I got several hobbies, interests.. quite a lot to share, but unless I'm dating someone then nobody cares. My notifications are always dead and even if I had social media I have no one to add.

Clearly, I must be doing something wrong that I can't see, because I continue to observe over and over individuals with terrible social skills that don't even try, that could be described as physically unattractive by society's standards, with very introverted hobbies, even those that are autistic and low functioning.. and all of them seem to make friends overall easily.

I’ve become needy and reliant on my partner since our relationship went through a rough patch when I had a severe decline in mental health. Since then he’s become tired and apathetic. I’ve never felt more alone trying to work on myself and find things that work to manage my condition. He mentioned moving as a farther future thing so I put it away in my head. I picked him up from the airport yesterday after a visit to Seattle and he told me he wants to move as soon as I got him. I had a panic attack thinking I would lose him for good. I spent the night crying and lying awake in bed next to him. It feels like my world is falling apart and knowing I’ll be alone in my future is slowly killing me.

It's a bit of a struggle to not fall into my workaholic ways especially seeing some of my co-workers are still online. It's already a bit of a challenge trying not to think about work when I'm resting.

I'm starting to conclude that working is my escape. Working is probably my forte. When I'm not working, the bad thoughts get even stronger like how I'm stressing out on trying to stop smoking so he doesn't go blind. He can't see well right now. There are some clots blocking his vision. 

I think about how I'm trying to upgrade my looks, but I feel down most of the time because I end up comparing myself to a girl my boyfriend used to like before me that he's friends with. I feel like no matter what I do , I'd never be more objectively attractive looking than her. Sometimes I still wonder if he's with me because she rejected him or because he just likes the idea of having a girlfriend. If he's still friends with her hoping he still has a chance with her. 

I don't know if he even thinks of me or really cares about my feelings. Maybe he'd be more excited to talk and see me if I was prettier. 

I get sad alot and I just choose to keep it to myself as much as I can even though I only want to be comforted sweetly because I don't want him to tell me to take anti-depressants. I guess the fact that I feel like I cannot rely on him to be there for me emotionally make everything worse in my head. Those instances that he is there struggles to be registered that it's real.

5270,Correct_Slice5796,1646135440,1,"Went to a party with my best friend this weekend. We almost never can sync up to hang out with her having a family to tend to (her mom, Uncle, husband and two kids) with online college classes on top of that and me, working all the time to make ends meet and living quite a drive away.  At times we are able to hang out, it generally was very short lived, but we were always very appreciative of the time we try to make for each other. These small moments of hanging out really helped me out during times of feeling lonely, especially during these times with my recent breakup from a long relationship in which I thought would last (this is a whole other story but to keep it short: we've lived together for a while, I came home from work one day and she had already moved out with the help of her other friends). 

This weekend, one of her favorite artists were playing in town so we went. We started drinking before doors opened. After going in the venue we drank a little bit more at the bar. Was having a good night for a while. We went outside to take a breather and smoke. Next thing I knew, she collapsed to the ground and could not get up, she was still conscience, just very drunk. Stuff like this had happened back then so this wasn't something new, we always just weathered it out, drink some water, eat some food, and things got better. Quite some time passed but she seemed to be getting worse, it looked like she was fading in and out of conscience. Security was trying to help me get her to my car so we could get her to the hospital nearby, but security had to go back to the venue as I parked a bit to far from the venue. For a while, we were about a flight of steps + 70 feet away from my car but at this point she was barely responsive and was pretty much dead weight so it was a major struggle to get her down the stairs safely. I lost my personal phone and broke my work phone that night so I wasn't able to call for an ambulance. I wasn't in a clear mindset, but I should've just shouted to call for an ambulance and hope someone would. My ex and her friend showed up and helped get her an ambulance. We all ended up going home after because they only allowed immediate family to visit at the hospital during this time.

I was beating myself up (mentally and physically) because I knew I could've done so much more. I've had a couple best friends pass away already (one to cancer and one to a drunk driver) and it hurt a lot just thinking I might've lost another.

The next day I couldn't contact anyone because my phone's were either broken or lost. I felt so disconnected from everything. Just felt like I lost a big part of me. I ended up buying a phone because I needed it for work and I wanted to make sure everyone was okay. 

My best friend ended up texting everyone on our group saying she was feeling a little bit better. She had get ventilator for her at the hospital because she would have periods where she wasn't breathing. Her BAC according to her was 10 times the average. I tried to check up on her but no answer.

I have this feeling she and her family are upset at me. They always trusted me to bring her home safely all these years and I didn't this past weekend. It's Tuesday around 1am, just needed to vent this out. 

TL:DR
My best friend almost died from alcohol poisoning.  I feel like we're no longer on good terms. I feeI lonely because it's like I've lost another best  friend.

5277,Govna2021,1646127633,1,"Sorry if this ends up being a long post. 
I (22,male) have been at university for a while now and have really struggled to make any meaningful or lasting friendships. Before I moved to university, I had a nice group of friends that we all considered each other basically family as well as some other friends from other circles. These people were the main reason I could stay sane while I was stuck back home. 

Since I’ve moved to university, that sort of quality in friendship has declined as I’ve gotten older and met more people here. The first year was the biggest disappointment as I got into class, thinking things were gonna be like college and I was gonna have a nice group of friends in class but boy was I wrong. I think it might be worth noting that I do an art course that is very girl heavy with some non-binary people around. I’m literally one of few boys. I get worried that whenever I try and talk to people and make a good effort, they think I’m trying to get with them, even though I try to make it very clear that I do not want a relationship at all. Additionally, while I’m very passionate about my career choice, I do not present myself as a very artsy looking person as everyone else does, so I don’t really stand out. 

I tried to make effort with everyone in the class but everyone was so anxious and quiet. I went from very social and confident to very anxious in a matter of months and lost the will to try. It made me miserable. Additionally I started noticing a conversation format that a lot of people seem to use but I’ve come to despise. It’s where you talk, but no questions are asked and nothing is a response to anything. It’s always just “I did skiing today””well I did snowboarding yesterday” it basically just becomes a pissing contest. I try not to volunteer information unless asked of me because I never want to get stuck talking about myself. I always want to make sure no-one gets left out because I know how that feels but it feels like no-one else has that sort of awareness.

After I decided to retake my first year due to my mental health hitting an all time low, I became optimistic that this wouldn’t happen again and I would get the fresh start I’ve been dying for with a new set of class mates. For a year, I finally got it. At least I thought I did. I became the person who threw all the parties and set up all the social events with the circle I gathered from this new set. Which was fun but I did so I didn’t have to do it forever and that I could start to get invited to things that aren’t of my making. Unfortunately after a year, this has not happened. I’ve taken a step back and I basically get invited to nothing, other than what my partner gets invited to or sets up themselves. The worst part is that the people in the class are making plans with other class mates so it’s not like they are too busy for plans at all. 

I just feel like I’m in this endless loop of trying so hard, yet still being forgotten, I don’t even feel worth existing anymore. I’m so tired.",lonely,I went from having a great social life to basically nothing after moving to university.,2022-03-01 20:40:33

I know that people find you attractive because of how confident you are and that’s just something I lack severely, and when I do end up talking to a girl I find cute or attractive in any way I feel like she sees that fat kid and I get in my head and mess it up before I know it.

I have no friends at school, and i never talk to anyone aside from the couple of people who say hi and make extremely light conversation, which goes by so quickly and never evolves into anything.

I decided to do this because i'm more comfortable online, and feel like doing this could at least allow me to express myself slightly. I felt like this was a good way for people to get to know me somewhat since I have too much anxiety to talk to them, and they aren't gonna do all the work themselves. I'm lonley and social anxious, I'm not antisocial as people like to paint onto me. I really just want to break out of my chains.

All of this worked fairly well. People view my posts, some liked them. No one comments or anything, but that's ok to me because i didn't expect them to. We don't talk irl, why would they talk to me online. 

The thing which made me feel bad about this was that the girl I ""like"" denied my follow request. They followed me for like 2 seconds and then for some reason unfollowed. I put like in quotations because I hardly talk to them, and I don't know them at all. It's nothing more than my brain trying to find some possibility of some real relationship. I just found it kind of sad, becuase they are one of the few people who sometimes talk to me. They didn't talk to me at all last week. No one ever talks to me one on one, in a situation where I might be more comfortable. But I felt like this was a way people like her could get to know me.

I just want somebody who will put in even half as much effort to the friendship as I will, somebody who will acknowledge my existence when I try to talk to them, somebody who won’t just disappear at the first sign of any troubles.

Hi, I'm Brian. I am currently a 17-year-old male who is a senior in high school. I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 5. As you can imagine, my autism has severely crippled my ability to socialize, especially at a young age.

Late elementary, I had a friend, ""Branson"", who I would play with on recess every day. One day, however, ""Branson"" told me that he just wanted to play with his other friends. He said that he would, eventually, come back to talk to me another day. He never spoke to me again. Little did I know that this event would basically become foreshadowing for my future.

Middle school. One day at lunch, I was manipulated a bit into bullying another kid, thinking that what I was doing was funny. I only realized what I was truly doing when ""Ed"" started crying. I was called to the office where I confessed to my bullying and apologized to ""Ed"" with tears in my eyes. He forgave me. After that, we started to become good friends. We started going to each other's houses. We played games with each other. Our relationship was starting to evolve, until I sort of just stopped going to his house. I don't know why I stopped. I just did. After that, our friendship waned. After school while in high school, I asked for his phone number. He said that he was too busy. Too busy for 5 seconds. I still see him at school, but it's not the same.

8th grade. Some of my new classes had a mix of 7th graders. One of those 7th graders was ""Linda"". I thought she was cute as soon as I saw her, but I fell for her even more when I started to know her. Her beautiful smile, cute laugh, her personality, and the way that she was just herself melted my heart. I desired (and still do) a relationship deeper than the surface level where we could tell each other anything, girlfriend or friend. I thought that I could finally have that relationship. We somehow ended up getting paired up all the time. She would also check in on me sometimes, which was sweet. At a 8th grade dance, there was a ""props"" section. We stood over there just laughing at each other for the entire night. Than, I moved on to high school, where I barely got the chance to see her. This year, however, she is in the same lunch shift as me. Recently, my pestering feelings for her became even more intense. Today, I had finally built up the courage to sit with ""Linda"". I asked her and the other person she was with if I could sit near them, in which they just didn't respond. I proceeded to sit down anyway and, just before I was about to say something, I noticed ""Linda"" absolutely engrossed with her phone. She didn't care about me. I guess I was a stranger to her. I ate, switching between staring at my food and her. She didn't even look up at me once. Lunch ends. Does she even remember me?

11th grade over the summer. I am interested in computers and want to have a career involving computers, so I sign up for a computer camp. The camp was great and I met some amazing people as well. We all decide to join a Discord server. That server has now been inactive for a long time.

No matter how strong the relationship is, every person that I have loved has ""faded away"" from me. I do have some friends within the current computer class that I am taking, but now I'm wondering if it's just a matter of time before they ""fade away"" too. For a while, I have tried to use video games to ease my pain. Now, I am tired of doing the same old shit every day. I desire someone who I can share and create new experiences with, tell my thoughts and feelings to, and to share interests with goddamnit.

I have tried to paint a smile on my face every day. If my life is a cruel joke, might as well laugh at it.

I tend to very much blow things out of what they are said to be, like ""I have no redeeming qualities"" or ""I deserved better a long time ago"" but I have gotten to a point I've convinced myself I have no wrongdoing in anything. On one hand, this is good for confidence, but now I wrap all my actions in ""I can just do whatever since I'm never given anything"".

To better understand, I've lived an isolated life since preschool. I was a missed birth control pill that turned into an unaffordable abortion. My parents treat me like I'm the mistake that I made. The only friends I have are online. I had high school friends, but after they graduated (I say that because I didn't attend because of my extreme anxiety in crowds) they went on to other things without me. The only exposure I have to society is my job. Don't get me wrong, I love it, and I even work with my dad, but working with 50+-year-old guys every damn day gets boring. 

I just want somebody to love. I've had fair relationships during my school years, including one up to 2 years, but it always ended with my ex either threatening me or abandoning me after saying they'd like to stay in contact. I spend every day talking to my same friend, who I love and appreciate, but not only do we have an age gap, but she lives on the other side of the planet, reducing the likelihood I will ever see her in person.

I've gone through the solutions to this. I tried smoking but that didn't do me any good, plus I'm not the druggie person anyway. I cannot go on a vacation because I refuse to travel alone. However my parents won't go, and I have no IRL connections. I've been on dating apps for 2 years and had been in a 2-month relationship with the most precious woman of my life, but she found me too clingy. I've also been in therapy for about 4 years and take meds. They don't work. I even admitted myself to a mental hospital for suicidal thoughts. That didn't work. Every damn night it's just another lonely ass few hours to myself before I brute force my sleep with meds. I sleep to forget, and I sleep to fast forward. I never sleep for rest, it's always to skip my boring life until the next workday comes. I no longer find any activity fun. I have over 12 consoles, a gaming pc, an expensive steering and plane throttle set, a massive tv with all the streaming services I like, but they all bore me. I have nothing exciting in my life.

What scares me is how often I see the middle-aged to elder fields on this sub talking about a life just like mine. I do not want to live my whole damn life like that. I just wish I could see somebody.",lonely,19M Chicago Kid,2022-03-01 11:45:54
5322,DeformedCreature117,1646094621,1," I have been told itll never happen, that I'm too... ugly. Women and men both tell me this.

Ive confided (is that the word?) in other men and asked them if I'm ugly and its always, ""yes.""

They get sex, random hook ups left and right, they get dates, they cheat on their gf and laugh about it, they share the women (in gangbangs and run trains on them) the women seem to like it and laugh and joke about it. I get shamed for even... trying though.

Some women told me I'm ""not allowed"" to date...

I noticed in middle school people were getting their first kisses and all that, and by high school, they were having sex and having ""serious"" relationships, which I doubt cause they are dumb kids but yeah to them it was ""serious.""

Ive had women even say that the reason is that I am ugly, and need to lower my standards, so I lowered them to crippled and deformed women, who also rejected me because ""they just arent attracted to me"" my looks in particular.

This is reddit, so I know women will claim it's my personality, but personality is constructed by the environment, when you get treated as a deformed creature your whole life, you will become a deformed creature. Look at rule 6, the mods even made it illegal for men to explain their troubles... haha... this is the kind of world we live in, and its up to a few users to read what I say and complain to have my post removed and my time wasted when all I want is some help.

So you keep trying and trying, and get put down and put down...

I've tried online dating for around 5 years with no matches I'm told its because... well, I'm ugly.

This is just what I'm told, so idk, I've even had females make my profiles and no matches... I've messaged women on apps like Badoo that don't require you to match to message with them saying ""ew."" or ""UHM!? DID I GIVE YOU PERMISSON!"" I'm told its my fault, how dare I message them?

Im not sure what to do at this point, what is your idea?",lonely,how do i get a girl to date me?,2022-03-01 11:30:21

I’m forced to depend on her for rides and the only places I go are work and out with her. I didn’t have sleepovers when I was young and lacked social skills so no friends. Don’t know what it’s like to wear shorts outside of the house; hell I’m scared too and I’m fucking 20.

Hello folks! I've been lurking in this sub from time to time and finally decided to make a post. People around me seem to stick around if they can get something from me, and if they can't - they stop talking to me. I like to help people, but if they don't need anything they just throw away our friendship like trash. My health isn't very good, I have low energy, so I mostly interact with people online. In 2018 I was in toxic relationships where my girlfriend liked to make everything about herself. She was nice to me, so I didn't realize that she was manipulative. We broke up.

I met a girl in 2019 in online game, we clicked, we joked and laughed, we watched some TV shows together, talking through voice chat. She said she was out of relationships and wanted to take things slow. I respected her boundaries. She said she felt lonely cos she's writing a paper so I did my best to keep her company. We chatted almost every day through voice and texted multiple times a day. She was writing a paper for university and working so she didn't have time for irl friends. Then comes summer, she finishes her paper and that's it. We barely text, voice chat only once, iirc. Now she has time for irl friends, I am not needed. I was a placeholder. Then around October she says she found someone, I decide to tell her about my feelings, she doesn't need them and suggests to stay friends. Around New Year 2020 I deleted her from steam friends cos it was too hard to see her name in game. She didn't text me since, she has my number.

2020 rolls in, Covid, social isolation. I get a copy of Animal Crossing for my Birthday and think that finally I'll play with my friends, cos they all play and talk how great they spent time on each other islands. I collect DIY and stuff in case they need anything. They don't. They visit each other, have fun, but don't invite me. If I ask, they are like ""sure come as well"", I ask them to let me know when they will play together next time, they don't. To this day only two of my friends visited my island, once each, when they needed to trade something. I see someone ask for stuff and answer that I have it and they are welcome to come and have it, and someone else says that they have it too, and sure enough that person goes to that other person. I feel so pathetic when I offer help or stuff, because people turn it down in favor of others.

So, 2020 I am depressed over that girl I mentioned before, 2021 my parents and I get Covid and I have even less energy than I had. I slowly recover and start of February 2022 we have Covid (Omicron this time) again. I have even lesser energy now.

I want a girlfriend. Long distance is fine, since I don't have energy for meeting up anyway. I want to write her some silly fluffy stuff in the morning, like ""good morning to most beautiful girl!"", something like that, and wish her good night. I want to watch some TV shows or movies together, joke, laugh, maybe play some games together. I don't want to be a placeholder. I want to care about her and I want her to care about me.

Since it's the first thing people see, I always felt like I always walked into a room with a physical representation of how I failed in my life.  Because of this, I never wanted to talk about my weight or draw any attention to it. Unfortunately, that also meant that I could never talk to anyone about how I wanted to lose weight and how I was trying. I always tried in secret and wouldn't ask for help. 

BUT I came across one post that shared common ""fat people problems"" and it weirdly made me feel less lonely and made me want to do something similar.

It's like today I don't want my dms flooded with people, and if I state that im a woman then my pms would be just filled with dick pics and fucking shallow people making poor attempts to flirt with me and it's pissing me off. And yesterday I had to deal with this fucker while I'm drugged saying ""take it one day at a time"" that's not the part that I'm pissed off about, it's the fact that he would say ""it's in the past now :)"" and I'm like??? I'm dealing with trauma and feelings in the moment and you're telling me ""it's in the past?"" Like wtf? And he had the AUDACITY to say that he'll ""say it to everyone"" when I asked if he'll say that to people that are fucking dealing with shit, traumatized, almost dead or dealing wjth war?! And then he said that I'm wasting my life being stuck in the past and it's a shame?! 

Excuse me, I admit that I say mean stuff to myself but NO ONE should fucking insult me like that while i just had a dream 10 minutes ago of my mom telling me she loves me but I'm also having flashbacks of her molesting me when I was 5 fucking years old. I'm not a violent person, but at that moment I wished I could go through the fucking screen and give him a good bitch slap and fucking mock him while he winces in pain saying ""why is your face like that? It's all in the past, remember?"" And block him. But the most I could do is yell and block. 

Maybe that's why I'm so hesitant. Sorry about the sudden mood change. I don't know where to post this so I post it here because I'm actually lonely and everywhere else didn't feel appropriate, you know?

5375,sunny_starblossom,1646066177,1,"Hi friends,

I know none of you are going to read this because I don’t plan on ever releasing it.

How’ve you all been? I hope all is well with everyone. I just wanted to take this opportunity to formally apologize for being M.I.A. in your lives. I’ve endured a years’ long battle with abandonment and trust issues. (and still am) 

You see, when I detect any remote signs of something off, I tend to automatically assume the worst. I tend to prepare myself for the worst possible outcome of any situation, and because of this, I begin to lose the interest I once had into investing in these friendships. 

I secretly begin hoping that y’all will leave me eventually because it hurts too much to do it myself. As much as I have the ability to do so, it sucks to hurt people. As much as I fear abandonment, I would rather y’all do it first because I’m already prepared for it. If not, I just wait for everything to fizzle out itself.

I truly hate this part of myself not because I feel like a bad person, but because it affects my ability to form close relationships with others. I see friends or romantic partners who are attached at the hip and constantly long for that. I want to feel loved by someone, yet I laugh in disbelief anytime someone says or tries it. 

As desperate as I am for any sort of connection, I still can’t allow myself to get hurt again. I feel empty yet more at peace when I’m lonely. It becomes depressing eventually but I’d rather have that than my continuously spiraling mind. I want to love but I can’t. As much as I love y’all for the company and good times, I don’t love y’all on an emotional level. I don’t love anyone that deeply other than my dog, Jerry, or family (which I question sometimes). It’s mostly Jerry though. 

Jerry is my rock. He’s my life. He came at a time I needed him the most. He’s given me what no one else ever has. He was my best friend when no one else wanted to be. He loved me when no one else did. He never judged me when everyone else did. I sometimes contemplate taking my own life after he passes. I want to protect him. I’m committed to him forever. 

I don’t see myself ever being able to commit that much to any human being. People suck and I hate them so much. Even you guys. I hate you guys but I also love you guys. I don’t feel included anywhere I am so my friendships mean nothing. But I have company and people to laugh with so that's all that should matter. Not that I’ll ever get or feel close with y’all anyway so either outcome means nothing to me.

I’m gonna leave it here and say that I secretly hope y’all leave. I can’t let myself go too far and cause any heartache or pain. I can’t be a burden to y’all. I don’t wanna be a nuisance, or cause any more anguish than I already have. I don’t have the guts to leave y’all myself, otherwise I would have a long time ago. I’m sorry if y’all are hurt by this but it’s for the best. You don’t have to deal with my annoying and unbearable ass anymore, which is awesome. Go enjoy your lives, okay? I’ll be fine &lt;3",lonely,A Letter to Friends,2022-03-01 03:36:17
