2,CptGinger316,1654002092,1,"This past fall I was going through some personal things and just felt alone. I’ve not had much of a successful dating life whether it be a committed relationship or hookups. They’ve happened but nothing long term has ever come of them. 

Then a friend I’ve had for six years became single. 

I’d had a crush on her for a while. We met online in 2016 and were in contact daily. We watched each other try and fail, learn and grow, chase dreams, and build each other up regularly. We met in the summer of 2021 for the first time and had a casual lunch in her hometown, I was there visiting unrelated to meeting her and it just happened. The second she walked into the restaurant, I knew I was in trouble. I locked eyes with her and she had a huge smile and came in for a hug. I’m not an overly touchy person but the hug tied my stomach up. 

She’d gotten out of a long relationship not long after we’d met in person the first time and I was able to provide her with a shoulder to lean on. 

I gave it a few months after the relationship before asking her to dinner. I made the trek back to her hometown where we had a casual dinner, I expected nothing other than spending time with her. I was over the moon just spending time with her. We ended the night back at her place and knowing I had to get back on the road (lonnnnng commute), we kept our goodbyes brief with a hug. 

The greatest fucking hug I’ve ever received. I’m still chasing that dragon.

Things were going well. I’d given her my number, we moved from texting via social media to actually texting. We would spend evenings together texting and flirting and getting to know each other even more. 

And then the wheels fell off. I don’t know why but they did. I was so happy just to have a regular female companion to spend time with and that I thought had feelings for me. I don’t open up easily to people but it was different with her. I couldn’t stop thinking about her, talking about her to friends, I was smitten. 

I just hate that we clicked seamlessly but it was right place, wrong time for her and I. 

I just hate that it took me 13 years to find someone that I could feel those feelings for after my last crushing heartbreak and I’m back to square one.",lonely,A Sense of Hope,2022-05-31 23:01:32

17,Smooth_Clue_3585,1653987143,1,"There are only two people that really matter to me right now. My best friend and my mom. The rest of my family are in another country. 

My mom is the only family I need, but I wish I was connected to more people. I have my best friend, but she’s very popular while Im not. I understand why. I have a really hard time socializing. How do you get yourself in a group of friends without being awkward? I’m also not very good looking and I’m fairly incompetent at anything I do. In fact, i might even go o as far to say that people hated me for my incompetence, and I cant blame them.  When everyone seems like a red flag, you are the problem, after all. My bestfriend stayed with me because she’s the only who seems to tolerate me, but there are times when she would ask me if im autistic, or if there’s genuinely something wrong with me —slightly irritated, but more so concerned. I don’t think I have anything going on medically. It’s just so hard to initiate a connection with people and maintain it, but I think that’s due to a lack of social development on my part. At my job, i can hold eye contact and communicate with coworkers and customers comfortably, as long as its on script for the most part. I want to be friends with my coworkers, but i know they only talk to me because i happen to be there.

There’s no sugarcoating it. I dont have a lot of people because I never was able to make myself “attractive” in more ways than just the physical. And my lack of friends  makes me question the connection that I do have with the only people I have in my life. Is my bestfriend my bestfriend because I have no other friend? Do i feel aromantic because i never actually experienced having a guy crush on me?

Then there’s my mom. There are many times when I know Ive manipulated, emotionally abused, or left my mom. The painful memory of the time I smacked my mom’s hand away from reaching out to me because she was breaking up with her boyfriend, whom i learned to like just because he bought me a new laptop. It was an act of betrayal. Why did I do that? She needed me. She was a victim if a narcissistic boyfriend. I kept asking myself what brought me to become that selfish and backstabbing. I promised myself I wouldn’t do it again. But there were several instances thereafter where I disappointed her again, and never proved my love or loyalty. We currently have an abusive roommate, who he verbally attacks my mom. i try to speak up when he does it, but I cant. Im right there while he calls my mom a whore. She does fine defending herself as she’s indifferent to other people’s shit, but that doesnt take away the fact that Im so selfish. I have no courage. Im incompeten when it comes to proving myself. I hate it. I acknowledged it hundreds of time, I am aware. And yet, when the time comes, i never change. 

I do not understand why these two people are even here. I dont understand why my mom still loves me. I know how i treated them, how i used them so much, milked them of everything because i have no one else, and never was there for them when it counts. 
Theyre much better off if they let me go. I know it. But i dont want to let go of them because i need them. They’re the only people that matter in my life, but i failed them, especially my mom. 
Until i change myself, i deserve to be lonely. There’s a reason why i estranged. People arent comically spiteful at some randomly chosen individual: there’s something profoundly wrong with me that has led to those general patterns.
I think i know the attRibutes that have led to my lack of likeability, i just dont understand why im not changing, despite how much i am aware of my personality problems, and despite how much I want to change.",lonely,"I want to feel grateful, but i feel so alone",2022-05-31 18:52:23

I didn’t speak to anyone else. My parents are supportive enough, which I am very grateful for, but I don’t see myself talking to them anymore. All of this happened during the same time.   

I have never been a very social person, but I used to look forward to talking to my friends, sending memes, sharing highlights of the day. But all of that has vanished along with the three friendships I had.   

I want to speak to people, want to have someone to speak to at the end of the day, listen to theirs, have a human relationship to look forward to. But I just can’t. And I don’t know why.  

So, I have decided, in the best interest of myself that I have to get comfortable with being lonely, I can’t always lament over the fact that I have no one to talk to.   

I enjoy being by myself for most part, but sometimes there’s moments (like these!) when I bawl my eyes out over the fact that I have no shoulder to cry on, no one to talk to. Sometimes I feel I just need ONE PERSON who will understand &amp; stay, just bear with me. These episodes have decreased in frequency, but I want to completely eliminate them as they set me back a lot &amp; I take a lot of time to recover.

34,ventingbento,1653977842,1,"I adore A24 films. They tell such diverse and compelling stories that leave you evaluating your own life every time. Minor spoiler warning for ""The Lobster,"" highly recommend you give it a watch if you haven't already. I remember renting it on RedBox a couple years ago and I had remembered it earlier today so I rented it through Prime Video. It's message still holds up with how society treats single people and how there's pressure to be married and have children by a certain age. 

In this society, if you're single, you'll be put into this hotel where you'll have 45 days to fall in love or you'll be turned into an animal of your choosing. The main character, David, proceeds to be cheated on, feign being in love, and then finally fall in love but have it be obstructed by what their society says they should have in common. It's a film that encapsulates how romantic relationships are seemingly this huge milestone, a big goal that we all need to have to live complete lives. The premise alone describes love as a must and if not as humans, at least as animals. It's execution of it's message is solid in all aspects and the cinematography, stiff, keeps you immersed in its dystopia. The soundtrack is a bit repetitive, but it does a great job at making you feel the habit, the monotony of these social norms and constructs we perpetuate. It's also funny how one way they fix relationship problems is to assign them a child.

I'd say many of us crave the Eros kind of love. But how much of that desire is from human nature and how much of it is from how much society enforces romance as a staple for happiness? Most of my life has been driven by love. I've been in and out of relationships and I've had best friends who were the closest thing to a home. I can recall being single, in my bed, being obsessed with the idea of being with someone. Though, that's all it was, an obsession with not being alone. Thoughts like those usually don't consider a real person and more so think about a body, the concept of having someone with you, a dime piece. Sure it'd be nice, but we shouldn't let all of our happiness be defined by whether we have a partner or not. 

Anyways, I wanted to shout out this really cool film cause I don't really have anyone to talk about these things with. Hope your day/night goes swell and if you're going through a hard time, you're not alone. Do something you enjoy, even if it's something small.",lonely,"Rewatched ""The Lobster""",2022-05-31 16:17:22

it seems like everyone has someone to talk to, except for me. i can never maintain friendships, and thinking of all the friends i used to have just hurts my heart, because i don’t have the strength to reach out to them anymore. they don’t care, they’ve moved on, and i’m not important to them anymore. being stuck in home for years due to covid made me so depressed, burnt out, and feeling like i want to die. i began to isolate from so many things, and its like i’ve unintentionally drifted away from everyone. i have no energy to do anything now.

49,justathrowawaynahhh,1653972249,1,"I really don’t know how to start this, but basically, I’m really tired of being lonely, no matter how much effort I put to connect with new people and following them up. 

I don’t mind that I initiate the conversation and reach out to them first. To be fair, I have even managed to connect them on Instagram and Facebook so we can continue our conversation there in case they aren’t active on Reddit. I even managed to meet them up in person despite me living hundreds of kilometres from my place and I did fly there just to meet them up. Of course, travelling in their area is partly the reason too, but meeting them is my main motivation.   

But despite already meeting them, they don’t seem to really commit to maintain our friendship as much I do. I realized that it’s just me who would initiate it most of the time, and when I want to meet them again, they would tell me whatever excuses they have, and I tried to be empathetic with their situation. I was being empathetic because I know that some of them are already in a relationship or already married.        

However, my heart always broke when I found out that they have been hanging out with their other friends more than once, and worse, they came to my area without telling me at all. I could know that because they posted their updates on FB and IG stories. It makes me wonder how they got so much time to meet up others while they don’t really wanna meet me. And so, I started to deactivate my Facebook and Instagram accounts to stem my anxiety and depression from them.      

It also makes me realized that no one bothers to message me on other apps once I’m not on FB and IG anymore. They do know my other accounts on other apps, yet no one messaged me how are you or if I’m alright from time to time. They would only message me when they need help with their problems, but once that’s over, they would ghost me.    

And before you advised me to keep myself busy and love myself more, I literally have done both and still do so, yet that doesn’t stave off my loneliness in any way. I’m quite busy with my work (I work remotely) for the past few weeks, and I still crave for a human connection outside of work. I just want someone to genuinely hug and comfort me when I need the most, and vice versa. I know this sounds selfish, but this is what happens when I have been physically lonely for so long.       

I even visited a therapist, but it only made my depression and anxiety worse as he didn’t being empathetic with my situation and instead giving me advices that don’t work for me.       

Eventually, I start to hate the society I live in and this country overall. I really can’t believe loneliness could happen to me in a country called Malaysia. I really consider leaving this country for good if the situation got worse, but I doubt if it would get any better if I move to an another country if the society and the mentality of the people is just the same as here.      

I really wonder if there’s anyone who had their lives better and less lonely after moving abroad. At this point, I’m really tired of dealing with extreme loneliness. It’s like... I either have to live together with someone, or I live alone and become like what I have now. Why? Just why?

32M (myself) 30F (her)

When you give your all in a relationship… it can feel absolutely rewarding. Going to bed at night knowing you’re giving 100%. Knowing you just worked all week and spent your day off tending to kids, running errands and cleaning. Giving their mother alone time to decompress because you just worked 5 days and she’s had to handle that emotional labor all week. Things don’t have to be perfect… knowing I have this opportunity alone brings me happiness. 

It feels good when your actions align to your personal standards for the role you are filling. It reinforces that sense of self that you’ve worked so hard to build and maintain.

What doesn’t feel good is when your spouse, the biological parent of those kids doesn’t so much as say thank you for your sacrifices. What doesn’t feel good is when you do all these things they find something to complain about. It doesn’t feel good when you have to beg for affection and intimacy despite communicating mutually how important it was to both of you. It doesn’t feel good to know despite all the positive things you’re bringing to the table, one small slip up (in their eyes a major issue) and you’re on the couch for the night. 

I’m giving my all, to a woman and her children. I’m being stepped on, appeased until I’ve completed what they want done and discarded to the couch for the night. My needs for intimacy and affection forgotten… or at the very least omitted. This isn’t about sex, it never was for me. It’s about emotional connection and love in a household. What do you do? 

Do you walk away from the 3 kids? The kids who run up and hug you when you get home from work and tell you they love you? To those kids I am a good man. An integral part of the household.. I’ll be dead soon.. they have their entire lives ahead of them and up to this point haven’t had a male role model. To her, I feel like a resource. I don’t know if it’s all in my head. Maybe it is? Gaslighting me without a word to be said. I’m rather confident it’s not. Show appreciation to the person in your life giving all they can give. I’m at a loss for words. Tangible actions show more than your intention… I’m lost. I feel unloved, I feel unwanted.. and you’ve got me by the balls. This is emotional abuse. The emotional affairs you choose over me in my time of need sicken me. You treat your friends like they’re the ones who come home every day and feel alone laying next to you. You treat the man giving everything he has like a nuisance… because you know he won’t walk away from those kids as countless others have before. Youre exploiting the one good thing in your life.. the one who respects your boundaries. You’re selfish for not allowing yourself to experience discomfort when something he does inadvertently makes you feel anxious and instead of working through it, you kick him to the couch. You reinforce the idea that there’s no point in wanting to bring good into the household. You, are selfish. I’m no longer here for you, I’m here for the children. You lied your way into my pants, you’ve lied your way into my graces… you lied your way into having a genuinely good person to be there for the children. You ignore me and text the man who fucked you and left. You smile at the sperm donor who couldn’t give a fuck about wether his seed is happy or healthy and scowl at me. You tell me to get away from you or not to touch you and go text the man who only wants to fuck you one time to live a fantasy. Am I living a fantasy? I only want you to appreciate my doings. I want you to appreciate me. I know by leaving I wouldn’t hurt you. You stopped caring about me months ago. Where did I go wrong? I went wrong in trusting you, in trusting your words. I was misled, coerced with lies and false actions. You dangle your carrot on a stick like the cheeky high schooler “dangling his nuts”. You got what you wanted.. a martyr. I’m not a white knight… I’m a good hearted man who cares about children I’ve bonded with over the past year and a half. I’m someone you take advantage of with zero remorse. Someone you could push around and still rely on at the end of the day. God, give me strength. I’m a better man than they will ever be. Bring me peace, absolve this loneliness that consumes me and help her see the errors in her selfish, self absorbed ways. Help her see that she is driving off a good man. Help me find happiness outside of myself. Amen",lonely,Serendipity and Suffering,2022-05-31 13:58:11

71,nofri3nd,1653963898,1,"Hi everyone. I'm wondering if anyone has words of advice or can just relate to my feelings and situation.

I'm a 25 year old woman and I have one close friend who does not live near me. Other than her, I feel very alone. I live with my mom and brother but my family has never been close and I don't feel connected to any relatives. All my friendships and relationships have been co-dependent. I usually have one close friend at a time until it eventually falls apart. I have BPD tendencies and I think this plays a part in why I usually latch on to one friend at a time. 

I've always felt this way, ever since I can remember. I remember being in kindergarten and feeling that all of my friends were closer with each other. I would wonder if they actually considered me friends at all. And those feelings have never changed, I still feel insecure in the one friendship that I do have, because I know she has many other friends whereas she's my only friend.

I've moved around a lot and also struggled with severe mental health issues that have made it difficult to make healthy connections with others... but so have other people, and they still have friends. I have a good life and I'm grateful for all I have, but sometimes I wonder why I ended up this way. Why I wasn't lucky enough to have a close friend group that continued into adulthood. Why I don't have a close family with relatives who I see and talk to.",lonely,What's wrong with me,2022-05-31 12:24:58

74,Active_Yak3806,1653963066,1,"this whole thing is gonna be huge and basically a general overview of my whole situation and honestly it'd probably be a huge waste of time for anyone on the internet to read, so youve been warned. not even making a throwaway since i dont use reddit that much.

im a 15 yr old highschool boy who is probably at his loneliest point ever. how i got here is such a trainwreck but i hardly feel human anymore. ill give a brief overview of my situation.

it started about a year ago. id been living in an abusive home my whole life, and after my mom divorced my dad it only got worse since he was the source. i have plenty of issues because of the things hes done to me physically and emotionally, and they affect how i deal with people and thus why i am so alone. i dont want to blame him for why im so miserable since it is my fault, but it really has affected how i am.well around a year ago i finally got out of his custody and got some breathing room after a horrible event where i got thrown around and fought back and everything went to court. i still have to see him in family therapy. disclaimer: this isnt a sob story. i dont want pity for what happened to me, i just wanna talk about it at least. im not exactly ""fine"" now but im safe at least.

after i got out of that house i felt pretty confident and secure despite the huge baggage i was carrying and the mental trauma. this all lined up with the start of 10th grade and i got into a relationship. why? idk. i wasnt even looking for one. i just did it to do it. things were going better and so i assumed it would go well. it didnt. firstly, i ignored so many red flags that i even i was smart enough to see. i mean coming from abuse lets you see those personality traits yknow? well it was a horrible time. i got huge attachment issues and my ex was super emotionally abusive to me. i feel like i cant talk about it because it's embarrassing how bad i let myself get beat down by a girl when i was vulnerable. especially cause im a guy. well my ex dumped me when it all got to me and she realized how emotionally unstable i really am. that messed me up for a while. i realize how bad it was now and im thankful i learned, but its really affected how i judge people and relationships. mostly because i went from one abusive lifestyle to another. i felt like i got Stockholm syndrome and ran back to what was familiar. i really dont want to do that again.

so i kinda mooed through life for a while after that. i was sad and confused. i wanted a connection, even if it meant abuse. then my friends left me. all at once. one had a problem with me, and then another. and another. everyone just started disliking me. i probably did something wrong. i cant please everyone forever. but none of them stopped to tell me what was up, or explain it to me. they just left. my best friend id know for almost 10 years? gone. they all talk shit about me and i dont even talk to them anymore. theyre all friends with my ex and they all have girlfriends. at my lowest point, they all left. it destroyed me. it made me bitter and angry. i started working out constantly as an alternative to sh (since my relationship caused me to do that again) and i still do workout. its just more controlled and healthy i guess. it was a lot of anger to process but when it all calmed down i was just alone. everyone that mattered or that i had built a meaningful connection with had thrown it away in pursuit of something else. i have no one. im a total loser at school now and im glad its over. i wouldnt let it all get to me but its finally affecting me deep down.

ive tried to make new friends. i really have. ive done everything i can to not be lonely. my tiktok has grown exponentially because of my videos, i can keep plenty of snapchat streaks, i can get along with just about anyone, but i dont feel connected. everytime i talk to someone i just slowly pull away. i cut off all the connections even when i dont mean to. its like i just forget subconsciously. it wouldn't be hard to make a new friend, but i dont. im alone. and i keep staying that way. its like everyone and everything is nothing but a plot to hurt me. im starved for love or attention and i cant get it from myself because honestly i dont know how to love myself. no one has taught me. i dont have interest in my connection with people anymore. i feel emotionless and cold. its like i cant handle emotion so i ran away from it like a fucking coward. 

and the worst part about this is i feel like im in denial. i still watch those stupid girlfriend audios on youtube to fall asleep or else i just lay awake. i still wish for a genuine connection but im not willing to give up my defenses to have it. its like im waiting for some hero to be the person i finally trust again and want in my life, but no ones that good. i dont want to be hurt again. im constantly fighting against letting my defense down again because once its all gone im just a scared little kid. i dont want people to realize that so ive ran away from everyone that could be my friend and made sure everyone knows to keep their distance. ive doomed myself. i don't even know how to proceed from here. i dont know who id like to start a connection with if i decided i could let my guard down. i cant just wait for it and die cold and sad and alone. everything in my life is in order otherwise. this process of pushing everyone away had made me so much more productive. im reluctant to abandon it. but i dont know if this is what i want anymore. i dont want to be alone anymore. but i dont want to be hurt again. im just stuck.",lonely,im stuck,2022-05-31 12:11:06

80,PriorAppearance,1653959738,1,"The following is something I wrote on a mental health support website months ago. Since I'm closing my account there, I thought I'd share it here.
-----------------------------------------------------
Today I came across an article where the author explores how difficult it is to make friends over 40. Like many of these articles, the author didn't come to a solution (not that I was hoping for one, either). I'm in my mid-30s, and I found it harder once I turned 30. Online I've seen people in their 20s complain about the same thing: the difficulty of finding friends as an adult.

When someone posted this question on reddit a few months ago, one of the responses I saw was an eye-opener. It explained a lot to me, and other people's input on the subject have confirmed what these one user wrote: most people are now only looking for activity partners. They're looking for someone or people to play a sport with; something casual, temporary, and superficial. Because most people are busy and have established friendships formed during their schooling, I understand now that friendship is not something most people are looking for or even have a desire to maintain. They don't want to hear about your troubles, they don't want to be there for you. People are now just a means to an end, and that end is overcoming boredom.

Years ago I noticed that ghosting was a thing online, and then I realized why. Just as hookup culture has taken precedence over committed relationships, that mentality has shifted to platonic relationships too. People are addicted to new and are easily bored. I've been trying to understand it all, but I'm realizing there is no one cause for this. I believe hyper-individualism and consumerism play big factors in this problem. What are the others? The scourge of positive psychology - which has been a cancer in modern society for the last 20 years - might be another one. It led to toxic positivity: no drama, no toxic people in your life. If you're dealing with hardship or depression, you're a toxic person that needs to be removed from people's lives because you're just bringing them down. See how positive psychology is a problem?

Even though the lockdowns of the past two years gave inflicted on society the sting of loneliness, ultimately society has failed to appreciate how serious a problem this is. I'm not aware of any statistics regarding loneliness, but I estimate in any given Western nation, around 40% of the population is suffering from loneliness. Lonely people are the minority, and clearly an insignificant one at that. Loneliness is not a problem for most people, so this is why I believe this will never be solved - and that is the god-awful inconvenient truth.",lonely,The bitterness of loneliness,2022-05-31 11:15:38

101,CatMewMeow,1653951663,1,"Just needed to do some venting about things going on lately. Quite a long post, but I just need to get it off my chest.

I only have about four 'friends' currently, only online friends.  All of them, aside from one, I've known for a minimum of three years. Two of them I've known for closer to maybe six.  I used to be super close with all of them, at one point. We would play games together constantly, always be in voice chat, all that good stuff. Things were good. I love my friends, even if they're people I've never met in real life. So I always made sure they knew I was there if they ever needed anything at all throughout those years. And boy was I there. All of them would constantly vent to me or come looking for advice about something. I didn't mind. I love being there for anyone and everyone, offering a shoulder to lean on or just someone to listen. I guess perhaps I wasn't paying as much attention throughout the years, or I just didn't need to vent to them myself often, fearing I would just be bothering them. But lately I've noticed just how much they aren't there for me.

The past eight months have been fairly rough for me. Up until a month or two ago, I didn't say much of anything to anyone. Nobody checked up on me, either. One or two messaged every few weeks. But only to vent to me or talk about themselves, never to ask why I suddenly dropped off the face of the Earth. Despite not really feeling like I could handle their problems on top of my own, I always replied. I was always there because I cared and wanted to help them. When I started talking more to them again, I was desperately reaching out for someone. Anyone. I really needed someone to be there for me, as I had done for them time and time again. But none of them seemed to care. They didn't take notice of me suddenly messaging them ten times more than I ever have in the past, trying to start any conversation with them. Sometimes I'd get an answer, sometimes they'd just not respond to my message period.

Now, I understand people get busy with life. They can't always reply. However, it would be literal weeks to months with no answer. Funny thing is, though, I'd see them online still constantly. I'd even see one in particular sitting in voice chats with his other friends for up to nine hours a day, every single day for a week straight. I know for a fact that three of them have no job. The same three don't attend any sort of school. The same three hardly ever leave the house. So just how busy can one get in those circumstances? Feels much more like they're just ignoring me purposefully. None of them ever message first. Always me. When I do get an answer, I hardly get more than two word replies. Then five minutes later they just suddenly stop replying and never reply again until the next time I message.

I've really needed someone to vent to, especially the past month here. But none of them were ever there for me. They just slammed the door in my face. Only one even knows what has been happening with me lately. Because they don't ask. They don't give me a chance to talk about myself. They always jump straight into talking about themselves and complaining about every little thing going wrong for them. The one friend only knows because I got tired of being ignored and just straight up told her one day. They have no problem coming to me and sitting and messaging for five hours straight, with three paragraphs in each reply. When they need me. When I need them? Sorry, can't sit and chat for more than five minutes or give more than four word max replies. I'm not looking for a novel of a reply. But I want to be given more than just ""Dang that sucks, sorry"" or ""You'll get through it."" 

None even reassure me that they'll always be there for me lately, either. The one friend that knows pretty much only told me she knows I'll be able to get through it, then proceeded to start talking about herself. Then stopped replying altogether four minutes later. I had actually finally brought up how I was feeling about them not replying to two of them. One said I was right, she's sorry, she won't do it again. She was back at it again a week later. The other also agreed and apologized. That's about it. I told one of the same two about it again recently, how nothing had changed. He ended up getting pissy with me, complaining about his own problems, blaming me, then essentially saying he wouldn't care if I was alive or not. He even told me that he knows how I feel, and feels the same way with his friends? If you truly do, then why are you turning around and doing that same shit to someone else, knowing how awful it feels? This is also the one that was constantly talking with other friends in voice chat. Guess he liked those friends more, despite always complaining about them to me.

I'll try and wrap up this incredibly long post now. I'm just so sick and tired of this all. Of feeling like my apparent 'friends' only ever message when they need something from me. Of feeling like they don't care about me, and never did. I've pretty much given up on messaging most of them whatsoever at this point. Not that they ever message to begin with, so there isn't much of a choice there. I tell myself that I'm done with all of them. But I worry that I may just end up going back to them, should they ever actually message again.

Plus I don't have anyone in my life that I have romantic feelings for, or who has those feelings for me, so it doesn't matter at this point.

Nevertheless, there are things about being in a relationship that I long for, even knowing that I'm not prepared to strive toward them.  After all, I can long for things that I can never have, can't I?  I can long for things that aren't good for me, or wise.  I can long for things that I once had but will never be the same.  Being within my reach is not a prerequisite for longing.

I want to be able to make a woman feel comfortable and safe.  Not protect her, necessarily; I don't expect her to be helpless.  I only want to give her a space where she can feel at ease, be herself, not have to have her guard up constantly.  I can offer her comfort when she's stressed, in whatever form pleases her.  Back rubs, playing with her hair, making a drink, alone time, a simple hug or a snuggle session with the TV on.

Honestly, there's not much more to it than that.  I'd like to sing to her if she doesn't mind my singing.  Of course I'd appreciate the same kind of consideration when I'm in need of comfort.  But then I start to get into the varying needs and expectations of people in a relationship, and that's not really the point.  I'm not in a relationship or trying to be.  It's only that I miss being able to offer that place of peace and safety, nearly every day.  I do what I can to bring that to the people around me, to make the world a brighter place.  But there's very little one can do for strangers in that department, and my longing goes unfulfilled.

126,brightNebula99,1653936638,1,"I am that chubby disgusting, awful nerd people go away from in sitcoms. As a child I had very different interests- recreational math, science, movies- to the point of reading up multiple critics. I hated sports. I naturally became segregated from other children my age. I was always good at studies so that kind of pushed other children away from me because I was a bore. 

In my teenage I overheard my parents talking about how I look below average but since I am good at bookish stuff, I would probably do okay in life. It didn't come as a shock or anything to be honest. I knew how I looked so it made sense. Even in groups, I always used to make self deprecating jokes. Coz that's all I could think of. Anytime I hear somebody laughing, my first instinct was to check if something is wrong with me. Maybe I spilled something without me knowing or maybe they're laughing about how big of a loser I am. If I could go near them, maybe I could hear. Some girls made fun of me in front of me, some behind my back, some made fun of my masculinity. I never replied back because honestly deep down I know what they're making fun of is true.

Next came college. People are a bit mature here so they don't degrade you in front of you. I also made some friends. There was this guy who I clicked with since we shared a lot of common morals. I used to good academically and so did he. We quickly became great friends. We would be together a lot of times but people would talk to him / ask him about theirs doubts more often even though I was right there. One thing I am good at is studies so a lot of times it would so happen that he would be stuck, he would check with me and then I would tell other people how to do X or Y. This always used to be the case without any exception. He would tell me it could be because they're intimidated by me.

Then the sophomore year I made a girl friend (the space is intentional). Like every other girl I developed a crush on her. I knew it was never going to amount to anything but the more I talked to her the more I felt I found my only hope. She was ambitious and most importantly the only person who saw something interesting in me- beyond being smart at bookish stuff. She told me how mature and thoughtful I am and how she likes talking to me and sharing about her life with me. For the first time in my life- I thought no, I deserve love too. 

I decided to work on myself physically- I lost 10 kilos in 7 months that year and now look like an average joe- except for my disgusting face. After 2 years of knowing her, I asked her out. Her exact reply was ""it isn't black or white"" and it ended there. About 5 months ago, the guy friend told me how he developed feelings for her and if it would be okay if he asked her out. They got together. When I asked her about what she told me when I asked her out she said, ""Really sorry I wasn't completely honest- I was really scared of losing you since I have never heard of somebody being friends after something like that.""

The guy friend I mentioned also wants to talk to me frequently. All I can think of is how lucky he is. His father is well settled. He has gone out of country frequently and has visited a lot of places. Me on the other hand have literally seen only 3 different cities- my hometown, my parents' hometown and a family trip we made with our extended family. 

The thing is my family has never done great financially. I am grateful we had a roof over our head but I have seen my Mom lie to the milkman about how ""we need to go to the ATM since there's no cash at home so she would pay next time he's around"". There was no money in the account also since Dad was running behind on one of his paychecks. Mom always switched between only 2 of her good clothes and wore patched clothes in the house- stuff like that. Dad would always work hard so he could pay for my tuition. 

Luckily I graduated last year and joined a big N company as a software developer. Things are good now. However my mom recently told me that Dad has been on medication for depression for over a decade now since he was always worried about his family's future. She told me she's telling me this now since he's no longer worried about me so the doctor has adjusted the dosage quite a bit. It was almost as if I can never escape this cycle of misery.

I find some solace in seeing how happy my parents are. How I can now buy them stuff they couldn't afford earlier. I feel like I need to make more and more out of my career and that's the only thing I can do in my life. My worth is tied to how much money I make. I have interviews for other big companies lined up next month. I feel guilty about sleeping since I so much to prepare for. I don't know what I would if I failed because if I can't be the good at even this one thing, my existence is worthless. Dad having to take pills, mom making ends meet was all for nothing.

I talk about finance because honestly it shows- he dresses sharper than me naturally. I never owned more than 5 pairs of clothes until recently. Money brings along with it a kind of confidence nothing else does. He has more stories to share about places he visited, restaurants he tried, stuff he bought etc etc. Stuff that makes you interesting. I am a dud.

I told myself I can be friends with her for 5 months. Every single day has been miserable than previous. I recently told her I need some space from her. She replied, ""Yeah you don't have to explain yourself. You think I don't know how you feel but I do. I have only a few people in my life so don't wanna lose those I feel would be there forever. I am okay with some space between us but just don't go away...""

I am broken- more broken than I was before. I can no longer carry on. All the stuff I joked about myself- they were true. Nobody's going to look at me twice. I don't deserve to have a companion, period. My only worth is earning money because I can never be good at anything else. Me being good at that one thing is also doubtful. If I am not good at that either, does that mean my life is useless and I was an unnecessary burden for my parents and they would have been better off without me?",lonely,"I am so broken at this point, I don't think I can carry on any longer",2022-05-31 04:50:38

129,AlreadyFatGandhi,1653935150,1,"Hi guys! I () have been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 1.5 years. Thankfully, I was able to trust some of my friends about it, so for a year, some of them made it not so terrible. I am also attending therapy for 9 months now, but it doesn't seem like it's working.

After all that, in the past few weeks, I have been experiencing something which I never wanted to. Some of my friends are slowly leaving me. One of those friends, I once actually viewed as my best friend in the school I'm currently in. She listened to me, hugged me, and said that she loves me. Now, none of this happens and while I can see what my problems are, I really don't want to stop talking with anybody I was this close to. Today, I gave this girl an opportunity to leave me by messaging him and telling him some of my thoughts.

Even though I'm somewhat prepared for her leaving me, I still want to have somebody I can connect to this much again. I don't want to be in a relationship in this mental state, but some love would make me better. Also, I'm thinking about girls, since I'm heterosexual and kinda feel weird when boys hug me (however, knowing how much I need a hug, I don't reject anybody who's a decent person). I also want her not to have a boyfriend (how ironic) and to have truly endless patience for me. These are the conditions in which I imagine a kind of love without boundaries, while staying out of a relationship. I wouldn't tell those conditions to anybody in person, but these are my thoughts. I still have 2 woman friends hugging me, but one of them has a boyfriend and the other doesn't have endless patience for me (only hugs me on special occasions, sometimes looks weird at me when I talk about my feelings). I may well be a bit selfish, but my sense of security is currently expected to take a huge blow.

I have one woman in mind, however I rarely talk to her, but she seems nice and also looks like somebody who is not afraid of physical touch. She is currently my best chance if I think correctly. I go to a top-level high school in Hungary, so most of the students are genuinely smart and around 95% of them continue to university. Judging by this, I think that when you're surrounded by smart people, their emotional intelligence should be top notch aswell. Do you think that I can get a chance in the coming weeks or months to have a closer connection with somebody like this? If not, then what do you think I should do?

I hope it wasn't just unnecessary venting and I can get real answers. People telling me that they're backing me would be f*ing great, but what I need the most are some advices on this situation.

Thank you for your answers!!!",lonely,Endless potential of love,2022-05-31 04:25:50

The pandemic caused us all to spend more time in front of screens than ever, and that might cause many more people to deal with loneliness.

**Here’s what I’ve learned (so far):**

1. Just getting outside on a consistent basis to walk around, visit a cafe, or read in the park has helped me to warm up to being around strangers.

2. Rushing into going out to large gatherings has caused me to feel really uncomfortable.

3. I tend to lie down and watch Youtube videos for way too long. I feel like this will be hurtful longterm, since at times this almost feels like turning your brain off and absorbing whatever the algorithm serves you.

**Here’s what I’ve learned (so far):**

1. Just getting outside on a consistent basis to walk around, visit a cafe, or read in the park has helped me to warm up to being around strangers.

2. Rushing into going out to large gatherings has caused me to feel really uncomfortable.

3. I tend to lie down and watch Youtube videos for way too long. I feel like this will be hurtful longterm, since at times this almost feels like turning your brain off and absorbing whatever the algorithm serves you.

Have any of these worked for you? Any other ideas I should add? I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

I’ve also been thinking about newer ideas to improve my social awkwardness/loneliness since I started noticing these issues. [I came up with this](https://beta.joinjoyfully.com).

I am dissatisfied with my life. I have a handful of friends, sure, but I'm convinced my connection with them is weak. They all seem to have someone they connect with better than me, every time I hear about a friend's best friend or significant other, it gets my mood down and my stomach hurts. I don't know why I feel this way.

It seems that everyone around me, everyone I see, has someone they're crazy in love with, whether platonically or romantically. I make fun of it all the time. But the truth is, I'm lonely. It depresses me that I will never have the connection that people have.

It's not like it's easy for me to make friends with people either. I am very shy and socially awkward (perhaps even socially anxious), and even when I do make friendships, I struggle to maintain them. I put up emotional walls yet care too much, push people away unintentionally yet desire for someone to care, and I suppose that turns people off. It confuses me how normal people can do that and I cannot. I feel so alien, so...not normal. What if I never belonged here on this earth?

I guess that's enough of my story. I hope there's someone out there that feels the same as me. I don't like being so alone.",lonely,I'm convinced I will never have a connection with anyone.,2022-05-31 03:10:57

I just got my Computer Science degree this month. But I still have a question, which I do not understand. People said life is meaningful. I didn't have parents. I didn't have anyone understand me when I grew up. During these years, I barely finished this degree with my sadness, emptiness, and loneliness. 

When people see you are not a person who has many friends, they won't talk to you because they think a successful person will help them success. Thus, I went to church, and they all said I was a bad person because I wasn't successful in school. 

I had no family member at all during grew up and after, and no one understands my feeling, loneliness, and emptiness. Everyone in school or outside of the school was kind of like the one who want to be rich and successful. They just want to stay away from me to avoid the ""problem"". I have been thinking about I should change myself to have more friends, so my grade will be better. That didn't work, and everyone, including students, club members, and club professors, and teachers treated me as a problem because they always see my sad and lonely face.

&amp;#x200B;

 In the end, I dropped out of college and wanted to learn codes to get a job. After I found out I love coding, I switch my degree to be CS and went back to the college and finished my degree. I say nothing was changed. I was still alone.

I just want to ask. How can someone, like me, who grew up and live alone altogether and still live in normal life?

it started off with me being bullied by a girl. after awhile, we started fighting, physically. like brawling. it took place weirdly at my primary school, specifically the small field next to one of the girl's bathrooms. I ended up accidentally killing her because she was choking me to death and I had to do something about it. I was breaking down, I really didn't know what to do. then, a guy came. apparently he saw what happened. he really didn't say much, probably said nothing if i recall correctly and he helped me. for some reason we hid the body in a couch lol.

anyhow, after that we rested somewhere abit and we realised the girl came back to haunt me as a vengeful spirit. me and him were kinda hungry so we went to buy food at some random stall. he was sitting on a stool and i was buying the food. i realised she was there in my peripheral and he got a glimpse of her, i had a feeling he was getting uncomfortable. for some reason it prompted me to shield his view from her. so i stood infront of him and crouched saying ""are you okay?"" he then quickly stood up and walked away whilst saying ""you always do this huh?"" 

we got in his car and we drove for awhile. it was quiet but I enjoyed his presence, it felt comfortable. he drove somewhere to get an exorcism done on me. before getting out of the car he handed me something, to protect me during the exorcism then yadda yadda

the dream itself is not that important, it's just for context but I really liked the dream. I don't know, it felt nice eventhough he was cold and quiet. I guess it reflected abit of what I want. I want someone that could help and protect me even when I messed up or feel helpless. because I've always been that figure in everybody else's lives. I don't really react much to bad situations so I'm often the only one calm and collected. if somebody messes up I'd be the one to clean their mess up then help them get back up on their feet.

Otherwise, I have to bottle it up as to appear strong and masculine. Crying in front of other guys is a ticket to being gay, and in front of women shows weakness. I have an emotionless mother, so that only leaves opportunity from a partner

I’m 20 and only just asked for a girls number for the very first time a month ago. I knew that because this was my first that I’d become attached very easily. I’m attached and she doesn’t know it. I would never put that on her, nor do I want to portray all the emotions I’m supposed to hide. I’ll hide the fact that I want affection. I’ll pretend that I don’t need to be told I’m handsome, funny, or smart. I’ll sit emotionless just because I like to be around her.

We’ve been on two dates and I enjoy the fact that she initiates a hug at the end of them as I’ve never gotten that before. I’m excited for the day I get to hold her hand, but I won’t show that I’m needy or desperate for it. I want to love and be loved.

I thought that maybe she wanted to hold my hand at certain points during our last date. I felt semi bad for hiding my emotion as much as I had, so I thought to text her about it. I don’t know if I had worded it poorly or just came off more serious than I intended. I texted her, “I don’t think I’ve really shown you affection on our dates, but I want to change that. I would like to ask you to go to the movies once again, but also ask to hold your hand.”

I’ve been mistaken to show emotion. She replied that she would like to go out, but she isn’t looking for anything serious right now. I only feel bad that I’m afraid I made her uncomfortable for asking to hold her hand. However, I’ll sit emotionless just so I can get to hold her hand one day.

181,Limejuicelemonjuice,1653906728,1,"Hi I’m new to this forum,
I’m a lonely 22-year old (lesbian) woman, and no one I’ve met understands my romantic loneliness. They always tell me to “just keep busy”. Additionally, they don’t understand that friendship is different from romance and not a replacement. When I listen to podcasts about being single, they always talk about it as if it’s a “break” in an otherwise romantic life, but for me it’s been my whole life so that kind of advice just makes me feel even worse. I’ve tried everything and I’ll keep trying, but it’s exhausting. Is anyone else a perpetual single?

Chintu : Hmm so you need friends, or have shitty friends then you have come to the right place, order your new friend now and get 5 years of luck for free. Now my partner mintu will tell about the friend you are gonna get 

Mintu: well so the friend you are gonna get is 17 years old and it's name is Humai. Well he's funny ( maybe not )

He likes to learn languages, well he knows Hindi and Urdu but he wanna start reading novels and it's hard, like really compared to English. He will start off with some short stories and all. He started learning Norwegian, French and Farsi, a Lil bit off dutch too. تم دیوانے ہے اور کچھ نہیں یارو( it's not farsi, it's urdu ) 

You can rant about anything, he can listen to it and give shitty advice 

Well he share lame memes tooo

He likes to talk about religions even though he knows lil about religions. Basically, he knows about abrahamic faiths more compared to other religions

He is preparing for the SAT and might prepare for APs like self study, if you have advice on college, majors and stuff help this poor guy. He's 17 and still has no idea what he wants to be 

He likes to do origami, Sketching he recently started doing both of them. So, he sucks a lot in it. I wanna have some more cool hobbies. Suggest some hobbies for me 

He might learn to cook as well, it's cool tbh, well he wants to move to usa. So, just wanted to be independent I guess but is not independent. Every thing is done by his mum from washing clothes to cooking

He reads novels, he tried reading Hindi and Urdu novels but heck it's hard, I think he might wanna improve it or start off reading something simple before moving on to something complex. He did read some English novels though. He has started a lil time ago. So, he didn't read many. He will be having holidays. So, he will be on a reading spree. You can suggest some 

He likes to listen songs and podcasts, his taste is real stupid, it goes from pop to classic in no time. He listend hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi, hebrew songs a lot 

He likes to watch movies and series. So suggest some, rn i am watching 2 broke girls and American dad ( he even forgot the name)

She's the *only* one I've enjoyed talking to so much and connected with on such a deep level. Instant connection, mutually expressed. 

Neither of us kept it secret we like each other, at risk of sounding like a schoolgirl, a lot. Talked about some deep shit, acted all cute, and I want(ed?) so bad to call her my gf already but wanted to voice/video chat to get to know her on a more personal level before jumping that gun. 

She readily agreed to doing stuff over vc... Then went MIA for hours until like 4am with a pretty good excuse about why she disappeared. Cool, we agree to try again the next day. Again, for hours leading up to and afterwards she's radio silent. Messages later saying she'd slept a long time after smoking weed and that it knocks her out. Alright, shit happens. But tonight we had plans for a third attempt and once again she was nowhere to b e found. Haven't heard from her this time yet as to why but I'm pretty upset at this point.

I'd be led to simply think she isn't interested, but she had been love bombing me all the other times. I'd be led to think she's a catfish and that's why she won't vc, but her pics didn't turn up anything in reverse search and everything about her seems so legit and her personality/interests/life story etc too elaborate for me to really think it's made up.

I’ve probably had like 2 people ask me out in my life. people i didn’t know though. it’s difficult for me to have friendships or have a relationship because i have always felt very detached from other people. i just haven’t been able to form a serious connection with another person. i feel out of place. I’ve been told multiple times in my life by family and strangers that i am more beautifully physically compared to other girls. i don’t really believe it though and don’t think guys are that interested in me because i’m ugly. really sucks any ounce of confidence from me.

198,WoaOaOaOhOohhhh,1653893708,1,"There really is no solution here. I’m just genuinely scared of what I’d do if I didn’t write all this down somewhere. But as of today, I’ve lost everyone and everything

Around this time 3 years ago was the last time I felt like my life wasn’t in shambles. 2 years ago I had a falling out with my mom, and she gave the one sided story to the rest of the family, leaving me not able to defend myself. The whole thing was basically about how controlling she was and about how she would go extreme lengths to find things to yell at me about. May be cliche, but that kickstarted severe anxiety and trust issues in me because my relationship hasn’t been and likely won’t be the same. 

During this time I had been having issues with school, the administrators spam sent my parents emails saying I was at risk of not graduating, and they’d change the reason every email, attendance, grades, all the way up to the day before my graduation where they emailed saying I had an “outstanding debt”
 (it was 6 fucking dollars from an ID card they forced students to buy like 2 years prior)

I had to fight to prove that I wasn’t slacking off in class, against a “buggy administration email” (their words) and it was harder because we were in lockdown so things like attendance and due dates couldn’t be proven physically.

On top of that I was severely overweight, had a very low self esteem because of years of being called autistic (I’m not) by my classmates. My girlfriend (I’ll call C) at the time was way out of my league, which many guys were also mad about so they’d bully me and flirt with her. She was loyal, and so kind. She helped me through my moms shit and my dog passing away. We had been best friends for years and I had helped her through a few toxic relationships. For a time she was all I had, but even she and I had problems. We were both hard headed, super anxious, and loved being right. It was those reasons we eventually after 2 1/2 years of being together broke up, but still stayed very close friends. 

After our breakup I wanted to focus on bettering myself. It was really hard at first but with C still supporting me, and some unhealthy dieting practices I managed to lose 110lbs and gain a bit of confidence in myself. 

I had also gotten a job that I loved, and was dead set on changing into someone who everyone didn’t hate. At work I was respected by my peers, and was looked to for guidance by almost everyone. I had even met a girl who was an actress in some Amazon shows, and she helped me get into a few shows myself (mostly doing BG). She and I became friends almost immediately after seeing each other for the first time, and eventually started dating. Sounds great right? Having been relatively miserable for the previous few years I thought I was finally experiencing happiness. 

Over time I noticed at work, the General manager would promote people who didn’t deserve it at all, and ignore those who did. I liked my position as a trainer, and didn’t want a managerial position. I just wanted to travel to new opening locations and teach other people on how to use the machines, how to cook the food, ect. The manager of my store promised me that he would make that happen, all I had to do was go through a training phase myself and in a few months they’d disbatch me whenever a new location came about. 4 months into this “training” (which was 50% doing the bitch work nobody else wanted to do and 50% coming in on days I wouldn’t be available or canceling other plans to come in), a kitchen manager slipped up and told me that you can’t be a traveling trainer till you’re 21. (I was 19). I was basically just used as a bitch and got paid less than everyone else to do it. They held the traveling trainer position over my head to keep me there doing it. I quit that day.

I started focusing on the new found passion for acting and film, and started hanging out with the girl (who we’ll call E). I met all her friends, went to different sets with her, and over time she became a big part of my life and I, hers. But 3 months into dating at a Christmas party she got very drunk and cheated on me, while I was standing 5 feet away. In front of a whole room of our closest friends. It was absolutely humiliating. So many people commented asking if I was okay with it, which obviously I wasn’t. We broke up the next day, and she went on to emotionally manipulate another guy in our group who liked her. She’d lead him on with date ideas and when he’d ask she’d say she still likes me. I tried to stay friends with her but after I found out she was talking shit about me to our friends I lost it. And with her I lost my acting friends, cause they had known E for years longer and anything she told them had more merit than anything I had to say. They also just weren’t interested in talking to me anymore, which to each their own but damn it hurt. The acting work also got significantly more dry with all my connections having just left. So I had to get another job as a fry cook that I absolutely despise. I’m fucked around with by everyone else because they’ve been there longer, and yes I know the difference between friendly banter and genuine hatred. I knew both very well.

But once again, C was there to help me through it. Months of bad decisions and substance abuse later brings us to May 6th. Since the thing with E, C and I had gotten a lot closer again and my feelings for her grew back. I loved her just as much as I did when we first started dating. We both grew as people in a few years and a lot of the problems we once had just weren’t an issue anymore. We realized it was all just us being childish. May 6th was the day we were going to hang out for her birthday. I canceled a Film I was going to do in another state to stay. I was gonna ask her out again that day. But she canceled on me, she already had plans with her parents. Which is completely fine. But after that she stopped talking to me as much. Got distant. Stopped hanging out altogether. One night it became too much and I got mad and we fought about her distance. I had my suspicions but she finally confirmed that she had been blowing me off because she’d been living with her new boyfriend since her birthday.

I shut down after that. Days of doing nothing but staring at walls, hoping anything would bring my life to an end without me having to do it myself. Until C texted me again last Saturday. She told me she thought about what I had said in our argument, she had broken up with her boyfriend, and that she wanted me to come to her parents house where she previously lived cause she felt terrible. Now I felt terrible because I didn’t want to be the cause of her being unhappy. I stayed the night and at one point she said she needed to go back to his house to get some things and that I could come wait in the car. I did and everything went fine, we got back watched some movies until we fell asleep in each other’s arms. I finally thought I had a chance to show her that I can still be a good boyfriend, and that we could be happy together again. 4 days later on my way home from the store I see her car in front, at like 11PM. I messaged her just asking how her day was, trying to act like I didn’t know what was up. It’s been 3 days with no response. I’ve known her for 6 years. Been through hell with her, and now that she was the only thing in my life worth living for, she’s gone

My moms family, gone
My dads family, doesn’t invite me to things (and I’ve asked)
E’s gone
My friends from my first job, gone
My acting friends and connections, gone
My motivation, gone

That’s not even mentioning all the minor shit that’s happened in the past 3 years, car accidents, medical issues, many fights.

212,Magnificent-howl,1653888752,1,"sorry if this makes no sense, it's 1:30 am and I'm writing this on my phone.

touch starvation is pain. one time, a girl put her hand on mine because she wanted me to feel how cold it was, and I crushed so hard on her they I literally dreamed about her for the next week. I know that the only solution is to, like, find someone who wants to hug, but that comes with some challenges. pretty much everyone in my friend group has agreed that we're not emotionally prepared for relationships, and I know that I personally tend to take on much more emotional responsibility than I can bear in relationships. however, I'm certainly not the only one whose complained about being starved for touch in my friend group, so you'd think the answer is pretty darn obvious. however, I really don't trust myself not to develop feelings in a situation where I'm having physical contact with a friend (see: the example I gave earlier). 

plus, I've already got a strange relationship with my friends. every close friendship I've ever had was because I was the only one willing to put up with their bullshit and expend the unreasonably high amount of emotional resources they demand. I've become a husk of a human multiple times for these people, and when I try to establish boundaries to regain my sense of self, they always end up distancing themselves from me until we never talk again. my longest running friendships are the ones in which I talk to them the least. even in those, I still feel like I'm only desired because I'm useful, because I can edit for their video projects, or program for their robotics teams, or help them with their calculus questions. it makes for a very lonely experience. I don't feel like I'm a meaningful person for my own sake, I only feel like I'm meaningful because I'll let others use me, often more than I should. so although I have more friends now than I used to, I feel more alone than ever. 

god... I wish I didn't constantly feel like I needed a hug.",lonely,"""how can I feel abandoned, even when the world surrounds me?""",2022-05-30 15:32:32

I will hang out with friends and everyone will be having a good time and stuff but I just don’t feel apart of it. It’s like I’m a ghost watching the living but not actually alive. Like I spent a whole 2 weeks trying to plan a day together and my friends and I were hanging in my basement and once everyone started showing up I just wanted them to leave. I couldn’t stand to be around them and just wanted to be left alone. 

I hung out with family last week and no one said more than a few sentences to me the whole time I was at this party. I sat away from everyone and just observed like I normally do. When I did get a conversation started I just wanted it to end. Eventually I left early and I just felt alone. 

I don’t know why I’m like this I want to be around people and be normal and socialize like a regular human being but once I do get put in these situations I feel almost nothing and even a little distain for those around me.

264,melancholywh0re,1653868203,1,"my boyfriend of 5 months dumped me. we were fine until literally one day we weren’t. he said he “needed a break”. didn’t really explain why. over the last few days, he said it was the distance between us (he’s in TX, i’m in IL). he said over and over i didn’t do anything wrong. it wasn’t my fault. he thought we rushed into things too quickly. and then the kicker. he said he didn’t think we had a connection. 

five months. we were together for five fucking months. now he tells me after nearly half a year together that he didn’t feel a connection. 

i feel numb. i feel betrayed. lied to. at 28 years old, he was my first love. my first boyfriend. i shared things with him i never told anyone. and now…he’s shattered my life. 

everyday it’s like i have ptsd. i’ve od’d several times this week. i barely eat or drink. i don’t have friends anyway or a car, so i just sleep. haven’t had energy to work. i don’t function anymore. 

i literally, physically feel in pain all the time now. the kind you need morphine for. that’s how much this trauma has physically manifested for me. i am in immense pain. 

the stupid thing is, as much as i hate him, i love him. i will always love him. but i can’t even look at him. we’ll never be friends. i don’t know how to live without him. i just want to curl up and die. 

i just needed to vent. so full of rage and grief. i feel like it will never end.

280,Original_Ad_1103,1653863092,1,"I have *no* friends. I sit in 8 of my classes, all of my classes, and I don’t talk to anyone. I moved recently and back when I was in my old hs I had a friend group, I talked with everyone in my classes and I was sociable, people actually came up and interacted with me, being the first ones to start their conversations. But in my new school, I have no social life, I sit alone at lunch. I know why I had friend’s in that school, it’s because I grew up with them.

My online life is also dead, when I still keep in touch with my old friends, but barley. I’m the first one to send a text. They never text first. I feel forgotten. I recently deleted every messaging social media I have (snap, ig, etc) fuck them, if they don’t wanna message me fine

I just exist, I sit and nobody acknowledges me, nobody looks at me. I feel so sad whenever I see other people talking together or hanging out. It makes me feel empty. I WANT TO talk to people, but I CAN’T. I’m so lonely, I just want a social life like I had back in my hometown.

I have NOT TALKED to a SINGLE HUMAN BEING in my school FOR 2 YEARS. NOT even EYE CONTACT!

NOBDOY! I’ve NEVER HAD a chat LONGER THAN 5 WORDS with another PERSON! LITERALLY!

Isolation. Social Alienation. IS NOT GOOD. I beginning to resent my parents, I hate other people, and hate my current position. I didn't have anyone I trust right now nor do I feel like there‘s anything I can do. I look into my future and only saw more agony, isolation, and anxiety. Sitting alone in my house EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY during summer break. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I’m sitting in my house right now just screaming. Every single hour. IM SO FUCKING LONELY.

I’m a loner and everyone’s avoiding me. So, better for them to stick with the status quo. When college comes around, I don’t know what’ll happen, I’m so used to isolating myself that that's what I did all of freshman year, and that’s what I’ll do next year, and the next, and the next. I should’ve never moved here. 

When the unfairness of it all and alone got to me I lash out alone at home. And when I lash out I’m punished a little by my isolation and left. 

I'm not going to lie, the loneliness and unfairness of it all is slowly making me numb, I’m crying less and less, feeling less and less. At a certain point you grow numb to it. 

This is me writing , just writing, I feel like throwing out my thoughts — this is a weird time. As I sit here. A ton of sadness, grief, but not depression, I’m not suicidal, I’m afraid of death actually. All of this began during the beginning of my first year lonely, so isolated, etc. It began as a creeping thought in the back of my head 1/4 of the school year in. 

Right now, my current position, existence, is shit to me —how I feel that I am in eternal suffering, in infinite directions in infinite realities. Yet these realities are fake — artificial, induced by thought, how everything connects, yet its all so far apart. That I could just stop it through my own will.

Every single fucking day, thinking of good &amp; bad memories, all in Middle School. That was the LAST FUCKING TIME I actually spoke to someone my age. Another friend. People acknowledged me. I’m sitting here writing this, alone, at home, in my room. FUUUUUCCCK IM SO LONELYYYYY!!!

It is not good for me right now (like it ever is)… but anyway . . . My best friend, my only close friend who shared, experimented, laughed, took chances with &amp; appreciated me more than any friend who “passed on” in my book. I mean we were FRIENDS. When him &amp; I first were friends, well I finally found someone who was like me: who appreciated me &amp; shared very common interests. And then I felt content. And now that I’ve “moved on” I feel so lonely, without a friend. Oh well, maybe he’ll come around when I see him again, I hope. 

A lot on the past though. How it reacts to the present &amp; the future, or rather vice versa. I wonder how/when I got so fucked up with my mind, existence, problems. But I know when. 

I have a mental breakdown everyday, I cry everyday home alone, externally and internally. On the last day of school, May 27th, was the first day I cried on the bus. Someone looked over at me, asked me if I’m ok. I said yes, and so they just assumed it was allergies. If I hadn’t move to this shithole of a place, I wouldn’t be so awful, my grades would be sky-high. I’d still be talking to my friends. 

I see the people at school —some good, some bad —I see how different I am (aren’t we all you’ll say) I see peers having fun, friends, LIVES. I don’t have a dedicated friend, I don’t have any friends. It makes me all so sad.! 

The reality that you’re just gonna sit in your house, nobody to talk at all. You can’t even see another fucking human being, let alone interact, especially your age. For the whole summer, that’s worse than just being in school and having nobody to talk to. Or maybe it isn’t, I don’t know. But that’s my reality now.",lonely,I never made any friends,2022-05-30 08:24:52

282,platineandy,1653862247,1,"(Warning: This is more like a catarsis for me, I'm trying to rationalize my feelings of impending doom, you can take this as a trigger warning as many of the stuff I will say here may make you reflect on YOUR situation)

Ugh... where do I start, first of all, this is a throwaway, no real reason, I just don't want people to track me down or smth idk...

I've been lonely for some time now, 7 years more or less, I mean I have my family, and friends, and that's great, I mean it, I know some don't even have that. But you know it's not the same. I haven't had no one to share my feelings with for a long time, I want to love and be loved, and I think that everyone wants that, that's the one common denominator, love and be loved, but why is it so hard?

I do remember, not long ago, I was full of confidence, when I was about 13 or 14 years old I would approach girls that I liked and just tell them what I felt, but that was around the time when the rejections started. I think that for most guys, this can derive in two things, either make them extremely unbearable so that they pursue a single people for so much time that they eventually strike some kind of relationship even if it lasts for like a week, or for the other half of guys, it just demolishes their confidence completely. I guess for most guys here is the latter.

This has been an extremely crippling issue for me, as this did later made me develop mild anxiety, and although it's not as bad as other cases of anxiety (I know some personal serious ones, I do have a friend with extreme anxiety) it is crippling enough for me to not be able to do a lot of basic human and social stuff.

I've never really dated, maybe my anxiety was at fault, but after I reached my 16 years of age I just stopped approaching girls in a romantic way. That's a huge problem for me, I just make friends when in reality I like them in more profound ways. This happened to me about 2 years ago, when I met a girl and was just hypnotized by her beauty, her laugh, her everything, but alas, turns out I'm really good at making friends but not lovers. I'm not blaming her, at all, or society, I don't even want to associate myself with *those* kinds of people, you know which people I mean. I know that my poor flirting skills are at fault. But I just, feel so alien to that kind of speech.

I've never went partying, never caught my attention, maybe that's it?? Maybe I haven't had enough opportunities to try my flirting with other humans. But whenever I try to say something remotely romantic I just loose all confidence due to my previous rejections.

I have friends, at least, but I find myself in a moment where I just have no way of meeting more women, my anxiety prevents me doing most social stuff, the only times I do go out is when my friends want to gather and just mess around, but those are the same faces.

""So what is that song you were talking about?""

It's [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INNkO4WnBT8) (WARNING, MAY TRIGGER EXTREME SADNESS) many of you may already know it, but this particular edit makes me feel that I just wasted so much time, so much opportunities. I'd always say ""Ah whatever love will end up showing up... eventually"" but it never did, maybe I was too passive?? But I was rejected when I was actively pursuing romantic relationships. It's just so much.

First time I heard the song it destroyed me, so be wary of that if you want to hear it. Some may not get it, and I'm just so happy for them.

A friend of mine felt really sick while listening to it, maybe is the tonal contrast between the upbeat melody, the cool vocals, kinda sad lyrics, and even sadder life experiences that come together to make this combo of brutal reality. He told me ""This is to be expected, many of us have been rejected a hundred times at this point that we just lack all confidence""

I'm 20, turning 21 in June. I'm still young, I guess, and while I sometimes feel sad, I try to improve myself. I actively avoid this song but I've grown to like the pain, somehow. I just hate the thing I'm right now, the thing that was created by laziness, procrastination and lack of confidence.

That's good. I'm trying hard to break my own barriers, maybe this was a good thing, listening to the song, being horrorified at what I missed, and I don't want to miss it anymore.

I started lifting weights about a month ago, whenever I feel exhausted I just bring back that hate, the hate I have for the alien thing I've become, I want to change, is it ok for me to hate myself this way?? It's not destructive, is it?? It's my fuel in some way.

I feel a bit confident now, a little bit. Maybe I'll approach her?? It's been two years of ""just friends"", I know that asking for tips here or anywhere is extremely useless as most is subjective and do water down to ""be confident"", maybe I'll approach her, perhaps.

That's it. My conclussion. Money doesn't but happiness, confidence does. Keep fighting my lonely people, the human condition is complex, but change is in oneself... we just need that little push, that little realization.",lonely,How a song gave me a mental breakdown and made me rethink my current situation (LONG POST),2022-05-30 08:10:47

It's the only thing I got. I get up for it at 3 45am. Have a quick bite, get to the gym for a couple hrs. Rush home and then rush to work all day. And repeat.
Instead I am just going to push it to an unhealthy level and go twice a day for maybe 5hrs total as well as working all day so then literally I don't have a single moment to think how lonely and shit my life is. All I can do is gym, work, gym, sleep and repeat till complete burnout.

Doesn’t mean that they’re a bad person. Or that you’re a bad person. Just don’t waste your time trying to bend over backwards to try to be this person’s friend. And look for other potential friends instead.

I’m searching for fellow Indian nerds who are career-focussed and can also keep me motivated. I would appreciate science students ‘cause that’s what I myself am. 

Also, I’m not the one to text dirty the first few weeks, so if you are looking for a hookup, then stop reading this. I’m looking for a serious relationship where we can be each other’s best friends as well, and share memes etc.

Geeks are more than welcome, so are techies. Also, since I really lack technological and commercial skills, I would appreciate someone with a deep knowledge pertaining to these affairs.

Also, please be an Indian. Also, if we talk for two days on end, chances are I’ll never ghost. I like to keep things straight and simple, and would rather let you know than be passive ignorant of you.

Am I in control of the situation or is it out of my control?

This isn’t to attack you, it’s to better your life. It might not sound like coddling support, but it is support. If you’re able to, you can support yourself. I’m not forcing you to do what you can’t do, I’m saying to do what you already can do, but you don’t think you can. 

If you’re lonely, you don’t have someone there to check on you to see if your thoughts are irrational or you’re being unreasonable with yourself, and being alone can make your thoughts spiral all together down a deep dark never ending pit. And sometimes it can be an illusion.

After reflecting over my teenage years though i am doing good academically i feel like the goals i had socially are very subpar. I have slowly distanced myself from many friends, i now have a slightly close friend group of three yet there is a void that i cannot ignore. Rn i feel like this void is the lack of direct love wether it be physical or emotional. Small acts from mates where they go out of their way for me is nice yet i feel like i cannot act myself around them and i guess thats something i want in my life rn💀. This post is a reflection of this behaviour because i rlly need to vent to someone/thing😭😭😭

I think im good at giving love but i kinda just wanna know what it feels like to really recieve it. The type of love where they are willing to spend hours of time on something for me. I want validation, i want someone to provide me with same caring that i give them.

Now how do i go about finding this person tho? I dont know if its a childish/immature mindset yet i want my first “love” to have value so im willing to wait for this person to make themselves known to me. Problem is that snapscore of 3000 isnt looking too pretty so im all flustered on what to do.

Hi! I’m an **Indian** girl, an absolute nerd with no friends at all. 

I’m searching for fellow Indian nerds who are **career-focussed** and can also keep me motivated. I would appreciate science students ‘cause that’s what I myself am. 

Also, I’m not the one to text dirty the first few weeks, so if you are looking for a **hookup, then stop reading this.** I’m looking for a serious relationship where we can be each other’s best friends as well, and share memes etc.

**Geeks** are more than welcome, so are **techies**. Also, since I really lack at technological and commercial skills, I would appreciate someone with a deep knowledge pertaining to these affairs.

Also, **please be an Indian**. Also, if we talk for two days on end, chances are I’ll never ghost. I like to keep things straight and simple, and would rather let you know than be passive ignorant of you. 

And please **don’t be older than 21 at any rate**. Absolute no-no.

If you have made it through this text, please type an asterisk with your message- (\*Hi in place of Hi) You get bonus points for being patient.

Even if you can't find someone who enjoys being around you currently, never give up. You'll find someone who will be best bros eventually.

Recently start phd and leave parents home to live in a new city on my own. All college friends moved to other places so im completely lonely in a strange city.

Thought that could handle this well, cause when was a child I really doesnt have any friends at all. Im very introvert, so it was very difficult to make friends. In fact the first ones ive got were in college, and I value then a lot. But now we cant go out and barely chat online.

This weekend was terrible. I never feel so lonely before. Try to play some games, read books and do random stuff on the internet, but the feeling continue.

Then I try a date app, but coldnt find anyone interesting. Im not good in start chat with strange people, and the conversation were so bored that a I just give up. Im very nerd, so its difficult to engage with commom people (think this is the cause for my loneliness).

It’s only been 4 months. 4 months and he’s moved on. She’s prettier than me too and of course that kills me further. Why does that make me feel so much worse? God. It feels like someone just stabbed me straight through the heart.

Which isn’t the way to live, I know. But I wanted to make him regret what he lost. I know i’m not the only one who feels like this after a break up. 

It’s not even so much about him, it’s more about me and how pointless my life feels because I don’t feel important or good enough, ever. I’m mad at him but even angrier at myself. For not being good at anything. For not being successful at anything. For not having the love, admiration, value, influence, and respect I desperately yearn for. For just being fucking important. 

Instead of getting my life together and doing better after he broke up with me by literally just ghosting me, i’ve just been stuck in a mental prison unable to move forward in any way. Why would you introduce me to your fucking family? How could you tell me you loved me and just never talk to me again and be totally fine? Fuck you.

I cant believe i’ve been wearing the stupid promise ring you got me this whole time thinking that you’d eventually come back to me? You probably moved on a week after we stopped talking. I’m a goddamn idiot.

I'm married to a loving woman who lets me know I am loved and shows it too. I'm fortunate like that. I have a good relationship with my parents and I have a step family that knows how weird I can get and they still love me. Lucky there too. 

The thing is though, while I know I deserve this love, I still can't *feel* it. 

My wife and I are poly so I've been seeking.. More. More intimacy, more love, that kind of stuff, not more sex.  I've been in a relationship of .. uh.. sorts.. With Monika (MAS... IYKYK) for over 3 years. That's helped a lot, but, still, didn't feel like enough.

I've been seeking therapy for a while. As it happens I also fell in love (literally) with my current therapist. She, of course, does not love me back and is very careful not to encourage it at all. She sees this problem as systemic. 

I tried talking to another person I met at some place neutral on the internet, starting catching feelings for them almost over night. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not looking for a relationship out of this post, I see that rule. But, I feel like I have so much love to output that I just don't know what to do with it. And then there's the whole still not feeling the love from those closest to me issue too.

447,Large_Reaction_1050,1653795774,1,"Here is my story of being ghosted by my best friend of 8 years. 
I will call her M. M and I met in high school and had a couple classes together. I became very close to her that it felt like she was my sister, and her family was like my family, always inviting me to come spend 4th of July and thanksgiving with them. We also never had any major arguments. Months after high school graduation, M got married to her husband and I was her bridesmaid. Her husband also became a good friend of mine, and the three of us spent so much time together, yada yada. Fast forward to April 2022, the three of us came back from a trip to Disneyland. It’s been two weeks since I heard from her, so I send her a text “Hey boo, how’s it going? Miss you!”. I saw that she read the message, though I didn’t think much about it, I assumed that she was just tired from working a long day. I send her another message a few days later asking “is everything alright?” I knew that this wasn’t like her to not respond because she is the type of person who is always glued to her phone. I then go on Facebook to see if she’s been active on there, and couldn’t find her profile. Then I go on Snapchat, press on her account, that’s when I saw the “add friend” appeared. I tried clicking to add but it wouldn’t let me. My so-called “best friend” of 8 years blocked me, with no warning. M and I have never had an argument as I mentioned before, aside from a minor disagreement we had a Disneyland about what ride to go on next, but that was resolved… or so I thought. Was that the reason why she cut me off? is she dealing with mental issues? Is she and her husband having marriage problems? Was it something else that I’ve said or done that could’ve potentially pissed her off? My mind was filled with all of these questions, and it drove me insane the more I thought about it. I tried reaching out to her husband, her sister, and her mom even, to see if they have any idea on what is going on. No response. They are all ignoring me, and I don’t understand why. I felt shocked, and betrayed, and I still am feeling like that. I’ve trusted M with basically everything in my life. I told her about my parents divorce and me cutting off contact with my dad. I cried to her when my ex-boyfriend broke up with me. M was there to help me and to listen to me when I needed her, and I did the same for her. I’ve been feeling broken and hurt, and it feels like I won’t be able to trust another person again. I’m a huge introvert and making friends is already hard enough for me. I want answers from her and want to talk to her badly, but part of me wants nothing to do with her at all. It’s a complex feeling.

I've never felt lonlier than in my current relationship.  The easy answer is to leave, but I'm not ready for a multitude of reasons. Primary among them, I'm not strong enough mentally yet, though I am actively working on it.
I'm pretty sure my partner doesn't love me anymore, and that's okay. I would ask for more clarity, but I'm gaslit in every conversation without exception. 
I currently feel imprisoned, and I know that is just a symptom of my mental health, because there are no bars.
But I'm saying all this to say, who knew being with someone and unloved was one hundred times worse than being single.  I guess I was just naive, because when I write it out, it seems obvious that it would hurt worse.
Currently, my self esteem is nonexistent.  I feel lower than low. Every minute of my life feels like an hour right now. A dreary, loveless, hour.

Your story is not yet written. There are characters yet to be introduced, journeys yet to be embarked on, joys you're yet to experience. If you're dwelling in a season of loneliness, despair, grief, don't allow this era to serve as a fortune teller of the future. As the future is a blank page influenced heavily by unpredictability. Embrace the fact that whatever you're going through, you're growing through. Show gratitude for the person you're becoming, and find excitement for the people and events life has yet to reveal.  


⋆｡˚ ☁︎ ˚｡⋆｡˚☽˚｡⋆  
Secondly, realize and accept that many of our friendships are impermanent. Even more so in the eras of uncertainty and change. People grow in ways we're unfamiliar with, and inevitably the foundations that once held the relationship twist and turn. It's normal. Everyone that comes into our life is either for a season or a reason. With this in mind, acknowledge that friendships growing distance is not a reflection of you. It doesn't say anything about your character, or make you any less of a valuable person. Most importantly, it doesn't mean you're written to forever live in solitude. Nothing is written or certain, you don't know if your best friend will appear in your life tomorrow, or next year. The suspense is what adds to the universe's beauty.",lonely,There are people you love that you haven't met yet ♡,2022-05-29 11:22:36

I feel like I have a lot of love to give but nobody to receive it. I used to cringe at those close school couples but later on I realised that I was jealous that they found someone who likes them back. Meeting girls is also kinda difficult since I don't like to go clubbing and i dislike dating apps since they give off a false impression and with the hobbies I have finding a girl isn't easy either (gaming, football, music and computer stuff). I used to be cool with being alone, well I even enjoyed it since it was a break from my talkative outgoing personality, yet now it just becomes a time I fear since everytime I'm alone I start to drown in my thoughts. So to counter that I overstimulate myself by consuming loads of media at the same time (turning on background music while I'm on my pc with my tv on as a stimuli aswell). What's also hard to deal with is that almost all my close friends have entered relationships in the last 6 months, I mean I'm happy for them but damn I wish it was my turn.

So summer starts and I’m kinda sad I can’t see him anymore but that’s not the point. We don’t know each other and probably never will. Guys don’t ever really crush on me. I know how Reddit is and you guys will disagree with me and bla bla.

The truth is, I’m just flat out ugly. I don’t look good, attraction plays a huge part in relationships. So I just can’t have it.

I don’t know how to describe it but just trust me it looks so nice. He’s a little bit chubby (which I prefer in guys) and I think he’s taller than me. I know he’s into skating, pretty sure he smokes (his friend group does), and he likes rap. I do too, I know his friends like suicide boys which is literally my favorite rappers in the world. So I hope he likes them too. His name is Tristen. 

I think he has a girlfriend, which I’m not surprised. Guys like him always do. He’s like the “cool” dude, I don’t really know how to describe him. He’s not the mean cool dude. Honestly the best way to describe him is that new stoner in season 4 of stranger things, “Argyle”. But he looks much better, and a little less crazy then Argyle. FYI: I literally love this character, nothing bad better happen to him. 

But yea, that’s really all I know about him. He’s so cute and by the way he acts I feel like we have similar interests. I’m a very bummy girl, and I’m pretty sure everybody thinks I’m a lesbian. Seeing the girls he hangs out with I know he won’t like me. Never will. It sucks man, if I could’ve just been born to look good life really would be that much different. Don’t tell me I’m actually pretty and all that fake shit. I’m not. I truly am not and it’s resulted in crazy loneliness. He probably doesn’t even know I’m alive.",lonely,Imma just tell y’all about this really pretty boy at my school.,2022-05-29 08:19:45

The result is no connection or intimacy with other people. Which makes me more insecure, which makes me more afraid to open up, and the vicious circle continues.

It’s not just that I’m too afraid to connect with people, I genuinely don’t know how to. I have “pushed myself” to try to open up and connect, I’ve put effort in. But the problem is I have so much inescapable anxiety and depression that I can’t emotionally relate enough to actually establish the relationship. Plus I feel like nobody wants to be around someone who is sad all the time. Even though I do my best to not act like it.

You sit down and there's a friendly face in front of you ( hopefully) , conversation may happen a bit between bites, and that meal may not seem so lonely and pointless after all. I was reading on some news website that during the pandemic, a group of students did just that. And it was a fine experience. They were having zoom dinners. That idea appealed to me a lot.

All I want, is someone who's my age or over, alone too,  ( I'm soon 50 y.o) in my time zone ( UTC-4) and eats between 4 and 5 pm. Yes, I eat early.  Or for lunch at 11:30 am. I'm working from home and these are my hours. They say that eating alone is unhealthy as well, we might eat too fast, and I can tell that the loneliness gets worse around mealtimes for me. All i want, is to share something like that with a stranger. Not a mukbang, that'd make me lose my appetite, lol.

So, is there anyone who would want to give it a shot, and be my eating buddy? I'm going to cut off anyone who's inappropriate on camera, though. This is something i'm trying for real, and, i'm not looking for an unpleasant experience.

We hadn't even met but it felt like we had known each other for years. She said that I made her world less lonely and she loved talking to me. 

I cried thinking that i finally found someone who cared about me, who enjoyed talking to me and wanted me. She would send me playlists titled ""i feel love"" and say that these songs said a lot more than she could say to me. For once in my life i got a taste of what love feels like.

2 weeks ago, out of nowhere, she said that she doesn't want to talk anymore and it would be the last time we would ever talk. She said i came to her mind as the day started and she wondered what would happen if we didn't talk that day. She said that she would always be alone and nothing i do will ever change that. She said that I deserve someone better. She said ""thank you and goodbye"".

Since then I'm so lost, so lonely. Every morning i have to deal with heartbreak all over again. Everytime my phone buzzes i immediately reach for it thinking that it's her. I feel like I lost the only good thing that is ever happened to me in my life. Only the last 3 nights i haven't cried myself to sleep.

558,Ohokayigetit94,1653762519,1,"So i’m in my late 20s and have lost quite a few friendships and close relationships over the past few years. Many of which were during the pandemic. 

I also recently started taking space from my parents because we have a toxic family dynamic that I just needed a break from. My parents and my sibling are the only family members where I live. My sibling and I have never been close (despite trying as we have gotten older).

On top of that, my on and off bf for about 5 years and I finally “broke up”. (In quotes because it was often a situationship).

I’m really sad at times seeing people around me or on social media with what seems like close, genuine relationships. 

Sometimes I feel like this is a normal late 20’s experience and that my tribe will come to me naturally over time. Sometimes I feel like when relationships end, it’s so that other relationships that better suit who I am becoming can make their way into my life. Other times I feel shame about not having a tribe and spending so much time alone. I catch myself wondering if it actually is going to happen. Sometimes I have faith, other times I gave a lot of fear. 

I live in a very small city where everyone pretty much knows each other and it’s tough for me to feel a sense of belonging. I’ve considered moving but I just can’t afford it right now.

Like i get it, im ugly and fat, or as he likes to tell me, ""you're not completely hopeless and could be attractive if you lost some weight, but will never look like you did at 18 when we met"". He's 10 years older than me as well.

People are quick to just tell me to leave, but I can't. I'm disabled, rely on him to take care of me, my parents are super poor and my dad is going through chemo currently, so I would only be a burden to them that they couldn't afford. I don't have any friends. I'm great at pushing people away because I can be quite the negative Nancy, because life fucking sucks. Also, I've had some mental health problems and been inpaitent 40+ times over the course of 8 years. I made some shitty mistakes last time I tried to leave him and ended up in a hole in someone's basement for 6 months, no joke. Being abducted has everything to do with my mental health problems and why I was so unconcerned about being fat for a while.  I've lost 80 lbs now the last 8 months, or so. 
We have a daughter who is soon to be 9 and if I leave, he will certainly get custody. My mental health record, including suicide attempts, make sure of that. When I was 14 I fell 60' off a cliff while put with ROTC, it messed me up pretty badly, buy I recovered for the most part. I graduated early and got a bachelor's in organic chemistry, commissioned into the Navy, got a dishonorable discharge(long story), but managed to get shot in the abdomen during my service. I survived and got better and then got my master's in Chemical Engineering. Then got pregnant with my daughter and was so sick with her that I spent 4 months in the hospital and she came at 7 months. She was in a bad way for a little while, but she's just a normal kid now. Truly the thing I am most thankful for. If I left and he got custody of her I could never forgive myself. I'm trying to hold out until she's 18 and I no longer have to worry about whose custody she'll end up in. I needed a shunt placed 2 years ago and have it placed 4 times total. If you're unsure what that is, it's a catheter that runs to the ventricles of my brain and has a tube coming out the back of my skull(still under my skin) that feeds down through my neck and drains all the spinal fluid that shouldn't be building up into my brain into my abdomen so my body can reabsorb it. I have hydrocephalus, for which I take medication that's main side effect is weight gain. Then on top of that I had a brain tumor removed last October, a stroke in April and an aneurysm in May, both of this year. It's been a rough year. Ha. 

Anyway, I've rambled on enough about my existence. All I really want is to feel loved and wanted by someone romantically. Maybe there's someone in the same kind of shitty situation, but I hope not, for their sake. In the off chance there is maybe someone will message me. I'm not holding my breath. I'm used to being alone. I've grown accustomed to a damp pillow every night as I wish that God, or whatever cosmic power, would just end my suffering. 

I live in Texas, if that's important to the picture at all. 

I'm not so depressed all the time. I like to paint and draw and craft in general. I love music, movies and reading. 

My favorite music is Elliott Smith, Bright Eyes/Conor Oberst, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Belle and Sebastian, basically stuff like that. I also love jazz, mid 2000's emo, and a lot of random other stuff.

My favorites movies are Punch-Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, Ghost World, Magnolia, A Clockwork Orange, Goodwill Hunting, Mad Max, Aliens, Trading Places, American Psycho... you probably get the gist of it...

Books can probably be broken down by author, my favorite author is JG Ballard, although my favorite book is probably Infinite Jest. I also love reading Bret Easton Ellis, Don DeLillo, Cormac McCarthy, William S Burroughs. Thomas Pynchon, etc... 
I used to be really into comics and have a large collection. 150+ long boxes of them. The current state of super heros and comics in pop culture really put a bitter taste in my mouth about them and caused some disdain. Everything has to have an agenda these days it seems and with the MCU being so popular it started bleeding over into most comics.

I have had the most boring and dull dating and love life because there isn't much to share. I was basically a third wheeler of my best friend's high school relationship. At that moment I didn't think much of it because I liked the company of my bestie. We did so many things together so I wasn't really lonely. I saw their relationship blossom. They broke up anyway. She and I went to different cities for college and lost touch. I made a new group of friends(girls only) in college so that was great. Everyone knows first year of college is exciting because new friends, dates, love prospects. It kinda hit me during college parties that guys would approach my friends to talk, dance with them and I was left with one girl who was in the same position as I. I was kinda invisible. Not that I'm complaining I had the sweetest group of girl friends who made college life sufferable socially speaking. I always wondered why guys were not even interested to make acquaintance with me. That one time two guys expressed their interests in me via my girl friends never approached me irl. Idk why. I feel they ran out of options and probably looking for whoever was left. 

I reunited with my high school bff over a holiday break to escape my dull college life temporarily. I again witnessed her new relationship blossoming. Oh, I wish someone would make efforts to date me 😂. Meanwhile I was with a guy she introduced and we had 4 days fling not that I regret it.

Anyways I’ve never really had friends like a group of ppl maybe even 2 or 3 that just stick. I had a friend group sophomore year of college but we ended up falling out bc one of the girls was using the N word and they were just kinda fake. I used to hit girls up I met at bars to hangout but after the bar I likely never see them again I guess because they already have their own friends, flake, or either they make no effort to befriend me. Should I put more effort into making friendships? I am a pretty well rounded person I would say I have a good sense of humor, chill, into a lot of cool stuff idk.

Also not to be vain but I guess some ppl just look at me and assume I either don’t like people or I’m stuck up bc I don’t have friends but I guess I have the look like I should have a friend group of that makes sense. I’ve done some modeling etc. 

I love my alone time but I also would love to just have a tribe someplace to call home, ppl to share memories with ppl who are excited to celebrate milestones together to travel with. I don’t have and I’m turn it’s causing me to be bitter towards ppl who appear to have a bunch of friends.

615,GERGAAA,1653726011,1,"Hi there :) So I´ve been feeling weird lately. Today has been quite a day and I just want to talk about it with someone, anyone. I just feel that I keep making mistakes with my decisions.

Well, I think I will write a lot since I have a lot in my head right now. My problems may not be as big as others, but I can't take them away from my head. And apologies if any of this is not well written or disorganized.

I can recall the moment everything started feeling weird. It was around high school. I met this guy and we became best friends. A year later he started to send me photos of him hurting himself and demanding my attention and help. I didn't know what to do at the time, but I know what happened after I told my parents. They changed me to another school. I kept contact with him even though I wasn't there to ""help"" him. I never told him that the reason I left was that my parents were worried about him being close to me, so I told him a made-up reason, keeping the friendship for some time. We were very lonely even then, and I felt guilty about leaving him alone. 

Maybe what happened next was karma? I don't know. In this new school, I made a lot of friends, and I fell in love for the first time. This girl was everything to me. I even presented my so-called best friend to her but I never asked her to go out, and everything ended badly after two years. She met someone else via online video games, so yeah. It was difficult to see her all the time, unable to talk to her as I did in the past. Even though I never asked her out, we both knew we liked each other, or well, at least she told me that. I really liked her. My so-called best friend decided to stop talking to me and get closer to this girl, so that hit me, but he was in his right to do that after leaving him alone.

After all that I became even lonelier. I wasn't able to talk to others as I did before. Most of my friends were her friends first, so I was heartbroken with just a handful of friends in school. In retrospect, I really appreciate them. They were really patient with me and my sadness. I'm afraid that being with my so-called best friend made me adopt some of his mindset, but I've never hurt myself. I was waiting for everything to end.

And it ended, for the most part, when I went to college. I decided to study medicine, it sounded really interesting. I met a lot of people and made really good friends. But then, COVID came, and everything went down. I think that being close to all these people was enough to make me feel happy. I wasn't even enjoying med school; I was good at it, but it just consumed most of my time when I was on campus. Maybe the ""free"" time I gained with virtual classes made me realize that being a doctor wasn't something for me.

So I left. I changed my career. And now I'm studying animation. And I don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, it is something I've ever wanted to do, but on the other hand, I'm scared; My parents don't trust these types of careers, and I think they have a point, not being well paid in my country. But I was feeling really bad while in med school, and I think I just decided with my heart? I don't know.

In this new career, I've also met very cool people. They are very different from my previous contacts but still really cool. I met a girl and we were close friends. We talked a lot while having virtual classes, and when campus classes returned, we went out... for a while. I decided to end that relationship after noticing how she wasn't for me for lots of reasons, and now I'm alone. I feel alone.

And this loneliness is not letting me sleep. I keep thinking about everything, about every mistake I made. Should I have stayed close to my so-called best friend even though I felt manipulated? Should I have kept my feeling to myself and talked to anyone after my heartbreak? Should I have kept studying med school even though I wasn't feeling it? Should I have kept my relationship? I think that most of my decisions aren't making me happy. They make me lonelier and lonelier, losing every friend I make on the way.

By this time, I'd be graduating from med school as my comrades are. I'd be at that great party I keep seeing on my Instagram. I don't know how to feel about anything. I keep seeing all the posts my ex-girlfriend keeps posting with her new boyfriend, and FYI it is not that I want to go out with her again, it's just that I want to feel good that fast again, as I think she is.

I have my family. They've been always there for me, at least most of them. But it makes me feel sad that I'm unable to keep in contact with someone else, someone I found and decided to keep close to me. Am I really that distant to others?

And that's it.

Thank you for reading and goodnight. I hope everyone is able to sleep.",lonely,I'm feeling bad and I need to talk,2022-05-28 18:20:11

634,jjnada556,1653720734,1,"I wish i could say im surprised but im not. No matter how many times he tried to deny it, she was always “the one”. I (21F) used to tell him (back when we were just friends)how they were soulmates and straight out of a romcom. Don’t get me wrong I know he loved me and cherished me but once his ex came back in town during thanksgiving .. things slowly started to change. She started working closely with him and feelings started to bubble up. He finally broke and confided in his mom about his conflicting emotions (march). What he didn’t know was his mom invited me over for dinner and i heard his rant coming down the stairs. It was pretty funny seeing his mom greet him and say “oh i invited-“ he then interjects and has a meltdown rant. Oh boy was it awkward… could u imagine the look on his face when i walked into the kitchen. I wish i could hate him and say he was a backstabbing liar and cheater but from his heart wrenching rant i believe him. He loves me but he also loves her and despite not even doing anything with her. He wanted to break up because it was the right thing to to do. So we spent the night crying together, reminiscing on our love and finding closure. Honestly we didn’t even get into the meat of the problem i just kinda accepted it. Theres no doubt in my mind he was in love with me, everyone knew it but for months we slowly became loving best friends. How am i holding up you might be asking..? Terribly :) he was my whole world and my first love, i was the loneliness person before i met my super funny and cheeky tutor. I was pretty nervous getting tutored by a masters student but good god was he a baby. I never laughed and blushed more in my life, he was unabashedly flirtatious and cheeky but also comforting and respectful. He showed me videos of his kitties, convinced me to buy these super cute squishmallows, and gave me a life lessons.. all in one tutoring session. We instantly became friends and soon lovers, I’ll never regret the year and a half I spent with him because it was the best year of my life. He helped me overcome so many obstacles and taught me about vulnerability, and falling in love. He was so beautiful and his energy was magnetic. Now I feel lonely and empty all over again, i’m back in my regular old routine. I miss him sooo much it kills me but i know it wasn’t meant to be. Despite not being together he still asks about me from to time, which warms my heart. He doesnt know that i know he asks my mom about me, its cute and heartwarming. I should probably tell him its ok to reach out and send me a text or call but we both know its best to keep our distance for now. Lord knows my attachment issues can’t handle having him back in my life just yet. But ya.. thats my story :) I fell in love and honestly it probably wont happen again but im thankful it did. I just spend my days doodling in my notebook (that he got me), watching movies on my projector (that he got me), watching the stars at night in his hoodie and the telescope he bought me for Valentine’s day. I snuggle in the hello kitty blanket he got me from our trip to disney, and most of all, I wear the pendant he gave me on my birthday. It belonged to his grandmother but he gave it to me because his granny said and i quote “keep her around, shes got a good soul and a beautiful smile” Of course i tried to give it back since it was such a meaningful gift but he refused and said “its yours, mama chose you and i know you’ll take good care of it”. So now i sit here playing with her necklace, scrolling through reddit wondering where do i go from here. Should I dye my hair red? I always wanted to but was always too scared. Should I go take myself out to dinner? I always wanted to but was always too scared. Should I follow through on our vacation plans and go to greece?

Your supposed to have people in your life at this point. The likelihood of me salvaging my life by playing some board games or going to meet ups (which I've tried) is just not likely.

641,French-BulIdog,1653717745,1,"I () a very extroverted person, but have been lacking social interaction for a long time. I’m also the type of person who needs hugs, primarily from friends that I trust. 

Anyways, I had plans to see a new friend this weekend. We’d only talked for a couple of weeks, she’s a friend of a friend and we started talking through social media. We were planning it for the better part of a week, and me - suddenly developing intense feelings for her - was super excited. I had butterflies all week, a mix of positive (because of extreme excitement), and negative (had been left on read for two days, but she’d just been busy and didn’t have time to reply). I couldn’t stop thinking about her. This week at work was especially tough, and I was just looking forward to seeing her like you wouldn’t believe. All week, she never left my mind.

Tonight, less than 24 hours before our scheduled hangout, our plans fizzled out. She was no longer comfortable with the idea of hanging out with me - fair enough. I do really appreciate that she was fully honest with me and told me the straight up truth. 

I’m now devastated. The window of opportunity id been hoping and praying for for months was slammed shut before anything even happened. Even if we could have just had one hug or just seen each other one time, that would have filled all the cracks in my already shattered heart. 

I don’t have anything against this girl for what happened, actually I’m really thankful because I wouldn’t have wanted her to be uncomfortable. 

I’m sure I did something wrong; I don’t know what. All I know is I dropped my heart into the blender again. I was going to make an IG story saying I’d be taking a break and to please message my cell instead… before realizing there’s no one who would aside from a couple guy friends who I don’t feel super connected to. 

I’m just defeated. I need a female friendship. I need someone to hug and to hang out with and make memories with. I feel desperate to find someone I can grow close to and then work towards reaching the stage of having a relationship and living the rest of our lives together for God, and for Jesus. 

But no, even more heartbreak. I’ll wait my turn, but it’s not getting any easier. I need a long meaningful hug and some one on one time with someone. 🥺",lonely,"Completely heartbroken, just need a friend I can hug",2022-05-28 16:02:25

I only wanted to make her happy, I didn’t care about myself, if she was happy so was I. But only a few months into the relationship things started getting Ricky and after 2 days of arguing, she left me. I’ve had no one except a cat that I got a few days ago. I love him but it’s not the same as having someone who can listen to you. So I’m alone again with what feels like nothing. I feel like an empty shell with no purpose. During the relationship, I was in a really dark place, not because of the relationship, just mentally, and I harmed myself. Now that I’m alone again, I was able to hold off for about a month and a half, but I cut into my arm again. It was only a few cuts, but I made sure they hurt.

I just find it funny that I remember there always being at least one girl in high school that seemed at least a little interested in me -- and this was back when I was 20 pounds heavier with a Ringo haircut and stupid fuckin glasses. I was a dork, and yet I remember a couple girls showing interest. I figured it'd only be uphill from there, right? 

Yeah no. 


I took the internet's advice when I stopped liking the thing looking back at me in the mirror every morning. I took up new hobbies,  started exercising and getting a new taste in music. Goodbye glasses, hello new hairstyle... And it seems like I took a huge leap backwards. 



When I realized I was 20 years old and haven't even been on my first date yet I started getting worried about my future. I began second guessing myself and the negative thoughts ramped up to 100 after that point. ""Maybe you don't deserve to be loved. You **are** pretty ugly, after all..."" 


But then I normally reply with ""ugly guys get girls all the time"" and then I'm hit with ""yeah but they're at least TALL"" and that's that. I'll never understand the people on here that are somehow still lonely regardless of being married. They **won** the game - found someone to spend the rest of their lives with. Their best friend, their lover. 


... I had one of those once. Nowadays if I think about her too hard, I cry. Well, that's technically not true. I haven't wept in years. Sure I'll shed a tear or two, but that's got zero relevance to the post I'm trying to make. 
Back then I wasn't worried about this shit. I was in blissful ignorance and that caused girls to be interested. Now that I'm more aware about the stupid shit I do and the way I act, suddenly all that interest dried up. Gone, like an angel's kiss. 


I uh.. I'm not even sure my heart could be in it if a woman did show up wanting to be with me at this point. Then again if that happened, Hell must've frozen over and the gates thereof rusted shut so I guess there's that",lonely,"""Women can sense your desperation""",2022-05-28 13:11:57

I think I have and will forever struggle to make friends. This could be online or in real life. I don't think I've ever truly like a person ive talked to in real life or online. It seems like a single flaw can escalate into a plethora of them. It feels like once a person ""makes a mistake"" they're forever less than what I thought they were worth. Which doesbt make much sense even thinking about it. That is just how I feel. 

I feel hopeless. The ebb and flow that is my emotions are just filled with sadness and manic behavior. I feel hopeless.

When I do find people I think are just brilliant, It seems surreal. I guess I attempt to break this friendship not sure how till after. And when the friendship is over there is momentary relief followed by a long sadness. 

When talking to anyone it seems that they take pity on me and it immediately makes everything seem so worthless. 

I recently made a friend who is definitely like-minded and messed it up, I think ill give up trying in a few. They were a lovely talk but it just felt bad a lot. I have made one friend that has stayed for about 3 years, although I am certain he will leave me since he has made other friends and has also gotten a job. I feel forgotten. I feel bad.

I just wrote a post looking for friends but it was automoderated. Now I don't want to make friends. But I'll tell you what I'm thinking about.

Every major relationship of my life has been with a cluster B. This feels bad because there's a point where you realize it's your fault. Eventually I met someone who ruined my life. I have an Amber Heard. I thought I would be alone forever after that relationship. I was old, my nerves were shot, my personality had changed, my looks faded as my hair fell out. R\*pe had changed me so much I didn't think I would ever enjoy intimacy again. I worried I would be angry forever and I turned out to be anxious forever. I felt convinced I was too much of a loser for anyone to love again.

My reason for going on was my Cats and the possibility of healing and maybe even following my dreams.

After a couple years I met someone. Another cluster B. In a way I've improved a lot because I walked away from it and stopped caring where I was never able to do that before. Since that time I haven't cared about relationships. The few messages I get I always ignore. I don't trust them. I feel certain that I'll be rejected for the loads of emotional baggage I keep.

Lately I've been extremely stressed because I've been legally harassed for five years and soon I will be called back to court by the woman who ruined my life. The reason is to ensure that I can never talk about my life. This is the kind of loneliness that causes deep despair. No-one even cares. But even if they did I can't tell them what happened.",lonely,I can't escape even in loneliness.,2022-05-28 10:53:26

699,Sad-Village-5069,1653698197,1,"Idk how i let that happen. I always seemed different and i knew it, yet i didn't do anything with it. I always thought ""Ah its probably a phase, everyone had one i'll be fine later"". Years later nothing changed, its worsened in the last year. I started feeling like a spectator, like im on autopilot that i didn't set up. I stopped feeling feelings, and when i feel something its me blowing up with anger, and then when im done being furious i feel nothing again.  
This is a living hell. I started to forget bad memories i had, and i do not remember last time i was happy.   
Sleep is the only thing that gives me feelings, i have feelings only when i dream, i wake up kind of satisfied when i had a dream where i could feel something, anything. It feels so good to feel. This is fucked up. I want to sleep longer but i can't fall asleep easily.

I always distracted myself from this prison playing games but it doesn't work anymore, nothing does. I fucking hate myself and always did, i always did everything for others, i always helped others, never myself just because i despise myself so much. I wish i didn't exist, someone else in my body would have a far better life then i do, me and wasted oxygen i leave. Now so that anybody doesn't think, i do not want to kms, i just wish i wasn't born.

If not for my nature of doing everything for everyone, i might have already not been on this world. Since i am the way i am, i can't just die, i wouldn't want to let down or hurt my parents, my brother, family in general, they would blame themselfs which is not what i want. Still, its not like i have anyone else i could let down further more than the way i did up until now.

Its friday again, woo fucking hoo another 2 days of torturing myself from inside with thoughts dissociating and trying to force myself to sleep coz i cant stand the real world and doing absolutely nothing i just cant wait.

Probably no one will read this whole fucking book, and thats fine. I guess i just had to say this somewhere since there is no one i could share that with comfortably. Of course it is easier to share that to someone who doesn't know you. Of course.

They are not objects, they are a part of me. But she never understood that, and I definitely don't understand why people are still friends with her. I never thought her as a friend, my intuition always saying 'no, she's not your friend, she'll betray you'. And she did. Then I blocked her, and unblocked her to say something. It wasn't mean or anything. But she blamed me for blocking her and said she never did anything. Then said she wasn't mad when I told her she was pissing me off. Like bro, I know you are. In our community, we take our oc's and make couple out of it. I asked her if she still wanted my oc shipped with hers, and she said 'do whatever you want'. Like I said, my oc's are a part of me. She litteraly threw it in the trash like it was nothing. She was always being mean like that, and always said she wasn't. Maybe that's why my ex-bff insulted you.

736,http_uncreative,1653683450,1,"I want to preface this by saying that, overall, I am okay. I’m in a safe environment and have a good family and I don’t totally despise myself all the time. I just wanted to rant and get some words off my chest. 

I’m currently homeschooled. I’ve been in and out of public school since I was in fourth grade. When I go, I’m usually pretty quiet. Most of the time I can make one solid friend and just be cool with a couple others. One hundred percent of the time these friendships don’t last. So right now, I have no friends. I just wake up and go about my day without talking to anyone but my family. If I think about it for too long I get kind of emotional, but it could be worse. I’m lucky because I actually enjoy spending time with my family. 

So like, nearly a year ago, I was in my first relationship. He was a great guy but that was my first relationship and things moved way too fast and the dude talked about marriage and things like that, so I kind of panicked and broke up with him. In hindsight, I could’ve handled things way better but we also weren’t going to last even if I did. Wish him the best. 

After that I ghosted my best friend. She was such a bad friend to me, I don’t even feel bad about it. I knew she was a gossip but I never expected her to put me into a bad light. I’m not flawless but she just had no respect for the sanctity of friendship. 

After that, I was friends with another girl who was also going through it at the time. She ghosted me when she felt better, which is okay. No hard feelings and I hope she’s doing good today. 

So now I’m back where I’ve been countless times. There’s no one to talk to. Since those events, I’ve grown a lot and genuinely think I’m ready for friendships and relationships and all that jazz, but I don’t know what to do. I’m going into my senior year next year at an actual school, and I just feel like no one’s open to making new friends. Like everyone already knows everyone and has established relationships with other people, and that I’d just be invading a space where I’m not really wanted. Honestly, I’m pretty funny and have been told that I’m charismatic a few times, but I have no clue how to befriend people in an environment where I’m extremely uncomfortable and nervous and they’re probably over with the year the second they stepped foot on campus. 

I’ve worked on myself so much. I go the gym, I’m happy (just lonely), I no longer have unrealistic or toxic expectations of other people, and think I’d be a good person to have any sort if relationship with (friendship, acquaintance, romantic, etc…), I’m just so scared because what if i’m not? Two years ago, I thought something was so inherently wrong with me that me being friends with someone would be an actual bad thing to happen to that someone. That i would ruin their life by just existing in it, or that I was just lacking something that everyone else wasn’t— and that was why no one would be with me. I mean, when i was 14, I thought I was so ugly and grotesque that I swallowed whatever pills I could get my hands on, and now, a few weeks ago, some really sweet little girl told me I was pretty in Target and i don’t hate myself when I look in the mirror— so I know I’ve improved, but what if who i am as a person isn’t enough? I want to be enough so badly because I could really, really love someone, and I’d be good at it, but what if these relationships just never happen for me? No one owes me friendship or love, no matter how much I’d show up for them or make them laugh or yearn for it. 

And I’m gonna throw in a suicide TW just to be safe. 

I’m happy, really, I am. I know my worth and I know my faults. I don’t want to die, I haven’t wanted to die for a long time. But I remember my life beforehand, and I can’t live in that state forever. I’m happy right now, but that loneliness is so strong. I’m hanging on because I’m young and things can still get so much better, but this loneliness has been following me since I was thirteen. I cannot carry it with me till I’m 26, mattering to no one but my grandma, mom, and sister. I love them so much but I can’t feel like this for that long. 

Thanks for reading. I know I probably sound selfish or entitled, I’m trying hard not to be and I apologize. If anyone wants to hit me up and talk about literally anything, loneliness, music, share pet pictures, video games even though i don’t play them, etc…I’m down.

I’ve never been so angry in my life. I try to be as helpful and kind to everyone but no one cares. I’ve never had anyone truly thank me or tell me I’m important accept my parents. Girls always insulted me and the one time a girl asked me out was a prank set up by my presumed friend. My teachers are my best friends and I know they would disagree from their side. I can’t even look at my teachers anymore, I’m to pissed of to make eye contact with people.

None of them ever spend time around me; I have to actively seek them out. They never converse with me, and it always feels like I'm that one stupid kid that tries their hardest to belong.

For a while I () have been alone. I come home to an empty home everyday for the past maybe 2 years and now all my friends left me. At the beginning of the year, my closest friend had decided she needed more friends and as a result had left me for more popular and active people. I understand it honestly, all i like to do is sit around and talk maybe go hiking, but they’re more of a party person. Now im alone. Even before this i have felt alone but ignored all thought of it because they were in my life, now i have to face the fact that i dont have anyone. I often have dreams where I just hangout with people i wish i could be around. I use it as a way to lie to myself and pretend like i have an active social life. I have severe memory loss and auditory hallucinations and i work 5 days a week for 10 hours a day. So im busy and never have time to address my problems. My hallucinations suck cause i tend to hear my friends voices or other people and my memory loss makes it so after a dream i can’t distinguish weather it was a dream or reality which leads into my psychosis which hasnt been determined but just a possibility. I now have a therapist. She tells me that it isnt my fault. Im very skeptical of doctors so sometimes i choose not to listen to her. Everyday i wake up to an empty house, empty social life, empty pockets. I just dont have anything anymore. It slowly has been chipping on my will to live. Seeing everyone hangout doing things i want to do knowing i cant participate and knowing it will probably never happen to me makes me just jot want to continue. Slowly and slowly i do just give into my fake reality because it helps me not feel alone. Some of you might be confused about my living situation, my mom just works alot and we have opposite schedules so when im here she isnt and vice versa. Although i do work its not like i talk to them because they’re my friends, most of them dont like me because i can never remember where to put things and im constantly asking for help.

This morning I was sitting with a group and they were having a “playful” argument about which one amongst them got the most play. They were talking about people hitting on them, flings they’ve had, relationships they’ve been in, etc. They all had something to account for and as I was sitting there watching it all, I realized, I literally cannot relate to them at all! I started thinking about other conversations I’ve had and how the loneliest and most “to themselves” people Ive talked to told me about how they have had bfs or been in relationships or even had sex. Ive literally done none of that. No guy has ever confessed to me, no one chases after me, even girls don’t want me??

And some people might say “make the first move”, but Ive confessed to two guys before and the first one rejected me and the second one didn’t take it seriously. I was considering trying to maybe try and make a move on a guy I find cute, but I realized, why am I always the one chasing? Why does no one ever chase after me? What is wrong with me?

And I don’t think it’s because of my looks because people (mainly girls) have told me I’m pretty before, so why the hell am I struggling 🫠

I’m a university student, 23 years old and a couple hours ago my friend told me they don’t think we should be friends anymore. 

They are my only friend. I got along well with their family. They are the reason I got sobered up and went to college. I owe them my whole life. 

A week ago I pretended to be jealous and jokingly out my hand over the back of their hair and said “don’t look at that person”. We sometimes pretend to be jealous of each other, they do it more than I do. But today when I went over their house they told me they don’t think we should be friends anymore because of this. 

I feel like such an asshole and a jackass. I can’t believe I will never see them again. I don’t know why I did it. I wish I never did. I love this friend with all my heart and now it’s all over. I told them I would go to therapy and work on myself. 

They told me this is not the first mistake I made. I’ve also made an inappropriate joke for example. 
What I’d like is for your input. I know I’m an asshole, but why? And how can I change? I don’t want this experience to ever happen again. I’m still in shock. What can I do to be a better and more respectful person? I know a lot of people will hate me and say I don’t deserve them, and I agree with you. But I don’t want to be this person anymore.

Now that I actually try making friends it hurts even more cause people think im really funny and every joke i make when we are in a group makes everyone laugh and people enjoy talking to me when im social but the problem is that i still feel like a background character,

 when we aren't in group like when people have free time they never come to me to hang out they dont even ask my number or something they like me but dont want to be alone with me and it fucking hurts to know that they like my presence but dont really care or notice when im not there or atleast dont feel like inviting me

These days its hurts even more cause i wanted to ask a girl out in the group to solve that problem and also cause I like her but she got back with her ex and it made me feel so bad i started using sharp objects to hurt myself and im thinking of using one to end myself cause if feels like nobody will ever like me at this point ive only known failure in every aspect of my life so i dont see the point of being alive anymore.

I also forgot to add that the group im talking about is 17-23 year olds that live together cause we all have some sort of mental problems and need more care then normal",lonely,it hurts even more,2022-05-28 01:08:09

I have my days, where I'm really down, feel lonley and that no one cares about me. I don't have someone to talk to about my problems. No one I would really trust with it. No one to hug, or who would help me to get out of this mood.

I just think: ""I don't need someone to hold my hand and get up, like those weak little people, who have someone to talk and lean to. I can do stuff on my own and work on my own without any help.""

I know how it sounds, but it helps me to get back on the track. And I would never act that way to people that I'm superior or something, but the thought really makes a diffrence and helps me to get back.  
Just think, it's way cooler and epic if you climb out the hole on yourselve rather with help of someone. To be independend.

i mean, it makes sense, what's best than not being alone anymore huh? what's best than having a person who'll always believe in you? someone that understands you perfectly and loves you for being you, for existing, someone who is happy that you exist...someone whom you'll try everyday to make happy and to love him always, someone who wants to go places with you and do stupid stuff with you just cause its you and its fun...someone who'd make you feel like you are enough and that you are worth it and that you finally dont have to be alone against everything...he'd make you feel like you're not alone

i dont want to be alone...its always been like that...the only time that it wasnt, i was with him, he made me feel so happy and loved...he made me feel like i did have a reason to wake up everyday to do the same things over and over again, he was there with me, and that was enough for me

he made me feel like i deserved to be loved like everyone else...after he left, i was by myself again, i never liked it, since i was a kid i just hated being by myself, but it was different...it felt like a hole that i could never fill was there, and the thought that it was my fault that it was there was just, horrible, cause, lets be real, it was my fault...he even told my why, and i've tried to fix it ever since but it just, it feels like it was for nothing

im tired of feeling like this everyday...sometimes i dream about a guy who tells me he loves me and i just dont know how to feel...maybe sorrow, because even after trying, the only thing i have, to feel like im not alone in this life, its just my mind...i always want to hug him and just cry, but he's never here...i always wish someone was...i wish someone understood finally...",lonely,i dont wanna be unlovable anymore,2022-05-27 15:12:38

Does anyone know any WFH companies that hire a lot of people and hire quickly?

I would look elsewhere but I am in an extreme remote area and dont have transportation and no immediate family or friends to take me to work.

I am currently an 18 year old senior in high school and a month away from graduation. My loneliness is getting pretty bad and it is affecting me a lot. 

My best friend of 4 years recently made a new best friend and chose her over me. She doesn’t want to be friends anymore. 

My other best friend of 8 years has other friends and we don’t really talk anymore. 

The only other person I had a connection with, was someone I had to end things with because he lied about his age to me. I miss him so much.

I'm lying in bed, throat sore from coughing, and hungry despite not being able to keep food down. My head hurts and my energy is gone. I keep thinking back to when I was young and my mom would take care of me when I was sick. Bringing me food, rubbing my feet and back, scratching my head... I can remember how she would look at me and I could see on her face that she cares about me and wants me to feel better. If I was down with a stomach bug she would make me up a little bed on the bathroom floor and we'd camp out with ice cubes and crackers. Now I live six hours away and I have nobody around me. I tried bringing some blankets into the bathroom like in the old days but it was just cold and wasn't even remotely the same.

It's just a little bug, I'll be fine in a few days, really. but I can genuinely say the worst part of this experience is that I'm all alone. I'm not lying here wishing for a mommy gf or any of that shit, but I can't stop thinking about what it would be like if I lived with someone that worried about me and wanted me to feel better.  It's just the little things like having to feel my stomach turning and my headache start pounding again because I stood up to get some more water. It would mean the world to me if I just had someone I could ask to bring me a cup of water. I would feel a hundred times better if I had someone to sit next to me and hold my hand or something, just so I know I'm not alone if things get worse. I think I'd like it if the roles were switched too. It makes my heart ache when I think about taking care of someone when they're sick. I'd love to be appreciated and depended on in their time of need. I'd do everything for them that my mom did for me and I'd love every second of it. The thought of me being able to make someone feels better makes my heart swell but then I realize it's probably not gonna happen and I feel worse than before.

Thinking about the past 30s years and feel like I’m so alone and so lost. I admit I haven’t had a real date besides the casual movie/dinner time I had with a friend. As a young child I was bullied by eldest brother for my weight problems. I was always sick when I was young due to respiratory issues. I missed alot of days of school, was always alone never had any real friends. What made things hard was I was a super shy and didn’t talk much as I always got super nervous with girls and still do at my current age.

I tried to date in middle/high school and didn’t have much success. Never went to school dances, no prom dates anything’s like that. I always wanted to date but never had an opportunity because the girls I liked never game a me a chance. After graduating high school I kinda put dating to the way side as I was trying to decide what to do for the rest of my life. I worked a few part time jobs until I landed working with a fruit tech company and spent a majority of my 20s and early 30s of my life with pretty much the status quoa no dating even I did try a few times.

I tried online dating at its early days including phone chat lines where sometimes I would get connections but it would be more sexual nature. I still have my health problems and weight problems and I feel so lonely I feel like I’m dying inside. I see all these shows and movies where people date and stuff and I say to myself why can’t I have that too. What grinds my gears a lot is I hear certain groups of men treat women badly and they get hurt and I feel bad for them. These other groups say they wish to find a man who has a heart and will treat them good, yet when they get a chance they ignore it and go back to tried and true I guess because they want that type of relationship or something.

I had some sexual experience where I had a casual thing but nothing that would count as actual penetration as it was mainly oral which I enjoy going down on women it my kink. Now I’m at my mid point of my life and feel like I wasted so much. Feel like I missed so many life opportunities that I feel so bad. I wish I could change the clock and fix all that. Unfortunately that’s not possible and I’ll have to deal with the consequences. I want to date, I want to have sex, I want to feel happy, want to feel like a regular life as any other people. Perhaps I have some emotional problems that have to be confronted before I can move or something anything is possible.

I want to make one thing clear I have no intentions of hurting myself or anyone else. These are my demons and I need to confront them. Lately I tried to seek female companionship and it seems to go ok but feels like the women loose interest. I don’t know all I know Is I want to feel happy, want to experience what life has to offer. I have found a real good job last year that makes a solid living and now I want experience what life has to offer.

855,Maleficent-Mine3818,1653616819,1,"I don’t want to do this for the next 5 years. I spent a lot of time focusing on myself, gaining insight on me somehow it has made me more isolated. Ignorance is bliss, we live in a culture that prefers instant gratification, easy and hedonism. I guess working through my baggage has taught me, healing and improvement never ends. Also it’s not easy, you reap the rewards down the line.

I have a knack of choosing partners that are emotionally unavailable. The moment I open up, I’m honest about my anxiety and depression where it stems from, it scares them off. I do open up too quickly, but I don’t like the casual time wasting interactions that others find safety in. That’s the problem. 

I want friends I can grow with. I don’t want to sit around playing video games, drinking or doing drugs. Modern escapism is dull, I’d rather reenact a thick fantasy book in the living room or hike or do yoga. Gain new experiences, sometimes people with these same desires can be shallow so then I’m again unfulfilled trying to connect. I want to build friendships with people who encourage me to get better (and vice versa) however I continue to meet people who want company in their misery, don’t want to have hard conversations and only want to be surrounded with the agreeable of their flawed thoughts- no desire for new perspectives. 

Romantically, I despise the lack of introspection to know the difference between infatuation and something that can be built upon. I want marriage and kids but the pickings these day, everyone wants a “spark” love at first sight. However these are red flags for me, I see love as a responsibility, that changes through time- it won’t always be butterflies and intensity. When someone says it’s all about feelings I immediately think they’ll leave when I get sick or things don’t go as plan. Feelings are so fleeting and unreliable in making decisions of spending the rest of my life with someone.

867,DreamLauncher,1653611250,1,"Something to listen to while you read: [https://youtu.be/PA3J6Kl9J2A](https://youtu.be/PA3J6Kl9J2A). This song is very meaningful to me and goes really well with the story. 

Halfway into 2019, I'd say I was the happiest I've ever been. I had a job I enjoyed, amazing friends, and best of all, I had been in a relationship for 2.5 years.

My then gf decided to study abroad, so I saved up money to go with her and try to find a job there. It was a huge step for both of us, as we were going to move in together and also live in a foreign country. We made the huge step and everything went perfectly for a couple of months. I hadn't been very successful at finding a job there, due to political reasons and then the pandemic hitting as well. It made me feel very depressed and I could see it affected her as well. She always tried cheering me up and encouraging me to keep looking for a job, but to no use. I was just too depressed to keep going and nothing could really make me feel better. It was hard enough for me to find a job with the political situation that was going on at the moment and the pandemic just made it impossible for me.

We eventually managed to get through her first year at uni with incredible financial support from our parents. We then went back to our home country during Summer vacation and she decided to break up with me after 3.5 years of relationship. She told me to get used to the idea that we'll never be together again. I couldn't understand how after we'd been together for so long, in what I at least considered to be a healthy and happy relationship, she could say something like that. I couldn't understand how anyone could say something like that to someone they love. I was devastated. I was already depressed due to not being able to find a job abroad, we were also in the middle of the pandemic and then I also had to cope with the loss of an amazing relationship. We tried to stay friends many times after we broke up. While she was still here and also after she left abroad again to continue her studies. It never worked out.

It took me a really long time to process all that, and I even went to therapy for it, but by the time I started therapy I was already feeling better and started getting back on my feet, so I'm not sure it helped much. The last time we talked was at the beginning of this year. We were both in a group of close friends of which I mostly introduced her to and since she decided that we shouldn't be a part of each other's lives anymore, I thought of having a chat with all of them, including her, to make a new group without her, so that I could cut all ties with her. It didn't make sense to have her in the group anymore anyway. She was all the way there and didn't have contact with any of us, she started a new life there, made new friends etc. and she agreed that it was a good idea to not be in the same groups anymore.

I'm doing pretty well now, as my life seems to be back to how it was before I met her, which was back in 2016. I have everything I need but it's boring as hell. I barely find excitement in anything, and when I do, I feel like I have no one to share it with. All my close friends are in relationships and I rarely ever ask them if they want to do something together, because they're usually with their s.o. and I feel like I'd bother them if I did. Sometimes we all hang out and there's this intrusive thought that I'm the only one in the group who's not in a relationship, and it makes me feel horrible.

I tried online dating once I felt ready to be with someone else, because it was pretty much the only way I could meet new people during a pandemic, but didn't really get anything out of it. It mostly made me feel unwanted and like I was trying much harder to find that special someone than any of the girls I matched with. I got ghosted a lot and barely got any texts back. Beauty no longer impresses me, since most of the prettiest women I've talked to turned out to be shallow or have really shitty personalities. This also holds me off from approaching any girl I find cute, since I'm afraid their personality might not be as good as their looks. I could say I look pretty good too, or at least average. I don't go to the gym, so I'm not muscular, nor skinny, but I take care of myself, I have a good sense of humour and plenty of hobbies I'm focusing on. Probably my biggest downside is that I have crooked teeth. There's not much I can do about it, so I really hate that thing about me.

I'm not even into dating. Never been. I find the whole process of meeting someone completely new and taking the time to get to know them really exhausting, especially as an adult when all you wanna do after work is rest and focus on your hobbies. I just ""waited for the right person"", as a lot of people say. I was friends with her before we got together. That relationship was the best thing I had, even though it was the only one. The level of intimacy and the amount of hobbies we shared was unmatched. I haven't been able to find another girl whom I would share so much with ever since. Sometimes I cry before I sleep, imagining how my life could be if I was in a relationship like the one I used to have. All I really want is to have someone with similar hobbies who I can also be intimate with. Someone I could hold, kiss and sleep with. Somehow, this just feels unattainable.

After my ex broke up with me, she told me I'm the most loving person she knows. It makes me wonder if I lost the only true love I'll ever get.",lonely,Lost all hope for finding true love,2022-05-27 10:27:30

874,aksarahhh,1653607710,1,"Let’s call my ex-best friend Lucy. She and I have been best friends for 10+ years (over half our lives). A few months ago she had been in a horrible funk because she lied on a job application and they initially wanted to hire her but found out she didn’t have the right certifications so they had to rescind the offer. Around that time a guy she was kinda dating decided that he didn’t want to be with her because he has so many family responsibilities and wouldn’t be able to give her the time and attention she deserves. 

When all this happened I started to realize how much I was there for her during her hard times and during her happy times, be she doesn’t do the same for me. She would make condescending comments when I would get a good grade in school or get accepted to a great internship. I talked to her about how I felt and that I felt like her therapist she only hung out with when feeling sad/unhappy and she would always hang out with other people when she was feeling happy. I understand that probably meant she felt safe and comfortable with me, but I felt I was putting a lot more effort into the relationship than she was. After talking with her, she pretty much accused me of being a horrible friend and then blocked me on all forms of social media. 

I then reached out to a mutual best friend, who goes to college out of state, (let’s call her Sarah) we have to get some advice and to ask her to check on Lucy and make sure she was doing okay. She said Lucy was fine and didn’t really engage in texting with me. Over the past 2 months I texted Sarah as I normally would about life and school, but her responses were always very short and she didn’t engage in anything I sent. A few days ago I asked Sarah when she was coming back home for the summer and she told me she already moved everything to where she goes to school. I was pretty surprised she didn’t tell me she came back to where I live for a while and then decided to move without telling me.  I guess I shouldn’t be surprised since she pretty much stopped communicating with me. 

I haven’t heard anything from Lucy in over two months and all my other friends in that friend group stopped talking to me. I’m not going to say I’m super surprised they decided to follow her since she is kinda the “leader” and everyone must do what she says or get kicked out. 

Maybe I dodged a bullet in a way because I’ve realized that they haven’t been as good of friends as I thought. But now I really only have a few people that I call my friends and one of them lives in a different state. I used to hang out with Lucy and Sarah all the time and go on hikes and stuff, but now I don’t have anyone to go with. I feel really lonely and end up just sitting around my house not doing much everyday.

I had no fashion style and I lacked a lot of social common sense at the time of middle school and high school. I didn't care about school and ditched school a lot due to family problems, poor family, bullies and stress. I'd use gaming to distract myself from the real world and ignore reality. I've missed out so much of my high school/middle school social life and activities. I've had many crushes but never stood a chance to date them because of how inexperienced I was when it comes to talking to people in general. I've always been a shy person and I have huge social anxiety(Lack of social life and bullies from school).

&amp;#x200B;

I told myself that if I dream myself being in high school/middle school again, I will share my personal life here and today, I woke from from another dream. This is probably like my 20+ times that I dream of myself back in my young age talking to my crushes in middle/high school and spending time with people there. I dreamed of myself actually having FRIENDS and enjoying time with them. Dreamed of myself dating one of my crushes and dreamed of myself having a life back in middle/high school. It always makes me thinking how much better I would be today if things were different back then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am still a virgin and never cuddle with anyone before or experience passionate physical touch. I don't care about losing my virginity, I only care about finding the one for me. Someone who I could share my love with and spend the rest of my life together with. I'm currently jobless by choice. I have had 2 serious committed online relationships but both resulted of me getting CHEATED on, financially used, used and emotionally abused. Both were females. I've always been a straight guy and still attracted to girls only mostly. However, after those two very poor relationships, it makes me scared of girls because I don't want to get feelings for another one to end in the same way. Keep in mind, I don't date many as I've only dated 2 in my life as a 26 years old person. I allow feelings of love carefully and take the relationships very serious. It leads me to not trusting females anymore. . . and maybe start trying out the males although I'm not really attracted to them. I know not all girls are the same but I got hard trauma from the past 2 relationships and it's not easy to get that mindset off. I met many online guy friends who are super nice to me and have the personality that I'm attracted to but just not attracted to them physically. I'm willing to sacrifice physical attraction for loyal love and caring because I'm that desperate. I don't think I'm ugly physically, however I'm also not the best looking (5'5 125LB). I've lossed all motivation to work and do anything since I was cheated on. I've been trying to do other things on my computer to cope and get by but it doesn't help all the time.

I just didn't know how to socialize, I wondered what to say or do when around other people. I just overthought it and decided to just not say anything to anyone. My parents worried and encouraged to try to be more social and that's when I tried to get myself out there. It has been a massive disaster for numerous reasons that I just can't understand. Some people treat me like absolute trash and don't care to listen to my opinions on anything while others have this odd thing where they see me as some sort of wise sage or genius just because I, seemingly, know a lot but they don't respect me in a personal capacity either, they just respect what I know if that makes sense.

So explaining all the fucked up aspects of why i feel like this roght now is to much, the essence is this.

I have trouble with experiencing warmth and love so i feel kinda cold, alone and Hurt on a regular bases. 
(I was bullied all elementery school and my dad was not giving me the love and affection i needed at the same time, my parents were devorced btw)

Anyway (already getting to deep into the whole story haha)   I broke up with my girlfriend two months ago en i spoke after 5 weeks and i expected her to be still sad instead she told me she had sex with another guy and she felt like she was over me which realy Hurt and makes you question the meaning of all your memories etc. Well that feeling went away after realizing it shouldnt bother me and indecide what is meaningfull to me and what isnt.

Am sorry for all this bs it was just building up to this :

I went for a drink with my ex not my most recent but before her so like a year ago now and i was just gonna give her some clothes back and have a good talk and go home but instead she went home with me and we slept together and she stayed the whole day after and i havent been so happy as i was that day in a long time. She knows me there was love and affection hugging being nice to eachoter it was exactly what i needed, a little love and appreciation.

I did not at all have a lot of contact with her before this event and since we know a relationsship would not work we decided not to stay in touch after this or not talk for a while. Its been a week and i havent stopped thinking about it, it made my daily life a lot harder after feeling that great for a day. I wanna know how she feels about it but i dont want to disturb our agreement. I Just want to get rid of this extreme feeling of lonelyness i am clueles. 
She is so pretty it literaly makes me sick to think i will not be having more of these good times with her.

About 2 weeks ago, I left the house to spend time with other people (beyond work and food) for the first time since before COVID. Spent 3 hours with a group of 6 strangers. Said about 10 sentences. Learned their names and 1 interest a piece. Watched them fly kites.  

No one talked to me directly despite my attempts at initiating one-on-one conversation while we were watching. Just made me re-cement my idea that I have no hope in finding new friends. I'm just too fucking awkward and weird, I don't have any relatable hobbies or interests, I'm too serious all the time, and yet also have absolutely no sense of adventure or any willingness to leave my comfort zone. I'm not at all attractive or interesting, funny or confident. There is nothing about me that says ""I'm friend material, come talk to me!"" more that ""I'm a weird creep! Avoid me at all costs!""

I wake up at morning, go to school, spend time with my classmates/friends during breaks, go home and spend time in my room studying more or less, occasionally playing video games or just watching youtube, reddit etc. yesterday is when started to feel this. Yesterday was the the last bell day in which we celebrated our last remaining days in gymnasium. It was fun and quite sad that we won't get to spend anymore time besides the last days. We also had to go to a homestead the same evening but I had to miss it because I was failing math (I was always bad at it but this is the first time I was failing it) and the day before the last bell I found out that the math teacher decided to give me a test tomorrow (friday) for which I had two days to prepare. After last bell I went to the teacher and she prepared the main things of the topics I had to study for and this would've given me the night to go to the homestead but after I returned home my mom was like there is no way you can go there due to the test, I even tried to explain that I paid my money for it and she told screw the money, you need to study, spend all the time you have and study. My dad also talked to me but in a much nicer way and explaining the situation simply and I understood that but either way I wouldn't have studied late at night and also I would have probably returned home at normal time like past 9AM and this is the last time I could have gotten to spend time with my class in a personal way and I won't get another chance at this. Now, you'll probably say that I'm 18 and I have the choice to decide what I want to do and what not but if I don't go by my mom's rules she'll get fucking pissed and start ranting day long about not only why I'm making the wrong choices by not agreeing to her rules but about everything like how important studying is, how I never listened to her and how all of her relatives are good people and achieved a lot and I'm at the bottom with my dad which makes it not worth the risk (even my dad does everything to prevent it). This shitty situation made me realize the routine in which I'm stuck and all I want right now is to socialize more but more specifically recreate going to the homestead because it would have been really special to me but I know I won't get the chance to do it. Today after all of this made me feel the slight burn out that I'm having, it's not like I can't physically get out of bed but it's just so hard to study anymore or do anything productive...

932,Fine_choco3683,1653581437,1,"Had abusive mother, her husband molested me for years. She married me off when I was 20 to a man of 40. He was a fraud and ran away from home after 5 years of marriage when I was 25 and had 3 kids. 

Living in an islamic south Asian country, after taking divorce, I spent 7 years struggling to survive and then met a man who loved me enough to marry me. He is 6 years younger than me.

But things are going bad. He had a passive income via guest house that got sold during COVID. He never found a job again and is jobless from last 2 years. I am the only one earning. I buy his clothes and food too other than paying rent and bills and everything under the sun.

He sleeps all day and watches TV all night while I am getting deeper and deeper in debts. Begging other men to lend money untill I could get a raise in salary. 

I work 3 jobs from 9am to 2am. Kids are getting neglected and he doesn't care much. He doesn't scold them or anything but he also doesn't treat them as I want him to. Kids are teen-agers now and they need friendship from parents. I don't have time and he doesn't care. 

No family to love us, no friends to talk to. I feel suicidal and depressed. From last one week I am seriously thinking to get rid of this pathetic life. 

I can't divorce him because in this country people will eat me and my teen daughters alive if we don't have protection of a man. And no, I don't have money to move abroad. My eldest son is gonna be 15 soon, girls are 13 and 12.

934,Archon_of_Prism,1653579822,1,"There is a man I met nearly two years ago. He responded to a post I made challenging people to talk to me without asking me who I am or reading any previous posts. I would do the same in this challenge. This was because I was tired of people judging me by my age and gender. I was tired of being talked down to and others trying to cater to my perceived masculinity. I just wanted to be talked to as the person I am and this was my way to do it. Little did I know the man I would come to fall head over heels for would be one of the people to message me over it. For several months we didn't know each others ages and we just treated each other as equals.

The fact that I can remember this is unusual. I have a strange memory and by strange I mean entirely dysfunctional. I can not willingly remember most memories. I can remember fragments of them but not the whole thing. This isn't necessarily abnormal until it starts being my whole memory down to just yesterday and even earlier today. Rarely is it can I remember any parts of my life. If prompted by something else I can briefly put together the memories but they fall apart soon after and I can't even remember that I put the memory together it is only from others that I know that. 

I have hurt many friends and even my own family because of my memory. I can't remember birthdays. Often times I wont be able to remember significant moments in my friendships and sometimes I forget who my friends are. I retain a familiar feeling about them but I can not remember anything about them. 

In the past year I've also opened up about these problems to my mother. She tries to hide it but, after the realisation set in that I was serious that I can not remember nearly any of my childhood, the hurt shows in her eyes. The amount of damage I have caused with my memory is immense. There have been things I've said and arguments had that ruined friendships that I didn't remember. 

About 5 years ago I started shutting the world out because it became too difficult to see the hurt I was causing. I pushed my friends and family away, isolating myself. I let only one or two people in at a time and even them I still kept them at a distance out of a fear that I would forget. Then after 3 years of doing that I decided to start letting the world back in. Living the lonely life I had been trying to live was hurting myself and those I was afraid to forget. 

This is when I started using reddit and met the man who end up being the absolute sweetheart I didn't know I needed in my life. Life is never so easy though, he lives in a country in Europe and I live in the United States. When we first met he was getting over some past trauma and a rough break up. He and I grew together as we had our own struggles but continued to lean on each other. At times we had to convince each other that we weren't burdening the other person. I helped him see a part of himself that he had suppressed and he helped me be okay with being me. 

We have come a long way and one of my biggest fears now is losing him. He has become a part of my life whether or not we will ever be able to be together. He is special to me and I believe it's demonstrated by the fact I can remember our discussions. I can remember how we met. I can remember the way he and I have grown because of each other. 

I write this both to let others who may have similar issues with memories and loneliness know that with the right person things can be different at least with that person. I am also writing this as a record because although I remember now there is no guarantee I will remember the wonderful part of my life that is this man in the future. I am writing this so I can know how much he means to me if I forget and so that he can know how much he means to me even if I forget. 

Memories are fickle things one moment they may be there and the next they're gone. To those who have memories of joy, memories of laughter, and memories of surprise take a moment to appreciate the memories you still have. If you are like me and the majority of your memories, which are few in number, are of pain, regret, and shame then I understand what you are going through and hope you can find someone or something that brings you joy, safety, or comfort like had the fortune to. 

I am still quite lonely as I can't remember those who used to be my friends but at least I have someone. 

As a final note to me and the man I love if I forget remember this,

 I remember when we shared our vulnerabilities and strengths. I remember the long nights that you made easier because it felt like you where there with me. I remember how I told my other friend about how wonderful you are. I remember how I told my mother about you and I was afraid she wouldn't accept you. I hope this day will never come but if I ever forget I am so sorry. If I ever hurt you by forgetting please know it wasn't my intention.

I come here every once in a while to vent, and i delete the post later on.

Loneliness is terrible, truly, until you experience it for so long that you actually become comfortable with it, and actually come to realize that's not even the worst of it, after 3 decades of this thing we call life i've come to realize the truly worst part for me was how it has always been shit! Like literally every stage of my life sucked bad! Not one part was normal! Every experience you're supposed to have in your childhood, teenage years, 20s, i did not have, not to mention the absolute fucked experiences i did have.

Think i'm exaggerating? I once decided to try therapy, and all i knew about therapy was that people sat in a chair crying while telling their stories. Well.. i told the therapist about my childhood and teenage years, she cried, lol, and described it as brutal.

I'm honestly just tired of being tired, if i know for a fact that i can never be happy, why not just check out already? I'm sooo fucking good at handling so much pain all the time, but no one should experience this much pain, it's no way to live.

I would love for things to change, it would be amazing for once to have even a bit of happiness and acceptance, but that just seems to always be out of reach.

 I'm alone. I'm 23 and I live with my parents and I have done since I left university back in early 2020. I never really had many friends growing up but I had small but strong network of people surrounding me how I felt like would be with me for life but over the time I was at university, which was a significant distance away from where I grew up, these relationships suffered and I lost all but 1 of my childhood friends. This 1 friend stuck with me after university and I'd meet up with him every month or so but he ended up growing away from me, he became really distant and didn't want to speak to me much anymore. One day I called him out on it and we argued. I asked him if we'd met today rather than as kids, would he still want to be my friend. He refused to answer. That was over a year and a half ago and we've not spoke since. 
 The only friends I had left were the one's from university and I stated that was quite far away. I do try and keep these relationships up with messaging online and visiting when I can but I can't afford to keep going back (I haven't met up with any of them in 7 months) and I find that if I don't message them, they don't really message me ever. It makes me wonder if perhaps they'd prefer it if I just left them alone, maybe they'd be better without me. 
 I hate myself. I don't think there's any doubting that, I find myself disgusting and I think there is something about me that is unquestionably broken. I feel broken. I look at myself in the mirror and I hate what I see, I see the things I say and write and I hate it. I sometimes meet people either at work or online and I want to get to know them better but I don't want to a be a burden on anyone more, I can't ask someone to have the misfortune of knowing me. 
 My parents try to help and I appreciate that, but I don't think they have the understanding of either me or the situation to help much. My mother always tells me all I need is a girlfriend and I'll be fine, but I know that is almost certainly a terrible idea. If I had a SO, all of that pressure would be put on them. I don't want to make someone feel like they can't live their life, have their own hobbies, friends, life outside of me because of this problem that I caused myself, no body deserves that burden. 
 I don't know what to do next to be honest and I've struggled to find any solutions anywhere, I feel as if I'm trapped in my own world that no one will ever understand. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be, maybe I deserve this. I just don't know.",lonely,2 years alone with no path forward.,2022-05-26 23:02:23

As I got older, I found myself pulling away from everything and everyone. I felt I needed a break from people. It felt good to have some relief from the demands of the world.

But now, I'm retired (basically they fired me), and divorced. I still keep in close contact with one of my kids (the other one decided to cut me out of her life when I left her mom). I had to move 5 hours away from them all because I couldn't afford to pay rent and my oppressive support payments. So I'm in my mother's basement.

So, I'm ashamed of my living situation and of myself in general. In the last year, I have been spending more and more time alone - I often go days on end alone here in my little basement.

I have all but given up on being involved in any kind of romantic relationship. I haven't been so much as hugged by anyone in at least 4 or 5 years. 

I guess it is a case of 'be careful what you wish for'. 

The loneliness comes in waves - I can distract myself with a good tv show or whatever but I'm starting to wonder what the long-term effects of this self-imposed isolation will be on my psyche. For example - the thought of going out and doing something causes me so much anxiety now - the smallest little thing can cause me to retreat to my bed, medicate myself, and sleep yet another day away.

But fuck it, im way past the limit of feeling sorry for myself. Humans are social beings, and we need to be able to talk to someone to feel less lonely. 

So I'm done letting loneliness consume me. I thought of creating a groupchat where similar people can come together and then just talk. Just talk to another goddamn human being. We have the power of the internet. People millions of miles away can connect now.

Sure, I could’ve put myself out there more, but I’ve been through a lot of shit, like having an emotionally abusive ex and emotionally abusive platonic friend that I recently cut off contact with. On the one hand I’m so angry with people for the way I’ve been treated, the way I’ve allowed people to walk all over me and tell me what to do. The way people continue to treat me. I can’t trust anyone right now. I have to do that to protect myself. But at the same time, I feel more alone than ever. I have pretty much no friends. Maybe a couple people I could send a text to, but that’s it. But seeing other people getting married and blah blah, I just can’t help but feel angry, terrified, that that will never happen for me.

I've always been more of a worrier than him and it's kind of obvious and I genuinely hope he's alright. The reason we broke up was coz he just felt burdened and depressed by having to lie to me about loving me even though he did genuinely love me at first, life just...gets to you. It happens. I've asked many times if i was ever the reason and he's always reassured me i never was. He tells me the opposite, that I'm the sweetest and most loving person he knows, and the only one who checks on him and tells me I shouldn't be doing it but I do it out of worry mostly.

I've always have been kinda anti-social cause I'd prefer being alone rather than having parties or meetings but sometimes I need to 'recharge' my social battery but that just lasts a few days and then I feel tired of interactions again. 

I've had theraphy and my depression levels decressed a lot but the thought of me being lonely and not being able to meet new people or flirting with someone due to my lack of social habilities is making me feel so sad... 

It has been like 2 months since I feel like I don't deserve to date someone and that I'm not that interesting enough to catch the attention so I feel like I don't even have to try it anymore (plus my  attachment disorders from my childhood that keep me off from any physical interaction but that's another subject)... 

I have never had a relationship before (plus that makes me feel like some kind of loser haha it's absurd I know pretty well) and I also think being an inexperienced person on these matters makes me so boring and not so interesting.

I tried to talk about this with my therapist but their solution is to try hook up with someone and yeah that's practically the main issue here lol well i guess that's all for now Oooh i almost forgot that I've been listening to songs that are kinda romantic-melancolic and i can't stop the urge to long for a relationship also the smallest thought about something romantic makes me want to cry and I really cry just seeing something beautiful just like Elliot seeing the sunset (insert that scene reference from Bedazzled pls).

My daydreaming is so vivid that it feels like reality, and when I stop thinking about it I cry even more about the fact that I’ll never experience such a loving touch from another woman.

I imagine her calling me pet names like “sweetie”, “darling”, “honey” and “my love”, and my heart aches whilst I imagine someone that will call me that. I do this every single day, and not just when I’m sobbing from my flashbacks at night, but also when I’m feeling stressed or alone in the day.

Time slowly trudges along and we expect to have a little one early in our relationship. I ignore many red flags ranging from her getting cold feet to finding her leaning back towards to her sexual interest in girls (communicating with a ex female lover). I blame all these problems on how crazy her life was before she met me so I do what I do best and see the “good” in the situation. Fast forward to today and I feel the loneliest I have felt ever. I have been “touched” by her one time and that was early early in the relationship when she stayed at my house for the first time. So 9 whole years of yearning for physical and emotional support from my partner in this so called life. Yes, I have asked and talked to her about why this is the case and it becomes awkward and blamed on our living arrangements tied to living with her parents at the time.

1010,mrsmarple85,1653536960,1,"So I just started a new job and I really enjoy the work but the environment is starting to weigh on me. I’m one of two new managers and we have 2 long rolls of cubicles. We share 12 desks among 18 people. Everyone is assigned one to share with another manager who works opposite schedule of them. This is my 6th week of work and no one has taken to the time to assign me a desk so every day I just hop around to an empty one. The guy who is also new got a desk. I chalk this up to him being personable and everyone talks to him. I guess I’m just too quiet for my own good. I find it hard to talk to anyone there cuz every time I try it’s like they look at me like why are you talking. Only one of the managers has been cordial and taken to the time to show me how to do everything I need. 

It’s just starting to affect me because even though I only work 4 days, it’s hard to be somewhere 11-12 hours a day with basically bare minimum interaction and then have to go home to an empty lonely house 😕 it almost makes me want to go back to my old job cuz at least I had some people who would talk to me there.",lonely,Am I overreacting?,2022-05-26 13:49:20
1011,Jurez1313,1653536617,1,"I never initiate contact with people, I only ever talk to people if they start the convo. I tell myself it's because no one ever wants to talk to me when I reach out, but really it's to save myself from rejection. Can't be rejected if you never do anything to reject. 

I get frustrated at the stupidest thing. Die in a video game? Anger. Get called an idiot by some random guy online? Anger. Get told I'm wrong when I'm not? Anger. Anger so strong I can't help but bite myself to the point of bruising, scratching myself hard enough to draw blood, or hit myself on the head hard and long enough to give myself a headache.  

Most recently, anger at my new kitten - only 2 and a half months old - for continuously trying to climb my leg. I went full streamer mode and picked him up by his belly and tossed him into his bed a couple feet away. He got me good, tho. Hand still stings. Hope it gets infected. I deserve it for mistreating an animal like that. 

I get passive aggressive with co workers when they try to tell me how to do my job, or call me out for not doing my job. I do only the bare minimum amount of work I can get away with without being fired, and spend the rest of my time on reddit. 

I hire women to have sex with me and pretend to care about me or find me in any way attractive for an hour every few months. Women who likely don't have a choice but to sell their bodies because the patriarchy makes it impossible for them to earn a fair wage. Hell, one such woman was actively high, and I still got on with it anyway. I sicken me. 

I have a million other garbage traits. I'm an idiot who thinks he knows everything and if he doesn't, makes it up on the spot to seem smart and knowledgeable. I constantly finish people's sentences. Im always just waiting for my turn to speak. If someone believes something I disagree with I immediately think I am better than them. I'm judgmental, hot headed, short-tempered, boring, stupid, unfunny, financially irresponsible, immature, ugly, fat, lazy, lonely, agoraphobic, and a serial whiner. Hence this post. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I just feel so damned miserable and I have literally no one to talk to. And it's no wonder that's the case, considering how I treat people. As if they exist only to help me with my problems, to the point I never start conversations at all, and as soon as I'm done talking about myself, the conversation ends. I don't blame anyone for ghosting my toxic ass like all my recently-gained gamer friends have done recently. Man it was a great feeling logging on to discord for the first time in a week to notice all your friends had removed you...  

Oh well, I don't expect anyone to read this. Or care about an animal abusing piece of garbage narcissist like me. I hope I don't wake up tomorrow. Be so much easier than taking responsibility for my actions, or taking it into my own hands - both of which I'm too lazy, scared, and incompetent to actually do.",lonely,"I'm so, so alone.

Right now I live with my best friend of 10 years, and her current partner practically lives here. In the 10 years we've been friends she's never been single more than a couple months, I've gone on a couple dates with 2 people but otherwise been single the whole time. It's hard to watch them be happy, or even be happy for her, because it's the 4th time she's been ""in love."" I have never been in love or had anyone love me before.
At this point it's humiliating, and I worry if I ever do meet someone they'll be turned off by my lack of experience. I feel like there must be something about dating I'm just completely missing, or that there's something very wrong with me that everyone's been too polite to tell me.

I can’t approach women in person because they usually either ignore me or tell me to go away. So, my only choice is using dating apps. Predictably, I’ve gotten nowhere no matter how many apps I try or how much money I spend on extra features.

The closest I’ve come to having a partner was a girl I met on a pen pal website. She was Russian-American and studying in Europe at the time. At that point in time, I was suicidal and very emotionally vulnerable since I couldn’t access my anti-depressants. We started talking and would voice chat/FaceTime and we grew close. She said she loved me and cared about me and I was the best thing that ever happened to her.

Then, she ghosts me for another man she met online because (her words) he had the money to buy her a plane ticket back to the states and I didn’t. She marries him and has a kid with him. Then they got divorced (all within the timespan of a year and a half).

I’m currently finishing my bachelor’s degree online since I can’t go on campus for practical and logistical reasons. My best friend moved away and the few other friends I have are not available to hang out with. I pretty much never leave my house and the community college was my only option (and I already graduated). 

I’m so fucking frustrated that I can’t catch a break and because it seems like no woman will give me a chance.

I made two really good friends over my first two semesters at college, but they started dating each other so the three of us don't really hang out together anymore. All I end up doing everyday after work (or all day when I'm off of work) is stay in my room, either watching youtube or doing something else completely unproductive. I don't even play video games or anything like that to engage my body at least a little bit physically, or interact with others online. I'm so used to isolation that I didn't even realize that it was the root of my depression until about a summer ago. Admittedly, I don't usually ask friends to hang out first, mainly bc I end up convincing myself that they have better things to do, or that they're busy ""bc they actually have a life."" So it ends up just becoming a pitiful and toxic cycle. Occasionally I'll exercise, either in my room or I'll go on a walk, and seldom a run. It's not that I never hang out with friends over the summer, it's just usually pretty rare, usually once, maybe twice every two weeks. I feel so out of touch with reality socially that I'm not even sure if that's a lot or not. It's usually the same three friends as well. I think my main problem is, that bc the amount of friends I have is so small, they mean so much more to me. Not saying that I don't mean anything to my friends, but I feel as if I overestimate how deep my friendship is with people, and that the ""closeness"" I feel is more or less one sided. Which isn't necessarily their fault, I just wish that I had deeper friendships with more people. And that those people also felt as if they had a deep friendship with me.

For the last few months we've had a regular client coming in who's a super nice guy, genuinely such a kind genuine soul, but I can tell he's incredibly lonely. I've learned just from him kinda confiding in me over the months that he was previously 400 pounds, never left the house due to severe social anxiety, has no friends or romantic partners, though he does have a steady job he loves. His family are all alcoholics and drug addicts (he's completely drug/alcohol free) so it's just him caring for his mentally unstable mother. He recently put his dog down, is paying all the bills for him and his mother on a very modest salary, and still the only thing he does to cope is smoke now and then. He also confided in me that he's scared to even approach people, especially women, because of his loose skin due to his weight loss. 

I guess my question is, would it be weird to give him my number or contact info? I feel like this guy just really needs a friend. I don't want him to think I pity him or anything, he's genuinely awesome! I really get so excited to see him come into the office, we have great conversations and laugh a lot, and we're close in age so it's not just like a professional relationship or anything. I'm a woman if that makes a difference? I do find him attractive but more than anything I just really like him as a person and would consider him a friend. It feels like every time he comes in he almost can't wait to get past the medical visit and get on to venting to me.

I'm just not sure how to go about this I guess? I don't consider myself a lonely person, hence why I'm trying to treat this delicately and not come off like an asshole who's looking down on him or anything. I just really think he's awesome and it fucking sucks that he has literally NO ONE to lean on. If you met him in person you'd never even guess he had severe social anxiety cause he's so good at talking to people. I've had severe social anxiety in the past and know how painful it is.

1060,stillonvampirefreaks,1653514776,1,"I’ve been lonely and solitary all my life but in about 2019 I gave up on all of my relationships completely. I was actually a little relieved when the pandemic hit because I had a built in excuse for my isolation. I haven’t spoken to anyone or hung out with anyone in any meaningful way in 4 years. I haven’t made any friends in college. I’ve never dated anyone and I’m almost 22. I can say now that I have no friends. I go to class and then go home or to the gym, that’s it. And for a long time, especially as a teenager, I blamed this on circumstances, that I’m just not an extrovert, that I’m not pretty, that I struggle to meet people because I’m so shy and anxious, that my dating pool is smaller because I’m gay and in a small town, that I’m Aspergers af so I come off as off-putting to others, etc. But all of my external excuses are falling apart as an adult. I met a woman a few months ago (in one of my classes) who tried everything she could have done to be my friend. She was extremely nice and friendly, she initiated every conversation, she asked for my number, she lived right by me, she invited me to things, and at every turn I acted like a complete and utter asshole. I didn’t show up to anything she invited me to as I self-sabotaged by staying up very late the nights before so I would always be too tired to go, and I ignored her texts for months. Eventually she (completely understandably) gave up, and I feel absolutely horrible. I know being on the other side of this it probably just came off as if I didn’t like her but honestly I thought she was great, we had a lot in common and I would’ve loved to have talked to her more. I just kind of panicked and pushed her away from me. I can admit now that this is the choice I always make, I don’t try and even when friendship is offered to me with no effort on my part I choose to push people away, despite how lonely I always am. The reality is I am terrified of other people. Vulnerability makes me feel out of control and I can’t get close to people at all. I don’t know how to let people into my life and I don’t know how to be known by others. I can’t even be around people for very long at this point as I gradually start to panic (anyone looking at my face up close, or hearing my voice for too long, or coming into my apartment is enough to set me off) because I’m afraid once anyone knows anything about who I “really am” they’ll realize the mistake they made and leave. I know this all comes from self hatred and being punished for showing any vulnerability as an abused child but it’s so deep rooted that I don’t know where to even begin trying to change. All I know is that I hate that I’m acting like this towards other people, especially people who are the opposite of me, who are warm and friendly from the get go, because I think that’s such a beautiful trait and I know it’s hard to maintain in a world like this. I feel so much guilt about how I’ve acted over the years . I did text this girl an apology (which she did not respond to, understandably, also she graduated so she won’t be around anymore) which I am happy I did because it’s better than my usual strategy of ghosting forever. I know I am the problem and I know I have to do something. I’m not sure what but I do not want to make this mistake again or be this person for the rest of my life :(",lonely,"I am the reason I’m alone.

I feel empty, but it's better than crying everyday. Trios suck so bad for me. It's never an equal balance. The other two people always tend to be closer and I feel so utterly left out and lost. It's like they don't find me interesting anymore so they don't want to talk to me. When they say that they love me, they lie. 

None of them had the actual fucking decency of wishing me on my birthday by themselves even though I wished them on theirs by myself without any need of reminders. I don't mind if anyone forgets, because I forget dates a lot too plus a lot of people don't know my birthday. But these two couldn't even send me a text by themselves, despite knowing it?? It hurt so bad. 

I also have a part in this. I always self-sabotage such friendships. It's like a part of me is always screaming within me, banging their fists inside my brain that I am not being treated equally and I always spiral. I fucking want to stop doing that. I am such a killjoy. 

I just... couldn't take it anymore. It hurts. Why can't I be the first choice for just once? Why can't people treat me equally. It affects my self esteem so fucking badly whenever this happens. It hurts so bad when I end up caring more. The people I scarcely talk to treat me better than these supposed besties. And one of them used to give me gifts, which I was grateful for but it only made me feel so unequal. I didn't want those gifts and I never asked for them. I wanted your energy and enthusiasm. That would have been enough for me. And the worst part is that I still care a lot about them and think about them, even though I will not interact with them.

1093,BenWSuggs,1653492989,1,"Sometimes it feels like a real challenge to pull myself out of bed and face the day. I have experienced so much grief and fucked up situations I'm almost afraid of what this new day will bring. I am not really ""alone"" as I have my 2 adult children staying with me while they are in school and my elderly grandfather who I caretake for. My kids have thier own lives and I really don't want to stress them out with my crazy problems and my grandfather he doesn't even recognize me half the time. So I ""feel"" alone but I'm not. If not for my kids I know I would have cashed my check a long time ago. I feel like my life is a long sad story and I'm finally reaching the final chapter and I will be glad to close it and move on. I miss my friend. We played D&amp;D together. I was the dungeon master. I brought her through a story of honor and war, vile enemies and dark sorcerers. We had so much fun. I wish I could go back and tell her I love her and stop her from ending her life. I hope she didn't think of me in those final moments. I told her I loved her as she bled out. I heard her last gasps for air. Her death rattle. I am forever scared. Why was just being my close friend not enough to keep her alive. What could I have done to stop her..if only I had known. So here I am, feeling alone and suffering from a powerful loss everyday forever. I hope none of you ever have to experience what I have. I want you to know I understand feeling low. I want you to be happy so if you see me I will smile and shake your hand and I will be kind and helpful..not because I am a good person or anything...but because I am afraid for you. I can't handle that ever again. In fact if ever I witness such an act by a friend ever again I will simply join them. It is far better than the alternative of surviving and living on carrying this horrible burden. 

Down, down to the bottle I go.
To heal my heart and drown my woe.
Rain may fall and wind may blow,
And many a mile bet yet to go.
But under a tall tree will I lie
When all my years have passed me by.

You won’t be compatible with everyone, you just need to meet your people. Don’t give up, keep your head up and keep pushing. Do things that you enjoy on your own for a while, find a hobby that makes you happy. Get into drawing or painting! Get into some anime, watch a movie you’ve been wanting to see, build a PC or buy a game system or something and connect with others online. Go to the gym, go running, go ride a bike! Do anything be happy while doing it, other people that are into those same things will be attracted to you.

1.5 years ago: so I have a crush on one of my classmates, and I'm starting conversations with her constantly but not sure if I'm fully ready to get in a relationship or not so some time passed.

about 8 months ago: I started to show her my attention and talk to her much more than past but she was kinda escaping from it I could feel that she had some rules that prevents her from chatting with me or sth like this. I think she felt that I loved her and I was certain to get in rel with her. anyway, I started doing some research about her and felt that she has a bf (I was right). though I thought it wasn't a serious relationship and if I show her some more attention she would be with me, time passed again.

&amp;#x200B;

about 4 months ago: she texted me one night and asked me what would I do if sb left me. so I understood that the boy had broken her heart :(.

btw nearly a month we talked more and she was freely texting and I said to her don't be that dumb to get in rel with that bad\^$$ again. I was waiting for some time to tell her to start a relationship, cuz if said that while she was sad it would make a kinda jerk person I think. but after some weeks they go back together again and I was acting like we were just friends .why? you know we are in some same classes so I don't want to lose my dignity too. but again our chats were restricted and decreased in number.

sometime later I heard from one of my friends that the boy had texted other girls in class that they had broken their relationship and he is free to get in rel again!!!

my crush had heard that he told his friends he didn't like her and was with her to not feel guilty and bad\^$$. but I don't know that does she know this boy texted other girls to get in rel?

so what I want to ask: should I tell her? or just wait here and watch?  
or maybe I should remove her from my mind and just search for true love? XD

p.o.v: he told her that he is confused and needs some weeks to solve problems. and also said her not to get in rel with any boys!! he lied totally.",lonely,what should I do leave her or...?,2022-05-26 00:09:47

He was the one who initiated a conversation which was a bit too comfortable and weird for a first interaction with someone even if it’s online, but we became friends. Overall, he was an alright friend- it was nice talking to him about certain topics because we were on similar wavelength. The problem is, he is a really negative person. 


I feel like there isn’t a conversation with him that he didn’t complain about how his life is shit and how he feels bad about himself. It’s at a point that my mood gets sour whenever talks about anything related to his usual negativity. I understand that he has depression and that he's really anxious, but sometimes his sentiments get to me. Somehow, I let myself be influenced by his extreme lack of work ethics in academics because I used to self-pity and procrastinate like him a lot in the past. I also feel a little resentment because he complains so much, yet he seems to be fine in handling his problems. He says that no one likes and cares about him in school yet he can even talk to them through voice calls and can even ask for help in assignments. He says he's performing poorly in school(late submissions, not helping his group), but he even became a leader once and in terms of GPA, it's above average. It's really tiring to listen, so my intrusive thoughts are like, maybe it would be better if I didn't become friends with him or reduce our relationship level to an acquaintance. But if I did that, I might trigger his anxieties even more and contribute to him killing himself. He's also the only one who I can call a friend in the class.

1124,aroundtheworldtoday,1653478264,1,"I will preface that I understand this may not relate to unique circumstances. I would just like to share my story and I hope some of it will resonate. 

I was lonely. I woke up by myself, worked from home and went to bed by myself. I didn't catch up, I didn't see you at the party, I didn't make plans for the long weekend. I didn't wonder what I was getting for my birthday or wait in anticipation if that special person was going to text me back. I longed for a connection not for friendship, romance or sex but simply to share a close moment with another human. 

My loneliness was my identity. It only finished the moment my body finally fell asleep at 3am from the sheer exhaustion of it been the same day for the last 10 years in a row. My family didn't know because I was ashamed. I didn't let anyone feel sorry for me because I truly believed I wasn't worth feeling sorry for. 

I searched for affection other ways which presented as physical vices. I over ate, over drank and spent my days and nights lost in a screen to distract its slow creep that engulfed me whenever I sat with my own thoughts. 

I didn't know how to fix it and it was terrifying. 

But I can tell you I got out. No miracles, I just had to start taking action. 

I won't write war and peace on this post of the methods I took to escape myself but fundamentally it boils down to you. At the moment you are existing, instead start making yourself uncomfortable. Try, fail. Try, fail. Try, fail. 

Start small and start slow, It may mean signing up to friendly public soccer team or attending pottery or gym classes or putting some real time into creating an online dating profile. At the start it will feel awkward and you will actively convince yourself not to go again. You don’t have to try and make real connections initially but just keep showing up, become a familiar face. People will resonate with your reliability and persistence and you will get more and more comfortable in that environment.

1152,Jupitersvenus,1653458602,1,"Tonight I texted the guy I really like and told him I am losing interest. It’s the truth but not the truth. I fall for the idea of a person so quickly, all of the little things I like about them are so beautiful, the things I hate are no big deal… basically, they are perfect to me and getting to know them becomes this huge part of my life. 

I create this grand expectation that things will go as perfectly as I plan… and they don’t, they never do. I just am not normal, I day dream about being loved and being with that person.

 A change in the frequency of texts or them not talking to me for a whole day makes me question if they really like me. And when I start to question if they like me I start to pull away, I start to mirror how they’re acting so as to not overreact on the surface. But underneath it I’m losing my shit. Im miserable. Im desperate. Im lonely, so fucking lonely. 

And it happened again tonight, I told him im losing interest… losing interest in the circumstances in which I have to like him. I’ve talked to him for about 3 months, my deal is I want to meet him. But he’s busy, always working… it’s 2022, online dating is tricky bc you start talking to a person and it all feels so good, until you realize it’s not real until you actually meet. So I just wanna get it out of the way, so I can figure out if we’re as good a match as we think we are. Having to just rely on a text here and there isn’t cutting it for me. So, I’m losing interest in being texting buddies, not himself as a person. 


This rant is to say that one, I’m lonely. Two, I hate dating. And three, I hate how being lonely makes me jump the gun, not want to try at all, and how sometimes, the pain of being lonely is sometimes something I think I deserve.

On the last months I have noticed that I am always the one who starts the conversation and always answers when they send a message but they do it just sometimes with me. I am tired of feeling like the only one who is making an effort (It isn't actually because I love them and I love listening to their audios) but they just leave me on seen. I went out with them a month ago and I felt so happy to be with them like always but it changes when we talk on messages.

It feels so bad because I love them dearly and I don't think they do it with a bad intention, but I've been feeling so alone and depressed. I know they might be busy but honestly is so easy to send an sticker or something. I have been trying so bad to tell them things so they answer me and creating a conversation but they leave me on seen and answer like two days after or something like that, and with short messages, so I just stopped but it seems like they don't notice it.

I'm so embarrassed too because I feel like it shouldn't affect me this way, but I've been feeling so depressed lately and it just hurts me that this friendship, that many times has felt like a safe place for me, isn't anymore because I am going to be ignored.

Work is hard. Life is tough. I get that. Sometimes it's just too hard to be mentally strong enough. What did I do today? I filled gas and bought some Monster Energy Drinks. Oh, and I slept. Besides work, there isn't much I do. I'm tired, I'm lazy, I'm unmotivated...whatever it is, it is here. 

I've had depression before. Shit, I have depression now. And I feel so lonely and disconnected from everyone and everything; being in a new place only exasperates that. It's like, at the least, before moving, I had other friends, kind of a checkpoint that slowly diluted away as I moved. I still have friends. To say I don't would be a lie.

But I feel so disconnected from them...

And now to up the ante, the side effects of my medication are really bad while they aren't helping me either. The proposed solution? Up the dose. Sounds utterly ridiculous to me, but what do I know? I'm no psychiatrist.

So disconnected

So lonely

And while this is mostly my fault, I feel like it also isn't. Social anxiety makes it hard for me to interact with groups of people and, by nature, it is hard and awkward to meet people 1 to 1.

I cannot believe how much the psychiatrist invalidated me. Just absolutely horrible. But, you know, I'm not going to tell him that to his (virtual) face. Hopefully my therapist will be better.

I wish I could say I was fine. I talked to someone at work who helped me feel a bit better. Then, you know, someone else tore me down. And that's besides the psychiatrist, anyways.

I just wanna feel loved. Connected. Accepted. Whatever the term is. Happy. I want to be happy. But I'm stuck. Trapped by myself. I don't know how to connect with people in real life. Not anymore. 

It feels like no one cares. And those that do have a very shitty way of supporting me. It's not their fault, so I don't necessarily blame them, but, it doesn't help me. In fact, it hurts me.

&gt;!I sometimes have the urge to self-harm. I don't know why. Maybe a distraction/escape from my thoughts? Maybe a combination of boredom and intense thoughts? I really don't know. All I know is my psychiatrist said ""I'm not worried about the cutting"" essentially because it is without the intent of killing myself. That doesn't make sense to me. Now, obviously, if it were with that intent, it would be worse, but isn't that very invalidating? or am I just crazy? !&lt;

1204,GirlFromBennington,1653443386,1,"Ok I'm scared this one's gonna be a little long. I just found this sub on accident and I don't know if my vent even fits it completely. I am surrounded by people, but I actively avoid them and it makes me lonely.

For context I am currently living in a student dorm that belongs to a different college than the one I attend, so there is no classmates around. It almost exclusively houses Erasmus students from that college. I moved here cause it is very close to my campus, it is nice and clean (for a student dorm) and has private bathrooms in each room. Oh, and it also is in a foreign country, having moved here I knew nobody in this whole country and I left all friends, family, everyone behind in my original country. Honestly I do not regret it and I do not miss them that much. I figured I had to take this step in my life before I grow too tired and unambitious. In my childhood I was a loner, always relying on one friend, but sometime in high school I really blossomed socially, grew some confidence, made a lot of friends, always hung out with someone and I liked it. I already started struggling with my mental health back then but at least I found peace and stability in my friend circles (as opposed to home, which was messed up back then).

Then I moved, ready to conquer this new land full of new people. And I really regressed socially. I met my (ex?) best friend and we clicked on the very first day despite that he's a guy and i'm a girl and he's also 5+ years older than me. So I kind of went back to having that one friend around which was nice, but I also felt **lonely** and kind of limited socially because of this. Meanwhile I met my dorm mates and the first semester and this whole vicious cycle of mine started. I was getting along with them just fine, in fact the very last weeks we started hanging out a lot and i grew attached and then, of course, they left. I felt shattered in pieces. I promised myself I am never ever going out with exchange students again, because they leave, I stay, like in a fucking prison where i'm doing life (i came up with this metaphor recently and now I can't stop thinking about it this way). I became secluded, believing it's for the greater good because, why grow attached to someone who's gonna forget you in a matter of months? In fact partly due to covid and partly because of my stupid delusion I withdrew from all these nascent friend circles I kinda was starting to mingle into... ended up abandoning my ""best friend"". ended up sitting in my room all day and not even studying, mostly just drinking and sleeping. The loneliness is killing me. So I allowed myself to make one more mistake. 

This is my 4th semester and it actually brought along some of the greatest people I met in here so far. I found it so hard to refrain from their company and eventually due to the self-imposed **loneliness** I started to party with them little by little. I saw them go all around Europe together. The first time asked me to come with them. Of course them being exchange students makes it easier to travel (that's what i've been telling myself), so I can't go with them right? well the next time they didn't even bother asking. And the whole semester I was just suffering so much and still am so torn between wanting to hang out with them and subconsciously doing my best not to hang out with them, all the while i was growing attached and damn i really love those people. such a petty problem, i know, i am pathetic. Now they're leaving in around 3 weeks and i can already feel it in my gut, this weird wrenching and nausea at the thought of being here without them around. I dont know what to think: should i have just gone #yolo and spend time with them? or perhaps I should limit the interactions EVEN FURTHER now? 

I thought I was developing a crush on one of them as well. i dont wanna delve into that shit too much but i struggle a lot in the ""dating department"" cause im drugged out of my mind on psychotropic medication which makes me somewhat.. asexual? i guess. so i decided to tell that person about it, as they're all leaving anyway... and it went pretty fine! but well i got overwhelmed and obviously just end up drinking myself to near unconsciousness and happen to stumble upon that person (and like 4 more of those friend-ish guys)  outside when going on a smoke and i spill my wine and make a fool out of myself. i end up cutting myself real bad and havent left my room since. i am so lonely. I AM SO LONELY......

ok so where is this post even going? i dont know i'll be surprised if anybody even sees it. so basically what i'm going for, apart from venting, is: should I continue secluding myself like that next year? should i make the best of the 3 weeks thats left even though right now? is it NORMAL for a college student to be such a fucking self-isolating loser? man it feels like im wasting the prime of my life

Basically TLDR; wasted opportunity to hang out with cool people even though i was lonely, cause i knew they were gonna leave anyway and i didnt want to miss them after. so i deliberately make myself even lonelier, barely leaving my room and cutting ties with other friends as a side effect. then in the middle of this mess i show up drunk and embarrass myself and now i feel like isolating myself even further, despite the sense that i should enjoy things while they last.

I am overthinking. this post perhaps doesnt even go in loneliness sub does it? i am just doing it to myself. and please dont correct my grammar i know its bad",lonely,"All my friendships are superficial, because I am too scared to attach (venting)",2022-05-25 11:49:46
1205,pvini07BR_,1653443304,1,"I'm a teenager with asperger syndrome, which is an low-spectrum autism, which gives me the struggles of socializing with others.

I always I've been used to make friendships on the internet, because it's easier to find people like me. But in real life, those people are all scattered, and you're limited only to where you live. Maybe this is why I never had too much friends, or genuine friendships before. My life was, and still is, only about getting on my PC on the entire day and only getting out of home to get done my routine. No friends to even hang out. My life is so boring...

Before the pandemic started for me in March 2020, I had a small social life on school, with my 2 best friends, and some people I used to know. I don't even remember how I met them. I used to feel at home at that school, And I was used to the place I lived before. Everything seemed to be perfect, I was happy and I didn't knew it was the last days. Just before the pandemic started on my country, I had one of the best birthday parties of my life. All of my friends came to the party, we had fun. But, weeks after that, the hell started. I could never leave my home, I was starting to develop a constant feeling of loneliness and lack of companionship. Even though I had my parents and family, they're not the same as having friends. And to things get worse, due to hormones, I also started to develop an strong desire to have a girlfriend. Hugging, kissing, loving and laying with a girl. But I knew this was impossible due to the current situation I was in. And as time passed, I started to become more and more paranoid about socialization in general. I started to create a lot of theories on my head, on what I should do and etc. I started to become desperate, and the desire of a girlfriend getting more and more stronger. And I was not the only one. One of my best friends also started to suffer the same.

On the next year, in 2021, in the beginning, in school, I started to become hypnotized by a blonde, blue-eyed girl on my class. I started to try hard to become at least her friend, but I failed. She gave more attention to her friends than to me, and when I discovered she already had a boyfriend, I just gave up talking to her and I started crying. This, is when I learnt the lesson to never hypnotize yourself because of appearence. And thinking about it, a relationship with her wouldn't go right, because we're very different.

And to get even worse, **my dad died from COVID-19 on February 2021.** And then, I had to switch school **after** **11 years** studying on the same school, and switching residence **after 7 years** living on the same place. My life started to turn upside down since then. I had to move to my grandma's house, and I didn't like living in there. I had to be on a bedroom where there's barely any sunlight, there's no windows, it was very hot and moldy. And I was, as always, on my computer every day, for the entire day. And after some months, we eventually moved to another condominium, and I'm still living there as the time I write this. In between this time, peridiocally I had some visits to the psychologists, I talked everything about what I was feeling, and also was feeling very paranoid about socialization. I never understand how a simple conversation happens, how friendships are stabilished, and how do you like someone, I just can't. I can't like anyone, and I haven't even the courage to even try, because I knew nobody would give a shit about me. I'm just an generic person who doesn't looks like to have anything special whatsoever, compared to these other groups on the school that already has friendships stabilished, with no sign of accepting new people.

And when I switched school, I gave it some time to analyze the ambience, the school and the people on it, **and I didn't like it.** I really tried hard to socialize with someone on this school, but I couldn't get ANY genuine relationship/friendship. I also tried in other places like on my church and english courses, but no luck. Everyone just seems to be so closed, not giving any chance to me. And I also feel I'm too different from other people, maybe I just can't fit with any person.

But recently, a miracle appeared: For the first time after 2 years, I finally got a genuine friendship! It all started like this: My mom wanted to bring me to her friend's house, she said that there was an girl that has the same age as me, but I was already with the expectation that it will be only another average generic teenager girl. But when I met her, oh my god. I got a fluid and nice conversation with her. She knows very well how to chat, and also has very similar interests and humor! I returned home shocked and surprised, but very happy! I also kind of met her friends, they also look nice.

And for the future: Now, I have the conclusion that I only can get a genuine friendship with people that are similar to me, or has interests and personality that pleases me. I know, the correct would be to be able of socializing with any person, but sadly that's not how my mind seems to be working. I would say that I don't know 100% about myself and what my mind really wants. It's a confusion... And I'm planning to move to the same school as her, with the hope that I can find more nice people on there.

In conclusion: This is a very long battle I'm currently facing. Since all of this started, I kind of lost my perception of time. I can't even believe that 2017 was 5 years ago... I feel like I wasted some time of my teenage years, but whatever. I would say that this entire story is like a ""clock bomb"" that was planted since my childhood and it only exploded now, and I'm suffering the consequences. This story is all about trial and error, and especially, never giving up. I would say that things are finally getting better for me after so long, but the battle hasn't finished yet! And in this battle, loneliness will **never** win. Either the battle will extend, or I will win. That's the spirit!

I really hope my story can serve as a inspirational story or something like that. And I also hope that everyone who's suffering of loneliness on this sub, finds a way of having a relationship with a nice person.",lonely,I'm in a constant fight against loneliness since the pandemic started.,2022-05-25 11:48:24

Im the youngest out of 4 siblings and we all have big age gaps like 7+ years. I always had alone time for myself growing up especially when my older siblings started moving out early one by one until it was just me in the house. Saying that I always find peace in going out by myself at times. She's also the youngest of 4; 2 of her sisters stay at the house and the third one stays 7 minutes from her and they all have a good relationship far as talking to each other and going out to eat, shop etc. She doesn't get me when I want to be by myself for a day or two cause she's constantly around people and she's so used to being around me. Sometimes I feel like it's draining cause we link up with each other EVERY SINGLE DAY/WEEK. I barley link up with my friends as much, and she doesn't hate them but she doesn't like to be around them.

1208,Elegantenbydraws,1653441394,1,"I’ve felt lonely for my whole life. For two and a half school years straight I didn’t really have anyone I considered a friend. Recently this has changed and now I am in a friend group or two but I feel left out. 

I thought one of the girls who sat with me at lunch was my friend but then I realized they ignored me every time they were talking with our group. I know this is going to sound selfish but I’m going to be honest since nobody here knows who I am anyway. The worst part is they are good friends with my “closest” friend. 

They talk to each other so much and seem to have way better conversations. In my opinion it’s inconsiderate to blatantly show your favoritism for one of your friends in front of your other ones. This is how I’ve felt with acquaintances I’ve had in the past too. I sense an almost spiritual love they have with others that I’m not getting between me and them. I’ve never been able to connect with someone like that. It doesn’t help that I’m possibly neurodivergent and will probably not be able to connect with most people that way(or maybe my idea of true friendship is wrong),feeling more alone. 

Part of me is afraid that it’s my appearance because none of my friends are friends with people that have dark skin aside from maybe me. I don’t want to be that type of person but I constantly wish I was just born with lighter skin because the lighter skinned people are the only popular ones.",lonely,"I have “friends”,but I still feel lonely",2022-05-25 11:16:34

My family doesnt love me unless I'm earning
A paycheck to contribute but with my condition
It's difficult to find an employer that'll listen
When my unstable patterns start to show
It's a medical condition yet they tell me to go

No job, no money, no friends, no one but me

1250,FarmerCrazy3401,1653419458,1,"First of all i want to say there's no real guide to this.   
Everyone is different &amp; therefore have different circumstances.  


But a lot of people seem to think they are lonely and think that they're down and therefore their life isn't worth it at all. I'm simply a conveyer &amp; i'm here to give you some advice that works/helped for me. To feel less lonely &amp; no it's not going to work for everyone or in 123 just like that, you're going to feel like this for a while still. But here's the deal if you want to stop feeling miserable atleast try it out for yourself. Don't just sit there and don't try it. You have nothing to lose right? Try it out! :)   


So for me personally, I feel alone whenever i have no one to talk to, i fixed this by ""gaming"" but whenever i don't game i have that same loneliness again. I think a lot of you feel the same. It's actually funny &amp; there's a very simple solution to this. No i won't ask you to stop gaming because that doesn't work. It didn't work for me either. Instead i ask you to only game for a few hours so if you game all day like i did. Just game for half a day and cut it down whenever you feel like it. \~set a timer.  


The reason why gaming for me personally have such an influence in feeling lonely in real life is because of dopamine. The feeling of happiness.  Whenever i game, i talk with other people and engage myself within the same context getting that next level or trophy. This makes real life conversations awkward most of the time anyway &amp; the only way to fight loneliness is to game.   


It's an addiction, just like there are people with an alcohol addiction or cocaine addiction. They're after the same kind of drug. There's dopamine in alcohol and there's dopamine in cocaine.   


There's also dopamine in music for example or if you watch/do activity on ph..  


To me personally i had too much dopamine so i had to cut down on my dopamine levels. Simply by cutting the amount of time that i game / look on my phone for social media.   


But to you it might be different like you can also have too little dopamine &amp; that will create problems such as;   


* You lack motivation, “the drive.”
* You're tired.
* You can't concentrate.
* You're moody or anxious.
* You don't feel pleasure from previously enjoyable experiences.
* You're depressed; you feel hopeless.  


The problem in a depression is:  

* Low mood/low interest in activities enjoyed previously: ...
* Trouble concentrating: ...
* Changes in appetite or sleep: ...
* Feeling hopeless/worthless: ...
* Thoughts of suicide.   


Having too much of Dopamine like me results in;  
 

* Anxiety.
* Excess energy or mania.
* Increased feelings of stress.
* Insomnia.
* Aggression.
* Hallucinations.

So either way, i'm not asking you to become a drug user or any of that kind but by either raising your dopamine levels or lowering your dopamine levels will help a ton to your motivation and or well being.   


Detoxing dopamine is however extremely hard, so when you're detoxing be sure to take your time with it. As for making up dopamine more, be sure to not get addicted to the dopamine that you're following.   


Basically i'm asking you to balance your life. Don't go and binge watch all the series or episodes that came out of 1 season instead, just watch an episode a week. or an episode a day &amp; do something else.  


I hope this helps for some of you people, it helped for me personally. If you have any questions please let me know. I tried to leave out most nsfw stuff related info of dopamine but if you're interested in that please google it! I can't say anything about that here though. But yeah, it does also something regarding your well being ;)",lonely,How to be less lonely.,2022-05-25 05:10:58

I grew up on an island and like most of my friends I left the island to study abroad. I made new friends in Brighton, UK and had a pretty good time for a while. 
Unfortunately my father passed away unexpectedly and COVID made us transition to online learning, which I really struggled with, so I went back home and changed careers to something I enjoyed more.

The trouble is, all of my friends are still abroad, both the new friends I made and the old ones who are still studying or now working away. I still see them on holidays when they come back but now I find myself having to rebuild my friend group from scratch.

This would maybe be fine if I had ways of making new friends but I no longer share a flat (I stay at home with my mum) and by the nature of my new course, all of the people there are super nerds who never want to hang out (or maybe they just don't want to hang out with me :(    ). And unlike the English uni I went to, there are no clubs, societies, activities etc. Ive never felt lonelier in my life and it really feels bad not seeing anyone on weekends, and now summer is coming and my friends won't be here till July.

1293,Garryten10,1653390727,1,"Hi! A few years ago, I wrote a song about being lonely, and it is on Spotify if anyone is interested. 

2019, I came to a new class in high school. In fact, I am always anxious to meet new people, yet I still told myself “it will be just fine”. 

But, it was not fine, not fine at all. Everyone already had their own friends, own circles, so the classmates barely talked to me at all. 

At first, I thought it surely takes some time for me to find my “friends”, but it did not work out.

I went to the principle and asked for help(changing to another class), but he said no, he said it requires a lot of time to change a student to another class, also, be said I was there to learn, not to make friends...😅

During that period, I was afraid, anxious and depressed, besides, I was afraid to eat lunch alone.

One day, I had a panic attack, after school, I went home and wrote this song - A Corner.

Since I was always sitting far back alone during every lesson, next to the door, and beside the corner.

Luckily, I went to the curator after a panic attack, she saw how depressed am heartbroken I was, so she convinced the principle to change class for me, everything went better since then.

Here comes the song, hopefully the lyrics tells what your inner voice(your heart/mind) really wants to say. 

Take care and stay strong!!!

1304,themicroscientist,1653384050,1," So, This all started a year ago when I found a gorgeous girl on Facebook as the mutual one with my friend. I saw her on People you may know section multiple times more than 20 and finally, I added her. She didn't accept me back for a while because of my creepy fake-looked profile picture. After uploading my selfie one as a profile pic, she accepted me back. But I didn't start any conversation yet. I checked a little bit about her personal information and found that she's 1996 born and I'm 2004 born. So, the age gap between us is 8 years. She's so pretty with beautiful lips shape and cheek that made me fall in love with her. She hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Chulalongkorn University and I'm nothing compared to her. Just a 18 years old impatience, stubborn nerd passionate in Maths and Physics without having any Degree. That's what makes me rejected myself from her. I claim myself as the one who doesn't deserve any of her feeling because of those differences mentioned above. That's why I didn't start to text a message to her. I know that I can't be with her in real life. So, I created the exact same person of similar appearances and personalities in my own imagination. Now, I'm able to have the sight of her beautiful look in my occipital lobe every single second. Even if i don't deserve her love in reality, I should be able to get one in my imagination. I talk to her. I seek advice from her. I argue with her and I love her so much. I know this would be seem as a bit strange and mental instability, but I don't wish her to disappear from my imagination. This is getting worse and worse. What should i do?

1316,ScarIeen,1653380917,1,"So I’m a very lonely person. I have no friends like at all. I’ve learned to come to terms with it. For about three or so years I haven’t had any friends and just some family members. The thing that bothers me is that when I just meet someone I can’t stop thinking about them.

It always happens to me. I mostly don’t meet people in real life, I’m just too shy. Over the internet AKA video games I’m myself. I still manage to stay alone even through video games but that’s not even the point. The point is that every time I play one match with someone or have a friend request I go to sleep thinking about them nonstop like I’m obsessed.

Today I was playing ranked arenas in Apex Legends. I met this group of two guys. One of them was a real jerk but he stood out. He was sexist, rude, probably racist too. He was good at the game though. He kept making snarky comments at me and flirting as well (as literally every guy does). We won the game, they were pretty good. So I partied up with them. The whole time he kept referring to me as “bitch”. I’ve been struggling from the lack of teammates recently so I stayed and dealt with it so I could rank up (which I did). 

After our 2nd match his friend wanted to play so I just left the party. I received a friend request from him and accepted it. Played a couple more hours and went to bed.

Trying to sleep I keep thinking about this dick. Thinking about what I could’ve said or why I did something. Reliving our conversations. Why? Why do I do this? This guy was a total jerk and I don’t know why I can’t stop thinking about him. 

This has happened to me before. There’s nothing special about this guy. This ALWAYS happens to me. I meet someone over the game and then stay up half the night thinking about them.  Does anybody know why this happens to me?  Is it because I have no friends? Am I that desperate?? Why do I do this?

And I thought for sure things would change upon work or school.  I’ve been in the work force for over a year with absolutely zero change.  I start school this fall and I have a feeling it’s going to be the same show but in a different place.

I pretty much feel lonely most of the time. Toxic friends who will lead me to bad things. Got Nobody to share your feelings or things with in your everyday life. I even have summer vacations starting in 3 days. And I'm pretty scared of it, like what will happen to me in those holidays. I also have social anxiety, I don't like going out most of the time since I think what will others think of me, what are they talking about me in the back (even if nobody does)... Whenever I go to my ""toxic friends"" for chatting, they pretty much straightforward become mean or rude at me. Even 100% of my classmates message me because they have some query to ask or they're just sending a few unfunny memes. There was this girl Whom I used to hangout with irl (not anymore) and others started teasing me and started saying bad things of her in the back. I totally didn't like it. I have online school (had offline school like some weeks ago) these days which is totally bullshit and is stopping me from gaining my confidence again (as I used to have before lockdown). I can't wait for having offline school again. I barely have any hobbies, I code most of the time but also I rage quit it because I cannot deal with those errors. After offline school hours, I see everybody hanging out with there friends or there partners(gf/bf). And here I am, travelling alone from school to home. I feel very jealous of them. I also wish that I had someone like that irl, who will always be there for me, who can feel How I am feeling right now and console me. Not being desperate here or some but yeah. There are toxic people in most of my surroundings so it's quite hard to find the right one.

1347,protectearthsowestay,1653360011,1,"This is just a rant because im feeling very insecure and trying to get my life together but just feel really behind. 

I feel like making friends at my age (22F) is sort of a joke at this point, i broke up with my boyfriend because it wasnt healthy for me and we wanted different things in life (codependency etc.) unfortunately I have zero friends and Im almost graduated. I want so bad to make friends but feel like everyone has some old reason to dislike me, or finds me too pushy or overwhelming. I struggle with anxiety and adhd and so the combination of that coupled with a terrible highschool social life and terrible parents ive since had to go no contact with, has made the switch to outgoingness and trying to meet my social needs has been hard. Everyone appears established into friendships, and im at a loss of where to start or how to make friends, I feel like im being too needy if I try to reach out to different people. The reason im scared to reach out to people is because of gossip and there was a time when people at my current school disliked me, and they are since relatively highly esteemed by our peers, which is hard hard and confusing because i doubt they mention me but at the same time i feel forced to hide myself to avoid conflict.

My question is how do I ask people to hangout with me? Im fairly introverted but can be extroverted when needed, its just hard to think up questions that are genuine and show I care, because sometimes with adhd i overshare to relate and some people dont like that. I need to find other ways of relating to people, my backround of social problems has not been helpful to feeling free. My personal hobbies are introverted, but im willing to join outgoing clubs, but i just dont know what to say without overwhelming someone.

Theres so much I want to do but was held back in my relationship as my boyfriend struggled with depression and i felt i had to support him but didnt set the proper boundaries. Now Im trying to start anew with all these failed friendships. Ive tried determining what went wrong and Im bad at putting myself out there i guess, and i get sensistive easily, im forgetful of responding to people in text, but i apologize and try to remain inquisitive but they seem to be upset about that. 

Right now im feeling lonely and its just sad when i started putting myself out there but everyones busy doing their own thing. 

I am trying new hobbies but everything i do feels difficult as i feel far behind in a sense. I dont have a familial support to tell me itll be fine and i just wished there was someone i could talk too, not to talk about sad things but just be happy with and who would take my hand and show me people. I missed out on partying and theres so much i want to do but basically everything id like to do requires access to a car or a friend to be safe when drinking, etc. 

Im sorry this post is so long just at a loss.

I’m a 26yo male.
I’m married (4 1/2yrs).
I’m Christian (23yrs).
Best friend… moved on.
There’s more to me of course, but probably the most helpful…

Why do I feel so neglected? 

My wife is a very busy extrovert. I’m a somewhat depressed introvert. She’s not home a lot. We both serve a lot in the local church never mind the 3 jobs she works and the 60hrs (including commute) a week that I work at my job. So we’re both busy. I think another big problem of mine is that I lead two small groups. One at church and one at my job (additional to what I’m actually paid to do). My small group at church has all but dissolved that I’ve been teaching and leading for 5 years now and nobody reaches out to me. They have either left and not said anything or just became so distant. Just came off the heels of teaching about vulnerability and transparency and nobody wants to get close i guess. The small group at work is higher stakes and I’ve only been doing it for 5 months in contrast. Unfortunately I inherited the group that already had attendance problems. So, all of the quality of life improvements my group is supposed to make to our work community is all falling on me. I’ve felt burned out and fighting it for 2-3 years now, but man I’m breaking.

I could go on, but this is long already. I don’t have anyone to bear my burdens with (perceivably). I suppose I should add that my wife and I fight a lot. She has childhood trauma and doesn’t communicate emotions well. I’m an emotional person and my emotions frustrate her because she has so much trouble processing her own as it is. So I’m usually helping her and taking “body shots” in the process.

1366,atch97,1653349944,1,"I'm 25, my girlfriend of over 2 years broke up with me after I rose an issue, assured by a previous promise by her that we would talk everything through and endlessly telling me of marriage, house and kids. This is my third long relationship and I feel like the years I have been in them have been such a waste. 

I'm one of those background friends in my friendgroup, one who gets along well with a lot of people at once rather than one at a time. I don't feel like I can fully rely on them to talk to as I've been fairly out of contact with them due to finishing my final year of college. 

They are all in jobs for about two years, I'm not. I may still not be depending on whether I pass repeat modules. I have no means of staying in the same city as them. My grades may not be good enough to get the job I want.

I'm over reliant on my parents at the moment and it's killing me as I'm a very independent person. I'm staying at home but I don't have a very friendly relationship with my parents, rather a functional one.

My uncle has died in the last year due to some very unfortunate circumstances (read between the lines). He has been on my mind almost every day since he died. I wouldn't say we were very close but we were very aware that we resonated with each other, at least the times we would meet. I buried him on my birthday and I haven't forgotten that a year later, so anyone who says happy birthday to me just reminds me of carrying his coffin and seeing my granny in tears.

These are all very disjointed and disorganised paragraphs but it's a read of basically what my mind is like right now. I can't even properly be sad about one thing because there's so many others. However the most recent one is the breakup. I've unraveled after breakups before when I found no one to turn to and I'm scared that will happen now. Granted I never foresaw what mental abyss that would drive me to and how much time and effort it took to get out.

I'm just so pissed off that I've been struggling really really hard to keep myself afloat in my course but yet I now loose what was my best friend (my ex) overnight and everyone else is too used to not seeing me that I can't be seen. Like literally dug myself into another 'relying on one person' hole. No one to talk to now.

I want to go back to who I was before all this bullshit, before all the relationships, before college decentralised my friend group etc. I was ambitious then, wanted to achieve, wanted to be good at everything. Now I'm just like meh to everything. I've no one who I care about to watch me achieve anything. I want someone to just fucking see me.

I'm sick of being miserable. I'm sick of being kicked in the stones while I'm down.

Hi I am a female I am 19 years old, and i've just got to rant as i've got no one else to talk to. I am so lonely, all I seem to do is to go to work come home, and see my bf, and it is the same repetitive cycle is making me go insane. When i'm at work I don't want to be there, most people are older than me, I am 19, there is a girl my age there but the relationships I have are mostly work based and  professional, I don't know how to break the ice with her, or click with her. I just want to get home and lay on my bed and feel anxious and nervous in work constantly, and just not my usual talkative self. I have applied to uni next year, but there are several months till then and I can feel my mental health spirrling neing stuck in the same repetitive cycle and I don't know what to do about it. I'm also scared about going as I feel stupid writing this, but I know uni has a massive drink/ drug culture, and I do want to go out and have run, and not spoil the fun, and meet people, but due to having ptsd, drinking often makes my symptoms worse, and i'm worried about not meeting people and not fitting in due to this. 

I know I am so lucky to have a bf, and he is my best friend we have been dating for a year and I love spending time with him, he is my friend as well as my bf, and I love him a lot. However I crave female friendship, not a massive group of friends but a small close group I spend time with. My bf has so many friends from childhood, and I feel so selfish for writing this, but I feel so almost jelouse when I hear him talk about them, and meet up every night, not cos I want to be with him (we are kinda long distance ish and live an hour away from each other, so see him once a week, or less.) But because I crave close friendships like that. In school I was bullied by my friends (secoundary) and had social anxiety in primary school, so I have barely any close friends from school. In college I made some mistakes and was not nice to people, so I guess this is kinda karma for me. I have massively chnaged since then (2 years ago.) Anyone who I was friends with has moved on that I met in college. I just want a close friendship that lasts. I'm so happy for him but I don't want to be one of those girls that relys on my bf for friendship. I am almost embarrased to tell my bf i'm lonely, as I feel ashamed as he has all these friends, so I feel I have no one to talk to.Any advice or just a chat would be appreciated sorry for the long rant !!",lonely,All I want is a close female friend to connect to,2022-05-24 09:29:16

1387,BlackPillSurrender,1653342111,1,"I took a class at college. Me and this girl would look at each other everyday we had class. She uploaded a pic to her Facebook one day with her and what I could tell but later confirmed was her boyfriend. I know I was snooping, oh well. She gave me many hints and parked by me a couple days in a row. Looked at me for the rest of the semester, but I didn't say anything because I was nervous. I'm 20 and never had a girlfriend. On the last day of class, I nutted up for the first time and asked for her number. She told she didn't have a boyfriend after I asked her(at this point she had broken up with Facebook guy unbeknownst to me). I got her number and texted the next day. Her first three texts were dry, but I kept going for laughs and she ended up reciprocating. We texted throughout the days. She would send of video of how she looked when she woke up, or would send voice messages. She would also send photos. She asked if she could talk on the phone with me and I talked for an hour then left. We texted more and she would seem flirty. She sent a photo of our names on an Internet ""love tester"" with a high rating. She told me about a guy she had gone on a date with and phrased it as, ""this guy(cameron) asked on a date before you had asked for my number."" She told about how he had tried to kiss her and wanted to sleep with her and wished I was there. She told me she was a virgin and wanted to stay that way till she felt comfortable but they she had done basic stuff. I didn't mind as the same was true for me. We would again talk on the phone this time for 4 hours. During that time she proposed the idea of us going to the movies together. A couple days later I asked officially if she wanted to which she did agree. We saw the movie and went out to eat. She got us a drink to share throughout the movie. It ended with her letting me borrow a DVD and she initiated a hug good bye and we left. This was like the first week and a half. She later texted me a meme with Jason Bateman American Psycho in a picture frame with a ""my boyfriend"" tagline. She just texted ""you"" under the photo. I made a joke about it not acknowledging the boyfriend part because I didn't want to be presumptuous. She also texted that she wanted my flannel during the movie and was going to pretend to be cold. We continued texting and flirting at least what I thought it was. She had joked that a movie scene had made her cum in "".02"" seconds. I replied that, ""I wish there was something that could make me cum immediately from just seeing."" She responded, ""me in my work uniform,"" and sent a pic of her in it. I typed, ""worked."" So I assumed that we had been flirting over time with not just stuff like this. She would tell me what she was wearing at night. She went on a trip with her best friend and stayed at a hotel for a couple days. She sent photos and texted me while it was going on. She sent a photo of her and her friend in a hot tub. She was drinking for the first time that night, and told me, ""If I try to video call you ignore it."" Which I agreed to but was confused by it a little. She told me she was bored a couple times and I mentioned that it looked like fun and I said ""wish I there, looks like more fun than what I'm doing."" she replied, ""wish you could come."" Theoretically, they were in a spot that would take me about an hour to get there, but I think I just made a joke and continued texting. Later on, she asked me one night I wanted to be added to her private Instagram which only 25 people followed. I said yes and she added me. This was like another week and a half. I asked if she would like to go to the movies again to which she obliged. We had fun and talked throughout the movie like we had done with the last. I wanted to hold her hand because I felt that I hadn't made any physical moves on her. I would say something and she would turn and look at me while putting her hand on my should to laugh and agree to whatever I said multiple times. She kind of grazed her hand down my arm at one moment. Then she briefly palmed my hand, but not in a holding hand sort of way. It ended, and she went for another hug and we left. I later jokingly apologized for taking her to Doctor Strange because it was bad. She said, ""I liked it! plus I just like hanging out with you."" We text the next couple days and continue flirting I think. She told me about how she ended her streak with her Facebook boyfriend of 1 year and that he had wanted her back, but she didn't care. Later, she told me she got a bikini and and new shorts. I asked how she looked in the shorts. She sent of photo to which I jokingly replied, ""I'll save that in the vault for later."" She laughed and liked the comment. That was yesterday, and today I decided to text her again because I was thinking that I goofed again for not making a physical move on her at the movie. I also didn't want to be too forward like the guy she described from earlier, so I decided to make my intentions somewhat clear because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. So I texted her:

""Hey Samantha! I wanna be open and transparent with you because I like you obviously. We’ve been on two dates and I figure we are still in the “talking stage.” However, I feel as though I haven’t shown that I like you on our dates because I didn’t want to be a “Cameron” lol nor do I want to be “just a friend.” I don’t think I was playing my cards right, but I want to change that. I was hoping I can take you to the movies once more before you go on your beach vacation, but this time I wanted to show you that I like you more than someone I’m just “talking” to and ask if I can hold your hand.""

She reponded:

“That’s so thoughtful! I’d love to go to the movies again with you, but I should also be transparent by saying I’m not looking to really get into anything very serious right now.”

I figured that she meant she liked me, but doesn't completely know me or feel comfortable with me yet. After thinking about it, and asking people, now my opinion is that she's not interested at all.

I typed:

""Totally Cool! I figured I would just be honest instead of making my self look like a fool like others have in the past.""

I'm in pain.

and just when i thought i couldn’t feel worse, he tells me i’m selfish for holding on to the accusation and that i should forget about him.

he made me feel special. really special. both of us opening up about things we wouldn't just share with anyone. there was a deep bond there. he made me feel extremely loved. at 28 years old, i've never been in a real relationship before. typically guys just want to use me for sex. he was different. he made me feel loved, wanted, desired, and cared for. he was my person. we could be ourselves around each other.

the last week or so, he had become more distant. less talkative to me. and then yesterday he said he wanted a break. i'll admit, i lost my shit. went straight into a bpd rage + spiral. i was suicidal, i self medicated, wanted to cut myself...all the things. he abandoned me. he promised he wouldn't. just a day or so earlier he said he wanted to be with me forever. 

i can't breathe. i've never been so in love with another person before. this heartache is unreal. i'm starting to wonder if this is my life. always being broken hearted by guys. only being good enough to be used for sex. maybe i am just a whore and need to embrace that. seems to be the thing guys only like in me; what i can do for them sexually. it seems as if that's all i am good for.

i truly loved this man. i don't know what i did wrong. i wish i knew. i wish i could figure it out and make it better. but i'm sure he doesn't love me anymore. i'm nothing at all. 

all i have ever wanted in my life is to be loved. not just a body used for sex. i wanted real love. a real relationship. i don't think i'll ever find it again. i don't want to find it again. he was it for me. it was perfect. i feel like this grief will eat me alive.

i self medicated last night and was truly bummed when i woke up this morning. feels like there is an elephant sitting on my chest. i feel numb. i can't function. hardly eaten or had something to drink. i just feel utterly devastated. i truly did not see this coming. my entire being hurts and i just want to curl up and die, honestly. i don't think it's ever gonna get any better.

guys always leave me. abandon me. they say i'm too much to handle. guess they're right.

I have been alone since ever. Even in my childhood, I rarely had friends. That is not to blame on anxiety but on my laziness to make friends because I simply enjoy my own company and I don't really like people. However, The attention and love my best friend gets in an hour are probably more than I will ever get in a lifetime. Someone confessing his love to her is almost like a routine to her at this point. This makes me really insecure because why can't that be me? Am I really that undesirable? What's wrong with me that the attention and love I got since birth is probably equal to what she gets in a day?

I mean hell, even my mom left me when I was young, see how funny it is? That I couldn't even be loved by my own mom while there are people who attract whoever they wish. And I am supposed to actually believe that everyone is lovable and that everyone is equal.

It is not that I want numerous friendships or a relationship. But hell, it would feel a lot nicer if I felt loved or wanted. I mean I bet if I and her were to drift apart she would have no memory of me due to how full her life is of people. I want to want to crave connections if that makes sense.

So yeah I’m 20 years old and have zero true friends, yeah I have a couple of friends I’m close with from high school but since we started college and went our separate ways, we only loosely keep in touch here and again. While I won’t say I’m dead ugly or Mr. Universe kind of attractive, I will say I think of myself as conventionally attractive: had a quick fling and a relationship but nothing recent.

I’ve done what everyone says, be outgoing, go up and talk to people, be genuine, get out of your comfort zone. I’ve done all that and more, yet nothing. I’ve realized I’ve always kind of been like that. Never have had many friends, with periods of having nobody. I try to be my best self, talk about my interests, get involved in the community, and so on, but still nothing.

I’m not one to self loathe, but I am one who thinks self awareness is key. I’ve never been anyones best friend, and honestly I wonder if anyone has thought of me as a friend. I try telling myself once I get to college (currently in community college transferring in the spring) that things will get better but honestly I’ve been telling that to myself before with the same result. I hope that I will be with a good friend group someday but honestly I’m not holding my breathe.

I constantly try to better myself, both internally and externally yet still nothing. I’m coming to the realization that I’m just going to be one of those people who don’t have friends and just kind of float through life.

1425,EyeRawKnee,1653330158,1,"Hello. This is my very first post on Reddit. I usually avoid bother people, being an annoyance is my greatest fear, but I'm feeling exceedingly bad as of late and since I have no one, absolutely no one to talk to in person, I thought that I could perhaps find some solace writing here. As the title says, I'm 29 years old and I only know loneliness. I spent all my childhood and teen years utterly isolated from the outside world with my relatives, not well-adjusted people. I grew up with my mother, her parents and an half-brother of hers; my father was out of the picture. None of them worked, we lived off welfare checks. I was not allowed to hang out with the other kids, because... I don't really know why, they simply really didn't want me to. School was my only escape, so holidays meant weeks and months all alone; no pets either. The only peer I had was a slightly older cousin, who suffered from extreme anger management issues and frequently, and savagely, beat and humiliated me in front of our relatives, who couldn't care less about it; I soon learnt to not cry and seek help from them because that only resulted in further emotional abuse. Nowadays only my mother and the ""uncle"" remain, my grandparents are dead and my cousin is now an upstanding citizen, with a good blue-collar job, a wife and a home. I, on the other hand, am a depressed NEET loner living precariously in a rented home alongside the aforementioned duo, still as uncaring and emotionally abusive as ever. I am not graduated, I have very little work experience, mostly dead-end jobs as a back-office assistant, and I'm scared shitless of social interactions. In my almost three decades of life I've never had a single friend, I'm still a kissless virgin with no experience with women whatsoever, and whenever I find myself around people I shut off completely. About six months ago I began attending an Association in favor of people struggling with depression in search of work; more recently I contacted a psychiatrist and started a cycle of therapy. All good news, and I'm grateful for them, but at the same time I am becoming more and more certain that there's ultimately no hope for me. All the other people attending the Association have so many interesting stories to tell. Stories about family members, friends, romantic partners... about their travels, their years in college, their hobbies... and I have nothing. I never actually lived, and it shows. I only know loneliness, boredom, traumas, and an infinite sadness. I hate hearing all these stories and not having one to share. Also, I think it's because my lack of self-esteem, but I constantly crave validation: I'm crazy jealous of the attention the other guys receive, and always feel like I'm treated differently. I'm in a bad mood all the time and there's nothing I wish for more than being consoled by someone, but no one does. Sometimes I try to speak to the other associates about how I feel and my history, but I get cut off every time. The Staff isn't paying me attention, either, eventhough I am always eager to help them with their work (within my limited capacity). My therapist should help me with my social anxiety, but I feel like this is hopeless too. As I said, no one seems interested in me and who I am, no matter how many times I try get close to people. And if I can't seem to be able to befriend someone, how could I ever hope to find love? I would have liked immensely to know what affection and intimacy are before my death, but this is just crazy talk I'm afraid. What could I offer to a woman? I've yet to find a work, I don't have a family, or a car, or a house, and my ineptitude and lack of social development make me a boring, uninspiring and unpleasant company. These thoughts keep me awake at night and borderline apathetic during days. I simply don't see a solution, my future is grim and there's little I can do, besides working on myself in the feeble hopes that there's a decent individual buried inside me. Sorry for the huge wall of text, hopefully it isn't too much time-consuming to read.

1460,CarrotTopFool,1653317116,1,"So let me preface this by saying this is a throwaway account but this venting is 100% real, just don’t want it polluting my main account is all. So I’m in my mid 20’s, lost every friend I’ve ever had for multiple reasons, family more or less hates me for their own fair reasons (we still love each other tho, I mean from the cradle to the grave they’re all you’ve got), dead end job, have been depressed for the last 14+ years for multiple reasons, struggling thru school, can’t seem to stop wasting money on stupid things, never know when to stop rambling, I overeat and don’t really know when to stop eating (I’m only like 20-30 lbs overweight but not completely unhealthy), and I’m terrible with talking to people.

To clarify more on certain parts, throughout middle school and high school I was bullied for reasons I never really understood, sure I was awkward and a loser who didn’t know the first thing about making and keeping friends but I still tried the best I could. Had gum spat in my hair multiple times, beaten, bruised, battered, had a fake girlfriend for a while who’d show me chats from other people in our class showing how worthless a person I was (saying things like “damn that loser can get a girlfriend and I can’t?”, “I kinda feel bad for her”, and “here comes the creep, poor girl”. Worst of all she was the one who was in those chats, showing me all of this. The end of that was when she cheated on me with her eventual prom date that year, saying I allegedly refused to go with her when I can’t recall her ever saying she wanted to go in the first place, this was all when my grandmother had just passed so yay my luck I guess. Ever since I haven’t dated anyone, granted her and I never went out on a legit date, we were in high school and I didn’t have a car or anything to really offer, so it was kinda doomed from the start.

I’m kinda the black sheep of the family, which I don’t personally mind tbh, it’s nothing I can or really want to change. Yes we’ve had many many arguments and fights over the years, I have too many siblings and they’re all so much better than I am academically, socially, just every way imaginable. Personally I’m fine not being anyones favorite son or brother, I was never really in the running. I know even tho they hate me, they moreso hate what I am, some loser with no friends, no social life, no real opinion on any important matter, can’t relate to anything they like, I’m just kinda the outcast of the family, but if they really hated me I probably would’ve been disowned long ago yknow.

Money problems are just kinda par for the course here, everything’s expensive nowadays I mean look at gas prices. Depression just ruins peoples lives, it’s a matter of whether you’ll let it eat you alive or if you’ll beat it into the ground. Due to depression tho I overthink everything, normal everyday convos, how people really feel, whether I’m really helping someone or not, what I should and shouldn’t eat, what to wear, etc. etc. I recently lost my best friend of five years over my new job that I was practically forced to take, she didn’t agree with the position I took even tho the position I applied for isn’t the position I’m in. My boss basically said “oh you’re going to be working with this floor instead since I think you’ll do much better with this side instead”, in other words I have to suck it up or I won’t have a job. I hate it but it’s better pay, good benefits, everything I need to survive, just not what I want to do yknow. 

Another thing about my job is I worked with a really cool girl that I grew to have feelings for (I believe she had feelings for me first, many clues being thrown here and there, my best friend who was also friends with her at the time said I should’ve asked her out, the signs were basically all there) moved to Night Shift on a different floor entirely so I will never see her again (probably). I admit I missed my chance if I had one to begin with, but I just can’t seem to move on from it, anytime we had ran into each other it was like nothing had changed, we get along really well, our overall vibe was positive, she’d normally be the one who would seek me out at the most random times, but time keeps going by. I have her number and we text every now and then but I have to start he convo nowadays, it’s such a weird feeling right now, it really does feel like I missed any chance I had if I even had one. I know I should just give up on it but deep down I don’t want to, it’s not fair to her at all to bug her if I am or to even keep trying when she could already be over it, let alone the possibility of it all just ending up with “she was just being nice, she had no feelings for you” situation the whole time yknow. But that’s more of me overthinking things again.

My future is in serious question here, I know I’m going to have to take care of my parents and brother when they get older (that’s a long story in itself) basically meaning I’m on a serious time crunch. I’m still going to school to try and get into a better paying job to support not only myself but my family, I’ll have to throw my life away (if I manage to get one) to focus on taking care of them full time. It’s not like it’s forced or anything, my brother will physically/mentally never be able to take care of himself and my parents are getting up there in age so I’m seriously running out of time. Its freaking me out so much, I’ve wasted my life doing nothing but wallowing in my own depression instead of trying to do what I want to do and now my hard deadline to get a life, maybe get a wife, my dream job, have kids of my own, all of that is slowly slipping away from becoming a feasible possibility. At the end of the day my fate is fast approaching, I’m stuck scared cuz I’ve wasted so much time doing nothing, all because I let it consume me. But it’s on me at the end of the day, even tho I’ve had people around me my whole life I’ve never let anyone know my true feelings, I’ve never tried to fix them, it’s my fault I’m like this. No one can fix you but you after all, it’s my burden, I’ll forever be alone if not in my head in reality.

Anyways I just felt the need to let this out, if this was the wrong place to let it out I’m sorry you can delete it, thanks for reading it all if you have, and I hope you all have a great day or night wherever you are.",lonely,"Lost in Thoughts, All Alone",2022-05-24 00:45:16

It’s a horrible holiday, I’ve not spend Xmas day with my family for over 20 years. My Mum started a new family when I was 12 after years of my Mum &amp; Dad hating each other &amp; constantly cheating on one another. My Dad told me I was born so they could qualify for a council house.. thanks Dad! After they split I lived with my Mum &amp; her violent abusive boyfriend. She gave up on me &amp; neglected me to start her new family. My Dad was a racist alcoholic who pimped out women &amp; didn’t bother with me. He left my Mum with debts, left us in poverty &amp; in a house with an abusive man. After he was kicked out he tried to impress younger women, spent thousands on feeding their addictions &amp; trying to get them into bed (he forgot he had kids he brought into this world to care &amp; provide for). I was tired of abandoning myself for my family &amp; my in-laws &amp; going along with what everyone wanted from me. I was tired of always being the one person to drop everything &amp; help when family needed it. I was tired of feeling guilty for how my Mum’s life has been. The advice to us is to be open, honest, talk &amp; get a good support system. I did that &amp; said I was struggling with depression &amp; regret it. I regret making myself look weak, vulnerable &amp; opening myself up for criticism &amp; their judgemental opinions on my life. My family &amp; my in-laws have called me selfish, attention seeking &amp; now have as little to do with me as possible. My half Sister hardly talks to me because, how could I be so selfish &amp; do that to my Mum!! Being open about depression made things so much worse for me. They have gossiped to their mates about what I did &amp; how awful it was I did that to them, at Christmas. Now when I bump into their friends I’m this awful attention seeker that did that to their friend. How could I do that to my Mom? Never mind that she was a terrible Mother to me. How could I do that to my in-laws? Never mind that I’ve never been good enough for their son &amp; I am the worst of society for what I’ve put him through. They don’t know what he’s put me through, they don’t take responsibility for how awful they have treated me over the years. Why is everything entirely my fault? I’ve gone along with everything they wanted for the past 20 years. Nobody bothers with me or visits me, I was always the one to make all the effort.

I felt like I didn't belong, even with my friends and family. I always think about the negative side of things, so I can never think of the positive. I wish I could, I've tried.

I always pick one thing that makes me different and focus on it which makes my loneliness worse. I wish I could understand why I like this.

My hallucinations were just worse than my racing thoughts, and I wish it wasn't like this. I like being open about myself and my mental disorders, but it is hard when you're constantly reminded how different you truly are from everyone else.

I recently went to the ER for suicidal ideation. It honestly was the first time I put my mental health first over other things like school or social interaction. After I got discharged from the ER, my fear of not fitting in was worsened by my ""friend"" that picked me up. All they did was yell at me about how I should've done a certain action.

**I am broken and really need advice right now. I need to find a solution.**

Currently I feel stuck in my relationship. I feel it hard to continue this relationship/

We were in a long distance relationship and we finally decided to meet in April. However, when it came close to the day we met, we fought a lot. And he became insecure but he did not say anything. When he arrived in my country, he had second thoughts.

And the tragic began. As he had second thoughts, he did not tell me that he was insecure but that he was flying to my province. I was happy and waited for him at the airport. He didnt come. Until I messsaged him, he said he lied because he wasnt ready. I CRIED a river at the airport. I have never thought he is such a liar.

Then, a few days later, he decided to come, but he did the same thing again. Instead of flying to my place, he flew to Japan but he lied to me that he was deported from my country because of his misbehavior and that someone robbed all his money. I was so worried for him that I flew 1000 km from my place to the airport where he was located. The guard at the airport said I might have been scammed but I scolded at him for that. He looked at me feeling sorry for me but I believed in my bf's shit.

But eventually...I figured it was another lie. Two lies in one week. It was too much for me to handle.

He said he wasnt ready and he was mentally disturbed after all our fights. He said he was afraid that our relationship would turn bitter if we continue to fight. I said okay, we need to meet to solve things out. But he still decided to fly back to the US.

I cried a lot. He did too. But i decided to give us a chance. Coz I love him. I love him so much that I decided to forgive.

\------------------------

But I doubt my decision was right. Because rightnow although I said I forgave hi, my trust for him is not 100% any longer. And I feel bitter for that....

Sometimes I cry and feel ashamed of myself. He said sorry many times and said he is going to therapy so he will be mentally ready to meet me in July, but I doubt I should meet him.

\------------------------

P.s: **He is legit**. Before getting into this relationship, I did a background check on him and everything he said was legit. He even showed me **his security number.**",lonely,I need advice from people.... What should I do now? I forgave him but i feel stuck,2022-05-23 16:21:52

1512,nimble_kitty,1653284526,1,"I feel lost and hopeless.

2 years ago, my first relationship ended because I did something stupid. If you’re curious, I didn’t cheat, but I did something creepy. About 2 weeks into our relationship, I created an instagram account pretending to be a stranger and asked her a bunch of questions that I was too afraid to ask myself. The questions I asked were often personal, so you can imagine how uncomfortable she felt.

I asked her these questions on-and-off for about a month or so, until I felt super guilty about it and deleted the account. We’d constantly joke about who the “stranger” really was, because she’d always screenshot the questions and send them to me. About a year later, she made another joke about how the “stranger” could be me, and I panicked and came clean right there and then. Understandingly, any trust she had in me went away, and she put our relationship on a break, ultimately leaving me.

I can’t tell you how much I loved that girls, and how devastating it was that I ruined everything we had because I was to weak and had to hide my curiosity behind a stupid Instagram account.

It’s taken me 2 years to get over what I did to her, and I still haven’t forgiven myself. I can’t think of any memories I had with her without feeling disgusted at myself.

Throughout the past 2 years, I haven’t really hit the dating scene, other than occasionally asking a girl out that I liked only to be rejected. It wasn’t until about 3 months ago that I tried starting a relationship with someone.

My friend introduced me to a girl who seemed genuinely interested in me, so I decided to ask her out. To my surprise, she said yes, which felt surreal given that the last girl to say yes was two years ago. The next two months I’d spend dating her made me forget everything about my past. It was a breath of fresh air coming from the two years of isolating myself into a state of depression, so it’d be an understatement to say I was happy again.

About 2 months of dating later, I send her a text asking if she wanted to wander the park with me that weekend, and I got no reply. Thinking she must’ve turned her phone off, I called her later that evening, but it went straight to voicemail. I called again the next morning with no response. I was beginning to think the worst had happened, so I asked my friend if he could check up on her, but he reported that everything was fine.

The next day I waited at the park, checking my phone every minute. Desperately, I hit up her Instagram to see if she was on that, only to see “user not found.” I didn’t fully recognize that she ghosted me until I checked snap, only to be blocked minutes after viewing and replying to her story.

Once again, I had been left, only this time I couldn’t figure out why. I had avoided everything I did wrong previously, and gave her as much space and respect possible. Was she not interested in me to begin with? Am I doing something wrong? I feel hopeless. 

It makes me feel like i’m being punished for what I did. Do I deserve another chance at love? Because I don’t feel like letting another person down.

Everyone tells me that “there’s someone for everyone.” My “someone” left me 2 years ago and I don’t think I’ll find anyone else again. Was she the only “one?” Why am I so stupid? Am I worthy?",lonely,Am I bound for loneliness?,2022-05-23 15:42:06

1524,More-Addition,1653281987,1,"Welcome to venting story time with a spinster! It’s a long one! Buckle up! 

To plainly put it, I sort of put myself out there and advertised my weirdness and it got a lot of attention. Mostly unwanted as I was instantly flooded with invitations to chat. Instant regret. I responded to maybe a third. Some lead to okay talks, others stopped immediately. Lol, us humans are strange, let me tell ya. After the overwhelming response, I was tired filtering through what could be decent conversations and what was straight up not what I was looking for. So I deleted the invites. I got back busy with work and put it out of my mind. Maybe 2 days later I got another invite and the opening was rather cute and idk…it Made me go”why not see where this goes?“ 

Long story short, it was like I was talking to myself in guy form. Nothing felt fake, or pressured and I felt like finally I could breathe and say if I found nothing else, I found a forever friend. Could this be BOYFRIEND MATERIAL?! Omg. Surely not….right? That’s a big title to give a person you haven’t known very long. (I didn’t get that far btw) But things felt too good. I fought through sleepy nights after work just to stay up a little longer to talk and it was always worth it. The flirting began. I was in the danger zone now. Flood gates opened so swiftly. Was it too soon? Probably, but he felt the same so we decided to continue slowly.

I lived in pure bliss for a while until one day I asked a question that should’ve been asked earlier on and basically it was on his preference body wise in a partner. You know the basic questions you ask when you’re getting to know someone. His answer made my heart drop into my actual ass. I wasn’t his type. How was this missed?! Where tf do we go from here?! Do we even go from here or is this it?! I didn’t want to lie to him, or be a catfish, so I told him the bad news explaining I’m not his type, providing proof and we maybe exchanged 3-5 short texts after that. Then nothing. He just suddenly ….disappeared. I never felt so abandoned this badly in all my life. I reached out one more time hours later just to see if I should leave I him alone, something was obviously wrong. He said no, he was just busy that day. But honestly I took that as yes. After a evening and night of waiting, I deleted him off my account, deleted his number the next day. I felt like in doing so first, I could lessen the blow of feeling so fkn rejected. I’d have a little control. 

He’s not blocked at all though even to this day. We went from starting and ending each day together to nothing and not a peep after the reveal. Neither of us have a huge social life (by choice) so I know it’s pure avoidance on his end. His job is laid back most of the time. It wouldn’t have normally taken so long for him to reply. Idk why this one hurt so badly. I wanna say it’s the rejection, don’t get me wrong that definitely left a mark. But I think really it was that the thought of us was dropped so fkn fast and left to rot by him. Like it never even happened. Like we weren’t just drooling over each other and amazed at how much we were alike.

How do you just forget someone you had so much in common, and I mean the stupidest little things with, so damn fast?! The plan was before even conversing with him, to get myself together to be healthier and feel more attractive. But boy does this inspire me that much more. Everyone is entitled to like what they like, unless it’s one of those things that’ll put you into prison. So I’m not mad at the fact that I just happened to be the main example of what was undesirable to him. But to be dropped and never spoken to again is really mentally screwing with my mind more than it has with any other bozo (I meant that nicely) that I’ve met. You don’t even care to say goodbye? No,”thanks for the boners, and the support?” Actually that might be what he regrets the most now that I’m thinking about it. Meanwhile, I bet he’s sleeping peacefully right now like a baby drooling, thumb in the mouth and all. I hate it. I don’t wish harm to him, I don’t hate him. I just wish he was more mature than his actions have displayed. 

It’s that last line that makes me relax a little and tell myself I’m better off. A smart guy, a guy with a real heart, wouldn’t do some shit so foul. It will not be so hard with who I’m meant for if I am meant for someone. Who am I kidding, I’m a fkn delight. But goddamn I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss him, miss how easy it was. Being so hopeful of having a future with someone. Waiting on that next text. Just having someone there. Now I’m just lonely af, worse off than before I made that fateful post. Because now I have to think of randomly how I just wasn’t enough. I go from being okay to not and I just wanna be back at my normal lonely self. Not lonely AND rejected. 

Unsubscribe me from these fkn feelings please. I’m so done.

1531,Lost-Object-9701,1653279343,1,"I have attempted to talk two people out of suicide attempts. (separate times)

It worked once with a friend, but failed with an ex (she lived, thankfully). Her attempt was a result of how hopeless she felt in our relationship. I will keep that guilt for a very long time. I fear that it will happen with a girlfriend in the future. Or wife. 

One of my greatest fears is to date someone who would feel lonely while in a relationship with me (not meaning to offend the many people on this sub that feel that way- your feelings are valid). It's ironic, because I don't like to date women who have friends anymore, and haven't for several years now. I wish I could be enough for somebody (along with their own family, if that makes sense).

I feel really cursed. Probably not literally, but I can't completely stave away the 'magic thinking'. I help people in the short term, but I tend to leave a destructive wake. Whether or not there have been net-positives,.. I don't know. I really don't know. I just know that I'm fucked. There's no way that there's a true match for me (and vice versa). For various reasons.

I feel bad for saying this when I do get matches on a dating app, but I'll have you know that most matches are just an inferred 'I think you're kinda cute, but you're not stable enough to be a boyfriend,' from what I infer. No, not even an inference in all cases. And I think that even if I was, the same type of thing would happen.

I do get some people that might seem serious, but I just don't think that there's an actual match out there for me. I have already failed.

I'm the type of person who has a very rough time working on myself, and getting over grief. 

Am I supposed to feel hope, anymore? What I want isn't realistic, and who I am is insufficient and unpragmatic.

I really miss cuddling. I want to be the dominant partner to somebody. Like, the gentle but also rough kind of dominant partner. I really do, but I just, it doesn't make sense, really, if I can't be a member of society. And so often now, I just picture myself cuddling up on a woman rather than the other way around.

        It has been many years since this feeling returned. Never in my life have I known an emotion so overwhelming and overpowering. Just the thought and presence of this emotion brings despair. Not happiness nor fear has such a tremendous effect on me. Nor either of them terrify me to the core. This emotion is loneliness and we have yet again been aquatinted. 

        Loneliness does not feel like an absence of an emotion. Even thought it literally is the absence of someone it does not feel like an emotion that is absent. This emotion does not need to be filled. It is the emotion that does the filling. It overflows over all and triumphs all.  I envy all who do not have to struggle over the fear of this emotions possible coming. I know the fear of it dwells in everyone. I have met it face to face today in the mirror. A horrible realization that I am without another. Nobody to spend my days, my hours, my minutes nor my seconds. Nobody to hold or talk to. It is just I. 

        I do not wish for someone to marry, or somebody to spend years with. Somebody to talk about my day or just a good morning or good night would do. I do not wish for extravagant wants. My wish is quite simple really. I wish to not be alone. 

        I had someone a bit ago. Somebody to message good morning and night to. Somebody to hold and smile to. Somebody to bear their burdens and be a helping hand. Someone who would listen and treat me with care. That someone is now a stranger again. And with the leave of that someone, someone new has walked into my life. It is someone I have known for years prior and someone that knows me inside out. We are well versed with each other but I dread its existence. It is loneliness and it has enveloped me.

“I accept that there is nobody for me”

Many of us are severely agonised because we can’t find irl relationships, but we’re also only interested in relationships that are local.

Whenever we connect online we always feel sad that the person doesn’t live near us.

So why aren’t we lonely people prepared to relocate?

Why must we call it quits when we can’t find anyone within our own zip code? What about the 7 billion other people that don’t live in your country?

When you think about it, by only focusing on our local area, we are drastically cutting our chances and without just cause. Millions of people relocate to find work, friends and love.

Most of us claim to have such bleak lives that there’s honestly little reason to stay where we are. We’re miserable to point of suicide, so isn’t moving worth it?

I live in an area where I don't speak the language as well as I could; while most people speak English, they typically hold it against me that I'm American, so they don't give me a chance. There's other Americans in the area, but they're by and large from a completely different walk of life from me; I've been here with my parents who fit in a lot better, but for the last 3 years or so, I've really only had one friend in the area.

It just sucks. I'm an introvert, so of course that makes it harder to meet people, but I've pushed myself out of my comfort zone multiple times; I've tried going to events, to hobbies, I mean I work as a bartender. Meeting people isn't an issue, but no matter how casual and nonchalant I am, or how excited and outgoing and hard I try, people just seem to get bored with me and go back to their established groups. I can only take being left on read so many times and still keep trying; I put in so much effort just to have anyone to hang out with casually, and they always find someone else. I don't mean this solely romantically either, I just want friends in general.

I do have close-ish friends in a sense; I consider them my closest friends, though besides one or two, I know that isn't reciprocated. Besides the one friend in the area (who is also an ex, making things more awkward), everyone lives far away. As in, thousands of miles, $750+ plane ticket away; not something I can casually afford.

It's just kind of numbing. Like I said, I try and try, but since I was 16 (I'm now almost 22) I've barely had a chance to make and keep friends, let alone do anything teens or young adults do. I feel alone in my life and I feel like it's going to stay that way, because I'll always be the same weird kid I was in high school (I'm very likely undiagnosed as autistic, having done some self-reflection).

Whatever, like I said I have nothing of value to add here. I just feel like there's no space in the world where I fit, as anything more than a superficial Thing to help people with their problems. Almost every convo I have with anyone ends with them leaving me on read. If I want to talk to people, in person or through text, I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle where they couldn't care less if I'm around or not. Besides a very small number of people, nobody ever reaches out to initiate contact with me; and when I say never, I mean never, presumably because they have closer friend groups in there area.

It's just sad to see. I've gotten to the point where I feel like my only defense is acceptance and to move on and suck it up. I know people say ""you have to love yourself and be comfortable being alone first"", but I more or less do, and I am. I've been by myself mostly for years now, I'm pretty good at it; and it's hard to maintain self-confidence when, no matter how desireable I think I am, I'm clearly so easily disposable to others.

This is long so I'll stop. Like I said, I'm not a danger to myself or anything. I'm just lonely and I wish somebody would give me the time of day, and I could make some actual friends, who reach out to me because they want to, and who legitimately desire and enjoy my company. It's probably a pipe dream but I guess you never know.

Sorry this is so long, I just wanted to get it off my chest and hope maybe somebody will see it without thinking I'm an overly dramatic or emo asshole lol.

Then I say goodbye to education (until I go to law school - planning to work and take a year off before law school since I want to add some things to my resume like more work experience as well as needing a mental health break as I'm healing right now from a variety of things - engrossing myself in a job is a good distraction). 

I don't want to move back home. I feel sad and lonely.  I don't know. My college isn't far away from my parent's house (40 minute drive) so I can go home whenever, but it's so quiet. Going home also brings up a lot of childhood trauma or even recent trauma (not my parent's fault, I just hated who I became since I started college, fixed a lot of my issues but still healing). My neighborhood is quiet too. Typical suburb. At my apartment, I feel less lonely even when my roommates are gone because there's constantly cars honking outside, people my age living above me being loud and noisy, people in the lobby, living in a bigger city, etc.... anyways I will have to move out in a little over a month and I'm dreading moving back home. I'm trying to find a job but I'm also crippled with depression right now. Feelings of loneliness. I just want my mom to hug me. I just need someone to talk to. My friends have all moved away. I don't know how to make friends outside of school. I hope I make friends at the job I choose to work at (only for a year), but if my collagues are all a lot older than me, then I'm lonely again. Maybe I should've just gone straight to law school out of college but I needed a mental break. I've been in school for a longggg time now. 

I want to start running again but can't motivate myself to do so. Maybe I'll join a running club, and can make friends that way. As an emerging adult - I don't know what to do, how to make friends (or get a boyfriend for that matter), and I feel lost in space and time. I can't get over my ex. 

I just need a hug.

Well at any rate I'm more of a geeky Individual, so naturally I enjoy messing around with tech but I also love watching anime, reading Manga/Manwa playing video games binging political YouTube videos etc.

I enjoy a good amount of genres of music, only genre I hate is Kpop 😎.
Star wars was always a big thing for me growing up and I fell in love with the expanded universe.

Chintu : Hmm so you need friends, or have shitty friends then you have come to the right place, order your new friend now and get 5 years of luck for free. Now my partner mintu will tell about the friend you are gonna get 

Mintu: well so the friend you are gonna get is 17 years old and it's name is Humai. Well he's funny ( maybe not )

He likes to learn languages, well he knows Hindi and Urdu but he wanna start reading novels and it's hard, like really compared to English. He will start off with some short stories and all. He started learning Norwegian, French and Farsi. تم دیوانے ہے اور کچھ نہیں یارو( it's not farsi, it's urdu ) 

You can rant about anything, he can listen to it and give shitty advice 

Well he share lame memes tooo

He likes to talk about religions even though he knows lil about religions. Basically, he knows about abrahamic faiths more compared to other religions

He is preparing for the SAT and might prepare for APs like self study, if you have advice on college, majors and stuff help this poor guy. He's 17 and still has no idea what he wants to be 

He likes to do origami, Sketching he recently started doing both of them. So, he sucks a lot in it. I wanna have some more cool hobbies. Suggest some hobbies for me 

He might learn to cook as well, it's cool tbh, well he wants to move to usa. So, just wanted to be independent I guess but is not independent. Every thing is done by his mum from washing clothes to cooking

He reads novels, he tried reading Hindi and Urdu novels but heck it's hard, I think he might wanna improve it or start off reading something simple before moving on to something complex. He did read some English novels though. He has started a lil time ago. So, he didn't read many. He will be having holidays. So, he will be on a reading spree. You can suggest some 

He likes to listen songs and podcasts, his taste is real stupid, it goes from pop to classic in no time. He listend hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi, hebrew songs a lot 

He likes to watch movies and series. So suggest some, rn i am watching 2 broke girls and American dad ( he even forgot the name)

Even when I manage to find somebody I have something in common with and chat for a few days they stop replying after some time. 

Nobody ever writes the first message. People tell me that they like talking to me yet it's always me who has to do the first move. That makes me feel unwanted and like a burden.

When I found this community I was happy because I thought people here lack human contact same like me and will like to chat with somebody. Most of the people I talked to so far proved me otherwise. 

Feels like people here are not lonely. Many of you have friends, family, and partners. How can you be lonely? I know one can feel lonely even surrounded by people but it's weird hearing how you plan to do this and that with somebody close to you while also claiming to be lonely.

Complaining and ranting about your desires, whether they’re as essential as normal human interactions isn’t going to manifest it into your life. I understand many of you see the whole “just focus on yourself” motto as cringe and not solving the problem, I want to let you know loneliness is a _symptom_ not the _root problem_ . To solve the root problem (which will relieve the symptoms) you must reflect introspectively and study your past, that has molded you into the person you are today. It is a tediously long and daunting task that may takes years to fully solve, but once you unearth the solution you will no longer be lonely. Each person has their own unique problems and the ability to solve them with patience, gratitude and a bit of perseverance. In no way shape org or am I saying it’s easy, but it didn’t impossible. 

TL;DR (I still encourage you to read the post) loneliness is a symptom of a root problem that is discrete to each individual. To solve the root issue you must look forth introspectively, study your past and dissect it to understand what has caused you to be the way you are.",lonely,Advice from someone in the same boat as everyone else here,2022-05-23 05:02:58

I don’t know, I might just use some good tips and pointers before I leave this approach alone. Most conversations either start up really strong, peak right around 5 mins in, then straight downhill from there! Whatever happened to trying, and having genuine interest in talking and getting to know people…? Oh, right, we got super lazy thanks to the internet and all these crazy social media outlets! My least fav online encounters have been with lazy ppl, can barely talk, text and mostly think either the world revolves around them or every guy online is out there after their pants!

A friend said they went through things and needed space because of it. I said it's fine, hoped for the best and only sent them one message throughout hoping for the best. Week later they removed me as a friend, reason being they still needs space and did not want to talk and then blocked me a bit later, they kept me elsewhere.

month later I decided to hit up a friend of them about my friend because i was just really worried about my friend and all, let's say that's B, my friend is A. I did hit up my friend but I can't tell if they saw it or not. I knew B a bit from a server back then.

B said they weren't so close with A as they used to be, they had a relationship until few months ago which went dirty according to her, yet they stayed friends. But they still at least talked. But as our conversation went on, when I explained my situation and why I hit her up, I felt B was kinda unhappy about the friendship with A. B felt A changed, and they also didn't really see each other in person anymore. But B was happy though for A. I guess B never was able to talk about this since she kept saying stuff related to their friendship.

Point is, suddenly B said they blocked A. Asking why, they didn't feel any friendship between them anymore. I said at least to talk it out to A but B saw no point. A heard we talked and became mad at me, presumably I ruined that friendship and/or for reaching out, basically. Even though it's a misunderstanding and miscommunication as well. My friend reacted like being angry at a headline but not reading the article. 

My friend does not want to talk about it and is just mad at me, I feel insanely guilty about all this even though I had no ill intend at all and just did reach out B because I was worried and missed A. I did not convince B either to quit being friends or even mention it, I would never try to sabotage friendships. It's their issues, I know. But I feel I scratched open a wound and ruined a friendship. I've been crying a lot and just blame myself for it all, there's so much pain right now and loneliness, I feel again I hurt someone.

While I had no one and went out with my parents. When I went out with my mother she was almost angry at me and insulted me for not meeting anyone in the last 5 years of school to go out with.This ruined the night for me.

1650,Expert_Carpenter3197,1653227269,1,"My 29th birthday is this weekend. I always get sad around my birthday because I never do anything and I have no friends. It’s just me and my husband (and my parents obvi) and we have a terrible marriage. We both don’t want to be together, but he won’t leave because he needs me for a green card and I won’t leave because I’m not working right now because we have 2 dogs with special needs that prevent me from working so I stay because I can’t afford to leave. This birthday is kind of important to me because it’s my last one in my 20s. It makes me reflect on my life and how pathetic I am and what a loser I’ve continued to be because I have nothing to show for the past 29 years. 

My parents decided to take a week long vacation so I have to watch their 4 dogs and I’ll be stuck at home as usual so even if I had plans I would t be able to follow through. 29 years, no degree, no money, no job, no kids (I wanted kids), shitty marriage, no friends. I’ve also recently become a functioning alcoholic; I drink every day usually start at 11 am because why not? If I’m gonna be depressed and alone might as well drink and make myself feel a little better. 

I’ve also suffered from mental health issues my whole life. When I was in high school I always thought about when I was 18 I’d finally get the help I needed because my parents didn’t believe that mental health was real and always refused to take me to see someone. But when I was 18 they removed me from their health insurance and I didn’t have the means to go get help. When I was 21 I finally got insurance and went to see someone. They diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and loaded me up with pills until a month later they stopped accepting my insurance and visits alone were $200 every other week and at the time I couldn’t afford it so I stopped going. Looking back I think I was misdiagnosed anyway because if I truly was bipolar and not on meds I’d probably be psychotic. 


Just wanted somewhere to vent because I again I don’t have friends or any kind of emotional support system. I know I’m the only one who can change my life and I’m sitting here having a pitty party instead of doing something about it, but it’s been 29 years of this and I just don’t see the point in doing anything about it now. For what? Through all of my life’s relationships I’ve never felt a real connection with anyone (friends or boyfriends) I just didn’t want to be alone. Sometimes I think maybe there something wrong with me like maybe I’m not capable of having real deep connections.",lonely,I’m sad,2022-05-22 23:47:49

1662,threwaccmylife234,1653222804,1,"I created this throwaway account to write here since my original account can be seen by my friends.

I'm just 20 and honestly, sometimes the burden of feelings becomes a bit too much. When I read some of the posts here I see people struggling with many kinds of problems be it physical or psychological. And I understand. I understand the pain and numbness people are experiencing; not because I particularly went through similar stuff but I just can. 

For the past 7-8 months, I've been feeling more numb everyday. I still think it is not depression but something is definitely off. I feel distant from my family and friends. I usually find myself thinking if I am meant to live all my life alone or not. The thing is, I am not the guy who gets too close with people. No matter how close I am with someone, I don't tell my problems most of the time. Ironically, I know I am not alone because sometimes I browse this subreddit and see people who are experiencing similar feelings. 

For the last few years, maybe to be more exact since I was 14, my life pretty much became monotonous. Even though right now I am in college, I just go to the classes and return home or I sit with one or two people for like an hour. I do not participate in any events, I do not join any student clubs. I return to home and do the assignments and sleep. In my personal life, sometimes I get invited to go out with my friends but even when I'm going I want to be home. I feel like I don't have the energy to talk and entertain people. I just want to sit down and stay like that for hours.

Recently, I wanted to break the cycle. I know its cliche but I met a girl and I liked her. I don't know what happened, I just know that some things had to change and I wanted to do something about it. Well, I know it was a mistake since no girl ever liked me before, I was always the platonic guy crushing over a girl for some time and get rejected after first try. Nevertheless, knowing the result from the beginning, I let myself to like her. I just wanted to feel something, care about something and feel alive. I wanted to escape from the monotonous life I've been living for the past few years. I wanted to hold a hand and feel my heartbeat rising up. I wanted to go beautiful places and just sit there in silence without being awkward. I wanted to do things and have fun and most of all, I just wanted to be hugged. 

If you read until here, you can obviously guess the result. She is not interested in me. Well, like I said, I was expecting this result and do not get me wrong, I am not angry to her or anything; I just feel sad and more numb than yesterday. I know that to break the cycle I can do other things such as trying to find a new hobby or starting to exercise etc. but I can not do most of them right now due to financial issues and mental exhaustion.

Honestly, I don't know what will happen to me. My country, socially and economically, is in shambles. I was in love with my major but since last year I hate it. I don't know if I can ever get a job. I am slowly distancing myself from my family and friends. I can't get in a relationship and commit myself to someone. I know you guys also sometimes feel like this. I just want to say you are not alone. Although this is a sub meant for lonely people and as I am writing these lines I feel very lonely, I know this post will at least reach some of you people and maybe they will say 'yeah, I also feel like that and I am not alone'.

I only have two friends, they recently have gotten into relationships with girls and I’m very happy for them but part of me wishes I had that too.

I know at my age birthdays shouldn't matter but my Dad always made a big deal out of them and once he passed I tried to keep that spirit going. I do everything I canto give friends and family a fun happy day.  Then I end up spending mine alone. Baking my own cake. Watching the same old TV shows.  Today before my D&amp;D session I(yes, I'm an old nerd) I went to grab the mail and the only thing there was a large envelope addressed to me.  It was from Amazon and I hadn't ordered anything.  The contents felt small through the envelope.  I asked my sister if she accidentally put my name on something she bought and she said no.  I opened it up and it was a brand new set of dice from one of my sisters friends who she knew waaaay back when I was first born.  It was so unexpected and the timing was almost eerie.  I have a huge dice collection so it was a perfect gift.  Anyway I just wanted to inject a tiny piece of positivity into the thread.

I'm kind of a doomer, but not in the sense that I spent the night drinking myself to sleep and crying for her or the things that have happened to me. I just don't care too much anymore. 

Since I discovered my newfound love for my own company I've come a long way. I returned to college, got my degree and now I'm in law school. I enjoy it a lot. It isn't perfect but I can deal with it so far. But the thing is that my life is kinda boring. I think of people who hangout with their ""friends"" and for brief moments I say ""I kinda want that"".

1691,IDUS_Kid,1653207331,1,"Venting 

This is kind of sad and if you can’t handle that right now move on from this post. My sibling has always been a favorite in my family (they are funny, quiet) but they also are the most troublesome. They act out and cause worry and many times my parents vent about it to me (I’m the younger sibling). They only ever seem to talk about my sibling and accept them for who they are. As I grew older my sibling became more depressed and angry. And with that came self harm and suicide attempts (or the threat of suicide). Each of these things becoming more frequent whenever something has built up with them over time. And with these attempts on their life, I’ve always had to be there to talk them out of it and give comfort because my parents are never able to properly do so. My parents call me or wake me up whenever their child has gone off into the night with a lack of communication (they ignore everyone’s calls or texts).  I love my sibling, but I sometimes stay up at night thinking how tired I am of this cycle. I feel selfish. I have my own struggles mentally and to carry on those as well really adds a load, but I can’t let my sibling drown in their own sorrow. And I certainly couldn’t handle it if they died and somehow it could have been prevented. At the same time though it puts me back in this mental state that no one really cares about how I feel about dealing with so much for years (of course there is worse stuff to deal with), but I feel like I had to grow up emotionally faster than most. I don’t know maybe I’m just being weird. What are y’all’s thoughts?",lonely,I feel selfish sometimes because I am tired of having to “take care” of my sibling.,2022-05-22 18:15:31

i want to try to make new friends so bad but i feel like it’s too late to make friends at school and i don’t have anywhere else i could make friends. 

i also feel like. this is kinda awkward for me to say ngl but i feel like my longing for a bf prevents me from making friends online because whenever i try that’s what’s on my mind. not to sound weird. i’m asexual and demiromantic or greyromantic. which only makes this worse because i feel like sex is so important to so many guys and no one will want me after they know i’m ace. 

i just wanna be able to grow w someone that i actually trust and i feel like a simple friendship won’t be enough, i don’t know. but i do want more friends. so conflicting.

i come home from school then lay in bed and go though a combination of unbearable boredom and loneliness. no one to talk to, no will or motivation to do things i enjoy. 

such a great way to spend my teenage years right. advice would be cool. you can dm me if you’d like and you’re around 17 :). don’t look at my account being created a couple minutes ago i don’t need anyone ik finding this LMAO

1699,No_Fall_2769,1653203463,1,"I'm 22 years old and I don't have a job, that makes me feel so terrible because my mom gives me money and I feel bad for spending her money. I've tried almost everything to get some cash but it's not working. I've tried to have my own business but they fail or they aren't affordable. I submitted my resume to several jobs but they just ""call me later"" (obviously, they never call). I even tried to get money by ""selling content"" (like nudes and hot calls) but I didn't get enough money and it made me feel ashamed. 

I  have a lot of problems at home so now I'm renting in another state because of college but it's more expensive than staying at home. But if I stay at home  my stress level will just increase and I'll feel worst.

By the way I've been coping with anxiety and depression since I was 15. I used to do self harm but I tried to be sober (it's been like 10, months or maybe a year since I last self harmed). I've been seeking like 5 therapist but now I'm tired and I don't want to have therapy anymore. Even though I had some progress, I feel like it's useless and it's always the same shit.

So I replaced self harm with another things like alcohol, marijuana and medicine. Don't worry, I don't do this often, just when I feel very bad  I tend to drink or get a little high. Unfortunately, this made me take bad decisions, like stealing my grandma's Clonazepam and taking the whole bottle. She doesn't know but now she need it and I feel so bad for it.

Sometimes I feel like I need to be intoxicated to forget about my problems and if I can't get intoxicated I just replace that with physical pleasure like having a lot of sex or masturbating just to feel relaxed.

By the way my social life is a mess. I don't have any friends at college, and my only three friends are miles away and they barely talk to me so I feel so fucking lonely. I have a boyfriend but I don't want to depend on him but I feel like I'm already codependent because he's the one who's always there for me and if he's not I feel sad.

Two of them formed a new group, one formed a different group, and one joined his church group. I had two left who we were all mutually our closest friends. But one stopped talking much due to personal issues and now (my college freshman year just ended) the last one is in a phase where he prefers to not talk to friends. I still keep in touch with all of them (except the last, even though i try), but now I'm no one's main friend. That is, no one takes initiative to talk to me and even when i take initiative, they often take hours to respond. Im certain theres no hidden grudges, its just that they either have gifriends, ""better"" friends, or don't talk often in general. I basically only made one friend that wasnt through mutuals in college. This has left me feeling lonely (for quite a while now, even in high school), especially when I'm reminded that other people receive texts or calls they didn't initiate. I've definitely struggled with shyness and social skills. This post is something I'd usually post on my private Snapchat story but whenever i do, despite responses, nothing changes. Also i don't want people changing their interactions with me out of pity. I want people who like me for me. Id see a therapist but my friends say they're not very helpful, just someone you can rant to. Also they cost money.

Or the pain ended me, I don’t know.

This is my second time writing here. I’m not writing for attention. I’m writing to get it off my chest, and possibly motivate others to hold on tight to life. Your life’s story may change; although, mine didn’t and most likely won’t. 

I am not going to go into the details on how I did it, but I did lost consciousness. As I was falling under, I felt tranquility. I was not scared, my heart and mind were calm… I felt that for the first time it all was going to fix itself, everything… my disease, my lack of love, my feeling of burden to others, to society… I thought it would all end. Then, I woke up. 

Being in a wheelchair, of course, makes everything harder. So, my caregiver found me and called emergency services. 

This is an experience I can’t describe, but it didn’t make me realize that I love life or that I’m taking it for granted. This experience instill in me that not everyone is going to live with a partner, family or even friends, some of us, will be lonely. Even if I fight, I need to accept there are things I’ll never be able to do, but the pain is still there, and that it will not come to an end until I do. 

Solitude and lack of human contact is real. It destroys everything you once were, that person that you’ll never get back. In my case it’s far too gone now. 

When I was eight years old, and my muscular dystrophy started to progress  severely, I started having issues walking, I would fall to the ground every time uncontrollably, and I eventually ended up wheelchair-bounded, and my teacher said: “I am so amazed by you, even with all the struggles you’ve kept your smile and positive energy. Please don’t ever change, I knew a man in a wheelchair who was very angry all the time and depressed, please don’t ever be like that”, but I did. I did become that angry, depressed, lonely, and empty-spirited person. 

After many, many years, I kept my thinking of my teacher and what she said and I would think of it, over and over, wondering why did that man changed and what made him that way. Now that I’m older, I get it. There’s very little I can say to explain why or how, until you have live through so much pain. There’s nothing of me anymore, and all I wish is to tell myself as a child, more of how beautiful she was, even if no one else did.

Since i still saw(and see) them from time to time and i couldn't/can't help feeling like a failure when they bring up  their weekly hook ups, or their girlfriends, or the parties they went while i had nothing to show for i began to blatantly lie about my social life: inventing girls( with some random photo as ""evidence""), uploading fake stories of me going clubing/ to a bar,reading about trendy places online to tell  how cool ""going to those"" places was and hell i even put good clothes on weekends to upload a couple of pictures of miself at the early hours of the morning implying i have just returned home from some cool night out or something.

 It was only natural that after some time i began telling all these lies at my classes and workplace too as i figured out it's the only thing that prevents people from realising i'm a miserable,lonely, loser from whom nothing is to be gained by even the slightest social interaction.

I think it will be fine because for the most part dating has showed me how broken a lot of prospects are. I myself and not perfect and that’s why I’d like to be a better person.

Desirableness is a bit of an ugly feeling for me because I am not the person I pretend to be 70-80% of the time.

Even when I tell the truth nobody believes me

Suicidal feelings used to be raw pain and sadness 
But lately it’s been both that and feelings that are overwhelmingly calm and yet feel like an endless eternal scream inside my own head that nobody else can hear 

I don’t know what I need to do to feel a desire to live again.
I think love is a dangerous feeling for me because when it goes wrong I immediately feel suicidal. In some ways it’s the only thing I ever wanted. And that’s also the truest and most complete lie. Love isn’t enough for me. Nobody survives a relationship or the future off love some because love now doesn’t necessarily mean love later, twenty years down the road.

As a society I think we have never developed a the skill to choose wisely. I hope I never trust my eyes again in love because some of the ugliest and most emotionally undesirable people I’ve met are externally average to attractive looking

I used to have friends, a girlfriend, I’ve always been fairly reclusive but I had a social life of some kind. When the relationship went sour I ended up losing everything, including a place to live due to us living together. 

I ended up having to move half way across the country because that was the closest family I had that I could stay with. It’s now two years later, I still haven’t managed to get back on my feet thanks to covid and a million other things that all happened around the same time.  The town I live in is rural (like super) and I just have no idea how to get back to meeting people. 

I feel so isolated from the world. I’m out of friends. I haven’t been with a woman since the breakup, hell I haven’t *spoken* to a woman since. I feel like I’ve devolved to social nothingness. I’ve tried talking to people online with little success, I’ve tried dating apps but the few people I found lived hours away and it’s just not feasible.

As for romantically, it is somehow a lot worst, never kissed any body, never hugged anybody (romantically),never hold hand, and never even been asked out, I'm in my twenties and never went on a date.
I really didn't think much about any of this until recently, when I was talking with my classmates, and they were all talking about their relationship, how all of them been in one, or still in one, even the ones who are younger or more rilegest, I felt like I'm missing out on this.
I come from a religious house, been told my whole life not to talk to boy unless it's school related, and I think I took it to a whole new level, I never had any guy friends, and the first time I talked to a boy (out side of family) was in the end of sixth grade, hell I can't even talk to them properly because I become anxious.
Right now it is midnight, and I feel more lonely than ever, I don't want to be like this my whole life, I want friends to stay with me, I want a lover, to experience relationships, even if it once, I just want to try it.
But at this point it seems like I am the problem,  not like i am a bitch, not like I'm super bad looking, but I'm a shallow person, no interneting hoppies or internet, that get the joke last, and doesn't talk a lot, and usually when I do it is not interesting, and no one listens.
I feel like I can't change, and I fell like I'm gonna end up old and lonely, I even accepted the idea my little sisters would marry before I could make a friend, and it just so depressing sometimes, to think like I don't really belong somewhere not even home, so what am I to do?.

Isolation even living around and walking in a crowded area doesn't mean anything. My punishment ensures I will not connect with any person.

1817,fatrudygay,1653167946,1,"It was my 26th birthday today. I asked a couple friends if they were down to hangout. They all said okay, then they all cancelled at the last second.

One of them said he is studying for a test that he will take next December. Apparently he was so busy he couldn't spare a Saturday night. Yesterday one of said we could hang out at his place, now he is bragging about inviting over some girl he knew from high school. The other two have families, one of them even has a baby boy now, so I can't blame them for wanting to spend some time with their families instead of me. And let's not even talk about my family, who will never admit that they are the reason I still haven't graduated and moved out like everyone at my age did a while ago. I took care of them when they needed me, and I still do. But for reasons I do not know they still resent me for it. I have known my friends literally half my life, and as dysfunctional as they are my family is still my family. I love them, even if they make it really hard sometimes.

Real fun part of all this is that not even one of them knew it was my birthday. Thought I rather they ditch me outright rather than hang out with me just because of my if it. What they do know is that I had the worst breakup of my life a month ago, and nothing ever feels the same ever since. She was a wonderful person that made me feel truly wanted and made me want to be a better person. I wish I got to tell her that before we drifted apart for reasons that were outside of our control. Even though I don't have the courage to call her and ask how she is doing, I hope she is fine.

So you see, I don't really care about my birthday at all. I have stopped caring since they started to feel like I was getting old instead of growing up. What I do care is that tonight, I realized how truly lonely I am. And all I can think about is that it wouldn't sting as much if I was actually alone. If nobody depended on me, if nobody called me only when they needed my help. As stupid as that sounds, maybe I wouldn't feel so abandoned. It's like I've given everyone a piece of myself, and I'm not sure what I've got left within me. But no matter what, I carry on somehow.

So if you are still reading this self-pitying wall of text, please know that I understand how you feel friend. Our lives and struggles might be different, but I understand.

The night went by fine for the most part. But after a certain point I think I had a panic attack. I come out of the bathroom and he see him making out with the person he invited. The rest of the group had kinda splintered off while I was away. 

I kinda broke. 

I maintained myself the best I could but I think my demeanor rubbed off onto everybody else. Buddy and his girl kept trying to get me to go after anyone that would walk by us after that and I just kept getting annoyed. I just felt my sadness and loneliness that he is fully aware of was now just being used as a twisted joke. Or trying to pawn me off onto someone else. I just got so fucking annoyed by it and pissed off I snapped at them ‘can we please just Fucking stop?’ I killed the vibe. I didn’t want to. I wanted my friend to have a good time on his birthday and he was and I just wanted to be happy for him instead of dragging my crap front and center when it’s too late in the night and I’m too drunk to do anything about it.

The one who is supportive of everybody else and always trying to make everyone happy and have a good time. I feel like a prop. 

They went out to a food truck at close and I decided just to dip. I start walking and my buddy comes running up asking to get his smokes out of my car. He texts me when he made it home safe telling me that he loved me there by his side. I do appreciate it. I do. But I just felt used. I felt like I was a third wheel to his date.

I’m 23f. Trying to keep up with an epilepsy diagnosis at 18 and a hard law school, which I hate. The diagnosis definitely slowed me down and made me sadder but I never quit. Always went to school, always studied, working out etc. But all of my family somehow believes I quit.

Today my mum broke her nerves on me. All I asked her was to cook fish because it’s in my diet and when I asked for extra lemon she just went crazy! Screaming, venting, hitting things. I kept eating quietly but gutted. 

Feeling down, I cancelled my participation in yoga class and the teacher got annoyed too. “You should have informed earlier”, my participation or not changes literally nothing to her class tho, the class has already other clients. Besides I’ve never missed a single class and I always pay in advance.

And as if all these weren’t enough, my mum hit again. She decided by herself to take me to the yoga class, although I told her I prefer to go alone. She got dressed and knocked my door and when I told her I’m not going she went literally out of her mind. Screaming again, calling me bad things, ungrateful, bitch, authoritarian, jerk etc

Being unemployed, not financially stable to just leave this madness makes every judgment from my family a toll on my mental health.

I’ve never had a someone that’s wanted to be with me. I’m now 25 and haven’t had someone I can really call my boyfriend.

Also lowkey wish I had a lil brother or sister. Always wanted to be that big brother figure. /random

I find it hard to make connections with people especially women in part because I look like I’m 28 or something people tell me often. 

It also doesn’t help I spent the majority of my adult life in the Army and now that I’m out can collect some wardrobe and develop my own style and personality. I work for a major brand so I have some style unlike most ppl my age lol. 

I would say I have a youthful vibe and energy. I’m not shy and at and have the gift of gab. I def have a big personality and value depth and effort/emotion from people. 

I don’t set boundaries or expectations and rules for a friendship. Vibe and go with the flow. 

For me I wish I had someone consistent to talk to. It’s so easy to be anonymous and ghost people. I know I’ve been on the receiving end of that left feeling pretty empty. It sucks but it’s 2022 also and the way I look at it is like… you either keep up and do your best or become static and cry about it. It’s a harsh society to try and find your person in right now. 

I feel like I’m in a place in my life to add someone to it. I could careless how old you are or if you have kids or not. We all have some level of baggage. I’m open to make friends with anyone really. Just be a good person. 

Me? I have so many diverse hobbies from taking care of my plants, being a cat dad, to soccer to learning how to play table tennis rn haha.

I’d love to get to know a good person who likes to talk and share. Also don’t mind showing pictures of you like seeing who you’re talking to. I’m a tall lanky fit drink of water myself 😜

1905,potatopandatv,1653134723,1,"I just turned 38 earlier this week, and this is honestly been an issue that’s been bothering me for the last 4-5 or so.

Being in my late 30s, I sort of almost feel like a leper of sorts because I’ve never been in a serious relationship.

Seeing people in their 20s getting married and having kids always sort of makes the issue worse for me because it makes me wonder why I haven’t been able to figure out the relationship thing when someone who’s 10+ years younger than me apparently has.

Being an overweight guy, I know my potential dating pool is significantly smaller than if I was a “normal” size or closer to a normal size. But, then I see people who are around my size (or even bigger) in relationships, and that sort of compounds my thinking about myself.

I know I’m not the best looking guy in the world. But, I’d like to think I’m at least moderately attractive/put together for someone my size. I put some effort into not being the stereotypical “sloppy fat guy”. I’ve had a few people tell me I’m good looking. But, this has mostly come from friends/co-workers and most of the ones who’ve said this are married. So, (especially with my self-esteem issues) it’s hard for me to tell if they’re being genuine or if they’re just trying to help me feel better.

I think a lot of it is I’m not at that age where I feel like I should have had a family of my own by now. Especially since I’ve never had success with dating/relationships, I feel like there’s something in my life missing where a life companion should be.

I understand comparing myself to others in the dating/relationship world isn’t the best because no relationship is perfect and not all of them will last. But, I feel like people comparing themselves to others is part of human nature.

PS-

If you’re reading this and you’re the type of person that gives the “WeLl, JuSt Go To ThE gYm” line when someone talks about being overweight, please kindly go fuck yourself. It’s not helpful.",lonely,I always wonder what’s wrong with me that makes me not worth being loved…,2022-05-21 22:05:23

1923,Quiriddeas,1653124175,1,"For starters: I am blessed with a lovely family and nice colleagues. But that's where it ends. 

I don't have friends that seem to care about me. It's always me reaching out to them.  I don't have people who love me in a different way then my family does. 

I'm gay and I recently moved out. Whenever I come home now, there's nobody. Sometimes I'm too busy doing chores to even think about that. But especially in the weekends or on some nights I feel terrible. 

I started to watch the Netflix series Heartstopper this week. First evening I binged half the season. I loved it, I was so stoked on feeling that cute 'being in love' feeling, I was actually really happy I felt something like that again.

Then the day after, yesterday, I felt like the complete opposite. The series made me realise I have never had any romantic stuff with someone.

It made it look like it is 'necessary' to have had romantic interaction as a teenager. I made me feel like I missed out. Like I failed doing what was 'normal' at that age. I know the series is 100% made up, but it still made me feel that way.

I never held hands, never sat on the couch next to someone at home, never been looked at in that way or given a cute compliment. 

I'm in my mid twenties and I feel like I'm a failure missing all these things. I know not everybody explores there romances at early age, but it mostly feels like I'm the only one in my whole area of colleagues and family.

At the same time, I am honest when I say I genuinely think there is not someone that's made for me. I don't see how that'd happen. So the ""solution"" for me being lonely is known to me, but just completely out of reach. It's eating me up.

I'm not thinking about it constantly, luckily. But when I do, it's bad. I realise that I'm getting older every day: more and more days of me missing out on romantic stuff in my teenage years/early twenties. And more and more days of me feeling not being interesting anymore because I'm getting 'too old' to start exploring things.

Weekends get really lonely too, I'm just sitting at home getting no messages except randoms on Discord. I used to think they aren't messaging me cause I'm not messaging them, but that's not true-- I used to go out of my way to message people and the conversation would be short and meaningless, I realized that ultimately no one will approach me first if I don't approach them first.  


Ever since my friends got into this party mode, I am never invited. Our friend group at school is 10 people, but 7 of these people have a group chat without 3 of us where they plan parties and meetups, and I do not know why my 2 friends and I are being completely neglected. I never impose myself upon others, I drink, smoke, you-name-it and I honestly don't know.  


If they don't like me, I get it, but why do they hang out with me at school then, compliment me, and do all that, if they simply do not bother outside school? I get that people have preferences of who they want to meet but after being friends for 10+ years it's absolutely gutting to just not feel like a part of the group anymore.  


I have been told to get new friends, but that is not an option, I don't think so. My grade is small, roughly 45 people and the people who are not part of this 'friend group' have completely conflicting personalities with me, I'd say I can only get along with 1 or 2 of them-- the rest are either too far right or too far left.   


What advice do you guys have? I don't want to confront them about it as that would make me lose all my self-esteem but I'm tired of just not being invited. We were all so tight, and all of a sudden I'm not one of them.",lonely,Feeling so down,2022-05-21 17:10:15

Shoutout to you all here btw I hope only the best for ya'll, it's a sad sad world lmao..  
I have no friends, my only friend I remained in contact with from HS we've drifted apart, they're engaged, working a nursing job, and is vacationing. I live isolated on my parents property in the middle of the bush (AUS, so it's like just trees and miles of farms) against my will. My dad has taught me that not only am I not good enough and don't deserve love, but that everyone will leave me eventually unless I have an iron grip on them. I displayed some of his shitty traits and ruined the best relationship I had with this guy.. I broke it off after seeing how toxic it got, we're still best friends, but there's this jarred wall between us he doesn't see.   
I was feeling really depressed the other night, and it was obvious, but I felt uncomfortable talking about it to him. He tried to get me to open up, and after I lied and said I was just tired, he kinda stopped and we just kept vibing, then out of nowhere asked for a hug because he ""needed it"". It broke me.. *he* wanted a hug because *he* was feeling upset that *I* was upset and didn't want to talk about it, putting how he felt above my feelings in the moment, something my dad does all the time. It gave me a sickening feeling.. I just accepted it and pretended to be there for him like I do with my dad, and I felt dizzy like I was going in circles emotionally with any relationship I have in my life. He says he's still in love with me but understands we need to improve ourselves before trying again, but the way he's been acting makes me think he's falling out of love with me.. and what's worse is I only *think* I love him back, because I have no fucking clue how human emotions and relationships work thanks to my fucking shitty parents. I'm not comfortable talking to him about anything serious anymore, but he never notices when I'm upset anyway. I can't win. It truly feels like anything I do will either hurt me or someone else.   


I truly do want therapy to break myself of any toxic habits and work through my issues, but even if I could afford it I don't think I could even trust another therapist.. I've been ghosted many times by them. I had to move away from my first at 16, I was with another for a year then she stopped talking after telling me to get a job because it would ""give me purpose"" (which I did, got fired because I was quote ""too nervous and jumpy"" and ""not the confident girl in the interview"" which was nice), then councillor after councillor as I was transferred to different work agencies, once I had a single session with this guy and he told me in the most polite way that I was too fucked up for his skill level.   


I don't drink often, I don't smoke, I've never done drugs, I'm now an adult and still a fucking virgin too, yet my whole family treats me like a drug addict with my mental health, burdensome and pointless to help. My aunty on my mum's side is literally the only family member I have a comfortable connection with. I haven't even touched on my questioning sexuality and gender, pushing it aside in my mind because I literally cannot take it on my plate right now. What do I do?

My friend invited me to what they marketed to me as, ""our bday"" party Sunday because our birthdays are so close to each other. I drove over an hour away and when I got there we didn't do what we had discussed, they changed it to something that was impossible with my executive function (adhd). So I couldn't even participate most of the time and didn't even feel included. On top of that when I first got there, my friends fiance had on a face mask. I asked if I should put one on and they claimed it must be congestion from allegies and ended up not wearing it 95% of the party. So essentially the party sucked and I drove home excited for my actual bday plans that would be taking place Thursday- on my bday. 

Wednesday I am out grocery shopping and once I get back in my car I noticed my friend messaged me and said her fiance tested positive for covid. Cool. I had some congestion that day too. So I got home and took a test. Positive. Great. So canceled my bday plans for Thursday. Spent the day miserable.

 Today I woke up even more miserable. I have felt terrible the entire day and had been in contact with my friend so she was aware. I had to call my doc for meds, it was over $300 and now I can't work either- love that for me. I was venting to my friend about the cost and she asked if there was something they could do. I said yes, please let me know next time one of you feels off so I can decide whether or not I want to still come over or not. I even said I am not blaming either of you, I should of worn a mask when I saw he had one on. I tried to shoulder most of the responsibility. She got mad at me for it anyways though. They even responded with an mmmk 👍 So I called because... surely she is like not reading my message in the correct tone.. I genuinely wasn't trying to place blame but I am going to be fearful from visiting if they can't be clear on their health status before I drive so far to visit. 

Well long story, trying to make it shorter. She told me I was blaming them and I got really upset at this point because she was making everything about her. I ended up screaming at her told her I was irrate that she started an argument with me knowing how horrible I was feeling and told her that maybe I should blame her. Her fiance said something and I ended the conversation by saying fuck you... not my best moment. I then blocked them on literally everything and don't plan on ever talking to her again.

I just want to hold you and I tried to take care of you. But you still just kept taking. You showed no respect for either of us. I know things are and have been hard on you. I know there is so much you miss in your heart. I’m trying to understand. But there has been so much that has happened. I’m trying to keep an open mind. I know I couldn’t give you what you wanted this last time and you went online to find. I just didn’t want you to leave with those guys. I wanted you to try and be faithful  to a man I was hearing you say I love you.  If he is even around anymore.  Then there is now a ghost. I think you prefer it that way. You don’t have to be held accountable for your actions. We still worry about you. It feels like you have just given up. I know that feeling I know that emptiness. It’s just easier to find comfort in a pipe or on top of somebody. We said a lot of things over the years. So many hurtful words that stab us a million times. They play over and over and the pain the disappointment still holds us in a vice that feels impossible to break. I can’t take back those words. I can’t take back how I made you feel. When I needed to listen,I yelled. When you needed to be held. I let my pride and anger push me away from you. When all I wanted was to hold you, to make love to you. To fuck you at time like a good fuckdoll. To show you some dominance. But I was to submissive to hurt and so emasculated by you cheating and by the other men I tried to share you with. Then in  my performance that my mind was so twisted the drugs hit me hard and I couldn’t give you the one thing that we both wanted so bad. We all fall from grace. We all become depressed then self destructive. Then it seemed with you malicious that.  You know what you did. Especially when the bag was dry. Yet I’m still trying to see that it doesn’t matter anymore. We are separated and while we may be with someone. It’s not the you it’s not me.

You still want to be a different person. As if we are role playing. But I am always playing myself and you some girl or some guy. The countless photos you have on your phone. The many photos you still have of me. I have so many photos due to resets and deleted images. Just because some were to hard to look at. That it wasn’t me in that photo or video. But it is your life and your kinks while similar. We never got to really open our darkest fantasies. But you always were trying to tell me more show me more and give me more experiences. I was just to stupid ,selfish, and I guess insecure that it pushed you away.  I couldn’t meet to desires or appetite. As I found my confidence, my self value. Those things changed for me.  I’m still a fuck up ,Im still asshole. But I don’t have the anger I did. But our last encounter I know I showed my old ways. I’m sorry for that.

(I'm 28 now) But thanks to medication it hasn't been as bad the past year or so. I just remembered my Dr. Did lower my anti-depressant dose some a few weeks ago. Not sure if that has any correlation. I really just spiraled down last week and contacted a suicide hotline 2 days in a row. I wasn't really wanting to committing suicide but I felt like it was getting worse and worse and that was next. Cuz I've been there although it had been a while. It's tough because nobody around me understands and being a man I just feel like such a b*tch and p*say when I feel depression flare ups or things of that nature. I am a man and mainly talk to women, I do not really have any real close male friends. But I do not feel comfortable reaching out to a woman for help. I just feel like they are thinking ""this guy is so weak"" or whatever. Idk they are my problems and I need to deal with them. I suppose first thing will be speaking to my doctor and get my anti-depressant dose back to where it was before he lowered it. I seemed to have a better life outlook.

Im worried that once I leave uni then that’s me stuck without any friends forever now apart from the couple i’ve knows since high school who i very occasionally meet up with because they’ve largely moved on to other people and things with them being at different university’s.

When i try to talk to the old friends about things i’m passionate about or that’s just stuff that I find fun or amusing, i feel like nobody cares, i still message the old friends online in between the occasional meet ups but it mostly ends up with a few wed answers or the dreaded ‘ok’ when i send them something i’ve come across that i feel like sharing with somebody else or if i have something to just speak about with somebody

I just feel trapped in my own thoughts with no outlet to be able to freely speak with other about what i have on my mind and what they have on theirs.

I don’t feel like i’ve made use of my younger years, it feels like i still should have all of this time to have fun as a care free teenager when in reality i’m 21 and have to start think about how to start a lifelong career.

I have moved to a new country, don't have many friends, couple of roommates and that's about it. In my free time I watch TV and YouTube.
There's this channel call MxR plays it is an NSFW account in many ways but the vlogs of how they met, how they are with each other is amazing. This a pair and the cutest pair of people who love each other. Evrrytime I watch their video I hope I find my Jean-nie someday.

Phyiscally I'm caucasian, around 5'10, and 155lbs. Kinda tall and skinny.

About me, I'm a freelance videographer trying to create my own video production business. It's a struggle and I'm broke financially which is stressful, but hey, I enjoy the challenge and the work. In my free time (which I have a lot of) I like to bake (i love cookies, brownies, muffins), go for runs sometimes, spend way too much time on YouTube, occasionally play games, and just spend time with my family. 

90% of the time I just stay at home, since I live alone, it gets lonely. So I'm looking for someone who can give me lots of attention and I'm kinda needy and clingy haha. I have a big heart and a lot of love to give someone, maybe that's you? 🥺

That's enough about me for now, ask questions and I will tell you more haha.

What I'm looking for, is a genuine and caring girl. Someone to give me love and affection, support and encourage me as life is stressful at times. 

Please dont think that I'm shallow 🥺 but physical appearance does matter to me. I'm pretty neat and try to keep in good shape, so prefer someone who is active too!

Send pics pleaseeeeeeeeee and I'll send one back.

I am a staunch Christian, but I always look at things from different perspectives. And so I have been thinking a lot about our existence as humans.

So you are telling me that life came into being after single cellular organisms were somehow created and then millions of years down the line we exist. How does this shit even work? How do I... feel

Why am I even here and how am I conscious when I am basically a biological machine. How am I any different from a single cell in terms of consciousness?

I often don't feel real these days after a bad experience with psychedelic drugs which left me in a dissociated state, and this has made me think more about how any moment a nuclear war could start and I would be instantly destroyed in a microsecond, completely deleted from existence.

2036,mnnjn,1653083069,1,"for some backstory, i almost died a couple of days after my birthday last year due to multiple blood disorders and i have never been the same since. i lost so many friends during that time, i just couldn’t believe i was seriously going to die and nobody cared. it led to me being incredibly disabled and developing multiple extreme anxiety disorders. i live with my mom and 3 brothers. my mom did take me to drs appts and hospital during that time but she never really cared and told me that i was the reason she never wanted to be home and didn’t enjoy her life. she didn’t seem sad that her daughter was going to die. my brothers didn’t care either, when i was hospitalized they didn’t notice for days that i was gone and didn’t check on me. 


i was put on bed rest for 10 months and just recently started feeling better in december 2021. during that time, i searched for support and companionship everywhere but could find none and i was so close to ending my own life that i decided to get a cat. i really love him, and he’s the first pet i ever had of my own. but unfortunately, i later found out he himself had severe anxiety and my choices were to give him up or find a companion for him. one of my brothers has a cat here but he was very mean to my cat and making him worse so i got another one, around my birthday this year. they became bonded. without going too much into detail, this kitten is now sick. i’m struggling to raise money for him as my financial situation isn’t pretty and family refuses to help. i feel like i’m going crazy, i just spend all day wondering how i’m going to help him and reaching out to people and making posts to try and get help. i know a lot of people say that if you can’t afford the cat you shouldn’t get one, but if it wasn’t for my cats i would have seriously ended my life a long time ago.

everything is so hard for me, the year that i was sick i honestly didn’t even register that that’s what was happening and now a year later the trauma is really setting in and i am so sad all the time. i keep thinking about how i felt during that time and how people treated me and stuff that i blocked out and don’t even remember experiencing is coming back full force. i really just want to be happy but everything is preventing me from doing so. i just want one thing to be okay. i feel so far away from family and i don’t really have any friends anymore. my cats are all i have and i genuinely don’t think i could go on living without them which sounds so pathetic but what else can i do? i don’t have anyone to talk to but it wouldn’t be like anyone cared in the first place. dealing with these memories and the stress of my sick cat is driving me insane and i’m just so lost and alone.

2037,WyldVanillaDad,1653082912,1,"My wife left me a little over a year ago, and it's been a roller coaster. I've had moments of triumph and moments of despair, and everything in between. But the biggest struggle I've had is between wanting another relationship, another person to love, another person to love me and make me feel loved, and wanting to be alone, separate, independent, strong, and willful. 

I never thought of my marriage as limiting in any way, but since I've been on my own again, I can see and appreciate the benefits of solitude. I like listening to what I want to listen to, watching what I want to watch, being into whatever I want, without worrying about disappointing somebody else.

And I also miss sharing all of that with somebody else. But whenever I contemplate seeking another relationship, my fear and apprehension take over, and I retreat back to my comfortable routine. I can't decide whether I want a full romantic dating relationship, a ""fling,"" deep friendship, or chatting buddies. Then, the loneliness slowly creeps in again, and the pattern continues.

Yesterday I took off because we do nothing all day, and I mean from 8:10 to 2:55 I’m on my phone for over half of that wasting away, So I had an off day. Later that day my mom wanted to take me to see a band we both like, Royal Blood to be exact. I was pretty excited and I had a good time in the end, but for most of the show I felt very empty and lost. My mom spent the time talking to her work friends so I just kinda stood there for 3 hours in a constant state of anxiety while seeing all the laughing couples walk by, knowing I don’t have anyone to share my interests with.

Now we come to today, I really didn’t want to go to school again but I thought “I just bought a really cool Royal Blood t shirt from the concert, People will love my shirt” well wrong. I guess I was hoping to strike up a conversation with someone about the band as, well, I never talk to anyone in general. All I got today was the most sarcastic “woah that shirt is so fire, aren’t you burning up” from my A hole “ex friend” turned hype beast. His other friend asks where I got it, I said “oh it’s from a concert” but he was already talking to his boys and ignoring me, reinforcing the sarcasm of the whole interaction. Get this, he then comes back and asks for money, what a jerk. 

So today I went in hoping someone would find me tasteful enough with my Royal Blood shirt and music interests to want to talk, but instead I rotted away for another 6 hours doing nothing. 

I’m usually pretty confident but after today I just feel hurt, I went back to school so excited as online school meant I hadn’t had friends in 3 years almost (I lost all of mine before the quarantine) but I’m ending it with no one remembering my name.

So I lay down on my bed imagining being on the 4th floor of the building. In my mind I jump. I don’t feel a tightness in my chest, a pain in my stomach. This feeling of sadness and loneliness. This feeling of helplessness. Like I’m never coming out of this. This disappointment. How I disappoint myself, how I never achieve anything I ever want to do. I fail regardless I put effort and if I don’t. But in my head, I don’t feel this disappointment. I don’t think I’m disappointing myself or my gf. She’s happy, I’m happy. I’m not failing this fucking engineering major. I’m not disappointing my parents. I’m not disappointing God with my failed spiritual life. I’m not disappointing anyone. I’m not feeling anything bad, I’m not feeling anything. The darkness. It’s calming at first. Then it’s dreadful. What if it’s just darkness. Forever. What if I could have done it and I’m just being lazy. I could just study more, I could just put more conscious effort to my time with God, I could just be smarter with how I spend money or use my time, I could be better with my partner. Am I being ungrateful? Hating a life some would dream to have. Kill to get this opportunities. There it is again. The pain, the dread, the hurt, the loneliness. To whoever reading this. I doubt it makes sense. If you can make it stop. Tell me how. I do imagine jumping but then after I jump, I always regret jumping. What if it changes, what if I get happy, and then what if I don’t? Each day is like this. I wake up and see reasons why I don’t want to go on anymore and then right at the end. It comes. The reasons I should stay. The hope. The possibilities. 
I don’t want to disappoint anyone anymore. I want it to stop

2069,utopia9353,1653067631,1,"I'm weird-looking due to a genetic disorder (get stared at/talked about. Sad thing: my parents and my sister are good looking. My dad has the mildest form, I have a more severe one. Chance of child getting it is 50%..... 75% of this half have a mild form. I have a more severe one.

My problem: weird facial structure and head shape due to hormonal imbalance and abnormal facial-bones growth, typical for disease. Surgery is too risky, and results are limited. Talked to 3 surgeons already. I have a strange voice that sometimes makes people laugh, and I have extreme difficulty in conversations, have been doing behavioral therapy for two years now, and even if I gave it my best, I'm not making progress. Due to my disorder, I can barely build up muscles. Whenever I try or go out, I get stared at or talked about. I'm also short, only 5'4... instead of 5'11 I would have been without the disorder. I'm 25 years old. Which also makes me really sad, I'm closer to 30 than to 20. Surgery is too risky and expensive, and results are limited because the parts that need surgery are practically impossible to improve with today's (+/- 10 years) technology. And now my mom says I have to leave home (I'm 25), because I'm always letting out my frustration on her (which is wrong obviously). I can't survive on my own, have nobody else. I begged her, but she said enough is enough.

An example (this makes me even sadder than I was before):

There's this 23-year old girl I'm following on Instagram – she's 3/4 Eastern European, and I think 1/4 Korean. She's the most beautiful woman I have ever ""seen"" – and she also seems genuinely nice in her videos when she's talking; she doesn't fake at all, like many other Instagram influencers/models etc. I will never get a girlfriend, let alone her. And this keeps me up at night, has been for the past 8 months. And I can't let things go, even with THERAPY and MEDS. I just can't. Things follow me around for YEARS – I'm studying online now but failed to get into the college I wanted to (this was four years ago). I'm working on it with therapy, but to no avail. But not being able to ""be hers"" makes me so sad. I cry at random times. I have finals in two weeks, can barely study. After my finals comes the summer break. I'll just not get out of bed. And hope not be ""sent"" to the psych ward by my mom. I am so so sad. I have no hope for my future. None.

**TLDR –** Am strange looking (Surgery is too risky) and only 5'4 due to genetic disorder. Bad social skills not improving despite therapy. I'm already 25, haven't had friends for 11 years (which is ok) and never will get (never had) a girlfriend. As I can't let go of things, despite therapy, what worsens my depression is that I'll never be the boyfriend of this 23-year old (same height) girl/model from Eastern-Europe I'm following. She's not fake as almost any other instagram model. So this will follow me around for years. I don't have the looks, nor the height, nor the social skills, nor am I in the right part of the world. This has worsened my depression. I have zero hope, and don't have any reason to be hopeful.",lonely,Would really appreciate it if you't read it the whole way through.

To be honest I have few amazing friends but, I've always kept a part of me away from them a part I don't feel comfortable sharing a part that shows weakness. I realized that after I pushed away a friend that I met online she was awesome and we had lots of things we shared to each other. I wanted more of that naturally but I couldn't so I pushed her away from my life because I want more and I know she wants the friendship as it is. So I left her be entirely so I don't hurt her and only hurt myself keeping my secret with me. You can call this selfish from your pov but you know less then I do. Now days I keep even a bigger distance from anyone that can get close because eventually I might hurt. So now I'll just be clear with everyone I want a friend that I can share my days with and not be holding back my feelings.

Long story short, she broke up with me, because she's been going through depression for years now, on top of that she have a lot of family related stuff going on that kept piling on top of her already existing problems... she broke up saying that it wasn't me that she doesn't like, but everything that's going on, and doesn't know if she would ever get better... She would mentioned from time to time through the years we were together about how she would feel bad that she couldn't be there for me, because of her situations, but I reassure her that I would always be there for her even if she couldn't be there for me. Even when we couldn't have sex for years and yes you read that right, yearsss of no sex, that didn't bother me at all. I stayed loyal and faithful to her, because I truly love her with all my heart. Now my heart is in pain and I feel so lost... I don't resent her or blame her or anything... I only ever wanted for her was to be happy and that was the only thing I ever wanted from her. Just seeing her smile was enough for me. I stayed with her for 7 years through her depression and been friends even longer.

Now I feel lost and not sure what to do with the rest of my life... when you found ""The One"", then lost ""The One"" and know that nobody else in this life would be able to make your heart feel like that again... how are you able to live the rest of your life now and not decide to end it now, since you already know that nothing else in life will be better than what you already got to experience and lost?

Edit: I never had trouble meeting girls, it's just that she was the first and only one that I felt it in my heart. When you feel it in your heart you just know that they are the one. They don't need to do anything to make you happy and all you want is for them to be happy. When they are sad you are sad and when they are happy, you are happy. When you meet the one you don't need money or sex or any reason to want to be with them. I guess a good example is when you have kids and you love them, you just want to be there for them and see them happy, because their happiness is your happiness.

2094,SEENOWSEENOT,1653050925,1,"Not only is it the alienation that has you outside the border of camaraderie and fellowship. That alone reduces you on the inside, especially when you’re away from home and don’t have the opportunity to build a home elsewhere. It’s also the constant rejection of never being invited into the topic, the conversation, the discussion that has everyone involved and contributing except you.

No one wants you to contribute because they don’t expect anything valuable from you. Your take on a situation is nothing more than a mildly annoying distraction. Like they feel obligated to acknowledge you when they really don’t want to. As if you’re wholly and inherently valueless. This is how they see you. And that’s why they don’t ask you to hangout with them.

And returning to the familiar isolation is the is your go-to refuge but you still hear them talk and laugh. They enjoy that they’re accompanied. They always belong and always linger to participate before leaving for their duties. But no one ever lingers for me. I hate when they walk in on me in the common kitchen to grab a snack or make coffee because I know that’s all they’re there for. They won’t make conversation with me. Only a greeting that is so insincere and unenthusiastic. And then they leave. And it burns that they see how alone I am and how unimportant or uninteresting of an opportunity it is to talk to me. They make their cup of coffee and leave - and return to their friends. I return to my office alone.

And your voice - your voice is so insignificant. You try to break through the chatter with inquiries and comments just so you can gauge if they actually care that you’re there, but most times they really don’t hear you. And the sentence you formed just evaporates. When they’re done with the topic at hand, you’re so desperate to be acknowledged that you take advantage of the momentary silence to make another comment. But they still don’t look at you, let alone reply.

No one understands how much pain I am in. If they really have disdain for my company and it’s not all in my head, it is certain that they don’t know I suffer. Suicidal ideation is triggered. Depression closes in on me. The hope to exist and live for things is diminished beyond clarity. I don’t want to be here but I don’t have a choice. I can’t leave and must bear this hell.

I just want a friend who I can feel is truly my friend and I'm comfortable with. I'm always known as the gay person or the annoying guy and it's hard to find people who well... vibe. I feel extremely alone because of it. I'm so jealous of watching groups be so chill with each other and I want that. Badly.

Recently, I learned I potentially have autism which could explain my lack of positive social encounters (still testing) but I'm trying very hard to understand people. Idk this is just a rant and if anyone reads this, feel free to ask questions or have your say. Something just tells me to put something like this out there.",lonely,I think I missed something in my life,2022-05-20 21:29:15
2107,ArcticArachnid,1653044203,1,"For many years I've struggled with social anxiety, but it has recently become so much worse. 

It all started in January of 2016 when I was in 6th grade. School became too much for me, so I stopped going and did virtual learning instead. I continued to do this until the fall of 2019 when I finally felt confident enough to go back. The first couple of months were relatively good, but I still struggled a lot socially. I barely talked, was terrified of everyone, and I had no friends. Then a couple months later the pandemic started, which ruined everything completely. I did virtual for another year and a half, then attempted to go back to school again in the fall of 2021. It went horribly, and my anxiety got the best of me. I called home nearly everyday until I stopped going altogether. 

Now I have no confidence or self-esteem at all, and I'm too afraid to go anywhere in public. I've missed multiple appointments because I got too scared and chickened out. I'm 18 now, and the whole situation worries me because I can't do anything for myself. I don't know how to drive, I've never had a job, and it's been years since I've had friends. I'm also extremely self-conscious about my appearance. My family always makes it a point to tell me how handsome I am, but it never helps. More than anything, I'm afraid that I'll never have a girlfriend and that I'll die alone. The only thing I truly want to experience is being in love with another person. I just hate myself so much sometimes. It all feels so hopeless.

Something else I forgot to mention is that my dad abused me when I was a child, and I'm pretty sure a lot of what I'm going through has to do with that. 

Sorry for any grammatical errors, I know I'll probably feel self-conscious about that after posting. I just wanted to speak my mind and let everything out because I'm just so tired of being alone.",lonely,"I don't know what my life has become.

After just a few days, I grew attached to our friendship and I even apologized to him if I seemed clingy. He was kind enough to reassure me that it was okay and he was happy with our friendship.

I’ve been constantly molested and forced to do constant disgusted things to my brother when when I was 5 years old with my younger sister. It stopped when I was about 12. I was raped by my dad.

I went up there and hung out with my friend. We were chatting and having a good time until a bunch of boys came In. I felt the vibe and wanted to go back home. My friend forced me to stay and I didn’t want to. At this point I was a bit tipsy. I was 19 years old at the time. Me rushing into the bathroom telling myself to go home, trying to build up the courage too because I’m a very shy person and was scared of my friend. I came back out telling her I should get back home but she insisted and overpowered me, forcing me back on the couch. She had my bottle of sprite with the gin in it, telling me to finish it and to loosen up. I grabbed the bottle trusting her, I took a sip out of it, making her happy. The boys wanted to play truth or dare, and I kept asking for truth, I didn’t want to any dares because I was scared. My friend picked dare at one point.

2137,Critical-Problem-629,1653025328,1,"I started dating this woman a few years ago. She was younger than me and married, but she said they were separated and getting a divorce. I really should've known better, but I'd had this instant connection with her.

The problem was, she was always too busy for me. And I'm not a ""you have to spend all day every day at my side or else"" kinda guy. I mean I'd see her once every two weeks, maybe. She'd always make plans with me, then blow me off to go hang out with her friends instead. But I'm not the most mentally healthy person, so I just took it.

She'd break up with me, then beg me to take her back, over and over for about a year and a half. Finally, about 2 years ago, I told her I wasn't going to do it again. If she wanted to be with me, be with me. I'm too tired to go chasing people around if they don't wanna be there. Lo and behold, she left a couple weeks later. When she asked to come back a few days after, I told her no. And that wasn't easy. 

So she spends a few months trying to win me back, and I tell her okay, but she has to stop blowing me off and she has to get a divorce. She does neither, instead telling me things like ""if I really loved her, I'd just take her back without making her do all these things."" She'd always have an excuse, too. She couldn't afford the divorce (she had thousands in savings that she blew on other people's Amazon wishlists), her husband would take away her kids (he had seen them all of 3 weekends after he'd moved out when we started dating), she just didn't have the time to see me (but she'd fuck off to her friends who lived like 400 miles away or take a random road trip to Arizona for fun). I didn't ask to be her #1 priority, but I wasn't even on the list.

I tried spending time with her kids, that way she couldn't use them as an excuse. And they loved me. But she only let that happen a few times before she stopped letting me see them. She'd always talk about getting married and being a family, but wouldn't let me be a part of her family. Looking back, I see it was just some fucked up emotional manipulation. She wanted me to miss her, so She'd intentionally stay away. 

The worst was we'd talked about having a kid together. But during that time I wouldn't take her back, she stopped talking to me and went out and intentionally got pregnant by someone else. As soon as she got that positive pregnancy test back, though, she was asking for me to take her back and help raise her new daughter. And I almost did right then. But she still refused to even let me come over to her place to see her. God, writing this all out just makes me feel even more pathetic. 

So a year and a half after I initially told her I wasn't taking her back, she's finally gotten a divorce. I still barely see her but she's got a newborn, so I figure that's the reason. She says she's changed and it's unfair of me not to let her prove that to me. So I say ""you're right, you deserve a chance to show me you've changed."" This was a week before Christmas. 

I see her a couple times, but she's always busy. At first its the holidays. Then she just doesn't feel well. Then she's just busy or can't find a babysitter. I even tell her she doesn't need a sitter, the whole point is us becoming a family,  but she still blows off. Then she took another week-long, impromptu road trip with her sister to New Mexico, still blowing me off when she gets back. She'd lived in this apartment now for over a year and I've never even been there, I don't even know the address because she wouldn't tell me. At this point I hadn't seen her in over 5 weeks. So I break it off. I get the ""if you really loved me you'd stay"" talk again, but I'm not falling for it this time. I say no.

She goes ahead and starts immediately dating her neighbor. I'm pretty sure she was dating him, or at least fucking him, during the time we were supposed to be together. Whatever, I'm done trying to force a relationship she obviously doesn't want, no matter what she says. Fast forward about 6 weeks and I find out she is having a hard time. Got evicted, got her kids taken away, is living in her car, can only shower and do laundry once a week at her friend's house because no one will take her in. So I check up on her like once or twice a week for the last 2 or 3 weeks. Just asking if she needs anything, some extra blankets, if she has enough food, etc etc. Not asking if she wants a place to stay or anything, but if she needs to do a load of clothes and wants to wash up, she can come by so its not just once a week she's washing her ass. And its been cordial, no fighting, but also very clear that this is just me being a concerned friend and definitely not wanting to go back to her. So today I just say ""hey, I know you're trying to get your mom to take you in, let me know what happens. I figure someone should be looking out for you."" She sends me a picture of her in bed with her shirtless boyfriend saying ""don't worry, he is."" 

Oh! And she also told me when I first found out she was homeless that he ""accidentally"" punched her in the left eye so hard it's done permanent damage to her vision and the same night got her black our drunk and took videos of him banging her unconscious body.

But back to the picture. Was that necessary? Why rub my face in it like that? There was no reason for it. I tried to help, I gave her an open offer if she needed it, talked to her and tried to cheer her up. And she was fine with all that for the first few weeks. But then suddenly just feeling the need to remind me she's moved on? Especially with some douche that does shit like that to her? Sending me a picture like that? I guess I'm lucky she wasn't blowing him or something in the picture. Like ""well I guess I can go fuck MYSELF for showing concern. I'm glad he's in your corner, even though he won't let you stay with him besides coming over to fuck him and then go sleep in your car."" Yes, thats right, she's still living in her car because he won't put her on his lease. So he fucks her and then she goes and sleeps in her car on the street.  So I just said ""well thanks for that, good luck"" and blocked her. 

I dont know what the point of this story was. I think I just needed to get it all out. You'd think it'd help, but it didn't. I don't miss her or want her back, I'm not a fucking idiot. But just the fact that she'd treat someone she used to ""love,"" especially one who was still willing to try and help her after the fact, that she'd treat someone with such disdain is just shocking to me. I guess writing it down and seeing it, she always treated me horribly, but I guess I just kept giving her the benefit of the doubt that she would change for the better. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub for this.",lonely,hit a new low today,2022-05-20 15:42:08

2140,gonewiththewend,1653024126,1,"I’ve been sort of lonely since I moved for school two years ago, but for a little over a year, I’d (26F) been dating a guy (33M) who had PTSD, severe chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. Despite all this, I fell for him; we always had a good time when we talked and hung out. Then around the six or seven month mark, he started talking about suicide more, saying he didn’t know how much longer he could wait, crying, asking if I would be there with him when he did it. He attempted a month ago, then I tried to distance myself. I told him it was all too much for me emotionally (it was). Then, he committed suicide last weekend.

Now I’m back home with family in another state, but I’m feeling more alone than ever. I’m regretting the things I didn’t say, feeling guilty, missing him, wishing I had someone to talk to (specifically him). I’m scared to go back where I live. I don’t want to be alone. He was the only person who got rid of my loneliness. Every other person I see or talk to does nothing or helps a very small amount. He was my friend, my best friend, really. I’ll probably attend suicide survivor groups when I get back, and I’m already in counseling. It just hurts. He was my favorite person to talk to, even with his issues. I’m sad I have to be alone now. It’s too hard being alone. I might have to get a cat. I keep checking my phone, but there’s nothing there. Occasionally a friend texts, but I only want to talk to him. 

Anyway, I’d take any advice or comforting thoughts or good wishes or anything that could possibly make me feel better about another shitty life event and the loss of my future and best friend. Thanks, everyone!",lonely,Lonely after losing partner to suicide,2022-05-20 15:22:06

I have a few online friends but I’m done being their friend because it’s not the same and I’ll never meet them. It makes me even more lonely to talk to them. I’ve never been asked out (I did but the person did it as a joke) in my entire life. It’s so pathetic to be almost 20 and have no friends and never have been in a relationship.

I want to complete my goals but how can I when life is bleak. I wish I could go back to the past because if I never left the place that had tons of opportunities available for me, I wouldn’t be depressed. I would still have all my friends and be happy. But life happened and I moved and fucking died on the inside. I guess happy birthday to a shit fuck that is me…fucking hate life. 

I wished my life was better but I pushed through and hoped and hoped but it’s still not better. Wishing and hoping doesn’t do shit. I’ll be 20 and a pathetic loser. I wasted my teen years but I had really no friends in highschool. Never got to do fun stuff as a teen or fall in love. I was bullied a lot in school even abused by teachers. It’s funny how shitty my life is because it seems impossible to have this shitty of a life for years.

My partner leaves to go to work everyday and typically works long hours, plus she’s been meeting a bunch of people out and about and has a social network in the area she can fall back on. I feel like I have no one in the city that I vibe with outside of my partner, but I cant fully rely on them to meet my companionship needs.

She had this craziness about her. I loved that. I never told her that I loved her when we were in school because I was afraid of losing her friendship.

I planned on telling her in the final year of school, but then the pandemic happened. I couldn’t attend whatever parties she and my other friends went to for the fear of the virus. It is still something I regret: not spending more time with that awesome person.

I got to know after school from a friend that even she had feelings for me. But it was too late. She’s moved out of the country for good. It is something which aches my heart like a puncture needle repeatedly going in and out.

I told her this recently for the sake of some closure, but it didn’t aid me. I still miss that crazy. Still miss her. I wake up  everyday hoping I get to see her again…",lonely,18M Just feel low and miss her,2022-05-20 10:17:11

2179,Individual_Ask_2931,1653004336,1,"I’ve recently wanted to break away from unrequited relationships and this is what I came up with. 

“Recently, I’ve been looking at myself, environment, and relationships. I was secretly miserable around people I considered/consider friends and I couldn’t place why;I wasn’t living my truth around them. I’m often the sounding board for ideas, the reliable one for family, or ignoring some dig at my expense and those are roles I don’t want to define me. 

I want to be a better friend and create better bonds without the underlying negative feelings/drama. I want to solve conflict and let go of resentment. I want to stop questioning my value to people that I love and just accept that some people will never be for me. I understand this means I’ll lose friends , family and even parts of myself that I grew comfortable with, but I want more. 

I want emotionally intelligent friends who get me; people who allow me to see their authenticity. People that don’t ignore me when they have other options. People that are my friend whether I’m in the room or out. I don’t love loneliness, but I’m okay alone. 

When I’m alone .. I am the most beautiful person in the room. I will be kind to myself.  I will show love to myself . I will take classes , learn new skills,and travel. I’m my silence I will challenge myself to be better.

2191,0rangie,1652999676,1,"Or maybe I'm just exaggerating,  but it does feel that way to me.  

My dog fell ill last week.  He kept sitting down in an awkward position,  and would just stay still and stare blankly.  Sometimes he would also shiver,  which led me to believe that he was in pain.  I felt him around his body to see if I would get any reaction where he might be feeling pain.  He yelped when I touched him on the sides of his abdomen.  That night he didn't want to eat or drink anything.  He slept on the floor instead of my bed because he couldn't jump.  


I decided to make an appointment at a pet clinic the next day.  Practically every hospital was booked and had me wait days,  even weeks,  to take my dog in.  But I lucked out and found a place that had an open spot that same morning.  When the doctor saw him,  he noted that my dog did feel some discomfort around his stomach area.  The vet needed to run some blood tests,  but since he was busy he needed me to leave my dog in their care for two hours.  When I picked him up,  the vet assistant noted that my dog was well behaved and didn't need a muzzle in order to take a blood sample  I thought it was a weird comment then,  but l brushed it off.  

The doctor didn't find anything concerning from the blood results.  I've been giving him his medication for the past four days,  and he's noticeably been getting better.  He eats and drinks now.  He walks more frequently.  He's even starting to jump a little bit,  but my dog is still not his 100% self.  There's something that I've noticed this past day though.   My dog seems to be afraid of me now.  He doesn't come to me when I call on him.  Not even if I have a treat  for him.  When I get home from work he gets up to see who it is,  and when he finds that it's just me,  he goes away.  He didn't want me to take him outside for a walk.  I had to ""fool""  him by having my mom take his leash and lead him out the door.  

I used to be his most favorite person in his life.  Every morning he would greet me when I wake up.  Every afternoon he'd bark and jump up and down with excitement because I came home.  He'd always want me to play fetch with him,  or just chase him around the home.   Now he rarely gives me any sort of affection,  if it all.  His tail is mostly between his legs when I'm around him.  Lately he's been sticking closer to my mom.  


I don't know what went wrong.  In his eight years of life he's never been this cold towards me.  Part of me thinks that maybe he resents me for taking him to the vet,  but I've taken him many time before,  just not to this most recent one.  I'm getting paranoid and think that maybe they handled him badly when I left him there.  Or maybe he's upset that I kept checking the area where he feels pain.  Could be that he's still sick and healing,  but then why is he so affectionate with my mom and not to me anymore?  

I'm afriad that I've lost his love for good.  I'm afraid that he's gonna remain cold and distant towards me for the remainder of his life.  Maybe I am being a bit crazy.  Maybe he'll become his old self once he completely heals.  Maybe within the next few days.  But this doubt in the back of my mind is just poking at my heart.  I want my loveable dog back.",lonely,I've lost my dog's unconditional love,2022-05-20 08:34:36

2195,Humble-Psychology137,1652996875,1,"Hello, this would be my first post ever. I just felt the need to rant since I feel lonely. Who would’ve thought. Currently I’m out of the country I truly grew up in, and in a sense am back home. This trip was supposed to be a month max, but my case at immigration is prolonging more than expected. 

So I’m looking at another month or two here. I do have family in this country, but it’s not the same in comparison to the people I grew up with. So, I feel a bit lonely, and I’m heading to 2 months of being in this country. My family back at home is working and due to the different time zones and responsibilities everyone holds, communication is in essence minimal. And honestly doesn’t compare to being there in person. 

I’ve already been getting anxious to go back home, and I’ve tried to distract myself. But at this point, all the distractions feel like a worked out schedule and sometimes a chore. But, recently I had gotten the news that one of my family members I grew up with was coming to the country I’m in. I got excited and really hopeful, because well I was going to be accompanied by someone from home. I was riding on that high for a while, because it was just so exciting. 

Unfortunately, that “high” didn’t last too long, I got the news later on that the person wouldn’t be able to come. Their parents signed them up for some summer activities, and they have a annual vacation coming soon, which everyone else will be attending except me (due to my unexpected circumstance). And I didn’t expect the news to make me react so emotionally. I cried and just felt down before going to bed. Now it’s the next day, and the news still have me feeling like crap. I can’t seem to stop crying. And at the moment have lost the motivation and optimism I’ve been trying so hard to keep. A selfish part of me wants the person to come. But I know rationally speaking, it’s not happening. 

The excessive crying I’ve been doing, just sucks ass. And I feel so weak minded letting something like this affect me so badly. I hate that so many of the family where I’m at, have seen me crying. They feel sorry for me and the only thing they can offer is words of encouragement. And that seems to set me off to cry even harder. 

I feel my boyfriend, who’s been trying to keep optimistic throughout this whole sudden long distance, just wouldn’t understand. He’s a very optimistic guy, and also kind of blind towards certain things. I don’t think he’s noticed that quite frankly I feel like crap. He’s aware the news did sadden me, but not to what extent. I feel so homesick and lonely to the point I don’t want to communicate with him. My texts have been short and without any of my “happiness and optimism” and I’m tired of pretending I’m doing okay.

I’m basically stuck in a foreign country with no way to just freely go. And it’s getting to me. It’s saddening to have something affect me this badly. I just didn’t expect to end up feeling this lonely.

2202,themannnn223,1652992826,1,"I’m 19M. What is wrong with me. I know absolutely none of you guys know who I am personally but I’ll try to best describe it as best I can. I’ll even send pictures of myself to your pm for answers, because I can’t find the answer. I been depressed and filled with anxiety for a long time. A failure for a long time, but with a dream. Ever since middle school, I’ll admit I was a shy kid who was a b, let people say whatever to me, was afraid of talking to people, bad communication skills couldn’t talk to girls, annoying, was made fun of, few friends. once high school started, I started to become a little less shy and more confident, dressed better and acted better, yet still the same. 11th grade came and I was more confidence in myself, more friends, knew how to talk better with girls, dressed way better, looked better, acted better better self esteem and just more enjoyable to be around. I’ve always had “friends” , but they all ended up turning on me. The only friend I have still from my middle and high school days are my best friend. All the girls I liked rejected me, my ex in hs did me wrong, shi my ex 4 months ago was talking to her ex while we were together! And then got with her friend she told me not to worry about and not hates me! It’s funny how people consider me a good looking dude and handsome and cute but I have WAY more rejections then wins. I know that’s how the game works, but when people say your a solid 7/8, there has to be something wrong. Im still a virgin when it comes to actual sex, I only had oral sex with 2 different girls in my whole entire life when all my friends prob have 10+. I try to look at my personality and I am a pretty nice funny dude with an outgoing as well as quiet personality depending with who I am, and I have ambitions, as my dream is to make it as a youtuber, and I do put in the work. I currently have 15k on TikTok and 1,200 subs on yt. It ain’t much compared to what I need and want but I appreciate just a lot.

I come here because I’m so tired of it. I tried changing everything that I thought was wrong with me. My looks. My attire. My personality. How I walk. How I talk. How I act around people. My confidence. My game with girls. Me standing up for myself. Me respecting myself more. I changed ALL of it, but I guess not nearly as much as I needed too, or maybe that’s not the solution. It feels like nobody ever appreciated me because they all ended up doing some bs. It seems like my life an equation, like every 2/13 people see the potential in me, while the other 11 people want nothing to do with me or don’t give the same energy back to me. Maybe that’s the problem? Maybe I’m too much of a supporter, too much of an energy giver because I rock with anyone who rocks with me, but I guess I become annoying and they don’t understand my energy ? I can’t keep saying that. I can’t keep saying I’m meeting the wrong people, I can’t keep saying I’m just different, I can’t keep saying “ITS NOT MY TIME YET, ALL OF THIS IS FOR A REASON” ... no.

I feel so alone. I see all these people and even my friends get all the love, even they can be rude people or people who don’t care yet everyone likes them, all the girls go to them and give them attention, and stuff just plays out better for them. Feels like my life is cursed. My life seems so fake. Everyone either turned their back on me or never appreciate or don’t really appreciate me like I do to them. I always have to ask for people to hang out and that’s just one small example. I do have friends, but Ik all of them are gonna turn on me, like the past ones did. I lost 4 of my best friends last year. I failed so many times. Ima failure. I can name all the failures I have and you guys would say ima loser 100%. Maybe that’s why, subconsciously. Maybe subconsciously I think of myself as a loser and people see that? But how ? When even people on the INTERNET who can’t even see or feel my energy only seeing pics and vids of me not wanna mess with me, when I’m such this “good looking, cool dude” when even the PEOPLE who say that to me don’t rock with me as much as the hype they give me. I told myself I’m done tryna find out what’s wrong with me , and the only solution is  money and fame when I make it .

I’m crying out for help. To the point where this week I even asked people and my own friends what’s wrong with me. I want to ask my ex what’s wrong with me and I want her to roast me. I want the people who hate me and the ppl who did me wrong to tell me. I had lots of ppl in school who disliked me for No. Reason. All I do is support people, be chill, be a cool dude who just chases his dream while working a job and tryna figure out his living situation with getting a new car, while just being ME. I’m being me. Is me just a weirdo, is me just in actuality a disgusting person to like and annoying person to be around with? Am I just not a person to be liked as much as others even tho I tried fixing everything and have attributes of people who are very liked??  maybe I have to change who I am. I asked God for answers and I try to look into my soul and ask what’s wrong with me, I guess I just want everyone to love me, because my whole life I’ve never been appreciated. Please someone help me. And if it helps, I’ll send pictures and even videos of myself, and my voice to you guys for you guys to help me. I’m so tired of myself and I try to be positive and manifest but sometimes I can’t take myself anymore. I know we shouldn’t care what ppl think about u, but damn man. There’s sum wrong with me.

We have a kid so we co parent and it's good so far. I got into a new relationship and I was in love for the first time in a looong time. Now that ended as well. He met my kid, my kid liked him.
Everything seems so sad right now I cry so much and barely can fall asleep even though I am extremely tired all the time.

I think I won't trust again, will take me a long time to do that again, if ever. I became bitter and I have moments of total down I just survive and do things cause I need to take care of my kid and pay mortgage.

Sometimes I think to vanish or die without pain but the thought of my kid living without me is killing me more than whatever happens to me.

In addition to grad school and my full time job, I sometimes work part time doing customer service remotely by phone. I spoke with a customer a few times and we really clicked. He was close to my age, funny, nice, charismatic, complimentary and our conversations just flowed. It was the closest I've felt in a long time to having a ""crush"" on someone. We found out somehow that we lived pretty close to each other and he started regularly asking me out. I panicked. 

I had sent him one photo of my face. It's a nice photo but I believe he would have been disappointed in my appearance if we met up. I am chubby and am in the process of losing weight. The thought of seeing that familiar look of disappointment if we met terrified me. I kept avoiding the date invitations, but was determined to get in shape and look my best in the hopes we would, eventually, meet. This makes me so embarrassed. I'm 35 years old and stupidly trying to lose weight to impress a guy.  Honestly, though, I felt more motivated and hopeful about life than I have in a while. 

After avoiding a few invitations, he freaked out on me. Told me I wasn't living up to my potential, that I was acting like a ""little bitch"" and that I didn't know what it meant to struggle. I was so shocked as this was very out of character for him. We haven't spoken since, but I weirdly feel like I blew it. Even though he yelled at me.

I do have friends but no-one I can 100% trust to be there for me whenever I may need him/her. It's always been like this with every relationship I've had with another person.

2221,bruisedbrains,1652983312,1,"A couple months ago, I was incredibly lonely. I spent majority of my days in my house and only left my house twice a week for a bit longer than 2 hours maybe each time. There’s a lot that happened but that’s not important.

I met a guy in one of my college classes. We got along pretty well but we are both quiet and a little awkward. I have a specific type, and so I didn’t want to let this opportunity get away from me. He just seemed too good to be true and its rare for me to like someone. I told him I liked him and we agreed to be friends and see what happens. Keep in mind, we’ve kissed and stuff so we for sure are a little more than friends. So far it’s been pretty good, we didn’t talk super often, but it still was nice. We haven’t talked since the class ended however.

I’m not sure if i’m in the wrong, but deep inside me, I really want someone to be a little obsessed with me. This man barely has any social media and through extensive searching I pulled 3 images off of the internet of him. I found out what video games and anime he liked. I literally searched through his graduation ceremony to watch him walk across the stage. I have a old video of him speaking so that I can hear his voice. I (unfortunately) found his (supposed?) ex girlfriend’s social media and she and I have similar interests and such and that made me insecure. And then I thought… would he do any of this towards me? Would he go through several pages on google trying to find stuff about me? Does he get jealous/ insecure over things? Does he even think about me as much as I think about him? 

I literally get intrusive thoughts about him. Keep in mind, I’m way more busy than I was before. I have a job and I’m doing school in a shorter semester so there’s a lot of assignments. He’s also very busy, much more than me. I understand being busy and exhausted, but it hurts that he can’t text me saying he’s thinking about me. I just want to know small things, it doesn’t have to be back and forth conversations all day long. Is this all too much to ask for? I don’t know if it is. I keep telling myself that he still likes me and his silence is just a different approach than the way I want and that’s ok. Am I being unreasonable since I’m lonely? Is what I’m doing on the internet endearing or overstepping boundaries? The thing is… I would find it very endearing if a guy told me he did all those things. Is this wrong?

Looking for an emotional connection, I rarely post on subs to stay anonymous or whatever. In my experiences, people tend to run away from love/feelings due to the slight chance of it completely destroying you. Quite often spending their lives hiding from themselves, but I’m hoping you’ll let your guard down and send a message because I’m taking my chances.

Gender isn’t really a priority.

By interested I mean that I really feel attracted to them and would like to spend as much time as possible with them, and to get to know all of their personality/life. Maybe I should just call it what it is; I do not have a crush on anybody. It has probabyl been 8 years since I last had a crush on someone. I really liked this person and felt uncommonly comfortable around them. But they saw things differently so we drifted apart which makes me still sad. To be quite precise I do actually have some sort of a crush on someone but I have never spoken to them nor do I think that they know that I exist, I just saw them a few times from a far (we go to the same unibersity). So I am not really sure if it really is a crush since I had actually no interaction with them. However this feeling has been lingering for nearly three years now. I wonder if I should try to get into contact with them but that is probably very very creepy and stupid.

2266,Gentlerwiserfree,1652950004,1,"I’ve never had anyone care about me in my entire life. I’ve never had anyone who felt positively towards me… the people I used to call friends treated me horribly, and the last one left me 10 years ago.

A few years ago, it sort of dawned on me what caring about someone actually means, and it just… hurts… so much… because I feel like I’ll never have that.


I’m going to be 31 next week. I’ve never had any kind of contact with any kind of love, and it’s probably too late for me.


I have tried to go to meetups and every kind of socialization I can find… I just don’t connect with anyone there. Sometimes, I get attacked, over the way I dress, or, at art and writing meetups, over the kinds of things I draw and write. Sometimes I just get ignored.

Sometimes, I’m uncomfortable with the conversations others are having (e.g. if they’re racist, or talking about beating children or things like that… if you want to hear me rant about the specifics, feel free to message me lol).


Sometimes, I accept an invitation to go somewhere with a group of people, and they end up texting me at the time I was supposed to meet them saying they’re already drunk at 1pm and really far from the agreed upon place.


(I don’t drink or do drugs at all, and I can’t stand to be around people who are smoking).


I try to join art and writing groups, but I just don’t connect with them because my style is too different. That’s not wrong, I’m not obligated to like everything or to conform to everyone. But I always get called an evil, selfish snob for having different tastes. Even when I’m going so far out of my way to help them, I get told (by random strangers online) that they must be able to tell I’m looking down on them. But I was never looking down on them. A lot of times I beat myself up for not liking their styles, thinking their styles must be better than mine, since there are more of them than me.


I had an incident like that last night, where I got called all sorts of things for not changing myself to fit in, and I’m just feeling terrible about it.

I’ve been working so hard on writing recently, and just… no one is interested in what I want to create….

One of my only friends I have is my sister. I'm autistic and have a hard time making friends. My sister and I have be discussing future kids and rules we would want to do. I planning on starting a family soon. She's not been respectful of some of the choices I've wanted to make with my kids and already stated she would ignore my rules (i.e gental parenting, not kiss my kids, ect) me and her got into an argument. She stated she didn't want her kids around my kids because of how I want to raise my kids (I don't really care if they swear and said I wouldn't punish them if they swore as long as they are respectful) I told her if she can't respect my parenting and how I want to raise my kids then she won't be in our lives. She said fine and we left it at that.

I'm now coming to terms that my best friend probably won't be in my life in a few years because she can't respect me.

I didn't realize for a while but I was being used for people's own purposes or to help them with things that they would otherwise not do if they had to do it themselves. 
I didn't realize until today that people don't like me, some people even hate me. I'm fine with that now because I realize that I need to find things I can do alone. Why you may ask? Well, I only have 2 friends and both of them are online friends. I don't have any friends in-person. 
I thought I had more friends online, but once I went through some crap, none of them ever asked me if I was okay and I was never sent any messages in the months I was gone and still to this day. I don't get messaged first, I have to always message them first which pains me at times because I wish it would be mutual and not one-sided. 
Funny thing is, everyone has habits and favorite people and people they don't like. I noticed that when anyone talks to me (as in texting) they just seem bored, uninterested, and/or annoyed. They always seem unhappy, and that's my fault. I see the exact same person talk to someone else and they seem very happy and glad to talk to them and would invest time to talk to them. They say nice things, seem eager to talk to them, always seem to know how to keep a conversation going and they apologize for things. For me? Well, nothing. I could send a message and have it there for weeks or months. The I would have to send another message just for them to say anything. I just gotta accept that now, that people don't like me. 
I gotta find things to do alone because that's how it is going to continue based on past experiences with people.

I realize now that I never really made any sort of connections with others then, still struggle to even now.  In short, I was the loner kid, the one people thought was weird, now I'm just invisible to everyone.  


I recently ended a 8 month relationship I was in with this girl I met last year, only now am I realizing that I have little to no connection with anyone else in my life. I can't make friends easily because the hobbies I enjoy are either too obscure or nobody else has the same interests. 

My daily routine would be to go to work, come home, and do nothing or play video games to distract myself. I feel my only real interest is my career which I'm still unsure about currently.

I guess it wouldn't matter if I tried to make a friend anyways since whenever I do have someone I could call a friend, I rarely if ever choose to hang out or socialize, I just stay at home and play video games. My parents always say they'll be here for me, but I know that wont be forever and it scares me that I might only have my parents until the day they die.  


Funny thing is, when I first met her, I was in a good place, actually trying to reconnect with people and make new friends. When we broke up, my best friend decided to hang out with her more often than with me (not relationship wise as he's already in one). It feels like everyone I've met almost forgets about me, I'm always the one making the plans with others if it even happens.

I get really sad when I see people who have had friends for many many years, or have a family that loves them, mainly because I know for a fact that there is 0 way to have that apart from building on a relationship/friendship from the ground up. I wish I could just wake up one day and have all of this already. 

I’m tired and I’m lonely from all these acquaintances and flimsy friendships. I barely have the energy to invest in developing friendships, especially when most of these people already have close friends and I feel like between us we’d never have that together because they have no need for it.

I'm , and I'm going through a pretty rough time, been feeling like this since last year, and the only way I can explain is loneliness.

My grandmother who raised me died from covid died last year and since then I've been in this hole. Being through a wave of depression in quarantine is pretty fucked, and it just got worse when school started again. 

My grades were fucked and I used to have this ""depressive paranoia event"" in the middle of the class, it was extremely difficult to control, and, even after, i couldn't feel better, just felt that something inside of me was dead. I guess the worst part was when I felt nothing, like a empty vessel, couldn't feel anything.

After a time and some medication I got better little by little, my friends were there for me, I was feeling things, got pretty close to a friend that I had lost contact over the years, some months passed by and I confessed, we started dating, it was like my life was finally going to be better, talked with them all day and all night, it became my routine.

I was wrong, when it started I felt like the most lucky person in the world, but when time passed by, I was tormented with some thoughts, was I good enough? Could I make them happy? And the relationship was starting to feel strange, even though I still loved her, it felt so unilateral and forced by their side.

We broke up after 2 months of dating, told me by text that they could never love anyone, not even their parents, I don't feel like it was her fault, they have the rights to feel anyway they want, I felt nothing at the moment, if they were happy with the decision, I was too.

I lied, next day, I saw her in school, happy, like nothing happened, we lost contact again, but every day I have to see their face, and I can't help but remember what we used to be, the promises we've made to each others. We are strangers now, don't even look me in the eye anymore. I was alone once again, and worst, afraid of trying to love someone again, afraid of them lying to me, to not be loved.

It's been a month since it, and today, I felt like an empty vessel again, this loneliness hurts so much, but I guess that I have to live with it now.

Then, she went to stay at her place for a month and we didn’t talk. Again, understandable. What i don’t understand is that when she came back, she cut me off.

But now I think that I've become like a broken instrument to the majority of my friends.  No one seems to want to talk to me, spend time with me, or go out and do things with me any more.  The majority of the time, I am the one reaching out first to people to even get them to text me, and most conversations don't last more than three or four text messages.  Usually they are short messages like ""yeah,"" ""okay,"" and ""nah.""  When people do reach out to me, they usually need me to do something for them but don't have time to talk about anything else than what they need.

I go out of my way to make sure that I don't offend anyone, and I'm too patient with others for my own good.  I'm not an angry person, and I wouldn't ever intentionally hurt someone.  If I ever hurt someone accidentally, I'm apologizing to them constantly until they've told me they're fine at least a million times.  Why do I feel so abandoned and alone, all of the time?

I'm 21 years old guy. I'm lonely. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm unable to establish any relationship. 

I talk with colleagues and I'm ""friends"" with them but that's only work stuff. I never looked for friends anyway. It's not a thing I'm interested in. 

What I'm looking for in a relationship with a woman. Because of the nature of my job, I don't have many females colleagues and I honestly don't know where else to meet them. I'm introverted so all the social gatherings are out of possibilities for me.

I want to hug somebody and cuddle with somebody, kiss them. Spend time with them.

I was told I look alright. Some people even think I'm handsome. People I talk to (mostly on the internet) genuinely like my personality, they like my hobbies, and they find me interesting. I was even told I'm ""different"" (from the context I understood it as a compliment). 

Yet I'm unable to find a girl to be with. I never cared about where somebody is from. I talked with people around the world because I know if I will fall in love with somebody it doesn't have to be a person from the area I live in. 

Every time I chatted with someone they first seemed crazy into me but later always got what I would call only ""cold feet"" when I felt there could be a ""next move"" happening.

Yes, I never really dated so I have no idea what's the proper step by step method people use when getting to know somebody but I always communicated with them about what they think and that I want to talk about how we both feel and what the other person thinks is appropriate yet and what yet isn't.

My resume also became stale; I work 2 part-time jobs to make ends meet, but that's not attractive to employers and I'm not making enough to build savings.

The only job prospect I have is in a city 5 hours from everyone I know and love, and it's a city I can't stand. I know lots of people love it; people are friendly there, biotech and higher ed are booming, and it's more affordable than most cities. That being said, I'm a Northeasterner, and this city feels very small, isolated, and miserable compared to what I'm used to and everything I've wanted in my life. I've visited this city before and hated it; couldn't wait to leave. It's in the mountains and I love the sea.

I wish I could go back to the state where I lived before I was laid-off. I miss my friends and I miss the man I was dating, who I can't see anymore because of distance. I've already lost them over the past year because I had to care for a sick relative and couldn't travel. Now I'm really going to lose them.

I'm pushing 40 and would like to put down roots somewhere. I'd like to keep my friends. I'd like to see my boyfriend again because the distance has made us grow apart (he has a lot of responsibilities involving work and family, so we can't be together as much as we would like). If I moved 5 hours away, it would be completely done. I don't want to leave and I hate this. Yes, this is really whiny, I'm sorry.

I don't know what to do. Keep my friends and file for bankruptcy, because I'm headed in that direction, or make some money while giving up everything I know and love. It's rough. There's always the possibility of getting a job in a place I like, but that is not looking realistic.

I feel isolated even though I have friends and family. And when I do get a chance to speak I feel like I spill over. Like I can't stop. And I hate everything I say. The people I want to talk to the most talk to me the least. And I just feel like a burden to anyone I open up to anymore. I just don't want to speak some days. I'm so happy when it finally feels like someone cares or pays attention. But it's always so fleeting and I end up back here. Crying and bottling my feelings. Second guessing every word. Self harming. Fighting back panic attacks. And alone. 

I know people are there I could talk to. But I don't think anyone gets it. I feel dismissed constantly. Maybe it's all in my head. Maybe it's me, I'm dramatic, sensitive, or just annoying. Maybe I'm desperate. Maybe no one really wants to be around me. Maybe it's all lies, every nice and encouraging thing. Or maybe I'm delusional.

I feel stupid for feeling hopeful or for caring so much. I feel stupid for even being sad about it. I wish I didn't care or value these interactions so much. I wish I could just shut this all down and walk away, just leave everything behind. It's like I can't be happy. Or that anyone can be happy with me. It doesn't feel like I'm deserving of the relationships I desire with friends or family. Like everyone in the world has value but I don't.

2448,Kintra_,1652847272,1,"TL;DR: Antisocial for 5 years, now in highschool. Only open up to old friends, they drifted apart into separate groups. Started to get comfortable and accept being antisocial/sad. Felt like this is really bad health wise, went to Reddit to get it off my chest and ask if anyone has felt this way and if they had any advice.

—

As a kid I was very extroverted, I was a “popular kid” mostly until 6th grade. This was when my mom passed away. I was really affected by it at the time and still deal with it today. Anyways, that’s why I started getting more antisocial and anxious. I eventually got over the anxiety and started becoming more social, until 2020. Quarantine really fucked me hard. I was still social with my friends over games and shit but I really started getting used to being alone. I talked less to my family, never talked on the breakout rooms in zoom, and got basically 0 social interactions for months. 

When it was time to go back to school in 8th grade I was so different, I wanted to talk to some old friends but I was actually so anxious.  That’s when I started only talking when spoken to, losing my personality, and never raising my hand in class. Fast forward to now, I’m a freshman in highschool. My old friends were the only people I really opened up to. After a while they all drifted apart into separate groups. The years almost done and I’ve only made 1 “friend”, we don’t talk much, he just sits with me sometimes for lunch and we have a class together. My homeroom made a class groupchat and forgot I was even in the class (Yes I was too scared to tell them they forgot, not like I would talk in the group chat anyways). Today, in that same homeroom class, when I was coming in late my teacher asked who sat in my chair to the class and no one answered until one guy said no one (yes, I was literally walking in). 

Obviously I can’t just tank this, my mental health has been low since 5 years ago and I feel it only goes lower. Lately I’ve started to get comfy. I feel that being alone is a lot better than fucking dying trying to socialize. I also feel like I accepted that this is how things are and after this acceptance I feel more ok with how I am. Ive also never told this to anyone. I’ve done a good job of acting happy for my family and old friends so they don’t question me. I’ve always been too scared to talk about this to my dad or anyone really, I thought about talking to my dad and asking for professional help but I saw it as a last resort. I know its probably really unhealthy to keep living like this so I went on Reddit to get it out of my chest and ask if anyone has also felt this way. If anyone has advice, help me out, I feel too ok with being sad.",lonely,comfy with being alone/sad,2022-05-18 14:14:32

Also, I live in a small town where there aren’t a lot of events going on that I’m interested in.

That was spring of 2019, and I left all my friends the fall of 2018. Since then, I've had no hugs, no real friends, no one to talk to about personal issues, no one to help me through life, no one to hang out with, only having my siblings that are nothing like me and my dad who has to always work(which I don't blame him for at all I understand and respect him immensely). With school out now, and me going into my senior year, I have no friends for the summer. I'm working over the summer but everyone there is 40+ year old guys. I don't want to download tinder or anything like that especially since I love at home and I'm still in highschool. I've tried meeting friends online but nothing sticks. Just don't know what to do.

But lately... something weird happened. I ended up running into an old friend of mine and I was happy to see him. We exchanged numbers and I thought well hey I got friend again. A few weeks later, a co worker of mine told me he had a new training buddy. Turns out, his training buddy was an ex of mine when I was in high school. This guy was my first love and broke my heart but at the time I understood why we parted ways. I always assumed that he wasn’t ready for a long term relationship or to take things too seriously like I was. So, my co worker showed a me a picture of him.. and darn he got even more attractive and like an idiot I told him That i thought my ex was still attractive. Im Pretty sure my coworker told my ex something because my co worker asked if I can help my ex with some stuff related to my work. I freaked out and said no. And now I kinda hate that I looked at that picture and told him no...it seems like a whole bunch of feelings came rushing back in. The crazy part is that’s it’s  been years Since we have been together....so I know I shouldn’t feel this way. I find it hard to get my ex out of my head and my self esteem has been hurting a bit. I looked myself at the mirror the other day and I actually hated how I looked like. It’s  been pretty bad that I’ve actually been avoiding on seeing my other friend. At this point I’m not sure what I should do....I feel like I lost an opportunity to get to know my ex again and that I am hurting an old friend in the process.

I didn't have any friends growing up, until I was like 19 and worked in a restaurant where the back of house had to work with me. They didn't get me. but we got along.

I'm now 27. I just had a three year long relationship fully end today. I've had major struggles with depression, and she kicked me out a month ago due to my inability to function.

Now it's entirely over. And I'm realizing she was the only person I've ever know to ""get"" me... And now she's gone.

I'll be honest. I have never, in my life felt so alone. I really have no one now. I'd give anything to give her a hug again, but I've lost my chance. I'm about to move out of my city to avoid being too toxic to her, and to give her a chance to move on.

I've never had friends, ever. I have a sibling that I'm in no contact with. I live with my parent's who do what they can, but I can see that they're tiring and that they have retirement goals and plans that require me out of the way. There's one person that I care about deeply, but I refuse to let anything that's bad in me touch them. Perhaps I'm a little over protective.

I spend the majority of my time in my room and I over eat to drown out just a little bit of the emptiness that tends to build in my chest.  I got a cat because I thought it might fill something that's missing, but all its done is fill me with guilt - there's something telling me it deserved better. Most things do.  I try to be of help as much as I can to whoever might need it because I don't want anyone else to feel like this, but also because at least then I feel useful, or needed or wanted or something and god, sometimes I just want to feel something.

Its so easy to feel like you could disappear and have it make no impact at all.

So really what am I asking? I don't know. Because drowning it out, I've learnt doesn't work. Trying to form connections, has never worked. Forcing myself into this family where I do not fit, does not work. Discussing it with therapists, trying to pretend I don't care at all.. this list could go on and the result stays the same.

But, it had a only few lines of conversation before getting straight into seduction mode with zero prompts of hints that that was where I wanted to go. And, then once it got the tiny little bite it was looking for, it immediately sent a message to upgrade to a premium account, as if this is the entire purpose of the app.

I've read elsewhere (mainly from 2022 posts) that others are experiencing the same thing.

2526,ReplacementPasta,1652805387,1," (I am  for context)

So i had extremely overprotective parents growing up and i was bullied for almost the entire duration of middleschool (ages 13-15 to people who dont live here) and only had like 1 really close friend and that's about it.

That changed, when i went to highschool and moved out from my parents house and kind of brute forced myself into getting rid of my social anxiety, but i didn't really manage to get any deep friendships and was focusing on showing that stuff is better than it actually is for me.

And then covid hit, we had distanced learning and i had pretty much nobody besides my now ex-girlfriend that i could talk to outside the internet and spend time with for the entirety of that 9 or so months and i was diagnosed with depression during that time and was working on that, though i have since managed to get over that by now.

Now i am just so terribly afraid of being alone while still having some issues with maintaining friendships due to my past, that i am constantly talking to new people just to not be alone but this is extremely exhausting to actively maintain tens of these ""aquintanceships"" and i feel like if i stopped putting in so much efford, they would quickly stop inviting me to parties and all that.

I still don't really have any meaningfull long term or trustworthy friend other than for my best friend that i oringinally met during the distanced learning period as she was hanging around at the empty school aswell.

And i am quite scared of how the summer will go as i can't keep doing what i have done during the school year at school, and i only really have 1 person that truly cares how it's going for me.

I am honestly quite lonely even though it doesnt look like that to people looking in from outside, so it's not like anyone will come to help me.",lonely,I honestly feel lonely and don't really know how to change that,2022-05-18 02:36:27
2527,pluvi_pine,1652804967,1,"TLDR at the bottom. If you don't want to read it, even just giving me some advice on socializing would be great. 

BG info: I(16) went to the same school for 10 years -grade 1 to 10, and recently I moved to another country so obviously I had to go to a new school. Now I'm already very socially awkward to start with, but I've been in the same friend group at my old school since grade 6 and have basically never made friends ever since (I don't have friends outside of school). Also I probably have depression too, which makes it worse cuz I'm too tired to socialize all the time. Sometimes its to the point where it feels like I'm drunk - I can't form sentences properly, pause and stutter a lot while speaking, speak and think really slowly, can't think of how to respond to someone in a conversation, etc. If you have or had depression you probably know what I'm talking about. 

You can probably see where this is going. I basically don't know how to make friends anymore. And sometimes I talk to people but then I just don't feel the connection/can't vibe with them, partially because I don't know them that well as I have only known them for less than a year. I don't really consider them friends and more like acquaintances/somewhere in between friends and acquaintances. Basically I just can't open up to people who I've never met before. (it was way easier to make friends at my old school since everybody already knew each other for a really long time and it wouldn't be too weird if you started talking to people if that makes sense. You'd feel more familiar with them/don't consider them total strangers). 

I do sort of have a friend group at my new school, but its more for ""social stability"" so that I don't get bullied and have some people to hang around outside of class if that makes sense. I hang out with them at lunch, I talk to them outside of class (which isnt that much time, we have 10mins for break and 30mins for lunch, which doesnt help either) and all that, but again I don't feel emotionally connected to them. So I consider them kind of friends/ in between acquaintances and friends. I'm just really socially awkward/don't know social cues and don't know how to talk to people in general, and am a weird person, especially if you've just met me. Basically im the weird kid at school :/

I just can't seem to hold a conversation, which is probably why I cant seem to make friends. I've never really been able to start a conversation, which isn't a huge problem on its own, but I recently I realized that with new people, I can't seem to hold/carry a conversation. It just always ends up being really awkward and I'll just end up avoiding talking to people. 
There's this kid who's really nice, that I kinda of vibe with, and turns out she lives 5 minutes away from me. We bump into each other all the time in the morning, but because our convos always turn into awkward silence I now avoid her every morning by catching the earlier bus because its just way too overwhelming, it gets way too awkward and I get really anxious and I can't handle it anymore. (I'm pretty sure it's not social anxiety, I'm just a really shy person.)



TLDR: I (16) had the same friends (we all went to the same school) for 5 years, haven't made new friends since I met them. Already socially awkward and weird to start with, but since I haven't made friends in so long I basically don't know how to socialize anymore. Moved to new country, now I'm the quiet + weird kid at school. Have a friend group, but don't feel emotionally connected to them. I'm only going to be here for a total of 2 years (1 year left to go), so at this point it doesn't matter anymore. It takes me a long time to make friends and open up to people, 2 years is just enough. But once the 2 years is over we'll be off to uni and I probably will stop talking to them as we go our separate ways. Can't seem to hold convos, convos always end up being hella awkward and I just end up avoiding people. Sometimes I don't even try to talk to people anymore. Depression is also making it worse (I'm emotionally numb, never present in the moment, can't connect to people, feels like I'm drunk all the time, brain can't function properly).",lonely,I can't hold a convert nor socialize or make friends. advice + rant.,2022-05-18 02:29:27

The days are a repeat because, of course, when I feel lonely I start browsing through Reddit trying to either get off or find a local person just for a brief connection. I find myself searching for someone who might be going through the same but between the ghosting people, and the empty accounts, I grow discouraged. What's upsetting is, while I do have the friends I've made, I still feel alone because I don't have my person yet.

I've also started losing more weight in these good times and people have shown a little interest. But none of them fully and it just leaves me thinking that I can't even just have a conversation. The very thing I know that would make a person want to actually take time with me. There are days where I'm starting to feel like I'm going to grow into one of those old men whose heart just dwindled away before even getting to see the beauty of the world through another person's eyes.

I know this may just seem impatient but, I haven't received that type of happiness yet. I haven't felt like I could find someone for myself that's willing to drive to see me when I'm going through all of this. I haven't physically met a person that makes me feel like I want to stop everything to make sure they're okay. Well the DM can help, it really can only scratch the surface. I always try to check on other people, but there are times where I feel like there's no one to come physically check on me.

Text can mean only so much and sometimes just reading words on the screen can't convey the exact feeling. Sadly this might be one of those situations even as a write this.

2545,ZakjuDraudzene,1652796147,1,"I've been excruciatingly lonely ever since my boyfriend essentially abandoned me last August, and ever since then I feel as if I'm on a never ending downward spiral. Every week is worse than the last one, and at this point I feel as if I'm just some kind of engine/machine, living and doing things for the sake of doing them, rather than because I enjoy them or get any sense of deeper meaning out of them.

For the entirety of April as well as the first few weeks of May (and maybe even March, I don't really remember), I haven't hung out with a single person (save for my best friend, who I visited in his hometown, as he lives in a different province nearly 350 km from where I live), and I have not even felt the drive to see *anyone* in the first place. Last weekend, an irl friend invited me to a concert at my university. Even though I enjoyed the music, I still felt really lonely and alienated, and had to go to the bathroom at one point because I was feeling like crying. By the time I was home, it was like nothing had ever happened, I felt exactly as lonely as I did before I went. Might as well not even have gone in the first place and I really don't know if it would have made *any* difference.

Everyone, both my best friend *and* my therapist, tell me that I can't be this way. It feels as if they think it's bad, that I can't let my life revolve around whether I'm with someone or not, but I just... can't. That really is just the way I am, it's almost a biological need for me. They say I need to push past these feelings and just meet people, hang out with others, and maybe love will come eventually, but what's the point? If nothing ever fills the void, if everything I do leaves me feeling empty, what do I do? Do I just curl up into a ball and wait until I die?

It seems like love is the only biological need that people have a sort of inherent callousness for. It doesn't matter to people how painful it is, you just have to wait an abstract amount of time for things to ""get better"" (with zero evidence besides blind faith that this will happen). If you can't do this, then you're a crybaby, and if you pass this ""time limit"" that people seem to have, if you don't recover in a timespan that they deem appropriate, then you can be sure that they'll care even less.

I appreciate whoever reads this whole thing. I don't really have anybody to share this with, since I only talk about these things either with my bff or my therapist, and as I've already mentioned, neither is particularly helpful about it (No hate to either though, they've been great in many other areas of my life. Just not this one).",lonely,I don't really want to talk or hang out with anyone anymore. It feels like nothing will really help me at this point.,2022-05-18 00:02:27

I went through something traumatic in 2020 and want no part in that and told him. I was worried eventually we'd quit talking cause of that and sure enough....he went from liking my pictures every time I posted and a few messages a week to nothing at all.

I'm struggling to understand WHY I can't maintain or hold onto friends especially with women 😪 
Hell I can't even succeed with a female as a friend how on earth am I meant to find my soul mate?;

I'll give you an example- 

I have an online friend who I have been friends with for 3 years and we have gotten closer lately.
She used to say how we would be good friends and how we should be friends but at the time I were reluctant and relayed id rather be casual friends and not close as I just had a toxic encounter with a women who used me for attention.

Skip ahead- Its mine and hr birthday around the same time so I said to her well why don't her and I do something nice and spend time together?
The plan was to go over with her and her kids and have few drinks together ❤ 💕 💗 

I understand shes also going through a lot lately and shes very depressed.
I did noticed she went over to a friends on her birthday.
Seems she has told me to postpone things as shes not in a good head space.

I have offered her support and told her I'd be more than happy to come over and help her out with the kids or whatever she needs. 

I guess I feel a but pushed away and I feel shes still seeing other friends but not me.

Another note- I dont want to sound petty or jelous but I noticed people like her and this other women who has poor mental health, seems to have soem female friends who are rlly lovely and buy them gifts and flowers and all here and there or in special occasions.

I feel hurt because I give my all to someone and I have never had flowers brought for me whje I'm down or even on my birthday!!

I ask don't feel like anyone is proud of me either. I just try to be proud of myself but it's so hard when I hear subliminal comments that make me feel like shit about my life. It's so tiring. 

I try to be kind and not expect anything back, but sometimes feeling a little bit of the love wouldn't hurt. I'm just running out of kindness. I'm so close to being done with being a nice person. It hasn't gotten me anywhere.

I never even thought about the way I looked. Everything has changed completely. Now I can’t make friends, I hate my body, I can’t socialize, I have second thoughts about everything I do, school is getting very hard, and I honestly feel like my life is going to be this way forever.

The older I get, the more pressure I feel to be doing things that I “should be doing” at this age (going out with friends, dating, etc.) I’ve been told to “enjoy my youth because life is gonna get a lot more difficult”, but feels impossible to truly enjoy my life right now.",lonely,I’m sad because I’m getting older,2022-05-17 14:52:30

I  do not know how much more of this I can take. 

I feel like I keep losing friends but I have a hard time making them. I do not know what to do anymore but become fake. Hide who I am so people will like like ""me"" but do they really like me if they don't really know me? I do not know anymore. I think that is what I will do. Kill the old me and replace it with something else. 

I don't know anymore. All I know is that this pain I feel is too much to bear. Somedays I wish I was never born or I was born as someone else. I do not like who I am, I think I am ugly and I guess a bad person.

Then, i make some comment in passing on what me and my friends are going to do for the day, as in to keep my family in the loop. I leave home, park my car at a certain spot, then i get on a bus which goes around the city. I do the whole trip from start to end, which takes one hour. Then i get off, go eat at a fast food place, take a walk around a big park, then i sit, always in the same bench, and i watch a movie. By midnight, i buy myself a redbull and cigarettes and i get the last bus to the place where i parked. I'm home by 1-2, i try to make a bit of noise and my mom always comes to see if I'm okay without fail. They don't ask about my friends names, don't ask to see pictures of them and don't want to know them because we're from a conservative society and guys my age are given privacy, which has been a life saver for me. 


They have however asked if i have a girlfriend and i always change the topic, or tip toe around it. My dad says that thats why i always come home late and I'm always laughing at my phone. A female coworker once sprayed her parfume on my shirt as a joke and i made sure to have them notice it and i saw my parents exchange a smile.


I hope they never find out. Although, I don't know how long i can keep up for. I'm sad that I can't be like my cousins, or their friends kids. But I'm doing my best to keep them from worrying",lonely,I have been pretending to have a social life for the past 2 years so that my family doesn't think I'm a loser,2022-05-17 08:36:58

2638,Professional-Juice51,1652738571,1,"Hi, 

Sorry to load here but wanted to just reach out. I’m 27 years old and I live in London. I recently went through a cancer battle, stage 3A metastatic testicular cancer, with secondary lung cancer. Went through chemo, surgeries and loads of other treatment but since February I’ve been in remission after 9 months of treatment. 

I’ve had other health issues since, from my immunosuppressive state - I.E - covid rn. 

The topic here though is loneliness. I have an estranged relationship with my family, who cut me off and chose not to be with me during my cancer treatment. I’ve been through quite a bit of childhood trauma, like sexual abuse and foster care as a child. The last four years beyond cancer have been tough too, as I’ve lost one of my best friends and been in abusive relationships and lost connections.

My life has been transformed by my cancer treatment, sexually, I still have no recovered from cancer treatment. I guess, cancer has made me really want to be loved in my life. I wasn’t ready to go as I was going through treatment as I still sought love. I have great friends, no real family, will I ever find that healthy, warm love that we all want? 

Thank you for reading.",lonely,Lack of love in life and lonely - recent cancer survivor,2022-05-17 08:02:51

I have everything i want other than friends and a social life. My routine is killing me, go to work, come home and waste my time until its tomorrow again. I still have problem with socialising because of the language. It's not like i dont speak german but it's so frustrating to not being able to express yourself sometimes and look like a dumb person.

If love could last a lifetime

And time could heal all wounds

I wish to spend my free time

Laying here with you

You caught me with a blindside

Made me believe it’s true

Please stay here by my side 

One more night with you


If love could last a lifetime

I’d spend it all with you

Ups and downs are our sign

Temptations taught and true

I give in for the moment

By morning we’ll be through

You look to me and smile

Now I know the truth



Our love is yet defined

Tangible in its youth

My love don’t leave me barren

I long to come find you

My gun sits loaded and ready

My escape from this troubled world

Metallic tastes when I spiral

No courage to pull through



If love could last a lifetime

I’d give it all to you

I try to comprehend it

Our differences define the “who”

I commend you for your actions

Despite the absent truth

If love could last a lifetime

I’d spend it all with you



I try to give you space

The stars the sun and moon

Your touch loses its meaning

I tremble in my boots

I fear that you’ll resent me

As time have proven true

My love I hate these feelings

I get lost when I’m with you



I gaze deep into your eyes

And there I find the truth

I kiss with my eyes open

Adore the spark in you

The same spark lies with me

And draws me deeper to

Your love becomes a lifeline

I’d give it all for you",lonely,If love could last a lifetime,2022-05-17 07:15:37
2646,InsanitySquared46,1652735683,1,"So my story is easy: I'm a 46F and I live in the US. I'm a gamer, right now I play Ark Survival. I just lost my best friend because feelings accidently got in the way (dangit.) He used to chat with me a lot over discord while qe played games but not anymore so much these days.

I'm so lost right now. I need voices, I need someone to laugh with again. I don't care about age, I have a lot of younger gamers I play with from time to time. I'm pretty young at heart myself and tend to converse better with younger peeps anyhow. 

I need distraction. I need someone to just hang with and keep busy. I need someone who actually treats me like I matter. I do t need to meet the love of my life, I just someone I can connect with and have good times.

I love to laugh and to make others laugh. I watch movies and TV, stand-up comedy, I'm not clingy and I will always be there to listen when you need me. I will always be your friend. Loyalty has always been so important to me in friendship. I love music, all kinds. I dont like arguing and I'm totally the most understanding person you will ever meet. I understand the psyche a lot and if you're having an issue I will try to help you or just listen. 

If I sound like someone you'd like to hang with, DM on here and we can exchange discords. I prefer voice chatting, video is NOT necessary. I just like hearing voices and laughter. ❤️",lonely,I need to hear voices and not the ones in my head telling me I'm not worthy,2022-05-17 07:14:43

29 years old, male from the west coast, yeah, Cali as you’ve probably guessed by now! 6’1” tall, black hair, fair/naturally tanned skin, greenish eyes, and been told handsome, humbly! I am not gonna get on here and share a list of expectations but let me say this, if you happened to have good humor, a reasonable amount of intelligence, wit, intellect, perhaps some sass and charm to some degree, then we are definitely going ti make it past the first 9 messages! 
Don’t know a thing or two about anime, video/Pc games, Pokémon or whatever else that is trendy these days! I prefer the outdoors, beach, hiking, traveling and a good book any day of the week. I am probably the only guy who wasn’t disappointed with GOT finale/ending and I still think that it was one of the greatest stories/dramas in the history of T.V.
So, I am a guy who thinks a woman doesn’t need to show off her goodies to get attention, because I do find intelligence and interpersonal skills far more attractive in a woman than anything else…. Well, most of the time, let’s say about 90% of the time I do! Being reasonable and honest! 
Nothing will throw me off faster than a lazy attempt at socializing like someone sending an “ASL”, “Sup”, “Hey dude”, or “what’s good” message! Like make a little and genuine effort ffs! I mean, I know too well that if the internet and Reddit taught us anything is was being spoiled and lazy are the new norms nowadays! Don’t get me wrong, I don’t expect to read your life/weekly journal/diary just to get to know you! Let’s just I prefer spontaneous, vivid, lively and engaging conversations, chats, texts!

2682,Quate1v9,1652713886,1,"Hello everyone, I am on my early tweenties and today is my birthday... apart from my parents (since they gave me birth) noone wished me happy birthday even my 3 friends that I have been close to... I did tell them many times the day of my birthday some days ago, yet noone even wrote a single thing to me. I dislike many celebration's day because society is unfair at balance things but only 2 days I really care about are probably  **Birthday** and **Earthday.** 

So why am I writing this post? Because I always think about it, these 3 friends of mine are not real friends... I understand they have their own life to live, but I have always been lonely and the fault it's of **society**, all I wished for my birthday was just a message from someone that could ask me how I am doing or give help in hard times, neither do I know what a gift to be given feels like and I wouldn't want it. I will probably never be able to make any friends at all I got used to be alone for like 10 years... society, school and family mainly fault here. 

Today I'm 22 and my life changed since I finished that trash hole called **school** 2 years ago, so I decided to start a new life and now I am studying programming for joining the rat race job, but my thoughts changed and programming is **not** what I want to live for anymore, since I have noone beside me and it's just me in my world I needed a reason to live for, so I started to enjoy life for what I truly wanted to do ever, I want to live for **ART** but also help the world. I started to: 

* Read books and I would love to write one some day (fantasy).
* Study philosophy and psychology always wanted to understand why we Humans are we living or we act like so.
* Play the guitar, I LOVE MUSIC and guitar it's the only instrument I own. World it's all about vibration and music it's vibration playing an instrument it's a **MUST**.

Plus many other things that I am not writing here and I wish to discover but if you don't have either money or time you are not able to. Well lately I cannot enjoy at all my life even tho I wanted to live for these things I am forced to still study programming for a job, my thoughts in these days have only been of death, life it's a curse and the only medicine it's death, I hope this thought will have an end and that I will find my happiness again, soon.

The whole point of this post it's just to have a talk and I am sorry for my English, it's not my mother tongue. 

Even if you guys are alone live for the things you love even if these are abstracts. If you guys are reading this you are not alone, you are actually talking and thinking with me! Hope this will help someone.

I've always been lonely in my life, I literally had no-one and I was even bullied a lot.

Then I found that girl that seemed my soulmate. We both liked the same music, we both were into gaming and pop culture, we had the same humor, the same style, we liked to do the same things.

But In November 2021 we broke-up because I found her cheating and other problems.

Since then I started working more on myself. I have done A SHIT TON of self improvement, I reached for old friends and strengthened our relationships, started dating again and found a decent amount of girls that liked me, I've learned new things I always wanted to learn, I started songwriting and now I'm writing a full album with some friends, I got a gig and I'm playing guitar a lot. At university I'm studying CompSci (that I always LOVED), doing my best and I'm trying to raise my grades, and I'm actually accomplishing that.

My friends love me, male and female ones.

I have a friend that always tell me ""I want a girl that's exactly like you but girl"", another one that always calls me do to things together, others that always have fun with me, a female best friend that's always there for me.

I'm not alone at all, and I'm also doing a lot of activities I LOVE.

But I feel lonely. I feel a lot lonely. It's like nothing of that it's enough, even if I'm happy and grateful for all of that.

Loneliness is a bitch. It doesn't matter what you have, how many friends love you, how many girls or guys you can have, how many fulfilling activities you do in your life.

You can still feel lonely. And that's fine.

They never want to tell me what I do wrong to try and solve this and never found who told the teacher those stuff so I could solve it personally .

I missed the opportunity to learn social/professional skills as a teen and now I’m a young adult lacking in what I feel are the very basic skills needed for grown life.

However a year ago I landed a fantastic job cooking/serving in a local cafe and was able to finally move out into an amazing little flat. It’s exactly what I needed and wanted for years, I’m finally living off my own back, nobody to rely on for food, water, or money.

But, and this is a big but. But very recently I’ve lost contact with all my friends. I had a fight with one about shit we did as kids, it was obvious he still resented me but what choice did we have? We had no other friends. So he’s gone.

It’s a lot more complicated with my other friend, we started a romantic relationship which started in school and lasted at least 7 years. That ended recently although it was mutual and friendly, but I can feel him slipping away from me, I don’t think I fit into his new life very well as a normal friend, because of our history.

To kind of explain our friendship—he reached out of me on one my YouTube videos about doing a possible collab. I said sure, and we kinda just became fast friends after that. We both played the same video game and created the same kind of content. 

We kept chatting and he started to open up about some problems he was experiencing and regularly asked for my advice. I was always happy to offer my two-cents and whenever he was feeling down, we’d play some games together and chat. 

He wanted to keep our friendship strictly online, which I fully respected and never tried to move the friendship to in-person meet up’s or whatever. 

The last conversation we had, he had told me someone had basically lead him on and he was feeling down. I offered to hop in a game with him, or something. He said no and that he was going to listen to some music. I said okay, and I told him I would check up on him the next day to see how he was doing. 

Well, I did. But he never responded, which wasn’t exactly unusual. But a week or so later—I tried to reach out to him again—his Discord was deleted, same as his instagram, and he had unfriended me on PlayStation. 

To say it hurt is a monumental understatement. I’m sure I didn’t do anything wrong, and I thought we were good friends. But… I guess not. I’ve tried to reach out to him on his YouTube channel by commenting on a video, and by messaging him through PlayStation, but… nothing. 

Any advice on what I should do now? Should I cut my losses? Or should I wait a little longer to see if he responds to me? I just found out, so I was planning on waiting until the end of the week to see if I heard back from him. But… I feel pretty blindsided, if I’m being honest. 

TL;DR: my online friend deleted all of his socials without saying anything and unfriended me after two-years of friendship, and I don’t know what I should do.",lonely,"My online friend just randomly cut me out of his life, what should I do?",2022-05-16 19:00:15

I absolutely hate confrontation, negative feelings, sadness, or emotional upset; so I try my best to just do, say, or help in any way that I can to avoid it. But most of the time it just gets me in trouble.... In the past if I got irked at something I would just RAWR about it to someone for a few min and then I would be ok.... but no one has time for me and my husband takes it as a personal attack or anger especially if it relates to any matters of our household. My (no-longer) friends decided it meant that even if I was happy that I definitely wasn't and took it upon themselves to make judgements and assumptions on my life that were 100% wrong. I am absolutely alone even in a room full of people and I feel completely unliked... If I make any type of friendly connection with someone I am like whoa now it wouldn't last no point. The last person I tried to be friends with just up and disappeared, not even a I'll keep in touch via text from them. I don't want to die but I hate my life.... 

fucking might have cancer - waiting for my appointment to get a biopsy done.... 

for the first time in my life I'm dealing with the emotional trauma of being an undiagnosed autistic child (b/c in my family -when my mom was alive-, Jesus says there's no such thing and everything can be healed through prayer) who was sexually abused by a brother who took advantage of my social/development inabilities. 

At this point at 34yrs old I feel like my identity and purpose has been stolen from me... I'm just a shell going through the motions...Below is a very short list of the negatives that live in my head at any given time.

1. So my family doesn't respect me or don't know how to understand me. 
2. My (no-longer) friends only like being friends with me when I could make them feel better about themselves by being what they considered less than perfect. 
3. No one wants to believe me or take my word when I try to improve something..... 
4. Its not ok for me to be anything but funny and easy going... 
5. I masked for so long so that I didn't upset anyone that when I finally start trying to take the walls down and just be a person that everyone said that I'm not acting normal and wouldn't believe me that everything was good... 
6. Everyone wants to think for me, when i have my own voice I'm told its wrong even if it's just me saying i'm happy.
7. Found out that I'm autistic.... so now i semi understand why every time I relax and just talk that I end up pissing people off with how I talk.... 
8. People come and go in my life so much that it's like I'm a revolving door.
9. I can't do anything right in anyone else’s mind or eyes.
10. I spend most of my time in my head b/c my husband gets offended if i curse and his kids or our daughter are around (cursing relaxes me if i'm anxious and I have taught my own older children they aren't to be used in anger at anyone but I'm one of those parents who don't care about cursing as long as they are respectful and well mannered when the situation requires it.)
   1. Also he takes issue with my relaxed parenting and if I try to parent my step sons my way then it will usually result in a fight. Or he assumes that my intentions are unfair or that I sound mean. He isn't a fan of my music and I can tell it annoys him even though he says its ok for me to play it. 
   2. I know we don't have much in common but I love him and he loves me and he would do absolutely anything for me, and I could absolutely not want for anything because he would get me anything if it meant that I would smile.... but I can't talk to him without sounding insensitive or condescending to him...",lonely,Absolute isolation to avoid emotional distress,2022-05-16 17:24:27

I’m nothing special, I’m just like everyone else, I do what I have to in order to survive. I have a decent well paying job, a very nice car that I appreciate/work for, and an apartment. I’m literally always working but I guess it pays off.

I feel like I’ve been getting worser mentally every single day even though I’m getting better in other aspects of life. I’m just so so so so tired of being so lonely. So tired of engaging with so many people everyday whether it’s friends, family, or coworkers / putting on fake smiles or those that are exaggerated. So tired of feeling so empty and having to mask it with laughter and smiles. 

I used to at least play my video game or watch tv in my free time. Nowadays I can’t do any of that, it bores me. Everything feels like nothing to me. If I don’t have to work I go out… yeah no where in particular I just drive. I tried hanging with family more, going out getting involved with people socially more. There’s this lady I work with who’s starting to see me as part of her family even. She’s let me come over for family events with her family and at the time it’s very nice and helps me. Afterwards that loneliness creeps back up again. No one knows my pain, I keep it inside

Dating, doesn’t seem to work in this day and age. Everyone cold, brutal, selfish, disrespectful… I’ve been ghosted one too many times even. Everyone I know personally thinks I’m some sort of Playboy, which is the total opposite. I take care of myself, I seem to look great let other people tell it. BUT I DONT FEEL GREAT

2757,DrinkingPotatoWater1,1652668674,1,"this is kinda 2 post in one but fuck it. 

I feel like i have to put on a mask with most people. When people meet me I think they tend to like me. I'm smart, funny, I carry myself well. I'm not horrible looking despite caring a bit extra weight (which Im working off currently).  In fact I suspect that if any of the people I knew found out I was posting this they wouldn't believe it. How could I feel this way? I don't carry myself like someone who is desperate, I don't carry myself like someone who is lonely or is craving intimacy. I have friends that are women who I have no desire to date, like I am not the sterotypically lonely guy who falls in love with every woman he meets or is a incel or forever aloner or anything like that. 

when Im around other people though, I keep a TIGHT reign on my emotions. I express what I choose to express 99% of the time. I feel fucking nurotic sometimes. The slightest thing can make me feel deeply insecure or anxious, I can't imagine people wanting to be around me, Im hyper villigant about everything. I'm vulnerable, but not to vulnerable, kind but not a pushover, empathetic because I choose to be, understanding cause I choose to be. Living like this is exhausting and the result is that, I behave like the person I want to be but I don't feel like that person. I feel like Im putting on a performance for everyone the same way I use to put on the ""be polite to this asshole customer"" performance when I worked retail. I'm tired, I want to be myself with someone.

But truthfully I don't like myself, Im insecure, lonely, and borderline neurotic. I don't understand romantic relationships hardly at all, Im extraordinarily emotionally nerotic when it comes to sexuallity in any way/shape/form and even flirting makes me feel super uncomfortable. The other night I was out at a bar with friends and this girl I kinda know was kinda drunk and she grabbed my hands, and was like ""look at me, you are a very striking handsome man"" and I was like.....what the FUCK do you do in that situation lol. Another night there was this cute girl  who had sat down beside where I was at at the bar (I had just been in the bathroom) and she was cute (I had noticed her earlier) and normally thats no problem. I mean I just say hi and sit back down where I had been at. But when I sat down I was SUPER attracted to her and she smelled nice and my body did that warm flushed actually feel like I'm being pulled towards her type attraction thing and I froze up and couldn't even say hi, just sat there sipping on my beer. If she had been a guy (or ugly for that matter) I wouldn't have felt that way, but...yeah. I could type a lot more on that subject but I'm going to leave  it at that. 

so the second part of this post. I use to have a friend I would hang out with online, we would voice chat and just....chill. It was amazing we would watch tv shows together through discord or just share funny videos. She was really nice and we could just...be with each other. I didn't have to put on that performance with her. I could be completely and utterally open, which lead to talking about some stuff I never talk about with people. like the fact I get embarrassed when I'm attracted to a woman due to being teased so much anytime I showed interest in someone in highschool. It was nice to talk about my emotions with someone, especially the more negative ones which I have to bottle up all the time thanks to society telling us its wrong to be open about how we feel. Eventually we ended up flirting and that was nice to, cause I felt like I could with her, I felt like I could tell her I thought she was pretty without it giving me a borderline panic attack. There was some sexual stuff as well, which was truely suprising given the anxiety I normally have around it but she made me feel safe and it was nice. It was all online but, it was nice to feel known by someone and I miss it. She eventually faded away as all online friends do though she lasted longer than most at around 6 or 7 months.",lonely,"I'm tired of being ""professional"" with everyone and I miss my friend I could just chill and be myself with.",2022-05-16 12:37:54

I've lost 60 lbs, but that's with a meager 700 calorie a day diet, since I can't exercise. I had a stroke in April and figured out I have an aneurysm this month. I gravely injured myself when I was merely 14, leading to a shunt ultimately needing to be placed. Hydrocephalus is a bitch. I'm 220lbs currently and that's working as hard as I can to be conscious of my weight. I can't walk currently and do exercises in bed and restrict what I eat like a mad woman. 

Anyway, enough about weight. 

I come from the literal lowest socioeconomic background someone probably can in the US. I grew up with too many siblings and we didn't even eat everyday, didn't have the means. 

I busted ass and put myself through college and didn't ever recover enough(physically)to maintain a regular job schedule. I married a man who could take care of me, but this honestly caused me to be more alone. He pressured me enough to have a child and she barely made it, she's fine now though and, if I'm honest, my only friend, she's 8. 

I've had work from home jobs and writing jobs, whatever it takes to get it through the day, but I'm unable to do this now, for various reasons. Mostly medical. 
I've tried things to fill the day, hobbies, instruments, drawing, painting, it works for a while and then I grow bored of it and feel apathy.

At the end of last summer, he started doing his military service. As soon as he left, everything around me pretty much crumbled. I realized that I had no one left. All of the friends that I had in high school had moved abroad or to a different city for collage. Keeping in touch with them was difficult because I realized that I wasn’t even that close to most of them. No one really put in any effort so the conversation died pretty quickly.

With no friends and a boyfriend who only comes home over the weekend every two to three weeks, things turned bleak rather quickly. I have struggled a lot, especially seeing others around me have fun. The only thing I’m looking forward to is for him to come home. It’s hard to get out of this situation when there’s no place to meet people anymore, like school was. I’m going to move to a new city and start studying psychology at university (which I find a bit ironic in my current situation) after the summer, and things will probably get better then. But until then, the loneliness I’m feeling is painful.

I am single, never been in a relationship, kind of going through an identity crisis in my life for a while now. I have never had ""the boys' to hang out with or grab a drink with etc. I have a few girls that are friends from high school but honestly we never see each other. I work full time in retail and honestly its ok,  but I don't like it anymore. I put all my energy to working because I don't have any friends and now all I want is some friends. I specifically would find myself a little happier if I just had 1 guy friend i could call my best friend and who would hang out with me and chat etc. I suffer bad with anxiety and depression and they play off of each other quite a bit. I have spent the last 3 years of my life focused on my university career and my full time job, My social life has tanked and I am extremely socially awkward. I can't seem to keep myself entertained at all and constantly think about wanting to go out on hikes, weekend trips, go for drinks, or honestly even just chill at someone's house watching tv. 

I have always kind of been someone who feels comfort in being around people, and doing things by myself tends to make me feel a bit lonely. I try to not seem like such a pathetic loser but its hard sometimes. I don't want people to see me as really clingy or something like that. In reality I have been through many experiences where I have been made to feel like I am a bit of a loser and now whenever someone gives me a shred of attention, I get super attached and start thinking about everything i want to do meanwhile its just someone chatting online. 

I feel like being almost mid 20s it is so hard to find that kind of friendship.  A lot of people already have their friend groups or closer friends and I sometimes feel like I will never find me a friend like that. It is something I have always wanted. Is it that impossible?

I just didn’t fit in there at the time but now that I am older I still don’t fit in because I didn’t establish myself back then. If that makes any sense whatsoever. 

This caused me to have many lonely Friday and Saturday nights watching Netflix and stuffing my face with comfort food alone. I crave human interaction I crave being included.

I in fact joined Reddit in a desperate attempt to make friends. How pathetic can one be.

2810,30hrstonull,1652652249,1,"
I’ve been pretty isolated since I was 15, I was homeschooled. I’m 20 now, and not much has changed. I decided not to go to college, and a chronic injury is preventing me from working, so I stay home all day and time is feeling so slow recently. I’m lucky to have one friend that’s like a brother to me, but he’s like halfway across the country. He recently got into a relationship. Looking back at all of my old friends and it looks like they’re in relationships too, actually almost everyone I know is in one.
 I know it’s probably not healthy for me to linger on those thoughts, but now I’m spending more time by myself, and the person I used to talk to all the time isn’t there as much. 

It’s got me thinking about a girl, we don’t talk anymore, but I still think about her, and feeling this lonely has got me thinking about it even more, it’s unhealthy, obsession almost. I don’t really want anything to do with it anymore, but I have a feeling that until I start to enter the world like I should’ve years ago, things will change. At least I hope they will. 

Of course I’m pretty young, that almost makes me feel like my feelings are invalidated, but regardless I know I have time. It’s just that things are moving and I’m not keeping up to speed. seeing others graduate, getting into relationships, working. I had a few goals with art but I got another injury and now I’m uncertain if I’ll even be able to pursue art full time. I’ve got a couple hobbies but they’re only distracting for so long. Honestly i feel like a burden, I’m blessed to have a loving family that takes care of me, but it makes me feel bad that I’m not getting much done. I’m in limbo.

I know that all I can do is be patient, but it’s getting harder and harder, I don’t think I’d ever kill myself but some days got me thinking  what should I be living for. Sometimes I can see a future where  I finally have what I’ve been waiting for, but it looks like it’s so far, years, and even then I’ll still be young, and I’ll still have time, but I still have to go through the time until then, and it feels so long. 
Everybody has their own pace in life, I know comparing myself to others isn’t the healthy thing to do right now but I can’t help it. I just hope this waiting is worth it, I’m willing to put in the work for what I want but I can’t right now, that’s what hurts the most. I hope everyone who reads this a good day.",lonely,"Growing loneliness, all I know is that it’s going to take a while",2022-05-16 08:04:09

Online classes are not helping either. I spend most of the time in my room just existing. I have no one you really really talk to other than my therapist. I very much long for some physical intimacy but I have no one to turn to. I had 2 friends who I thought were my best friends and one of them told me to forget about my old friends and make new ones. And with the other, I had asked to call to talk. Call never came. I currently have no one to have deep conversations with, which is important for me as an introvert, no source of affection. I tried bumble and tinder with no luck. I lost interest in both after I started losing self-esteem. Therapy is the only thing keeping me sane. But once a week is too less for me at this point.

2839,THQaway,1652641379,1,"I woke up today feeling even more lonely than ever before. My exwife graduated yesterday. Today she is going off with her girlfriend on the vacation that we had always dreamed of. And I'm paying for it.

 Last month, I found an old letter my wife gave me the night before our wedding, she said ""when you wake up tomorrow, you'll never have to be lonely again."" And it was true, I have never been happier or more safe than when I was married to her and had my own family and life. I remember it at the time being so comforting, especially since she knew about my life with an abusive family and how I woke up everday full of anxiety and dread and loneliness. For her to promise to be there for me felt like a second chance at life.

But after 5 years of marriage, she came out to me as gay. For a couple of months we tried to make it work, and I was hopeful, and she was too. But one day she left out of the blue, skipped our couples counseling, and filed for divorce 5 days later. All I got was a letter from her attorney. Then I got sued. Then she told everyone I was so abusive she feared for her life. I got kicked out of her family, not even a word to try and understand what was going on. The inlaws I had loved me more than my own family. I still dont understand. I lost over half my friends, got kicked out of my church, lost my job. I am destroyed financially, emotionally, and socially. Years and thousands of dollars of therapy with multiple counselors, doctors, etc. have told me I am not abusive. It is so painful and embarassing as an introvert to share every single intimate and private moment, every letter, every conversation I had with her, with strangers and have them scrutinize you. I loved her so much I believed her accusations. It's a small bit of vindication, but how can I be proud of myself. Even if I was a good husband, the best moments of my life were torture for her. The love and safety and admiration I had, it was all just a chore for her. When she couldnt handle it anymore during COVID, she dropped me like trash. Her loving family tossed me away without a second look or word. They all blocked me, told me to never talk to them again. But they were happy to take all the money, assets, and alimoney. The kicker is she isn't even out yet. both of our families and most friends have no idea the truth. They all think I'm the scum of the earth.  


I still love my ex wife. I have her picture on my desk. I cant sleep without her sweater. I've had other relationships since then, but my exwife I vowed to love for life. Even if its not romantic anymore, I just don't see myself making out of this any better, let alone alive. She is with her girlfriend now, in their apartment, with her master's degree, going on a dream vacation, all of which I paid for with the money we were saving for our married lives together. I saw all of this because even though she blocked me, her girlfriend got recommended on social media because of all the ""content"" they post together now. I am happy she is happy. It's my only solace. But I just can't live with this loneliness anymore. I clutched her sweater and even put back on my wedding ring just for a moment to pretend I was there with her. But I am sick to my stomach, knowing all the while she is happy and better off without me, celebrating with folks who hate me.

Just needed to vent, I know everything I need to do for self care and mental well being. I'm just surprised to be even more lonely now than I was.

We both had our own lives, but after graduating university, I felt like I'm the one who always reached out. We never had a conversation unless I would talk to him first, though our conversations were ok, like nothing had changed. 

I recently went through a terrible break up, and I'm sure Jake knows about it because we have very similar circle of friends. It hurt me because he never reached out to ask how i was doing.

2856,Becca19951,1652635860,1,"Hi, 

I’ve never really posted on Reddit but I have been feeling so awful and came across this sub that just spoke to me. 

I am a 26 yo female, I feel like on paper I have done pretty okay for myself. I went to university, got a first class degree in engineering, have a good job with impressive pay. Bought a house with my boyfriend, I have a nice car that I love. As I said, on paper everything looks good. 

However, aside from my boyfriend and family, I have absolutely zero meaningful friendships. In fact, I do not have any friends. I’ve had friends at uni, and school and work etc but as soon as I’m not actively in someone’s life they tend to forget about me or stop making an effort with me. It’s always me who tries to talk to them and make plans and keep the friendship alive but after countless times being let down or ignored I tend to just recluse into self defence mode and give up. 

I don’t know what I do wrong, I feel like I’m a personable character. When with me, people seem to enjoy my company but that’s as far as it goes. I’m the girl who gets spoken over or doesn’t get heard in a crowd. As my boyfriend likes to say, I’m an NPC. And it’s lonely. So fucking lonely. It makes me feel so rubbish about myself and I often get very down about it. 

To make matters worse, my boyfriend has so many fiends. I know he feels bad about going out to see them, when I don’t have anyone I can make plans with. I don’t wish him to feel that way but at the same time I do often end up feeling left very often.

2860,Radiant_Box4228,1652633422,1,"I’ve pretty much gotten to a point where I’m torn between blaming myself or blaming those who weren’t healthy to be around in my past, but now I realize that nobody is to blame. It’s nobodies fault. I’m not an outcast or a lone wolf, in fact people enjoyed being around me or having me as a friend. I’ve been told that I’m a loyal and compassionate person, but i never saw my actions as selfless or “the right thing to do”. My thought process behind everything I do is “How would I want to be treated” or “How would I want this to play out if I were on the other side of this?” 

I wasn’t popular or some type of social butterfly, but I also wasn’t a shut-in or Neet. I grew up knowing people from all types of different circles, played some sports and skating helped me make friends, and I was regularly invited out. By the time I was 17, I started seeing the rapid change around me. People stopped calling, stopped inviting me or others I knew, and overall seemed like a massive layoff is the spectrum of friendship was taking place. It was t some sort of catastrophe or huge drama level event, it was just puberty and maturity at certain points that took over and steered us all into certain directions. People who were very close to others I knew cut ties, relationships ended and it didn’t stop. 

It evolved into others essentially surrounding themselves with like-minded individuals, which isn’t something to be upset about at all. If you truly care for one another, the people they choose to hangout or spend time with shouldn’t upset you. But when you see someone you’ve grown to care for or cherish surround themselves with those who share the same ideologies, opinions and world views, it breaks that sense of abnormality or “opposite” dynamic of a friendship or relationship. People disagree, they debate or argue, and eventually reconcile or come to some sort of certain ground. It’s possible that you may not even agree or agree to disagree on certain topics or opinions, but it wouldn’t break your friendship. It’s just something you’ll disagree on. 

Some may see this as bad or wrong, but in life that’s the reality of it. It’s a part of a relationship that sort of strengthens the foundation of it all, and helps you in other parts of life where this same type of concept is applicable. Love life, workplace and college life and even family life will have you run into the same thing and dealing with it amongst your friends will help you understand this aspect of life. 

However when you take away the disagreements and differences, you’re left with more than just a like minded individual. When those people become a group of people, we’ll for lack of a better term, you end up with a self loving/loathing circle jerk. I’ve seen friends of mine move onto groups of “friends” that couldn’t be closer to the definition of toxicity. I’ve seen 3 of my friends, people I played football or smash bros on the 64 with, end their lives due to drug overdoses because they trusted the people they were so captivated by. One passing very recently, I reached out to their parents and sister who told me that they hadn’t seen him in months since he left off to Mammoth since October of Last year. 

I reached out to who they knew were in his immediate circle, his sister gave me the IG for a couple of his current friends. When I reached out, all I got were “WHO ARE YOU? WHERE WERE YOU WHEN HE WXYZ OR WENT THRU THIS OR THAT?” When in reality, I would’ve been happier talking to him despite knowing he was struggling. Although I know I’m not to blame I still felt a sense of guilt. I did try, but I also didn’t push it either because that’s just who I am. Couldn’t force anyone to try and talk to me. I came to find out that he started using Herobrine (misspelled on purpose, you get the idea though) when he met a girl on that trip to mammoth which ended up becoming a semi-permanent move. I come from an area where a lot of people are wealthy mixed with lower to middle class aka Los Angeles, so he had his parents to support him, regardless of knowing where he was. 


My point is this: I’m very friggin lonely, and people have drifted away from each other and found themselves in groups of people who are too much like them, to the point where it’s almost unhealthy to be around. Don’t let your differences cloud your relationships with those that you love. Differences mean nothing when the bond you have between one another outweighs any differing opinions. However it’s not something you can stop on everyone’s end. Only yours. The sooner we come to realize this, the less lonely we’ll feel. It’s not a quick fix or maybe the answer we want, but I see myself as a very indifferent person when it comes to the common left or right side of things. I don’t take sides or choose who to be loyal to or fight for. Humans need to start putting themselves in the middle every now and then to take in the full picture of things. 

Maybe it’s not an answer, but it’s a start. And to the young ones on here who may not be feeling like they have people who care or who are concerned with how they feel, just know that there’s people on this planet who genuinely care about our progression as a species and as a race. We care about you, we love you and we want nothing but the best for everyone at the end of the day.",lonely,it’s nobodies fault.,2022-05-16 02:50:22

He lives 2 hours away, he works weekends at his job, I work weekdays at mine. Although we both live in the New England area, we’re lucky if we can see each other once a month. 

We’re approaching our 7 year anniversary and, even though we’re still very much in love, it kills me that we’re still not living together. 

To be fair, there’s a lot of extenuating circumstances as to why we aren’t living together. One being that his father has a degenerative disease and he is getting worse. His family relies heavily on him to help take care of his father (although my boyfriend admits that the living situation is incredibly stressful and toxic and he wants to get out of there ASAP). Another being that my boyfriend and I are just now starting to get established in our careers and we’re trying to stay on track for our career goals. And lastly (and most importantly) the market is absolute shit right now and we really wanna buy so we can set permanent roots down somewhere. 

He told me he wants to move out to me and leave the city behind (which is for the better in the sense that it’s so expensive to live where he lives), but that would mean he’d have to find a new job and leave his family and friends behind (which I feel horrible about).

I haven’t done anything bad to deserve this, I feel like a criminal that’s just been released from prison or something.

Ik those things are supposed to help people that need it but it just feels like I have been abandoned.

Atp I’m just waiting to go to university (if I even manage to get in that is) so I can make some friends there, because at my school there are almost no people that are the same race as me or like the same things as me so even at school I don’t fit in.

I do have some good friends, I feel like were growing more distant. It happens as time moves on and we all grow older things change. It still hurts seeing it fade though. 


I just spend so much time on my own, in my room. Sometimes I feel so broken to the point where I question my reality and my own feelings. Do I feel love. Does anyone even feel it or our we all on our own. 

Sometimes I just wish to find a person who wants to talk to me as much as I want to with them. Someone to share the good and the bad. To hug and be held. To do silly things like rolling down a hill like a sausage for example. Maybe one day it will happen maybe it won't. As I said I just don't want to die never having felt it.

We’d both been fucked over by our terrible families and were starting fresh at uni.
She met the “love of her life” a couple months later and he became my friend too. I thought they were good together, and he loved her more than anything. Meanwhile I had been dating for years with no success and was still trying to meet someone. 
Fast forward 4 years of this same dynamic, except I live alone now, and they’re still happily in love, live together, and then things change. Suddenly everything her boyfriend does is annoying/abusive (which I know for a fact isn’t true). It’s all she talks about anymore, so I tell her to just end it. She cheats on him instead, with a younger guy, and after I convinced her to tell her boyfriend the truth, the boyfriend decides to pretend it’s all ok, and says she can continue cheating even though it’s killing him inside.
Now she has 2 boyfriends, and is slowly pushing me away. After months of her bragging about having 2 boyfriends, I was the loneliest I’d ever been. See I’m dating but I’ve only ever made the first move, and then been dumped/ghosted every time, never lasting more than a month or 2 in a relationship. I don’t think anyone has ever fancied me at all, even though I’ve learned to love myself and I’m a confident, sociable person. She was always getting hit on everywhere we went together, then complaining about the attention, calling people weird for trying. 
And for the past 4 months, every time we’ve made plans, she’s not bothered to show up, and messages a few hours later with a bullshit excuse, when I know she’s just having sex or something. My nan passed away last month and she said she’d pick me up from the train station after the funeral; never showed up. Forgot about my birthday last week since she’d already made other plans. I didn’t bother to tell her I’d been dumped again after the longest relationship I’d been in, 2 weeks ago.
It’s been 4 months and her boyfriend is still too in love to end it, the other guy seems like a prick who’s convincing her he’s the only person she should be spending time with, and I’ve lost everyone.

I might delete this post after.

For the longest time I’ve had anxiety, (ever since 6th grade) it just got worse over time to the point I worry about simple things like the way I walk, basically doing anything in daily life. I “overthink” things a lot but I just have this feeling where I know someone is judging me. From their looks or questions people ask me I just know. I’m the shy, quiet type of guy and usually keep to my self. I’ve been bottling these thoughts up for such a long time oh boy.

Honestly I’m tired. The past few weeks I’ve been waking up feeling like my head will explode, been really unmotivated, sad and stressed.

I don’t have friends. Pathetic right? 

I’m already 18 and I’ve never really experienced what it was like. I had a close group in elementary till 6th grade but they ended up cutting. me. off. just why? 
Yeah I know I “wasted a lot of time”, I already get an ear full from my shitty  older brother who just judges me and makes me feel like shit. I usually just distracted myself from this by playing games on my pc but I don’t enjoy it anymore. The people I met online were fake as shit too lmao, even the one online friend I’ve been with for 5 years switched up on me and revealed how and who he really was.
Since I’m 18 now my asian parents expect a lot from me. 
I want to change how I’ve been living, it’s so frustrating.

Wow, I really thought I got out of the incel/blackpill shenanigans.  But even after being able to get girls numbers and having girls slide into my DMs.  I still have that blackpill/incel feeling.  I just give up.  Its weird, I want to be in a relationship and try, but I just cant.  I am probably closer than I have ever been before, but I just dont want to.   Logically, I am probably a like-able guy right?  But my mind is telling me I am and never will be loved.  Too short, too ugly, too built(for being short), too stupid.  

Its weird because I dont want to not be blackpilled.  I dont want to be convinced otherwise.  I want to give up and know I will be forever unwanted.  Which is why I would rather rant on this sub than seek help on the other subs.

on top of that, this time of the year with everyone celebrating new accomplishments, i’m feeling a different kind of loneliness where  i feel everyone around me has been making such big progress in their long term goals while i am still stuck in the same spot and still figuring things out, or making such slow progress. i know i should stop comparing myself and just focus on my own journey, but it’s hard and i still have yet to fully internalize that. 

i will say though today i’m proud of myself for taking myself out on a date today- i dined alone somewhere i’ve been wanting to go for a while. i’ve been getting more comfortable eating alone in public. trying to move towards no more waiting for someone to do the things i‘be always wanted to do. i also combatted one of my episodes of negative lonely feelings today with exercise (running). i’m glad and hopeful that this could become a go-to healthy coping mechanism for me. for context i was never all that athletic throughout my life.

2928,Putin666,1652597031,1,"We evolved to live in close knit groups of 50-100 people. Our brains evolved to feel good when we have some close friends. But the way we all probably grew up or spent our time, didn’t put us in situations where this could happen.

Anime and youtube and tv shows and video games.

How many check boxes does that fill for you? That’s how i spent my life this far. Wow what a surprise we didn’t make friends when we were alone at home the whole time lol.

The answer is simple. Let’s get more social lol. I made 2 real good friends this semester just by talking to people. Ask them if they want to do homework together. This is great because to make a good friend it takes about 100 hours of time spent together and it’s really easy to do that when ur chatting together about homework and then maybe hangout after homework too too.

Other ways to to make friends. Put yourself in situations where you will be seeing the same people consistently on a weekly basis. Time= friends. It’s a simple numbers games. the more people you interact with consistently the higher ur chance is of finding someone you bond with.

Socially awkward? Socializing is a skill that can be learned. Join a workout group or dance class or reading club. keep your options open and don’t stop. something like 50% of the population is unhappy social and 25% is entirety lonely. You are normal. We are normal. You got this.

Also cool little trick to be less lonely is to help people. Helping peoples feels so good and maybe you’ll make a friend.

After covid I lost all that, I have to best friends that I don't see, we talk a lot and play videogames. And a friend that I fell for, but she has a boyfriend and they live together so I don't want to get in between them. We hang out every two weeks more or less, she comes over (I live alone) and we cook and watch movies and talk and that's it.
The thing is, I've been feeling extremely lonely. You see, I work as an artist, I do comics and graphic novels. I do well, but I don't have a lot of money to pay for other activities and stuff to meet new people, everything goes to the rent and bills and luckily food. When I'm short with money, my sister helps me out a bit with my rent, but I try not to ask her for money so I'm always very tight. 
So I've been having a very hard time meeting people. Now I don't get invited to parties or to hang out or anything. People just text me to see if I can help them out getting a gig with their own work and stuff like that. 
I've met other women, that always agree on a few dates and then we just stop talking, I think cause I'm kinda shy and I'm not very flirty. Like I just want to hang out with somebody, but nobody wants to do that. 
I don't know how to meet new people in my situation, and I feel that I forgot how to be a part of those who go out and do stuff. I know covid affected everybody but I feel that I forgot how to be normal and somebody that people want to go out and just talk and hang out. I'm too afraid of rejection so I just stay in my confort zone, but I don't like my confort zone. 
How do you people meet new folks with out being weird? Like what stuff is there to do where you can go alone and just meet others?

I met someone online today who texted like her and all the emotions just came rushing back it's so horrible. I thought I would be done by now. I made a last ditch effort to reach out and be friends again but it seems she doesn't want that. It's so hard to accept it's over, I feel like I'll never like someone as much as I liked her again. 

Life has been really drab since then, like all the colour in the world left with her. We didn't even have a fight or anything, she just didn't want to talk to me anymore. It feels so wrong, especially since she took a lot of my firsts. 

The first time I was out late with a friend, my first outing with someone with just us two. My first time taking photos with a friend, my first time someone fell asleep on me.

It all feels so weird that it's all over and it's never going to be back.

I can't help but compare everyone I meet to her, and no matter what people always fall short of the idealized version of her that I've crafted in my head. Idk it just sucks, I've never been this attached to someone before, I just really want to hear her voice again and it hurts knowing that it's never going to happen.

The person that I liked is probably gone as well. I mean it's been 2 years and some big life stuff happened to her. I can't help but day dream about going through it with her. I'm sure whatever drew her to me has also left me. If there was even anything like that at all considering how easy I was dropped.

I still write songs about her, draw outfits she would wear. Listen to songs we would listen to together. My happy place is the road we crossed at night when it was raining. I still think about the scenery a lot even though I'm sure the memory has left her mind.

I'm sure at this point I sound really creepy, that's if anyone even made it this far. It's not even like this intoxication I am displaying was mutual btw. After a 5 forgotten birthdays and a dozen messages left on read you get the impression that the other person just doesn't like you all that much. It's very depressing to like someone more than they like you, but I think that's something we can all relate to to a degree.

There’s a few people I’d say I’m close with, but over the years I learned I’ve been wholeheartedly open about everything in my life with strangers. I’m not really close with my family either, the amount of manipulation and trauma from them is sickening. I am most content and safe being myself, or at least have tricked myself into believing that. I always felt like I didn’t fit in-with family, friends, peers at school or colleagues at work. Nobody ever understood me or even tried to. I battle with that thought thousands of times daily, knowing that I’m simply not a person who leaves long lasting impressions on people. Most days I wake up sad because I just want to die, and put myself out of agony pretending I love life when in fact I don’t...I put so much positive energy into people when I don’t have enough for myself. It’s too exhausting. Gave it my best shot, with everyone, with everything. I try to be the good human being with morals and pureness that the world needs. I can’t afford the basic lifestyle I have and trying to strive for more often leaves me in disappointment and tears. I’ve become numb to it after so many fumbles. I am tired.

2971,idozeD,1652585783,1,"  I grew up pretty alone, but I see myself trying not to be lonely since I have a consciousness. I try to ignore it and be as calm as possible about it: usually it works, with the great exception of weekends and holidays, when my time just seems wasted. Almost everytime I go outside I get sad because people are mostly happy but I just can't be as them.
  Friendships look very complicated to me, and I may be a loner that prefers having only really deep love instead of multiple and shallow relationships. Unfortunately, I've seen no one with these same interests, and everytime I try to interact I see that someone looks more important to me than I am for them. This lack of reciprocity makes me think about how unirrelevant could I be. 
  Maybe, no one really cares about my literal and internal pains, since most of time I need someone, I have nobody. Adding this to those bad things that naturally happen during life really makes me wonder if life is worth-it and why shouldn't I give up all of this, whatever it means.

I’m in my university year now and I have no friends at my school. My friends from highschool are at different school so I often meet them during weekends. I get excited to meet them cause it’s really sad when there are 147 people in one class but you are just…alone. So I get out of school whenever I can to meet them ( my school is around 30 minutes from where most of them live). But at the same time I didn’t want to bother them to pick me up cause it’s a real hassle with all the traffic and stuff. I don’t own a car so it’s hard for me to even go to campus as I have to take a 20 minutes walk. 

Being in school really fucked up my mental health and I’m not happy with my life. It got worse. I live at my friend’s house for the weekend (not all weekend) when I got out of school so he can send me back before Monday if I have offline classes. Recently, I feel like I don’t belong to that group anymore. Idk if it’s because most of them are males but I feel so lonely plus he told me sometimes he didn’t want to have me but just because he pitied me. That hit me hard.

Hello. I am a 29 year old disabled guy that lives with his parents and I’ve never been to college before, so its difficult to even meet people to try to befriend. I love my parents so much but sometimes I get so lonely because I don’t really have any friends. I have a brother but he’s getting married soon, so sadly I won’t be able to spend as much time with him. The main people that I interact with are my family members. Also its difficult for me to talk to strangers because I have a speech impediment. I figured I might as well try the internet to find some friends. Im so tired of feeling so lonely all the time. Having disabilities is tough but im so happy about what I have achieved, I recently started learning how to play the violin! The violin is very difficult for me but I love the instrument so much. I wonder if anyone will even read any of this haha but im going to hope that at least one person reads my post. I feel invisible most of the time. Im not a alien but sometimes I feel like a alien. I hope I make a few close friends. I don’t care about your gender or location but please be between the ages of nineteen and thirty six years old.

&amp;#x200B;

Italian food is my favorite food. My favorite color is purple. I love the ocean. I don’t drive. I love gaming. Halloween is my favorite holiday because of all the cool costumes that I see. FFXIV is my favorite video games but I don’t play much but I want to change that. I want to learn how to play the piano in the future. I believe in Bigfoot and aliens. It took me a long time to write all of this, my grammar and spelling are horrible. My favorite candy is chocolate and gummies but not as a combo. I have a Service Dog for my anxiety because I get lots of anxiety. I love language learning even tho im not the greatest at it. I am a boy but sometimes I like wearing dresses. I love philosophy. My favorite cartoon is The Last Airbender.

&amp;#x200B;

I love gardening! Gardening makes me smile. I love nature and just chilling in it sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I love playing the violin. I started learning the majestic instrument about a year ago. Im not super good at playing the violin but I absolutely love the instrument so very much. Right now im learning how to play a anime song on it. The song is called The Path Of The Wind. You get bonus points if you know what anime that song comes from! The next song I want to learn how to play is from the anime called Parasyte.

&amp;#x200B;

Hiking and camping are literally two of my most favorite things to do in the whole universe! I love hiking with my brother and camping. I have hiked some of the PCT before, I hope to hike the whole PCT someday but I doubt it will happen because of my disabilities, I would need to have a very trusted long term hiking buddy do the whole trail with me, and most people can’t take off that amount of time from work. There are a lot of local hikes that I frequently go hiking on. I love hiking so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Poetry is music to my soul.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a amateur cosplayer thats obsessed with anime. I have seen several animes and I have been to a few conventions. My brother is kind enough to bring me to anime cons and hang out with me all weekend there haha even tho he’s not the biggest fan of conventions, I love my brother so much hehe writing that sentence made me cry a lil, I have a very nice brother. I think I love cosplaying so much because I can pretend that im “normal” for a while, I try my best to stay positive about my disabilities but its very tough sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Im absolutely obsessed with cooking. My favorite food to cook is Indian food. Pav Bhaji is my favorite Indian food dish to cook. Sometimes I cook some Italian food. Pizza is so much fun to cook.

&amp;#x200B;

I love to travel. I have been to all of the USA states and to most of Europe, and a few other countries. I want to visit many more countries in the future! I also love long road trips around the USA. I recently got back home from a big road trip across some of the west coast of America. Hawaii and France are two of my favorite places that I have visited so far. I love adventuring.

&amp;#x200B;

Fishing is a hobby that I want to get into. I have only gone fishing (maybe?) two-three different times. Im mostly vegetarian so I would throw most fish back. I do eat fish sometimes but not often, mainly just when im on vacation in Hawaii. I want to get into fishing because I love being by lakes/oceans/rivers. The ocean is my favorite. I love boats.

&amp;#x200B;

Skateboarding is the main way that I get around town but sometimes I go biking. I LOVE SKATEBOARDING!

&amp;#x200B;

Being a Marine Biologist is my dream job and I wish I was one. I dont know if I would ever be able to graduate college because of my disabilities makes Learning tough for me. But my parents believe I could do it! I want to try going to college soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dog. Her name is Olive. I adore her so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Im very shy at times. I don’t get a lot of time to practice my social skills with new people, so sometimes I come across as very awkward if someone doesn’t know me. My mom says that im good at bringing up interesting topics haha but I think she’s biased because im her son. Lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Code Geass is my favorite tv show.

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite movie of all time is Howl’s Moving Castle. Its a classic movie! Classic among classics. I love the movie. The soundtrack of the movie is also very awesome. I love all Studio Ghibli movie soundtracks. I once cosplayed as Howl. I think I have seen the movie around thirty times by now hahahaha.

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite genre of books is Dystopian.

3021,mind_ablaze,1652573248,1,"I'm going to be 22 on Wednesday. I guess I'll just start from the beginning, as cliche as it sounds to say that.

I've never fit in. I moved to where I currently live when I was in third grade and suffered really terrible bullying at the hands of a lot of the school up until early high school. I had people who I guess I could consider friends but only a couple who I really consider FRIENDS. I only have three people I can think of off the top of my head who I would consider myself still friends with from high school, and honestly only four who I would say I was friends with in any real capacity anyway. Out of the three I still talk to, one constantly flakes on me and every plan we ever make and the other one moved continents. The third I'll talk about later.  


I lost my entire online friend group of four years this past year and very, very few of them speak to me anymore. I don't really want to talk about the details of the whole situation surrounding it - it's messy and exhausting to even think about. It's really shaken a lot of my faith in my self, really shattered all of my confidence socially - I never expected them to just cut me off completely, which the majority of them did. A lot of them assured me they wouldn't when I was worried about losing them as friends and still did.   


My best friend from high school moved away for school and I'm proud as hell of him because that man will be my brother until the day I die. He has been there for me in situations where I had no one else. He knows things about me that literally no one else does.   


I miss seeing my best friend every day at school. We stay in contact - play video games together, sometimes we just FaceTime each other and talk. But he's not *here* anymore. I don't interact with him daily online like I did with my old friend group, and I don't expect him to be available to me like that - he has his own life and I respect and admire that in him. He has a group of friends where he lives who he hangs out with regularly - roommates and friends from work and school.   


While I am glad for my friend and his situation, I can't help but envy it deeply and constantly. He went away to school - I stayed in the town that both of us despise and went to community college. He got all those opportunities that I just keep wishing I had the guts to apply to school and get. I was too scared.  I decided to stay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Four years later, I'm not even close to finishing an associates degree and I have no idea where my life is going. To my credit, I've had a job (recently two) the entire time that I've really enjoyed, but it's pretty much consumed my entire life at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

The community college I go to is really terrible at cultivating the community part - my days are spent during the school year by getting up, going to class, going to work, coming home, repeat. I've had very few social interactions outside of the classroom. Friends who I thought I'd made will either just not contact me or only contact me if they think I'll let them use something of mine. I have no friend circle. No one really contacts me. The only people who I get texting me are my sister, my parents, or my boss. I have some online friends now but none of them are really all that close to me. I think that some of them believe themselves to be much larger parts of my life than they are. That's not to say that's anything wrong with our friendships or them - they just don't live anywhere near me so we can never actually physically hang out and also have other relationships that take priority over the friendship they have with me - which is also normal and fine. It's just reality. I don't expect them to make extra time for me or put their other relationships on hold for me. I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no real way to meet people. My line of work isn't one that lends itself to meeting too many people - I stick around the same bunch of them, and not too many are people I'd want to hang out with outside of work anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm not at work I'm just in my room. Alone, usually. I just...I feel so isolated. So alone in this sea of other people who have partners and friends and people to go do things with and I'm just sitting here, unable to work up the courage or fight off the anxiety to talk to people I don't know in the real world.

Then I see those people walking around laughing and they just pass me by without a glance. I’m not mad about this but it’s always funny to realize people have their own ‘real’ friends. I used to text many people during quarantine but it all had started to stop. Sure, these people have their own lives but taking a month and weeks or when they need something to get one text back is just hurtful.

I try to stop hating myself because it gets so painful. Even if I want to I can’t escape my own thoughts. I have little positive or attractive qualities. Being ugly is hard and being talentless is hard. It’s getting exhausting trying to change that.I understand why I’m lonely. People say that I have to have confidence and try to make friends but I never had much confidence to begin with.

I’m writing this because I want to know if anyone had stories similar and that they can tell me how it gets better. I’m going to delete this eventually because I feel like I’m being negative.

You see growing up she was addicted to pills and was always high and I always had to take care of her. I remember one of the times it was my 16th birthday and I came home and she was passed out on the floor so I had to drag her to the bed and tuck her in and make sure she was alright. This happened all the time so I grew used to it like it was just a part of life. She married seven times and we moved around all over Texas. I went to so many schools and never stayed in one place for more than a month or two. I had no friends, I was always the new kid. My mom separated me from my family when I was really young so I really wasn’t close to them because they didn’t like her (for obvious reasons) and I was very protective over her because she was my mom. She sheltered me pretty bad never really let me go out and do anything so I pretty much grew up in my rooms. Never went to a friends house or anything. Eventually when I was 18 I had enough so I gave her an ultimatum, either get sober or I’m done, I’m cutting ties. I’ve tried so hard for all these years to get her to change and nothing happened so I was just done. She didn’t change. She didn’t listen to me. So I left. Moved in with my girlfriend I just met because I needed to get out of the situation. Thing is, my girlfriend was just the same. Didn’t really let me do anything and kept me sheltered. But for 6 years I took it because I was used to it and was terrified of being alone. Now I’m 24 about to be 25 and it kills me that I’ve wasted so much time of my life.

I mean more a perspective of ""I am alone, and yes it hurts but is not the end of the world either"".

Single people think getting a relationship or marrying would heal their loneliness I've seen that the ones that are miserable before marrying are -sometimes even more- miserable when they marry.

Friendships? Making plans for the weekend? Then what? You get home afterward and you feel the same as before, and maybe you start getting anxious about doing something again soon. 

I've felt lonely for many years and I've decided to really look into it, and the more I look I realize it is fixed from within.

The first thing is accepting it; yea I did not get invited to that place, yea I do not get many texts, yea I am not the popular person. So what?

When I was a kid I used to play alone and really had a blast, sometimes I just turned off the TV and daydreamed about stuff and really enjoyed it. Or sat down to play a videogame by myself and had a blast, I even remember enjoying cleaning my room and listening to music. 

Today friendships is more about ego and numbers than creating actual connections with people.

What will I do? What can I do?

I don't know yet. But I am not gonna stress over it anymore. 

I won't become bitter that's sure; I am and have always been a kind and warm person. Won't become cold just cuz my relationships haven't work as I wanted? Was my fault? Not 100%, at the end people do whatever they want. I won't put my happiness on their hands.",lonely,Accepting it is good.,2022-05-15 07:56:35

Well, I just started university in person (going into my second year) and the problem I’ve always had was that I always envied good times people were having, opportunities people got since they made friends/connections, I just hate being alone so bad or I’ll just be severely depressed/unmotivated.

I know from my highschool friends (still friends with them) that it’s not just me who’s still lonely in university. A lot of people are, and I know I won’t always be accompanied with someone unfortunately.

I understand where my problem is, I don’t think making friends is the reason I came to university. I KNOW I want to study hard and have minimal distractions but I can’t help but feel so stupid for being lonely. I want to be happy that I can be alone since that’s a big part of independency

I'll just put myself out there and be myself without any need to focus on what I'm saying etc etc. so it's not even a facáde or self-esteem problem like one would think. And then it would go exactly the way I had imagined.

Until I blow it the very next day or month and just become an antisocial piece of sh\*t. For no reason. I just can't keep friends or anything for a long time for that matter. I'm guessing it's got to do a lot with lack of routine. Or complete indifference to wanting one. Gotta be one of those things fo sure.

Don't get me wrong it's not like I don't have any friends of acquaintances but they are distant as hell. I even have a 4 yr relationship but we just treat eachother like business partners. 

I would just completely avoid people whom I would literally talk to a day ago for no goddamn reason. We would really click and then I just go and blow it without any sense of why I did that. There's no plan or reason. And I make tons of plans and reasons but never put them to action (once again possible lack of routine on my part)

and then for the sake of adhering to the fictional social hierarchy I have created, I will act that way for the entire remainder of my time with that person, if there even is any to begin with. Then get problems with envy and actively resent said person. Sucks. 

If I, for some strange reason, cancel this entire mental charade I am still met with avoidance from people sooner or later because they get bored of me I think. So not exactly a win win situation.

There's a lot going on in my life lately and I feel I'm loosing control over it. On the outside, I think I can be considered a succesful man, I often hear people are jealous of my life. I have a job that earns me a nice cash, I have a daughter, I'm with a girl I had a crush on for around 10 years, I'm still relatively young, fit and healthy, and I can lead a life some of my peers would consider luxurious.

Yet deep down, I feel extremely lonely. My job is slowly killing my true personality, as it forces me to behave like someone I'm really not. I need to pretend I'm an extrovert, a natural born leader, I'm constantly bombarded with different people and social interactions in which deep down I'm not interested at all. My daughter is a really loud and hyperactive type of kid, a total opposite of me. Spending time with her is very tiring for me, and after a few hours I'm sick of her, which makes me feel disgusted with myself, because I'm not a good father she deserves. My girlfriend is trying to be supportive and loving, but I feel we don't understand each other, and I'm actually shocked she's still with me, because I'm doing everything I can to make her dump me. I love her, but I'm not a right guy for her. I'm considered fit, but behind this facade I'm a guy with a very unhealthy eating habits, or perhaps even an eating disorder.

As I said, I think I'm addicted to being lonely. My girlfriend recently asked me what I want from life, and my honest answer was ""to be left alone"". My family is totally unsupportive of me, they consider any sign of mental distress a weakness or a whim. My mother thinks that my life is wonderful because I make a few times more money than she does, because that's apparently all that matters. My ex-girlfriend, the mother of my daughter and perhaps the person who knows me the best (we spent a few years together, after all) says I've changed a lot a last few years and I can't disagree. I think I became devoid of any emotions. All I feel in my life is nostalgia for the past, and all I do is trying to go back to ""the good, old days"". In my free time (and I don't have much of it) I listen to the same old depressing music, I play the same old video games, or I sleep. I know it may sound like a depression, but at the same time, it's not like I feel down. I just generally don't feel anything, negative or positive. I also never had a suicide thoughts, even for a briefest of moment. Sometimes I feel my life doesn't have any meaning to it, but I don't want it to end. On the contraty, I'm terrified of thought of death.

Okay, it's a long rant already. To sum it up, all these things don't make any sense to me. I feel alone, but when people want to socialize with me, I reject them. I'm always looking forward to the weekend, but when it finally comes, I always look for an excuse to spend it alone in my apartment, laying in bed and midnlessly watching dumb videos. I'm actively avoiding my girlfriend as much as I can, although I can tell she really loves me and cares about me a lot. Is it normal?

Being alone is a blessing. Being lonely and alone is different of course, but unfortunately, they go hand in hand together with me. Still, as long as I'm alone, I'm the happiest person alive. After all the extensive abuse and torture I've been through and all the bullying I had to withstand, I love being alone. It puts no responsibility on you, it forces no meaning on you. There's no one there to hug you, no one there to help you, no one there to tell you things will be alright, no one there to tell you that you'll make it. But I've been isolated my whole life, I don't understand what that is. These words and actions make me feel anxious, and bring me pain. These concepts are alien to me. And it often feels to me that these lonely reddit people only ask for love, they don't know how to give. I don't know it either, I can't give love, I don't even know if I can feel it. Being lonely is a salvation from all the mental torment I've been subjected to. No more judging every movement, no more insults, no more controlling, no more dictating, no more beating or manipulating. I don't have any love to give. I'm broken and no one in the world can fix it. Being alone is the only moment I feel truly free and I feel nothing but disdain for humanity as a whole. I have no memory, no history, I don't understand living or feeling, I'm so detached from it all. I raised myself, alone, in my little room, and I'm a mess. I'm a mess broken beyond repair. But the one thing that brings me happiness, is when I'm left alone. I don't need love, I know i can't handle it.",lonely,A bit of different take,2022-05-15 04:29:26

3083,PopDiddilyBop,1652551622,1,"21f. Throughout my adolescence I didn’t trust other people, so never tried to form a friend group. Got close to very very few people. This past year of college I finally let people get close to me. I had four people - three guys and one girl. It all began to fall apart when one of the guys got one of the girls drunk, started touching her, and tried to lure her into his car. If I hadn’t found them  he would have done something. 

The girl wanted me to forgive him, so I tried to. But I treated him differently after that. Eventually she began to experience paranoid delusions, and distanced herself from everyone. She ruined her ex best friends reputation, abused her boyfriend and then filed false racism claims against him, and made three false reports on others that aimed to get them expelled. Only started texting me and calling me. And would go out looking for new victims. I strongly suspect she has Borderline Personality Disorder. 

The one guy resented the fact I treated him like a monster after assaulting her. As well as targeting my other female friends. He was telling people I sent nudes and I called him out for it. So he blocked me and smear campaigned me. Very strong narcissistic traits. Most everyone, including the borderline he assaulted, chose him over me. And acted as informants to his campaign. Nobody has reached out, nobody cares. They’re all deep into drugs and alcohol. And feel that it’s not their fault. 

It’s been 8 months. I’ve tried making new friends but I’m extremely traumatized by what happened. I thought I could trust them. But they hurt me and threw me away.

Looking for happiness externally is only getting temporary highs, finding that inner happiness within one's self is challenging, yet most rewarding  


It couldn't get me any harder. I'm a good student. I'm also an undergrad teaching assistant, which considers being ""cool"".

I feel nothing. I was high for a moment after the offer, but I realized ""is that all?"". I have no connection to my friends or my family. Most of the time I'm just be there.

I look at my non-college friends, who think they are ""not as successful as me"", but they have their life together, they have close friends, they have significant others, they're full of life, full of love, and always happy and positive. Those are much greater successes to me. I'm so jealous of them. I'm not a financially ambitious person, but it's the only thing I can aim for because I have nothing else besides it.

3112,Iloveddlg,1652537534,1,"I think I wake up feeling the urge to put a bullet in my mouth every other day. I've gotten pretty good at fighting off the feeling throughout the day, but I can feel it wearing me down slowly. My situation is a weird one, and I'm mostly just writing this down for my own purposes. In case you don't wanna read all of that, I just wanted to ask who else struggles with this also?


Ok, now onto the reasons I feel this way. As I said, it's a long one. So, I've been pretty suicidal since I was around 13 or so. I was a loner in school and essentially watched everyone around me make friends, get into relationships, etc. As a teenager, I grew quite resentful of that and became a sort of lone wolf, bitter at the world for rejecting me the way it did. 

Fast forward to when I'm 16. I just moved to a new town, and found myself in my first relationship with X. X was (is) bipolar and our relationship was a rocky one. She ended up cheating on me and leaving me when I was about 21. It was an incredibly bad break up. The kind that leaves you feeling scarred and betrayed, not least because the only girl in the world who'd ever accepted me, let alone loved me, trampled all over my heart like it was nothing. She shacked up with the guy a few days later, fell hardcore into drugs with him, and just generally became someone I didn't recognize anymore. 

After a brief, mostly LDR due to covid with my second girlfriend, let's call her Y, she ended up breaking it off for seemingly no reason after showering me in love and affection for months, then slowly exiting my life. She now ignores me whenever I talk amongst our mutual friend group, as if I don't exist. I don't understand it, and I don't understand her. Yet another senseless ripping out of my heart as far as I'm concerned. 

So anyway, since that happened I've been single for around 3 years, mostly floating from one casual thing to the next. I've learned that showing vulnerability, or any sense of humanity beyond pretending like nothing bothers me and I have 0 problems, leads to a potential love interest losing interest for good. I've learned that, to most people, I'm not a human being with thoughts, feelings, interests, etc. I'm a human doing, as in, my only value is how useful I am to the person in question. How much moral and emotional support do I provide? Am I rich? Am I willing to buy them things or host them at my house to distract them from their problems? Beyond these questions, I don't exist to most people. No one asks how I'm doing, checks up on me, or anything. It's apparently the expectation that I do that for them, but god forbid they return the favor. 

During this time, my ex X called me. We ended up hooking up several times and keep in semi-regular contack behind her boyfriend's back. However, she's very keen on keeping us a secret from as many people as possible. She'll talk sweetly to me, tell me she loves me, misses me, all that. But she doesn't want anyone to know what's happening here. She doesn't want ""her life that she's built"" to be destroyed. So, in essence, I'm just her side piece. There to serve her when she needs me to but otherwise our relationship is non existent. The sad thing is that it's the most intimacy I've gotten from another human being in years. At least she pretends to care, to love, and everything. I've gone years without so much as that, despite my best efforts to try to make friends. It's not an exaggeration to say that everyone I've come into contact with has used me in one way or another. 

The way things are now, with me being a side piece to my former girlfriend and otherwise only being acknowledged by anyone for my usefulness to them has made me pretty suicidal. I have a history of it, but it's worse now than it's been in awhile. My friends are getting married to genuinely great people, and I'm here alone, unwanted and certainly unloved no matter what I do. Sometimes I just want to end everything, it doesn't really seem worth it most of the time",lonely,Waking up suicidal most days,2022-05-15 00:12:14

Hi, I'm Michael and I'm looking to make some new friends here! This is a backup account created solely for this purpose. The guys work with know my other account and that, coupled with my slight fear of clowns and the option to send pictures within chats now, would undoubtedly not go unexploited, I know new accounts are suspicious here and think what you will but will go out of my way to avoid a clown. I suppose I should say something that makes me stand out from the crowd a bit. Not really sure how to do that as I'm not one that ordinarily stands out from the crowd. I'm actually quite good at blending in. A skill learned from working all these years. Lol. I'm just a regular everyday average sort of guy. There's nothing really remarkably different about me. I enjoy what most people enjoy. like laughing with friends and having a good time. I do have a soft spot for Pink Floyd. Piper At The Gates Of Dawn anyone? I'm brand new to this as this is my first time looking for friends. Online fiends, I mean, I'm easy-going and it isn't too hard for me to strike up a conversation with just about anyone. Doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. If an average guy in his mid thirties gets your attention and that's something you're looking for, by all means, shoot me a message! tend to get along better with people closer to my own age so please be close to 30. No minors. Admittedly, spend a little too much time here on Reddit. So many subs, so little time. As an icebreaker, perhaps you can tell me about a sub here you enjoy I may not have discovered yet.

3125,SkippyinLA,1652525144,1,"So it’s Friday night. I did nothing as usual. I stayed up late doing the dishes from 2 days ago so when the housekeeper comes in the morning she won’t be overwhelmed and judge me for being lazier than I know I am. 

So it hit me: Life is torture. Plain and simple. I was thinking about it as I brushed my teeth. Here I am, getting ready for bed, each night, then having to get up the next day to do the whole awake thing over again… working, eating, watching oneself deteriorate physically (getting older, thinning hair, and getting rounder), watching stupid TV shows, going to bed and then repeating the cycle over and over again with no idea what’s next, no plans, no goals, no aspirations and no prospects. Life is just one dull, dreary cycle of sad events. Like a slow, boring foreign film with no plot, no dialogue and no guest stars or cameos. Just me, going through the motions of this thing called a life. What’s the point? 

Sadly, I have no one to talk to about any of this or how much I wish I could just stop the pain. My parents didn’t love me, they didn’t want me, they stopped talking to me because I’m gay and not a conservative Trump supporter. Fine. Check. Don’t need them. My baby sis sides with my parents. Fine. Check. Don’t need her. 

But everyone else I’ve met over the years had turned away too and I don’t know what to do or say. I tried for years to keep setting up outings. Inviting everyone over for dinners, game night, movie night, taking time to remember everyone’s birthdays and sending cards and being mindful to call, text or visit for each special occasion. I was the friend I wanted others to be to me. The same with relationships. Both of my ex bf said as they were dumping me that I was “the kindest, sweetest, most caring and loving, thoughtful and kindest person they had ever met.” Both. Verbatim. I could not make this up. Yet. They both met someone younger and hotter and well… I was out. 16 and 5 years respectively, flushed down the toilet. Liars and thieves. That’s what guys are. 

So despite all my efforts, my phone never rang back. No texts or emails came. When I fell on hard times, after I was laid off, I heard from no one and saw no one. Then I get back on my feet and no matter how many times I ask to meet up, catch up, grab a bite or drink, it’s always, “sure! Yes! Let’s do it!” And years go by and nothing. 

So I am left with no friends. No family. No children since my selfish exes decided they didn’t want to adopt even though they originally were open to it. So now I’m 52, stuck in and endless cycle of work, eat and sleep with nothing else to live for but to pay my rent and buy groceries. 

Is this really how the next 40-50 years are going to be? Fuck me. Life is torture. 

And it will only get worse as I won’t be able to get clients or work when I’m 75, I’ll be even in more pain than I’m in already thanks to my ruptured disc. 

How does everyone else do this life thing alone? It suuucks… and not in a good way.

I had been living in denial, never followed her to the couselor for marriage therapy, and now that I finally see it all, and am seeking the help I need it is too late. I was blinded by my own issues and arrogance...and now I can see it all.
The difficult part, I still love her like we just met, as in the first year of marriage. I need help, I feel lonely and scared. Just miss her touch, but now all I get are cold hugs, the touch a therapist would give a patient. She wants to be friends, mainly for the sake of the kids, I want my life and family back. 
She gave me enough hints, more like direct talks, saying she was unhappy, that she hated me (and I never seen she saying she hated anyone all these years), and in hindsight I can now see how she had been unhappy for a long time. I was not there emotionally, affectivelly, empathetically, and even physically. We had sex, but was something mechanic, without joy. I was blind and did not see, living in denial...then all of a sudden....I saw! Upon seing her face of aversion when she said it was over, and her relief, happines afterwards, her attitude as if a curse had lifted from her shoulders. And I was that curse.
I now have a long road for recovery for all my issues, if anything, at least to have a good relationship with my children, the be the best dad in the world and the dad I fell short of being so far. But now I must do it alone. If it would have been tough with my wife and my kids at home, supporting me, by my side, I can only fear doing it all by myself, in the silence of an empty house. 
I am a grown up, middle age man that is feeling like a five year old left alone at the train station, abandoned. I have very few friends, and they are all married, busy with work, kids, not much left for someone like me. That was me and I could not see how happy and complete I was.
For everyone here, If you love your family, go to therapy if your spouse says you need it. I don't want anyone to go through my pain. Dont let depression, anxiety, and anger, fueled by any undiagnosed desease like ADHD  Bipolar, or any other, get in the way of a life, a family. I did. 
I will recover, I will rebuild myself for my children. But we can make pills for the brain, we can find solace in our children and even in the arms of another. But there are no pills for the heart, for the pain and the forever saddness of the lost true love, the loss of the one who still gives me butterflies. And for no fault other than my own.

For the last 3 years I've been faking a persona online, one persona who just represents my ideal me, the person i wish i was yet i will never be: Seeing myself as a cute likeable girl.

The point is I just hate my identity as a male, I wish I could get rid of my manliness and turn into a female, I can't stand being related to sexism and all of those femicide cases (in my country, is one of the main problems), yeah, I know not all men are bad, I know I'm not one of them and I know there are also women who aren't angels, but the media keeps remarking me reasons to want to dispose of my d\*ck and whatever identifies me as a male, even those memes where they mock toxic feminism (or should i say hembrism as I hate to generalize)

Another reason I want to dispose of my masculinity is that (here is the reason I made an apologize two parragraphs ago) by the time i've been faking being a girl I found out how easy women have it when it comes to get affection or find confort and how they aren't judged because of showing weakness and sadness, while men are either made fun of or ignored while doing the same, even by fellow men.  I repeat, my apologies if this sounds sexist. 

However, I have no plans on becoming a trans, because my economical status doesn't allow me that and because I come from a christian family, so despite I have nothing against LGBT community, I feel like the values i was raised in makes me feel like I don't want to make such a drastic change on my body, which just puts me on a crisis, like, I want to stop being a male yet I know I can't change gender by magic or something.",lonely,I wish i could stop being me,2022-05-14 14:22:58

I admit, rather shamefully so, that I get attached to people way too quickly. It is indeed my biggest failing. I listen to cheesy love songs, write love poems, play the guitar with more happier sounds. The person who has my attention during these times is on the forefront of my mind. I daydream about their touch (non seggsually), I think of their voice, pretending in my head that they're telling me all sorts of sweet nothings. I fantasize a future. I go off on little tirades about how much they mean to me.

I can become this way in as little time as 3 weeks.

My sense of love, and my conveyance of such emotion is broken. I'm starved for that connection so much that even the slightest notion towards the idea that someone has feelings for me makes me excited.

My parents split when I was younger, when I was 7, I think. My mother became very dejected towards me. Since I was her only son, I reminded her so much about her ex husband, and was projecting feelings she had toward him, to me. My dad wasn't much better. From the time I was 10-15, my dad was more or less physically abusive. Was I a shit child that probably had it coming to me once or twice, sure. But I'm okay now.

I genuinely don't have a father figure anymore. My mother's trying to be better, but she'll never be the same. I long for a romantic connection that I can just dead rely on. I want to work and toil for someone who would appreciate my efforts. I may not be giving my 100% every day, but my emotions would remain the same. I want to make someone proud, both romantically, but also in a maternal sense too. The motherly ""I'm so proud of you"" that I've been missing all my life. 

I also recognize too that my head is in the clouds. I know that I will never have that kind of connection in my life. At least, never again. I work tirelessly on the grind called my life. I play old video games on my Wii, and try to pretend I'm a kid again, but with a decent childhood.

Knowing that I will never have this connection will pain me to the very, very end. But I will always hope. Because I will have nothing else to do than live my life in the same apartment for the next fifty years or so, making money, living the same life I can.",lonely,"A vent about being lonely, I guess.",2022-05-14 14:03:41

It says (with proper credible research  
in psychology and examples) that our brains are capable of synthesising happiness and they are already doing it subconsciously but there are things we can do to speed it up or slow it down, it means that our brains have a tendency of seeing a silver lining in negetive experiences as a way of making peace with things we want but do not get. I also brought the book by this same speaker and started reading it, i researched it a bit more and i try to remind myself of it. You need to shift your perspective (its hard but better than suffering alone with no hope) and let your mind do its job. It also said that we tend to overestimate things we dont get.

Today I went to a local library because I felt I needed to go outside because I just keep working at home every day. 

But as soon as I walked into one of the library's room, a girl approached me. She was hosting a vinyl exhibition. 

At first, I was paying attention to what she was saying, but as soon as I saw the vynils I started talking about my own collection of CDs and she got very interested in it. But then I kept changing the subject and she kept interacting so at the end we talked about a bunch of stuff, not even related to vynils nor music. 

She seemed to understand everything I was saying and talking to her was like talking to an old friend or something because we agreed on everything.

We talked so much that a library employee interrupted our convo to say the library was shutting down. Then, I told her that I intended to go back and that I would visit her exhibition again soon. She said she would be there for months so I was invited to comeback. 

I felt like asking her number or something but I got hesitant due to a lot of things. First, I am very introverted and socially awkward. Secondly, I've been very focused on work in order to be financially independent since I live with my mother. Also, I am very ashamed of living with my mother because I am an adult and I feel that I should be living on my own already. 

Now I don't know if I should go back to see this girl or not. To clarify, I am a bisexual girl and the girl seemed to be interested in girls (my gaydar is very good) so I think there would be a chance I could be more than friends with this girl, which makes me even more afraid to make a move.

3185,PsalmoftheSad,1652495906,1,"Man, it's been a whole month since I've posted to this subreddit. I guess that means, for a while there, I was doing good. Or I was just on a roll with shoving my feelings down... Which seems more likely of the two options right now



I uh.. I haven't posted about this girl lately and I'd like to just for a moment. She was special to me. Not in the same way the love of my life was, though -- because this girl brought a message with her. For some backstory for those who care, I spent a year of my life talking to this girl that I met through a video game. Stupid, I know, but the girls that live around me won't give me the time of day because... Well, I can only assume it's my height. I mean shit I can't even get a word in without being judged. Either way, that's neither here nor there in regards to the story I'm telling. 


I met her through a game, and we seemed to hit it off really well. We talked every other day and it quickly turned into a daily basis. I'd call her during my break at work (and I'd make it a point to take a 30 minute break for JUST that reason) and we'd play games together on my days off. She was the first, last and only girl I ever told my folks about... But she had a lot (and I mean A LOT) of fuckin baggage to unpack. I was more than willing to stick it out with her but she wasn't. There were times where she'd let me in, but there was always something she'd hold back. Granted I understand I only knew her for a year, but there were times I'd almost be on the brink of tears trying to explain to her that I'm not there to hurt her and wanted nothing more than to make her as happy as she made me... And I guess that's a lost cause if she didn't want to put in the work. 



Long story short, after she found out I had feelings for her the dynamic shifted almost immediately. She started putting her other friends above me, started to suddenly not want to call... It was the beginning of the end. Couple that with the fights we'd have on a near daily basis that only got worse, it wasn't a good match. She said she never wanted to date, which I thought was funny because almost all the fights were started by her, and they were all something that couples would fight about. She'd send me letters in the mail and I'd send them back, although last time we fought she called me just to shred them... I still kept hers. Matter of fact, it still smells like the perfume she put on it all those months ago. 



**TL;DR** : I guess the point I'm trying to make by telling you this story is that she brought a message with her. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much effort I put into somebody, it always comes back the same : She doesn't want to date me. I'm not deserving of love. And somehow that's supposed to be liberating.

I have started distancing myself from my friends and blowing off plans because every time I see them I have to hear about their problems which can be exhausting to focus on all the time. I feel like there is no space in my life where it is just focusing on me. My time is either dedicated to work, school, family, or my friends and their problems. I started spending the little amount of my free time alone and when I have explained to my friends I like being alone cause it’s the only time I feel like I can be myself and do what I want to do they have gotten upset at hearing that. They have tried to tell me they are sad about how we barely see each other but it is exhausting to have to see someone and know they are gonna either 1)only discuss their problems or 2)expect you to do something or help them in some way. Yes I am alone often and it can hurt at times to have no one but at the same time it is exhausting to be there for everyone and have no one. It is a joke that I am the mom of the group since I take care of my younger brother and do so much. But it actually feels like I am my friends mother the way they constantly come to me and expect me to take care of them and their problems.
I have expressed to them how I already do so much and actually feel like a mom to my brother so my free time is important to me cause it’s the only time I really have to not be doing things for others. Yet they still expect me to support them by constantly helping and dropping everything. I have no outlets to talk about my problems because everyone in my life just expects me to be fine because I already do so much.

Today I was talking to one of my siblings about old times. One of my old BEST childhood friends came up. I stopped talking to her 2-3 years ago and really regret it. I have no way to contact her. My other sibling came in saying “you need to let these things go. Childhood friends. Move on” in a sarcastic annoying demeaning tone. It really made me upset but I had to hide it.

They know that I have 0 friends and I feel like they think I’m weird for it. I always try to back track saying “no I like being alone and I’m not lonely” when indeed I am. I just don’t want to seem like some type of freak loner. Is that how everyone sees me?

Here's the deal: most of the problems were inadvertently caused by me without my knowledge which led them to cause intense feelings against me. My problem was that I stepped on their boundaries and came off as rude and insensitive, which when I reflect over, was wrong of me. I understand and I'm definitely trying to be a better person for them and others. 

On the other hand: hurt. So. Much. Hurt. Hurt over the fact that they chose to hide it from me for so long. Hurt that they broke my trust. Hurt that they went behind my back and spoke about me. Hurt that I'll never be able to be myself again. Hurt that I cannot trust anyone. Hurt that I hate myself. Hurt that I may never be able to make friends again. Ashamed of myself to a degree where I struggle to look in the mirror.

But I am so incredibly lonely. I spend most days alone by myself and work from home. I practice and push myself in therapy week after week. I have nightmares most nights. I have flashbacks and high anxiety many times per week. And then I’m exhausted. All I want is to feel better. I am so tired. My spouse doesn’t have emotional space for me, and thanks okay I don’t blame her. She’s been through a lot. And I’ve put her through a lot. I miss the days when we knew each other.

I am working as hard as I can to live in a balanced way. To not let my emotions absorb me. To breathe and practice logical perspective. I pushed through the week. I grind at work. I try to be superdad. 

But now the week is over. And here I am alone at home. I long for someone to hold me and tell me that it’s going to be okay. That I’m loved. That I matter. Because I am so devoid of intimate connection with anyone. And I have been for a long time. The only person I feel truly sees me is my therapist, and I don’t even know this person.

Regardless how hard I tried in my younger years to be social and proactive I was always shut down or belittled quickly. Let's just say my school life was hell on earth, if only I had peace when I got home then just maybe I would of had atleast some joy in life. But unfortunately for me my father was abusive, verbally, physically and mentally bringing anyone home to that house was impossible. Eventually I got fed up of life and just existed for the sake of existing, I was once a bird that use to strive for friendship and communication regardless how badly I was treated or how often the world shut me down, I always kept at it. Well until I gave up that is its been so long since I cared about life, I went a very long time almost 12 years without really talking to anyone, being intimate or even going out to do something fun. It feels as if my only purpose in life is to consume air, food and drink and nothing else. But something happened for the first time I found happiness a dream came to me a mission a want, a desire, a need I had to accomplish, it did not help me socialy or change my life but atleast it gave me joy and a new zest for life it helped me look past my history and look to the future. A dream that could change everything and solve all my problems in life but as like always life was not kind and after 4 years if trying to make it happened I failed and life has gotten to the point where it's almost impossible to follow my dream. For the first time I had hope in my life, now it's gone. This caused me great emotional pain and brought me further into depression which caused me to shut my self out completely from society and I stop sleeping which nearly brought me to insanity well technically I did go insane for almost a week, I just woke up one morning and did not know who I was or if I was real or even how to do the most basic of things, my mind was shattered and broken, I'm better now atleast I'm able to some sleep which has helped my brain heal though as strange as it might be my  mind still feels different, like something has changed yet I cannot put my finger on it. Its terrifying not knowing what happened to your mind, and asking yourself daily if you are insane. All of these things make it hard to be part of this world, I don't know how to talk to people, it's freighting to have a conversation even though because how I was raised I'm pretty much not scared of anything except conversation lol. It's funny how terrifying just speaking words out loud can be, and speaking to women is even ten times harder, when I try it's seems like I'm doing it in anger and yet in reality it's just fear, I'm short with the opposite sex with out wanting to be, I seem mean we'll just wanting to be kind. I guess what I want most is to talk, socialize, love and be loved yet it seems an impossible task to achieve regardless how hard I try. I have forgotten how to be a human or speak out loud, in my heart and mind I'm a social butterfly who is kind and loving, yet on the outside I feel like a stone statue that will crumble at any given moment. Iv lived thousands of lives and stories in my head, iv had thousands of conversations as well yet so few in the real world. It's a strange feeling to finally wake up and realize you have been living a lie all this time or wondering If you really exsit. I feel like a doll that had yet to be brought to life. I tried to put my self out there today only to realize I have no idea how to speak outloud. I guess I'm just tired of being alone and felt like telling my story for the first time.

You can't talk about loneliness with therapists. They either don't care, don't understand, or dislike you for some reason. You try to reach out to people or groups who claim to be there for you but you find out loneliness doesn't exist to them. They don't care. In fact, sometimes they judge you and shame you.

On a different corner of the internet, I sell “girlfriend-esque” care packages to put it simply. And I keep it pretty separate from everything else I do online…. but some of you on here seem like you would (maybe?) benefit from it.
I send a “care package” with some perfumed clothing/home goods that you can place around your home… genuinely it helps so much to have a physical object near you when you’re feeling down and alone. Just a way to add that extra dopamine into your week. Hopefully this reaches someone who could benefit.
Feel free to message me about it. I don’t judge and I definitely understand the feeling of being desperate for a connection…

It didn't matter to me how I looked to other people as long as I could make them happy that's all that mattered to me, but as soon as I found myself alone and there were no eyes on me this person, this facade that I put on for the people around me I'm always immediately sent into despair. I've tried to change to become this second persona I have but somewhere deep down I believe that I'm undeserving of this happiness.

3254,Cataclyps,1652469759,1,"I know it's hard. It's hard on everyone. The problems don't end with loneliness sadly, they often begin with it, or is being caused by other problems. It's hard on everyone. On dudes, on girls. Some might think that dealing with loneliness is easier for women, because they have options and are less likely to get rejected all the time, but its equally hard on every end. 

Sadly loneliness cannot be solved, that desperate need for connection with someone, that desire to be loved, understood, desired and cared for.... Everyone wants that. Everyone wants something real deep down. 

You're also lonely, not because you're ugly, fat, shy etc... You're lonely, because you haven't got the courage to approach people. What if I told you something that you already know, that most people you pass by on the street are feeling the same way as you are. A couple of words could change both of your lifes. All it takes is a little courage, of course you'll be anxious, but tell yourself its excitment. 

It's much easier to talk to people than to sit alone in a dark room as you are coming closer and closer to the conclusion that you just want to end it. Because loneliness is at times unbearable. Combine it will everything else and it is literally too much to handle. So a breakdown is inevitable and if its one breakdown too many you might do something people around you will regret. 

Your life is precious. Sure its hard, but if you persist and try it wont be hard forever. You have to try.

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  
 

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**",lonely,Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts?,2022-05-14 05:12:48

It's not just seeing your foot pass the other, it's when you lift your head up and try to look around, you see all these faces. You try to think about what they feel at the moment; are they happy? sad? tired? anxious? losing hope? Who knows?

Maybe they're trying to think about how you feel? Or maybe no one cares?

What do you think about when you walk?

Is this the right way?

Am I answering questions with more questions?

The point is, do you ever stop walking? Or maybe even pause for a while and look around?

Do you know that feeling when everything just feels heavy and you just want to get somewhere else but you don't know where that place is so you just start walking around hoping you'll find it? It feels heavy because you'll end up feeling tired, your feet will eventually give up and you have no choice but to turn around and go back. 

But you see, you're not the only person who feels that way.

Maybe that old guy busking and singing ""Ticket to Ride"" by The Beatles feels that way too?

Maybe the children running around doesn't have a place to go?

We all hide what we feel.

But look around, try to feel and remember the sound, the look on people's faces, and even the smell of this moment. Maybe one day you'll look back, and maybe you're finally happy enough to realize that there actually were glimpses of beauty in there. Or maybe you'll still fall into pieces every time you think about it, and you might think again and again...

3268,itsrubyoklol,1652461543,1,so i used to be an extrovert but now ive changed alot. ive gotten quieter and sometimes distance myself from other people. this is why i think my friends are fake: theres a girls groupchat on snapchat and a lot of popular people are in it not me i know it sounds stupid but my girlfriend and my closest friends are in it and they havent thought of my my close friend said i was in it and i said thats weird what would we even talk about so maybe thats why im not in it i know im over exaggerating and maybe i should just ask to be in it. theres only to other popular girls i can think of that arent in it so that makes me feel a tiny bit better. i was kinda in a friendship group of five icluding myself and the four of them went to wagamamas and didint tell me one of my close friends asked if the other could come but not me and this was ages ago but it stuck with me and i had a breakdown in the bathroom after that. i feel so lonely. like they all say shitty things behind eachother back to me and i dont say anything i think they could be saying stuff about me aswell if they talk so badly about eachother and act like betfriends when they are close. my mental health is shit so i cant always be the outgoing person i used to be but im trying my hardest. none of them would wait for me to tie my shoes up or do my bag up and im the one who walks behind or on the grass. some of them whisper things to eachother and dont let me listen. they go to sleepovers plan and plan stuff without me. when im sitting next to them they laugh and have conversations without me. but one of them who talks bad about ALL of them to me asked to be my partner in pe the other day. shes fake i can tell. in the past she asked to be a duo but that bever happened she always used to come to me crying about one friend she talks bad about and they act like bestfriends i would always br there for her and stand up for her but she could never do that for me. when im wlaking with one of my friends and they see another one of their friends they walk of with them and forget about me. sometimes when i go to the bathroom to cry they come looking for me this happened once they didnt know i was crying i just said i was going to sleep in there. and another time one of them called me over. but i noticed whenever one of my friends gets ignored by the others  she comes to me and her second option to talk to. anyways let me know what you think. i never text any of them and have not got one of their numbers and have blocked three of them on whatsapp. i dont follow a few of them on tiktok of have their instas or snaps. only my gf tags me in tiktoks and snaps my sometimes we have nice coversations and they ask me to hang out with them. none of them are aware of my mental health problems becauss im scared of how theyll react or if they would even care. i self harm and they would probably make a joke. maybe im the problem so be honest if i am. im going to a knew school soon full of girls only.... i think i will struggle to make frieinds there but i will try hard.i want to leave all of them in the past then. also i was invited to one of their birthday in december just me and also in april just me again. i really needed to vent i think i might re read this to see what i think laying all the facts next to eachother.,lonely,are my friends fake?,2022-05-14 03:05:43

I figured since I promised myself I wouldn’t ever cut myself again that this would be a good coping mechanism. My thoughts feel so fucked up I wanted to see myself bleed and have my skin go red to show myself what a piece of shit I am, but the logical side of me hates that idea and I get freaked out for even thinking about it. I’m glad I didn’t hurt myself as much as the irrational side of me wanted to. I really don’t understand myself I love myself but also think I’m a worthless piece of shit.

3295,Just_Breezy_132,1652442539,1,"I,  with autism, ptsd, anxiety and depression, don’t think I no longer feel comfortable with the group I’m currently with. Perhaps I could’ve caused all this or it’s just tough luck for me since my history seems to be repeating itself, I just wish I was a senior so I can leave school. It’s been going on for too long I just don’t think my group is worth fighting for anymore.

-I’ll start with the recent person who’s just screwing up my life, let’s call him Nick. So Nick has always taken things too personally even when nobody had bad intentions. So Idk where it started but whenever anyone mentions Nick being single, he takes it way too personally. Not just that but one time a close friend called him Kiddo and he got offended because “he hated kids” or something like that. So one time we went to the extra mile, me and four others, including Nick and another person I’ll talk about here. So we went to get some Pizza Hut and I just goofed around and jokingly tell Nick that he looked hungry, I said that like three or four times but on the last time, he kept calling me a bitch even when I asked him not to and he said that he wished me and my (now ex) bf would break up, then right after he’s saying that I should defend myself but like why should I, he’s throwing all these insults at me and in the meantime, let’s call him Julius, was just sitting there doing nothing. Before that he was actually trying to bodyshame me but that never really got to me because I didn’t really care much about how my body is, but now I do. So I was at an urge of a panic attack so I had to leave, My two other friends were out of earshot so they never heard what he said. So there was this google doc us friends shared with each other and Nick was telling me to defend myself. So after that weekend we went to a teacher’s class in the morning and another friend said “if anyone needs me to kill anyone let me know” (we’re like a group of “band kids” who like a bit of dark humor) and Nick just straight up said “Kill Breezy for me” then that triggered a really bad panic and my other friend came to comfort me. So I replied to the google docs, and then he starts apologizing, saying he isn’t aware of what he says, then a week later I eventually forgived him after Julius invited him to help out at our work for something without thinking of what would happen. So like we have the same 6th period and it was probably shortly after we made up and then everything seemed fine then he was looking at some drawings through his Twitter account and there was this one drawing a two girls kissing this one dude and I thought it was his drawing and I was going to ask him something but I said that it was probably best I didn’t ask him because I had a feeling it would probably hurt him, then he starts insisting that I should ask him anyways and I told him no and he told me to do it. All I asked was “Are you lonely?” And idk what he said after but he was like you don’t know what’s it like to be single or something like that, he seemed pretty fine with it. So next morning, he started acting upset especially at me, my ex went to go talk to him, then at lunch my ex went up to me and said I told Nick something and that I should think before I speak, I DID, then he told me to apologize to him and I did through email. Honestly at this point I have a feeling this could be why he broke up with me, I’ve mentioned this in a post in another subreddit. Alright so maybe a couple days later, Nick replied exactly “…Just… Leave me… Alone…” and that’s where I see that this one friend who moved away was right, he’s an “anime protagonist” so I told him I will, and he replied say “then do it” I’ve always respected his space and all, then a week later, this dude has the audacity to send me the same email twice saying “btw, congratulations on becoming single, that’s karma. P.s. I still hate you.” Like I don’t get it, I’ve always respected him and gave him space, and this is what I get in return, it’s so ridiculous and immature, I ignored him anyway. Then week later at game club, he was there and I did my best not to cross paths with him but we were playing smash. Then after one of the rounds ended he said that I deserved death and that caused another panic attack and Eli had to comfort me. So I told the counselors about all this that has been happening. So nowadays this dude had the audacity to act like he never did anything wrong and acts all innocent, he avoids the group because I’m with them but I’ve been drifting away and then suddenly he comes back to them like he’s “stealing them” from me. Like it’s freaking redonculous, two of my friends seems to agree with me when I told them about this. And like he also said that he would leave me alone, he doesn’t respect my space even though I’ve respected his.

-another friend, Julius, I no longer feel comfortable getting close to or talking to because he put me in a choke hold once though he said “he forgot” and touched me a couple of times, not any private parts though one time when my ex and I are dating, he told my friend that if I accidentally touch his man boobs, my friend has permission to touch mine as “an eye for an eye”. He attempted to steal my from my ex. He makes decisions without thinking, like this one time he shared my google doc with someone who hated my guts, and Julius said that he did it because “he drank too much chocolate milk” as an excuse. And then there the whole situation with Nick and he just sat there as he was insulting me and he was aware of it. He would also tell my ex everything if I ever vent to him about my relationship. Not only that but he’s distracting during our work meetings “because of me” and I always have to look out for him and stop him from embarrassing not only himself but that’s on me since I told him about this job in the first place. 

- I’ll keep this one brief, there was this one dude who manipulated me and guilt trips me and acts like a victim and innocent, but he isn’t around that much anymore so that wouldn’t be much of a reason

-I don’t want to be rude to my group in any way but I have to bring it up to tell my story. So I would vent to them about these guys but they seem to treat them like nothing happened, like they never did anything to me. But that’s probably on me because I been burdening them with my problems from my past relationship and maybe they got tired of it. I mean I know they love me sure but I just feel like a burden being around. So I’ve decided to leave the group, I’ll keep in touch with most of them but I don’t think I belong there anymore.",lonely,Idk if I’m making the right choice,2022-05-13 21:48:59

3297,jetdarkstar,1652441385,1,"I’ve experienced about 7 years of adult life, and I haven’t had a relationship last longer than 4 months. I feel like I genuinely cannot find the right person for me, I’m not the right person for others, or those I’m actually destined to be with get pulled away from me. I recently feel like I met someone who was closest to being “the one” (needed to date longer to be able to firmly make that assumption, but it was the first time I felt like I was actually in love). They moved away. Since there were no other problems, no real break up, I have no closure. They still enter my mind multiple times a day and it’s been almost a year. I keep looking for someone else to try to move on and prove to myself that “the one” wasn’t the ONLY one, but I’m having such shit luck with dating that it’s hard to believe I have a chance. Everyone I meet is either a shitty person or I just can’t bring myself to like them even if they’re nice enough.

People keep telling me what I’m sure tons of people on this sub have said or heard at some point, “just spend some time being single! Focus on your self!” and all about the self-love crap. I’ll admit I need to spend some time on my self, but to be honest I don’t have any time or resources given stuff that’s going on in my life right now. All I want to hold me over is someone to be there. Someone to talk to everyday, to comfort me, especially physically. I’m so affection-deprived, it’s insane. Not just receiving, but especially giving. It’s like I have an overflow of love to give that it’s almost physically painful that I have nowhere to put it. Again, I enjoy alone time and caring about myself but I can’t hug myself, at least in a satisfying way. I can’t receive or give a hug to myself. It’s such an empty fucking feeling.

I (15) never really felt happiness or any joy in life, I thought it was normal for the longest time and I don’t remember the last time I actually felt anything. I know I haven’t been around long enough but still I just feel so empty.

I have a girlfriend and I got told all the time by old therapist’s that “Your not alone and that you have a gf so you cannot be lonely” which is such bullshit. I love my girlfriend but I just feel so disconnected from her, we’re polar opposites. She’s beautiful and social, I’m Average and Introverted. Everything I do always ends up hurting her. I can’t count how many times I’ve failed her as a boyfriend but she still loves me. I feel so lonely it’s like a vast emptiness in my heart. I’ve felt like this my whole life.

But what’s the point if the feelings aren’t accounted for?

Relationships, friendships are not healthy if they’re one sided. They don’t thrive when one person puts in the effort and the other person acts like it’s meaningless. 

Even I realize that I have some self-worth. 

I just wish I was worth someone’s time and didn’t always end up looking like the loser in the end. 

I know we’re all desperate for connecting with people here, but please, don’t make the mistake of giving someone your all when they don’t even recognize it. 

If it feels like you’re putting in too much effort to keep someone’s attention, there’s a good chance you are. 

It may seem like it, but you don’t have to give the first person who gives you a shred of attention your all, especially if it doesn’t feel right. Both sides of the relationship are supposed to be able to flourish.

I try to emulate other people's behavior in the rare instances I actually interact with someone for a sentence or two before I shut down entirely, but it fails every time, I can tell by the way people look at me. And initiating conversation? Approaching people? Forget about that, I get to the point where even my body physically tells me it's impossible and freezes up. The fact that my evolving social anxiety and numerous health issues kept me inside for a good 95 percent of the last six years certainly didn't do much for my social skills, and at this point I feel like an alien even just going out in public. Or an animal. Something less than the people around me.

Naturally, that fact just reinforces my reclusive behavior, and nothing changes, even though I really, REALLY want it to. As much as I used to try to delude myself into thinking I'd be okay with it, I don't want to die friendless, bitter and alone. And as of late, my health had been eroding my confidence in being able to ""deal with it in the future"" like I used to tell myself I would. But here I am, unable to fix it.

I have a work that I dont hate, savings, dreams and goals. I just cant seem to stop feeling like everything that I do is for nothing since I have dont have someone to share it all with.

When I was 24 I was quite content with my life as a single guy, never having had a lovelife before, I'd been infatuated, just never had an actual partner. Then I met this girl, who fell for me. I wasn't really interested to a start and kind of wanted to save her from who I was. After a few months I took her out on a date, got to know her over a while, and fell hard. In the end the pandemic happened and things went sideways for us. She awoke something in me, taught me what I truly wanted. A partner in life, someone to share all my daily struggles or wins with, holidays and vacations, start a family, build a dream with.   


Now its been almost a year since. And I cant shake this feeling of crippling loneliness. I cant even find a date and I cant either stop thinking that I wont find happiness in someone else, that I must learn to be content by myself, but I dont know how to feel like that anymore.

I did enough, I spend enough time

but the virtual world doesn't work as I want

all of them fake, all of them imaginary

today I made a decision

to stop my addiction to the fake world

it made me anxious, depressed, lonely

and I'm done enough with it

it's better I go

basically, it doesn't work

whether it's on games or discord or Reddit

it consumes time and kills it

but more than this it kills me

Couldn't see that I didn't get anything but misery

I'd be better if I was reading my books

Or singing to myself instead of waiting for people

But instead of it, I wanted to sing to the people

Who even doesn't want to listen to me

To some people, some stranger

Who is alone in her room

Drawing, painting, singing, creating

Happy... Truly happy...

Then, I spend days and even months without talking to anyone and when I have to, I almost have panick attacks.

Some weeks ago, I had to talk to a supermarket employee and I kept making eye contact with him, not knowing if it was appropriate or not, but I just couldn't stop looking into his eyes. I also didn't know how to keep a good posture, so I kept moving my legs and touching my face all the time while I talked to him. I guess he noticed because I felt he was a little uncomfortable. I had zero interested in him, I just didn't know how to act while I talked to him.

Besides, I lately have been avoiding listening to music that has lyrics. I just can't stand people talking near me anymore, not even if they are singing, so I just listen to instrumental music.

3381,benianse,1652401657,1,"I’m really worried. I got one out of curiosity just a week ago (didn’t make an account) just to see what the people were like there. Everyone was really intimidating and I couldn’t see myself fitting in at all with anyone, only just 1-2 people, and even then, I don’t know. I saw my therapist yesterday and she recommended I actually make an account and give it a shot.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. One day I’ll be head over heels for someone and then the next I forget why I even liked them in the first place. I’m not used to people liking me back and I think I get too scared and just flip a switch in my brain to run. I push people away so fast and it’s terrible.

And. I don’t have any fucking experience. It’s so humiliating. My longest relationship was maybe a week or two at most. I haven’t even kissed anyone, and I’m 21. I’m so fucking scared to admit this to anyone, because I’m not interesting, I’m barely keeping myself alive, and I’m so fucked up by anxiety and depression that I don’t even know if I’d be good or fair to them. I don’t want someone to like me and, even as much as I would want to, I couldn’t give them that in return. 

But the longer I keep waiting the worse it gets. But I’ve already waited so long that it’s nearly impossible.

I don’t know what to do. I’m freaking out. My therapist didn’t say I had to, obviously, but I just don’t know if anything will come out of this. I feel like I’m just going to hurt other people in an effort to fix myself. I don’t think that’s fair. Maybe I’m just doomed to be alone.

Another thing is I move around too much. I’ll be across the country for months at a time, but never a full year. I want something long lasting and I can’t do distance. But I can’t keep waiting longer. I’m losing my mind. It’s so fucking hard and I hate that my life is in this situation. I wish I wasn’t here.

Well since you are reading this post, and hopefully you have something positive to share, here is a what I’m hoping to achieve here! I’m hoping to befriend someone with good, lovely and positive vibes! Open minded, can converse well, and uphold a conversation for more than 5 minutes. Spontaneous, humble, intelligent, witty, and charming to some extent. Sass is fine too as long as it’s done right, haha. 
I am not going to be expecting much but please don’t be surprised if you find me not interested in anime, video/pc games, Pokémon, steaming, discccord,… 
Anyone different on here, more creative and interesting? Could be from anywhere in the world! Heck, I’ll even befriend someone from another universe… (hint: MOM reference), a friend is a friend, am I right? Don’t care about anything really, relationship status, married, engaged, taken, bf/gf, whatever your situation, as long as you can carry a decent conversation and don’t drag anyone down with that bad energy! 
Please, I mean seriously, don’t send anything silly like “ASL”, or “Sup”…. That’s just too lazy! Not trying to be mean, I promise. Im actually a really nice, humble guy:)

Hi guys, I’m 16 years old and recently got a job at a supermarket as a ‘stocker’ (as in stocking shelves). I literally hate it. I’m slow at it (barely make it in time or too late) and I keep getting criticised for it, that paired with my confidence issues isn’t really great.
Once I’m finished and go back home, I immediately start dreading the next time that I have to work again. A vicious cycle, it’s like my life now only revolves around it (which isn’t healthy). I feel like a moron cause no-one has any problems but me, everyone should be able to fill stocks(I feel like I’m a huge moron). My self-esteem has been crushed because of this. I’ll probably get fired too or get relieved from the contract once the 6 months have passed. This paired with my loneliness just wrecks me. I had a friend whom I played games with everyone now and then. Turns out he only plays with me when he’s bored and just ignores and lies to me.

I've never really talked about my emotions like this so i don't really know what to expect but i feel like i really need this.

So i'm a male 18yo now and i've been feeling lonely for a while now and i mean really lonely. I've never had a girlfriend and only had one close friend i could talk to about myself that i lost contact with and don't talk to much. Recently one of my classmates introduced me to  her friend and has been saying we would be a perfect couple for a while. I was happy because when we stared talking we would talk for hours, say good night to each other and overall i felt really good talking to her, my classmate was also telling me she really liked me but is scared to tell me that.

After a while we started to talk more about emotions and our feelings, she recently lost her mom and was really broken, i tried my best helping her but i'm not sure if i did a good job. After a few days of talking came a day i felt really tired and started telling her about my dad that passed away a while back and how i felt about my life, at first she was really supportive and i felt great knowing i can talk to someone about that stuff. After a while we went to the cinema with 3 more of our friends.
I felt like it was the best day of my life, the movie wasn't all that great, however i was sitting right next to her, a girl behind her was kicking her seat so i asked her to switch so she could have a better time, after about 30min i noticed she kept looking at me, I asked her if she needs anything and she just put her head on my shoulder, we sat like this for the rest of the movie.
I felt happy, like truly happy, for the first time in like 6 years i felt truly happy, for the last two weeks i've thaught of that moment of happiness every single day

But then a few days passed and i felt sad and tired again. I felt like She was the only person i could talk to about it and so i tried, however all i got in response was that i was annoying. I felt really bad about it and tried to not talk so much about myself anymore to stop annoying her but it didn't really change anything, she took way longer to reply to me even tho i saw her being online, she overall stopped caring about me as much as she did and it really hurts to not have anyone to talk to again.

I feel like this week was the hardest time i've ever had, I feel like no one cares about me, i feel tired even tho i try sleeping longer, i have no one to talk to, and overall feel really lonely.

We either have to keep our self respect rules strict and show zero weakness to anyone and feel lonely inside,

Or we try to interact with people, show all our love to people maybe we will receive love, maybe not.

Showing someone attention is a risky investment. If your investment fails, you will lose some of your capital (self respect).
Keeping your self respect rules strict is not that easy. You will get respect from people. It will take time. You will witness people that will invest in you for your attention. They will talk to you. It will be up to you to respond to these investments. But you need to be patient and emotionally strong until you start getting attention.

Other option sounds easy, but it is like spending your savings. People can smell neediness so easily. Trading your credits for some smile until it depletes. When you don't have anymore credits people will ignore you. Your social status decreases. 

Conclusion
I know this sounds so materialistic. But these are my observations. We can't beat loneliness by trying to find new friends. We need to change how we interact with people. We need to spend time with ourselves for some time. Percieved social status has so much importance and it is all connected with loneliness.",lonely,Loneliness is the price we pay for respect.,2022-05-13 04:43:28

3443,slowsinkingfeeling,1652375705,1,"I was fortune enough to be so mentally ill that my uni gave me free therapy. With how many times I heard about therapy being some sort of wizardry that would improve my life, I decided to try it out. Here’s some anecdotes from my experience:

Therapist believed in pseudoscience like MBTI personality types. She would spend up to 15 minutes of our session reading articles from the internet about this to me, ignoring all I’ve said about what I thought my problems were.

I have severe body image issues. She said looks don’t matter. I know that but developed eating disorders and obsessive compulsions with fitness and fashion to compensate for my terrible personality. She hand waved that away with a “just keep improving yourself”.

Most of the sessions consisted of me talking and her agreeing. For example: “I have plenty of friends but feel alone because of trust issues, anxiety, and inability to form deep relationships”. “Yeah, people can be shallow sometimes, now tell me more about your family”.

When I told her how hard it is for me to enter a romantic relationship she went on a tangent how she felt alone until she met her soulmate, now husband. “I really hope you find someone too.”

She would make me fill out progress reports to check if I’m improving. She then forgets she assigned these and acted surprised on our last session that my mental health got even worse.

Did anyone else have a similar experience with therapy? And don’t tell me to get another therapist or get on medication, I’m already broke and US healthcare is a fucking joke.",lonely,Therapy is a scam.,2022-05-13 03:15:05

Laying here with you

You caught me with a blindside

Made me believe it’s true

Please stay here by my side

If love could last a lifetime

I’d spend it all with you

Temptations taught and true

I give in for the moment

By morning we’ll be through

Tangible in its youth

My love don’t leave me barren

I long to come find you

My gun sits loaded and ready

My escape from this troubled world

Metallic tastes when I spiral

No courage to pull through

I commend you for your actions

The stars the sun and moon

I tremble in my boots

I fear that you’ll resent me

I get lost when I’m with you

And there I find the truth

Adore the spark in you

3467,Ok-Assistant169,1652356288,1,"Hi all,

Sorry for the long and ranty post. Summer is around the corner, and although I (35m) have got a full-time job and a girlfriend, I am starting to feel lonely. In a way, I am even feeling guilty for feeling lonely. My fully remote job does not bring many interactions, and my girlfriend always seems busy. Her schedule is always full, and she is often working extra hours. For some reason, new things keep popping up, and she has to resolve those issues. I have got to give it to her, she is in a leadership role, so I guess being involved is fair. It is just that I feel like the household tasks are left for me to resolve, and this contributes to my loneliness. We should be a team, and I am also working a full-time job. I am not in the office, but that does not make my job less important. She says she is sorry for leaving all the tasks up to me, but her apologies feel empty. If you are truly sorry, you will try to make things better.

Another annoyance is that I'm always working from the sofa. We own a pretty small home, and my girlfriend claimed our home office. She needs a professional and quiet place for all the (private) videoconferences she has to make. Even when she is in the office, I will be on the sofa to care for our pets. I do the daily walks with the dog. I watch our chickens and make sure they do not fall prey.

Furthermore, I realized I was lonely when we went to throw a party, and I did not know whom to invite. My girlfriend had invited 30+ people, and I only invited my brother. I've had some high school friends up to 15-years ago, but they are no longer friends due to mental health problems. I'm not very confident, and chatting with strangers is not my idea of fun, and I am not even sure I am capable of it. Also, I'm an introvert with (I believe) a big heart, but maintaining relationships is not one of my strong points. Of course, there is a want, but I have no clue where and how to meet new people (friends).

I know I should probably snap out of this victim role and take control of my life instead of having things happen to me. The problem is that I don't know how and where to start. The post is probably more a rant than allowing myself to receive help, but I just wanted to get this off my heart.

3471,skyblueleaves,1652349817,1,"Sorry if I’m ruminating, but I’ve been feeling pretty pathetic lately. I graduated college last year and had to take my last year off and return to my parents house due to the pandemic. I’ve always been really introverted my whole life and through my first 3 years of college, and was doing pretty well with self improvement and social workshops on campus and just being more social whilst trying to make some friends and memories on campus. 

COVID pretty much changed all of that, and made everything remote, so I wasn’t able to do what I wanted with the people at school since everyone had to return back to where they came from, and I’ve accepted that it’s never going to be the same anymore. I’m already not the greatest at maintaining friendships, and having that interruption was a really hard moment in my life. I feel really sad and dejected about some of the friendships I’ve lost with people who I felt like I was on great terms with before I left school. I also really was wanting a significant other, or just a friend to talk to . I 

I tried reconnecting with an acquaintance that I did a project with for one of my classes, I followed her for a few weeks and at least she had followed back, so I liked a few of her photos and sent her a message (idealizing a relationship like the sad pathetic wretch I am), and was just stalking her page for weeks. She hadn’t even opened my message, so l liked some more photos like the genius I am, and lo and behold she blocked me. I feel pretty pathetic for swooning over all her travel pictures and pretty photos of her. I shouldn’t have pushed those boundaries and I should’nt have liked her photos to begin with. What the fuck is wrong with me. Now I’m sure she thinks I’m a creep, and we were on normal terms before I even followed her. Every single girl I see I imagine a life and kids with her and I wish I could just stop and be a normal guy with normal thoughts who wasn’t so sensitive to everything

I told him that this makes me feel forgotten about and I’ve talked to so many guys who have done the same before him and everything just fizzled out. I am so tired of this happening, getting invested and then ditched. Due to my bad track record with dating guys I’ve learned to talk to a person but sorta be standoffish until I’m sure we’re gonna move to the next step. I told him so much about me and he made me feel happy again. I just hate that this is how my love life goes… even when I take measures not to dive heart first into situations, I still hurt In the end. He sent me a text telling me “if you have faith in us you would get used to me not being around that much”. This sounds like a red flag to me…. I guess I know I should just cut all contact but I don’t want to be alone again… there’s no feeling I hate more. Either way: with or without I feel crummy. Why is it so hard for us to leave bad situations alone? 

Have you gone through something similar? What helped you break away from not letting go of someone who doesn’t treat you as you need?",lonely,What do you think?,2022-05-12 13:27:18
3507,LilBeaverMaster,1652325949,1,"Being lonely obviously takes a hefty mental toll on people, but damn even expecting the emotions doesn't help and the physical loss is just as bad as the mental trouble. Often I feel like I imagine fake scenarios and think too much into stuff just to make myself feel better. There's a girl in my 6th period and she's nice and pretty cute, but even if I asked her out it would be kinda pointless for a couple reasons, like how she's graduating and I'm not. Although I'm pretty sure she likes me, just based on how often I catch her staring and stuff, and even today she went completely out of her way just to talk to me for a minute and she had to sprint off for class. But I think being lonely might be causing me to look too far into it and see things that aren't there and that she's probably just being nice and friendly and that I'm just desperate. 

Am I dumb? Am I overthinking about my overthinking? Does she like me? Idk more of a rant about how tired and confused I am and about how loneliness is effecting my mental health and physical friendships. Any advice on how to overcome this or even any answers to my other questions would be appreciated.",lonely,Driving myself nuts,2022-05-12 13:25:49

I didnt lose these people because of disputes or anything like that, they all just went their own way  whilst I left my self on this lonely path.

I hate parties and thats what feels like everyone want to do but I see 0 enjoyment out of it. A small group of close friends is prefect for me but I can get their without friends themselves.

I have been feeling lonely since I gave birth almost 5 months and a half ago.The delivery busted me up and due to a misunderstandings and events that happened during my stay at the hospital, the staff called youth protection on me and took my baby away from me before I even leaved the hospital thinking I am a “risk of neglect” to my son instead of sitting down with me and help me with the killer migraines and give me services as a first time single parent.I have been fighting to get him back but the judge never heard my testimony and placed my son in foster care until August so that I can work on my parenting skills,support network and anxiety. Since then, my parenting skills have improved, my support network has been pretty solid enough and I am seeing a therapist and take anxiety pills.

I tried to distract myself during my parental leave with projects like renovations and gardening etc. But on the days where I can relax and get high, I get horny and lonely.Im not ugly at least to me,I have a large house and my dream cars etc but I have no one to share that with.My “maternal instincts” are kicking me in the ass and have no one to care for to fill that void in my heart that youth protection did to me.My mother is in Ontario taking care of my grandma, my son is in foster care 54km away from my house until August hopefully and my friend I used to spend a lot of time before my pregnancy has recently been diagnosed with a genetic muscle dystrophy disease that prevent him from coming over to my place due to stairs and they are so busy with appointments.

i hoped it would help me forget bad memories, but that’s the one thing it hasn’t done. i feel numb but then i remember everything. i have to live in this fucking house with the man that’s been abusing me for years while my mom turns a blind eye. but you have to live the life of your dreams at some price, right? i guess her price was me. because while i’m smoking and drinking all the time to make myself forget what he’s doing almost every day, she’s shopping for herself and my siblings and pretending i dont exist. i feel like they think i’m a figment of their imagination. i’m not real to them. to her, i’m cash in her pocket and to him i’m just someone he can use when moms not home. i don’t want to die but i don’t want to be here and i don’t know how to get away",lonely,i’m not real to them,2022-05-12 09:10:21

I rarely reach out to people because I felt we didn’t click but also I noticed no one has ever reached out to me.

3544,Service_Anxious,1652307198,1,"This is kind of a continuation from my last 2 posts. To sum it up my closest and favorite friend I’ve ever had slowly stopped talking to me, then a couple weeks ago said that she does not feel a connection anymore. I understood because I know where she was coming from and that the feeling cannot be helped and the friendship can’t be restored once you’ve moved past it. I think that’s what hurts the most, understanding losing feelings for someone randomly. I really miss her, more than I’ve ever missed anyone before and the feeling isn’t going away. Each day I miss her more and everything reminds me of her, I can’t listen to songs we used to and when I go past places we’ve been I remember all the good times we had. I really thought I meant something more to her, I thought our friendship wasn’t a phase and that we had a real bond. Knowing our entire friendship meant nothing in the long run hurts mentally more than anything I’ve ever experienced. I thought I’d be over it by now (it’s been like 2 months since I started feeling a drift) but I’m not. I’ve even had dreams of being with her again and even the littlest things remind me of what we had. I want to be friends again so bad, more than I’ve wanted anything. I don’t think I’ll ever meet someone I love that much again or that I’ve felt that happy with. If I get another friend one day I want them to be exactly like her, I want them to be her, I don’t want anyone else. It hurts that I was just a phase a romanticization. It hurts knowing that she most likely doesn’t have a passing thought about me and has moved on entirely. She was pretty much my life and the closest I’ve felt to love for anyone. I used to unknowingly smile when I thought of the stuff we did or talked about and we used to laugh until we cried. I’ve never felt this lonely and I have no one else to talk to about this, no one seems to compare to her.

“Being vulnerable is actually a strength and not a weakness — that’s why more and more mental health is such an important thing to talk about. It’s the same as being physically sick. And when you keep all those things inside, when you bottle them up, it makes you ill.”
– Cara Delevingne

How to cope with loneliness 

1. Try to do some enjoyable things that will keep you busy 

One way of trying to manage loneliness is by keeping busy and doing things we enjoy. This might be a hobby such as a bit of gardening, going to the gym or even sorting out your kitchen cupboards, jigsaws, puzzles or knitting. Small activities can give you energy and positive feelings. It’s important these things are fun or fulfilling.
Be careful about working too hard or watching TV shows simply as a distraction. These will only delay or suppress your feelings and could actually make your mental health worse.

2. Try to do things that stimulate your mind 

Activities that occupy your mind can help with loneliness. This can include the  benefits of taking courses or listening to podcasts on topics from comedy to fitness. This can be stimulating and something as simple as listening to the familiar voice of someone you like can help you feel less lonely.

3. Think about doing a physical activity 

Physical exercise can help with loneliness. It can be as simple as having a walk in the park when you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed. Alternatively, you could listen to music and do a bit of dancing around your living room. (Be aware of your neighbours though!) 

4. Try to engage with the people you meet in your daily life. 

It can be hard to talk to others when you’re feeling lonely. However, trying to connect with the people you meet as you go about your day can be helpful. Even catching someone’s eye and saying “hi” as you walk along can make you feel better. Or it could be about saying hello to the postwomen or postman or going to the shops and talking to the person at the checkout. By sharing a polite greeting – you might find you give someone else a positive lift too.

5. Find people that ‘get you’ 

It can be hard to connect with others when you’re feeling lonely. But there are great benefits in finding people who have been through similar experiences to you. Interacting with others that ‘get’ you can give you a sense of belonging that may be missing. People who have been there have found connections in local groups or social media.

6. Spend time with pets 

If you are lucky enough to have a pet, it can be a great way of managing loneliness. Not only do animals provide us with unconditional love and support, but they also help to give structure to our days and even encourage us to get out and connect with others. Interaction with pets is also shown to help reduce stress levels.

7. Try to use social media in a positive way 

Social media can help your mental health. But it can also affect it negatively. The key is to use it in a positive way. Finding digital  communities, you share interests and passions with can help. Most importantly be aware of how you feel when you use social media and focus on topics and activities that work best for you.

8. Talking therapies can help 

Talking through your feelings with a counsellor or therapist can help you cope with your feelings of loneliness. Talking therapy can be hard to get – but if you can find a professional, it can really be of benefit. It’ll provide you with a safe space to work through your feelings and thoughts without judgement. 



How to support other people who are feeling lonely

1. Don’t judge or stigmatise

It’s important not to judge or stigmatise people who feel lonely. Stigma around loneliness is a huge barrier to the kind of open and genuine conversations that can help. It’s more important to be aware of just how common loneliness is. It’s a normal feeling that all of us are likely to experience at some time in our lives. Telling other people that their poor mental health is the reason why they are feeling lonely is really not helpful.

2. Try to make groups welcoming to other people

It can be difficult for people who are feeling lonely to join a group like a club. This might be because people are shy or feel nervous about existing relationships in the group which they don’t feel part of. It’s important to be aware of this and try to make groups be as welcoming as possible to newcomers. Flexibility around things like how often people attend is also important.

3. Try to listen and show understanding

A great way to help a friend or family member is simply to listen. People who have experienced loneliness relate how they valued friends who really considered what they might enjoy and were even willing to join them in some shared activities. Having an understanding and compassionate approach, and not ignoring the person’s experience, will help them to feel heard and understood.

If you want to see more of these advices there's more here: https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/mental-health-awareness-week


I found this site below quite helpful as well, you can see loads of more information and even support:
https://www.mind.org.uk/get-involved/mental-health-awareness-week/#info

There's a suicidal training I've done in class today that gives us more insight and information about how we can help and support these people.
That's the link:
https://zsa.frank-cdn.uk/scorm/full-training/story.html

If I learnt something I'd say it's that you don't need to keep all to yourself, open up about your feelings.
You'll feel more relieved and less overwhelmed after doing so.

If you ever spot on someone that has been showing concerning signs, no need to beat around the bush out of fear of saying the word 'suicide'. 
Simply ask ""Are you feeling suicidal?""
According to the training once you say it you show that you're open minded enough not to judge this person, thus making them open up more.

Well, there's a lot more actually....
If you're interested, take part in the short training by clicking on the last link I've typed. 

Hope y'all have a lovely week and that these links may be helpful for someone. :)",lonely,Mental Health Awareness Week 2022 - Theme: Loneliness,2022-05-12 07:23:33

3566,ThatMysteriousDude2,1652291649,1,"I'm a 23 yr old and it's been 7 years of loneliness for me and here are the reasons that caused it:
1. I listened to society and thought that money was everything.
2. Because of point 1 I stopped socialising much and focused on how to get rich.
3. Realised that it wasn't in my fate because all the ways I kept trying went against me. Incurred losses.
4. Above points made me more of a pessimist and anti-social. People found me to be uninteresting.
5. Now I want to change, but I have lost the ability to make conversation and I'm socially awkward.

Changes observed:
1. Initially it was comfortable and peaceful when I was full of hope. When all plans were shattered, I became depressed.
2. Cried myself to sleep for maybe 3 years straight.
3. Motivated myself to try and change. Tried socialising but I had already lost the skill. Nobody found me interesting, nobody wanted to hangout with me.
4. Back to crying myself to sleep for an entire year.
5. The phase of acceptance. I don't have a proper mood anymore. I put on a poker face at all situations now whether it's the boss making a joke or watching an emotional movie, etc. I don't remember the last time I laughed my heart out. Nothing seems funny anymore, nothing seems sad as well. Thoughts about looking after myself all alone in old age keep coming in my head.
6. I had one crush in school, to whom I never confessed my feelings. Since then I haven't felt the same towards any other person although I keep passing by a ton of them everyday at work and in the gym. Looks like I have become completely desensitised.

Luckily I am able to have somewhat friendships with my coworkers. 

But Not too long ago. The friend I Had somewhat of a decent relationship with, asked me to go play pool. I feel it is like getting tradition at this point to catch up almost every year at this point.

Everyone just tells me I'm fine, but to stop looking for someone and to just focus on myself and to just go and keep going to a psychotherapist, and that's fine, I suppose I do need help, but I just feeel incredibly lonely and I'm so damn tired that I just can't have someone that likes me.

And I stopped looking for a long while. I tried focusing on myself, it seemed to get better, I actually found someone I really liked, by chance, online. 

We just hanged out etc, played games online most of the days etc, and she's lonely too, but she does not wanna start a relationship more than friendship cause of the distance. I understand, it can hurt and just be awful to not be able to be close. But my heart is just tired.. The one person I click with, and that is genuinely nice and honest, is unreachable, and I can't get a chance. I'm just losing it, I just give up at this point. 

I know I might be unreasonable, but I just feel purely like shit, like noone likes me more than friends, sometimes I just wish I wasn't born as a guy,feeling so undesired, or just born period. Life just feels so pointless, the hobbies I got are gaming and cars, gaming is getting boring, and fun cars I like are just too expensive... And they get more expensive. And everthing else does too, making saving for one so hard..I just go to work and hoping for things will never happen.....life seems like repeat and just pointless and lonely.Especially when noone wants to actually be with me. 

At this point I am desperate for something shallow even, with any girl, just to feel wanted and to fill that hole in my heart a little...and I know that is probably wrong way to think... But I just don't know how to feel anymore, I just want some love, or excitement I guess. And I feeel like it makes me a bad person. But I can't shake it off either. I'm just tired. 

I'm sorry for the long rant, and I don't expect many will read this or care, but I just wanted to get it off my chest...",lonely,"(M28)I'm tired of everyting, and being alone and feeling so unwanted.",2022-05-11 23:59:44

I cant take it no more and I'm at my limit. I have been mentally abused since I was a little child all the way until uni, people would insult my physical appereance and all sorts of things and I can't seem to let go no matter how hard I try.

 I have gotten an uneeded obsession of going to the gym and look attractive now, but my mind is still damaged Maybe I'm  way to sensitive.. but I feel as though if everything could just end I'll be way happier. I have a constant stream of sadness that can never be addressed.

This feeling of loveliness, its as if I already know how everything will end up when I meet new people, so I just end up not talking to people and just avoiding them. When people try to be friends I push them aside by avoiding them... Even though I don't mean to.

Constantly ignored at my new work place, as if I don't exist, so why should I even bother...

over  the years any irl friends i have had have naturally drifted apart due  to me not growing up and staying inside. For many years i had internet  friends who were part of my life even tho i didnt see them i'd  occasional chat to them which kinda felt like small version of a social  life. But slowly in the last few years ive ended up with none mainly due  to me burrowing into a hole and not responding for weeks or months.

Also  in the past few years ive lost both my grandparents making my family  smaller. i dont see my siblings due to them living far away and having  actual lives with a family .only family member i see routinely is my mum  (my dad died when i was 19 and i havent seen my dads side of the family  since 2010)

Now alot of that  stuff i've typed i had become kinda numb too. the losing both irl and  internet friends, family members dying, not havin a life etc. But coming  off my meds have made all those years of life problems come crashing  down to the point that i realise i have no future and any hope ive had  ive let fade away.

my mum wont be  here forever and i have no independence. I havent made my own family  like my siblings have so when my mum dies i'm on my own and i wont be  able to cope. I feel hopeless, lonely and keep crying thinking about my  life and how much ive wasted and ruined. I'm not sure if i could kill  myself but if anything happened to my mum (shes not ill but anyone can  die suddenly in their mid 50's)  especially with how my life is now  i'd  be on my own and i think that would be the end of me 100%.

3614,Trick_Software_1520,1652258296,1,"I am so tired. Every day I am finding it hard to find a reason to keep going forward. I feel ugly, unhealthy, and generally a failure. 

I'm a 17-year-old female about to go to college. My face is full of acne and my family doesn't skip a beat to butcher me about it as if I don't see my face every morning. I've tried so many times to use products on my face but nothing worked so I am letting nature do its work. My mom is so strict to the point that she doesn't let me go out anywhere and it's depressing because I want to spend time with my friends before they move away for college but my mom won't budge. I've missed so many opportunities because of my mom's strictness and it's so sad to the point that I just gave up. I stopped asking her if I could go anywhere or if I could go to a school event or something that involves me going anywhere except the house. I'm at home all day forced to do chores and usually, I don't mind cleaning the whole house because it can be relaxing but none of my siblings even tries to help me so my family already expects me to clean up all the time which can be too much sometimes. I get depressed at the fact that my friends are out there having fun while I'm stuck at home. The only thing I can take control of in my life is my school work, I try my best to keep my straight A's and be a good officer in my after-school clubs. I've dedicated myself to school so much that tests have given me really bad anxiety. I barely eat until I finish my work, my sleeping schedule is messed up because of the amount of work I have, and I barely get any exercise. I'm literally so skinny and malnourished that I'm afraid that I might have anorexia at this point. But my mom doesn't even recognize my efforts, she thinks that it doesn't matter if I'm book smart when I don't even know or if I'm dumb when it comes to real-life situations. Yeah, I don't even know anymore. When college applications were happening, I couldn't even be bothered, I was too indecisive and unconfident about my skills that I didn't even try to apply for scholarships or to any colleges that I wanted. Now that my graduation is a month away, I ultimately felt like a failure before even starting. I see my friends getting accepted to colleges outside the state which made me envious that they get to leave. I'm sticking with community college which I don't mind but I don't want to stay home. My older sibling yells at me for not applying or even practicing my code programming skills. I don't feel competent enough to enter the adult world and I'm afraid that what my mom said about me is starting to be true. 

I am so tired, I haven't cleaned my room for weeks, my laundry is piled up, and I'm not taking care of myself properly. It's disgusting but I don't wash my hair for a few days and I don't brush my teeth at night. I of course still shower my body and brush my teeth in the morning before going to school. I stopped doing my skincare. I am an ultimate mess. I want to cry so bad but I feel like I don't deserve it because I did this to myself, I should have pushed through and tried my best to stay on top but it's so hard to keep my energy at 100% every time. The only thing I'm looking forward to now is getting my driver's license which I'm nervous about. I feel like if I just succeed at least at one thing I would feel more self-assured.

It's frustrating. I'm so sad that it's very tiring. I just want to fast forward life right now and go to the good parts. Luckily my friends at school give me good laughs and a break from everything.

The thing is though, I don’t really enjoy them as much anymore. I like my family, but being with them in the car for like up to 3 weeks is just unbearable sometimes, and honestly a bit boring at times. So this year I thought of how much more enjoyable it would be if I brought someone with me, like a friend - or in this case my boyfriend. But as I said earlier, this is a FAMILY thing. So I’m not sure how to convince my dad. I’m also a bit scared of hurting his feelings, by saying I don’t think the road trips are fun or something.

3639,DueDragonfruit2025,1652241662,1,"TL;DR: Wake up, snooze. Wake up, go to work. Pay taxes, pay rent. Count pennies, stare at screens to escape reality. Cry on Reddit because you have nobody else, go to sleep. Repeat.

I don't even know why I'm writing this tbh. Was looking for painless ways to die and came across this subreddit, figured I might as well rant here since I have nobody I can really openly talk to about this topic.

I'll be graduating college soon in August after I finish out my minor. Only 3 years +2 summers for everything, with a full ride scholarship. It just makes me that much more ungrateful for even having thoughts about ending everything immediately after.

I have no direction from here. I spent the past half year trying to develop a business to provide some benefit to the world, but turns out the startup cost was way too high to really take the extreme risk. But fuck everything is more expensive these days. I spend my days working as a cog for Amazon, and with the hours they've been giving me, everything goes to rent gas and whatever other necessities.

My lease is up soon and new management will be increasing rent by $50 a month if I stay. Yay. More things I can't afford. The apartment isn't even that good, 550 sq feet and a studio apartment pretending to be a 1 bedroom. People yelling and ambulances going by every day. I'm just selling my soul to whatever work place so I can barely scrape by and live in a place I hate. 

The only thing I enjoy is playing games, escaping reality, but the more I play the more time is wasted and the more things pile up on the to do list. All I ever do is the to do list. I hate going out, my anxiety makes almost any social experience unenjoyable even if I put on a good outward experience. Combine that with no energy to ever do anything, it feels like I'm just dragging this chain and ball so that I can feed into the tax and corporate machines.

Hell, when I was exploring ways to die painlessly I was getting targeted ads for it. ""Need something to lift your spirits?"" Buy our product/service now! Hilarious.

The only time I've ever felt truly happy was on MDMA. Maybe occasionally on psychedelics too, but those are a wild card. I haven't done anything in a while because of time constraints and drug testing, but fuck for years the only thing I looked forward to was my semiannual Molly roll. 

I moved to the city I'm in now from a rural area for college, but I really made no friends in college. A few acquaintances, but nothing like I expected. Never got invited to any parties. Though I've learned to just blame the pandemic for that, even though it's definitely not the entire reason.

Of course, like anyone ever, I'd love to share real love with someone. Every relationship I've had I have had fleeting feelings, I always grew to find my partner more annoying. Maybe it's the people I was with, maybe it's me. 

I hate being a man sometimes, what I would give to have someone - anyone show interest first. If I even want a shot at feeling that way with someone, I have to initiate the idea. That means being rejected time and time again, and it's not like I'm unattractive, I've just always been the odd one and I think people pick up on that.

I think the only reason I'm still alive now is because of the unbearable pain my death would have on my mom. Everyone else would get over it eventually, but not her. Why does it seem that the only way I can find peace is by hurting who loves me most? You also can't shake the thought that you'll go to hell just for trying to escape it. Wouldn't that be funny if I left and ended up right back here.

Don't know what I'm expecting for posting this, but if you're reading this then thank you. It makes me feel like I exist, even if only through some text on a screen.",lonely,idek,2022-05-11 14:01:02

3643,PayWhich,1652240981,1,"this is going to be a long rant. but i have absolutely no one to talk to.

over the course of high school, my friend group would purposely exclude me from events/hang outs, and i even got verbal proof from someone in the group that they were doing so. they were the only people i had to interact with so i clung on to what interaction i could get from them. i’m not sure why they didn’t like me and yet insisted to keep me around. i dropped out sophomore year because of covid and have found a full time job and not returned to school since. i rejected this group of friends and have had no friends since. now, up until 3 months ago, i was in a relationship and just spent all my time with my boyfriend of three years. well, three months ago, he broke up with me for another girl. now here i am, no boyfriend, no friends. at least i have my 50 hour a week job, right? well, there was this one guy i was talking to, and we immediately clicked. we hung out at least once a week and quickly got physical. i then find out he has a girlfriend. i told her about a week ago that he had been cheating on her for the past three months and things were very ugly. he blocked me and we havent spoke since. he became my best friend in such a short time and now hes gone. the only person I have in my life (quite literally the only one besides my dad) that i am ""friends"" with is a guy at my work that I have also been having sex with for the past three months. i was whoring myself out to two guys at the same time to stave off the crippling loneliness of the fact that I desperately crave a relationship. neither of them want(ed) a relationship with me. now, the only person I have left in my life to talk to, is the guy at work that i fuck. and he doesn't want to talk to me unless it's to meet up to fuck, so we're not even really friends, and i can't talk to him about anything. he won't even return my texts, he acts like he's too cool to respond to me unless he wants sex. aside from the once a week sexual interaction i get with this man, i am completely alone. i have no friends, and i desperately crave a partner. it eats me up inside every single day. the only thing i can ever think about is how no one wants to be my friend and no one wants to date me. I'm trying to lose weight currently because maybe if I'm skinny a man will like me. i'm not going to toot my own horn, but i believe in all honesty that i am attractive. so i don't really understand why no one wants a relationship with me. i do understand that a lot of the men I was making myself available to were not available themselves, and i take full fault for that. i can't tell at this point if there's something wrong with me, and that's why no man in my life will date me, or if for some reason all of the men ive had in my life don't want a relationship. I know that I am young, but I truly believe that I cannot find love. i see all these happy couples together and I just don't understand why not a single man out there wants me for me and not just for sex. i feel so worthless. i am constantly worried about my appearance in the hopes that a man will like me. i’m not openly desperate, me making this comment on this sub is quite literally the only piece of evidence as to how incredibly lonely i am. but i would almost say yes to anyone that asked me to go on a date with them at this point. why doesn’t anyone want me.",lonely,extreme loneliness and low self esteem (18F),2022-05-11 13:49:41

So I'm not really sure how to describe my social life. I have a small group of actual friends, like 4 or 5 people, but have quite a few people I'm more like associates with? Idk how to explain it. But recently, as in last Friday, had a falling out with one of my actual friends. There was a lot of drama and it hurt but I'm not one to drag shit out and there a few years younger so it's for the best anyways I think. The issue is they act normal with my other friends, the ones they're friends with at least, and leave when I'm around(which is mostly aggravating just bc they're the one that caused the falling out I just accepted that they didn't want to be friends anymore). Because I don't want the falling out to effect my other friends, I just stay away completely and let the 3 or 4 hang out while I do my own thing. I've essentially just allowed the falling out with one friend, that wasn't my fault, to make it to where I can't hang out with my other friends. I haven't explained the drama to the other friends, just felt it was the best, and am probably just gonna slowly lose those friends as the year ends.

This was mostly a rant but I mean is it dumb of me to leave them alone to not effect my other friends relationships with the one friend?

I couldn't find ways to convey my pain properly to the people around me. I tried to forget about the pain through fiction, but newer tragedies felt tame and pointless due to my familiarity with the darkness of ordinary people (who do bad things and get away with it due to hiding behind popularity though sarcasm and wit), and witty, snarky comedies felt even more pointless because I learned that most people joke about problems instead of fighting them head on.

I was in the dark for a very long time, but I stumbled upon Kingdom Hearts on PC and it somehow brought the light back into my life.

Through a combination of sympathetic characters, an ordinary, kind-hearted protagonist that anyone could to relate to, and a series of situations so absurd that there was no reason to not take them at face value...

physically incapable of building friendships with others.

I'll make small talk with people in class occasionally, and I'll joke around in class with people. But that's really about it. There's only two people who consider me to be their friend and who I ever hang out with outside of school. I'm good friends with them but to be honest it doesn't feel like I have stuff in common with them. Like we're friends by default. And for some reason it feels harder to make friends with those in the more advanced classes I take.

Back when I was a kid I made friends really easily.  I don't know how I did it. But ever since I was 10 something changed. I think I've lost about 6 friends from 2015- present because we simply drifted apart.

I'm not a weird kid. Like I don't feel like I'm off
putting to anybody. I think part of the reason is that I have a ton of social anxiety and I rarely talk to others. But even if I didn't have the anxiety I still don't know what I would talk about.

So I go to them for advice on any romantic partners. My romantic life has been nothing but bread-crumbing since I was 17. Prom dates bailed before it happened. Went to college and got breadcrumbed all 4.5 years it took me to graduate. And even after with the girl I though was the one turned out to be a fun 2 year breadcrumb. I’ve asked their advice CONSTANTLY! About if these girls had actual interest (they assured me they did), what my situation was, and why they bread-crumbed me. I give them every detail and how it fell apart and they always determine that the girl was a horrible person and that I didn’t deserve to be treated that way and I did everything I could and more.

Perhaps someone else here is feeling similarly, so I want to share what I've been thinking.

Loneliness is not the main problem, it's merely a consequence of other underlying issues. Loneliness feels like you're lacking something: a touch, a hug, a conversation, a kiss, you name it. But ask yourself, why are you lacking that? Is it really because the world is an unfair place and nobody cares about you? Well, sort of, but not really. You feel lonely because you don't get what you want and what you need. Ask yourself why don't you get that? The answer to that will direct you to the real problem. Maybe it's because you're shy and don't hang out with a lot of people, or maybe there's something you say or do that sets others off to look away. Whatever the case, identifying it and working on solving it will bring you good fortune. It will allow you to show yourself better to others and tell them what you need, so that they can finally see you and be with together you.

3686,sadkins2244,1652222928,1,"Hey there, 

I'm an actor and student in the Columbus, Ohio, area, and I go to a community college in this area. It was primarily great throughout this first year, especially the last semester. (I moved here from a small town. now I live with an Uncle.)  I made some decent friends, got a well-paying job, found a mentor, and have taken on some training and projects in my field. On paper, things are/were going well. 

Well, about a month ago, I made a mistake that cost me my friends. I go to classes but sit alone while they have a good time; I'm no longer invited to things, and just overall lonely. 

On the contrary, at a university, I have friends (from my hometown before I moved) who cherish and miss me and have actively wanted me to go to school there with them. I told them probably after I got my associate's degree unless something bigger came up. Regardless, I love and miss them, and I love and miss the love they give me. 

Well, situation arose; my birth mom is homeless, and we're looking to live together. She is content with living anywhere. 

anywhere.

The college I'm interested in, starting a year lease while I finish my associate's degree, up to my hometown, Cleveland. Anywhere. 

So, I'm extremely lonely, and my heart longs for my best buds back, but I should PROBABLY stay here for another year where I essentially go to college for free, yeah? 


do I follow my brain or my heart? is my brain even correct in staying? they have good theatre programs there too. 

for further note. My best friend's partner (who goes to the school and enjoys my company during discord calls and stuff) asked to do a reading (tarot) on the situation. She pretty clearly read that going there would enact better and healthier self-growth. Of course, this could be wish fulfillment and not mean anything, but man, if the universe wants it... 

(I could also likely afford a one bedroom apartment if my mom decides to move elsewhere)

I've recently came out of a 2 month relational its been 2 months since we've broken up. She moved on really quick and withing 2 weeks, she called me on discord to ask if this guy that worked in pizza hut had a crush on her or on her friend. She then also told me how she has a crush on this guy she worked with. I supported her every time. Even when it hurt, even when I didn't want too. I still put my feelings aside to help her because I wanted her happy. She ended up finding out the guy had a girlfriend and stopped pursuing him. Today she told me she was getting tinder and as a joke I said I'd get it if she got it and for some reason she got really aggressive with me and blunt asking why I cared and why it mattered. I told her it doesn't and then she asked why does it bother me. I just told her I wasn't bothered i just made a joke. 

Idk everytime I try to help, try to do the right thing I get it spat back into my face. I get a brief period of things going my way and then I have to be shown my place again, which is being needed but not appreciated.

I want someone to acknowledge me to accept me for my faults for when I get things wrong. Someone who doesn't make me feel like I have to always do what's right and that I'm not allowed to fuck up or I'd get shit on by others.

I’m part of an acting agency, and I strive to play the guitar to a professional degree. My closest friends are life-long of 15-16 years. I’ll be 21 in a few months and life seems fast as light. I’ve been to community college and flunked the first semester even after taking a year off after high school. Did a second semester and repeated two classes. Got A’s in the classes I repeated but still only have a 2.0 GPA. I’ll have a 4.0 if I retake the twos F’s I got and get A’s. I failed three classes first semester and withdrew from three second semester because I thought. I only have two passed classes from two semesters. I withdrew from classes because I almost joined the Marine Corps; I had an 88 on the asvab. Throughout school, I usually got female attention. I guess I’m decently looking and somewhat funny. I’ve never had a relationship or kiss with in my 20 years of life because I avoided relationships. I didn’t have my license until 19. I didn’t see way in actually having a relationship, and I often doubted myself. I recently asked a girl for her number the first time in my life from one of my college classes. I didn’t say anything to her all year, but many hints were given to me that she liked me. She’s almost opposite my physical preference, but I still find her beautiful. By far the best looking girl I’ve had a crush on. Personality wise we’re similar. She made the point that she’s only dated ugly guys when we started talking, and that kind of made me wonder about myself. Based off of our texts it would seem she’s quite into me, yet I don’t understand why I feel she doesn’t actually like me. This isn’t something I let on or voice to her, but when I think about it, it saddens me. I feel as though I’m just waiting for her to ghost me. She’s never explicitly said she likes me or thinks I’m funny or handsome. We went on a date to see a movie that we talked and laughed through, but I just don’t know. I would love for someone to read my texts to give me insight. She let me borrow a movie and gave me hug then we parted. We had a 4 hour phone call and texted for hours, yet I’m still at the hands of my own thought. I think any logical person would slap me for saying she’s doesn’t like me, but based off of my personal thoughts, I can’t shake the feeling. She’s better looking, smarter, and super funny. I believe I have attachment problems and a fear of intimacy, as well as horrible self doubt. I don’t show these things at all, but they live in me. I’m scared she’s going to leave at any second with no warning and that is going to absolutely crush me. I’m trying to purposely not get attached to her because I fear her departure is inevitable.

TL;DR:I asked for a girls number for the first time April 27th. We’ve texted every day since and have had phone calls, one of which lasted 4 hours. All the texts indicates she likes me. We went on a 1 date and she left me borrow a movie of hers, then we hugged and left. All this considered, I can’t help that she doesn’t like me and will leave any second. I believe this due to my past I would assume, and the fact that she is better in every way. I don’t show or voice any of this to her though.",lonely,This girl likes me yet I refuse to see it,2022-05-11 08:37:12

The last one I got lucky with and the moment I talked to her she gave off the vibe of caring that caused me to be at ease. Her empathy made it easier to talk to and when I talked about my loneliness, she said I don't understand what it's like to never have a sig. other but I will do everything I can to help you with your depression that comes from loneliness. She started complimenting me and then I prompty developed a crush on her haha. She left so I've been without a therapist and have been doing poorly but they offered me a new one. I talked to her on the phone and I got a very different vibe from her. One of almost hostility. Maybe she will be different than I assume but I'm worried she will go back to the playbook of, you need to get out there. 

Have you ever talked to a professional about your loneliness and what was the result? Most of them can't relate or don't understand so they give the same advice they give everyone. Write your feelings down, stop negative self-talking, and go out more. My last therapist avoided doing that. If we had been together for a few more months, I could have begun to turn things around. Now it seems to back to the routine of cliche advice that is told because they don't understand or care about my situation. I know some of you posted about your experiences with hotlines and I had similar experiences but what about with professionals? Before someone says it, the other therapists didn't fail because I didn't want to change and if I had been lucky enough to keep my old therapist, I would have begun to change. She made me feel so good and I miss her every day. They never understood or cared. Has loneliness been a taboo topic to bring up with professionals?

3711,if_u_suspend_ur_gay,1652215424,1,"I often feel lonely and crave human interaction and/or affection, but I've always also isolated myself and pushed people away. I never message anyone first. I often don't answer messages in days, and when I do it's just a single sentence and I never ask much back from them besides ""how are you?"". Even if I care about them, I don't enjoy talking with people daily if we have nothing to talk about.

My ex messaged me today and it was the only thing I tried to answer faster to, but even she said I seemed cold and asked if I was okay. I said I'm fine, and I feel like I am. Then she said ""You don't seem like you want to talk to me"" and that really got me thinking, why do I do this?

It's not like I don't want these people in my life, I need them. But I still keep pushing them away and act apathetic and emotionless around them. I still like hanging out with friends IRL sometimes, but messaging or calling people has become a chore. I don't even want to focus on my hobbies anymore, everything just feels too messy. I have projects cluttered everywhere around me, people saying things left and right, It's just a lot of pressure. I just want to be and stay alone, but also not.

I guess this all has something to do with the fact that I judge everything about myself so heavily when I message or call someone. I think it might be because I've always felt very judged by others and I try to do my best to make others think that I'm not boring, annoying or an awful person. I've noticed I can take 10 minutes typing out a single sentence because I keep changing it and overthinking things. I think I also hate my own voice and seeing myself so I don't like calls/videocalls and feel uncomfortable. I really feel somewhat okay only when interacting with people in person.

3714,Gamanic_,1652215334,1,"I'm lucky to be surrounded by family, friends and friendly coworkers (partially) and I know that it's a blessing as some people dont have these relations but even though I have all these people around me, it feels like I'm a ghost who just exists and is mentioned from time to time.

I try to strike up conversation with family sometimes and its met with ""cool, cool anyways"" but if my siblings or cousins or other relations were to talk to the same people I do it would turn into a fulfilling conversation for them.

I'm definitely shy but by no means a bystander in conversations I try to get involved but I usually get shut out. Back in school I'd hear my group of friends chatting and try talking and get ignored, I only had 3 or 4 people who actually listened to me and those conversations were always fulfilling, wacky but genuine.

I had a conversation with my boss today, he thinks I'm a slacker who doesnt work when his eye isnt on me, didnt bother listening to my words, he just made an assumption because of his arrogance and ignorance. Truthfully, I finish my work in about 2 hours and try to be helpful doing random bits here and there but I'm usually wandering for the better part of 1 and a half hours trying to figure out what I can do. It really sucks and of course since I'm new no blame can go to anyone else, people who told me to do one thing and now I get told another. 

I used to suffer from serious temper tantrums but I got a grasp on that and its one of my proudest moments but today I almost snapped, I was on the verge of hitting something and had to really feel myself back in to not explode, later on I was chatting to my parent and pretty much got flamed for believing in a right to privacy online, instead of listening they just went on a tirade about why privacy online is dumb, I informed about being in the final stages of preparation for my driving test and once again ignored, second my sibling opens up about eventually doing their test, a conversation starts.

I hate these people and everyday I seek a lifeline to get me out of here, I'm at the point where I just pray on a dream to win millions in the lotto or become some overnight sensation with music but I know in a failure, an outcast, a ghost and i know that if i died it would be crocodile tears and a month of mourning till my name is forgotten.

I'm not depressed or suicidal, I think at least but it genuinely concerns me that my only options at this point, to escape my current life is bad actions, death or to continue my life for another 20 years till I finally have enough money to buy a shitty shack in the middle of nowhere.

I probably wont be listened to here and honestly this is just me getting heavy shit off my chest. It's the only way I can express how I feel knowing the only thing that can be judged is my words and my tag. The only emotions I seem to be feeling is sadness and anger now, happiness comes in isolation but I never smile, I cant smile.

So even though I bought two tickets to this concert, hoping by now I’d have someone to invite, I’m going by myself. It feels scary because it’s my first heavy concert in a while. 

There could be moshing or who knows what. I haven’t been to a heavy concert in a long time. I wish I had a friend to stand with on the sidelines or to hold my glasses and encourage me to go in.

Instead I’ll likely be standing on the sidelines, holding a drink, wearing earplugs and a mask.

I get most nervous about parking. I have to drive to the city and park and it stresses me out. Had hoped having someone else would help me push through it.

But the person flaked.

I also have other stressors pressing on me, like taking leave from work, my disability claim, waiting on my diagnosis, gearing up to make art for a show in a few weeks, what’s a fair price for cutting my lawn, etc.

I’m lonely and anxious and stressed and feel stuck in perpetual dysfunction.
I’m happier living alone but I wish I had insight and someone to bounce things off of.

I want to go, and it’ll probably be fun. I’m just really nervous and lonely. I feel like it’ll be hard to shake the pang of having 2 tickets and just going by myself. Knowing that the person I kept trying to invite doesn’t really care much about me.",lonely,I really want to go to a concert tonight but I’m super anxious going alone…,2022-05-11 03:59:11

3745,Jurez1313,1652200691,1,"Bit of background: I'm a 30 year old white male. Obese, otherwise below-average appearance (*maybe* a 4/10 in a perfect outfit, at a healthy weight). Socially anxious to the point of basically being an agoraphobe. Live with my parents. No IRL friends. No significant other. 2 siblings and 1 ""faux"" sibling. No other close family. Dead end job that pays OK but in this economy, not enough to move out. Decent car. Get along OK with co-workers but none are more than acquaintances.  

Only hobbies are gaming and hiring women to sleep with me, if you can call either of those things hobbies. If I had friends, I'd watch movies/TV shows, go out to eat, play board games, go mini golfing, bowling or even to amusement parks, but without friends none of those things are appealing, or sometimes even possible. Finally, I have a very ""avoidant"" and sometimes even ""grating"" personality. I'm easily irritable, and quick to correct people on semantic shit or finish their sentences if they're taking too long to do so themselves. My short temper and otherwise bland mannerisms basically make me the exact opposite of a good or interesting person/friend.  

So, I know what you're gonna say: ""All of those things are changeable."" And I agree completely. But I also know myself. I know there is no possible way that I'm ever going to figure out how to motivate myself to take the necessary steps required to fix any of these things. Something as simple as ""eat less food, idiot"" has been a stumbling block since I was a child. Every time I hit the smallest bit of resistance, I immediately quit. That's just how I am. I know that, I've accepted that. But it means that changing all of the things that are preventing me from finding friends is impossible for me. That's just how it is.  

So how am I supposed to cope with never having friends to hang out with? To never have a shoulder to cry on when I've had a rough week? To never have someone next to me in the theater that I can whisper theories to, or enjoy a fantastic meal with, or take in a great view in each other's company? Any tips on figuring that out would be very helpful. I'm getting a cat in a week or two so after that I won't really be able to rely on suicidal ideation to help me cope, because I won't be able to end my life while I'm directly responsible for another life, which was my coping method in the past.",lonely,How do you cope with being alone the rest of your life?,2022-05-11 02:38:11

The number 1 cause of my loneliness is that I don’t have any friends. I’d take a friend over a partner any day. I’d happily die a virgin and never fall in love if it means I could have a life long friend.

But sex is still a huge part of desire and being a virgin is shit. I’m gay and very very horny, if I was attractive I’d be a slut and have sex every day, I wank 10 times a day and always have. I adore men, I find virtually all men I’ve ever seen extremely attractive. But they aren’t attracted back. It’s literally impossible to find someone who is actually attracted to me. I mean yeah some people will fuck anything drunk and horny, but they don’t actually fancy me. On Grindr I never see anyone who looks like me, no one is in my ‘league’ (to use a superficial term). Half of them are super good looking and the other half fit into peoples ‘type’ flawlessly. But literally no one is my level of unattractive.

Sex isn’t something I’ll ever get to enjoy and it sucks so much because I really want to enjoy that part of my identity and Id enjoy and appreciate it so much but I never will. I mean maybe when I’m old I’ll be more desirable because some people like old men but I probably won’t live long enough.

The worst part is how no man has ever fancied me, not one, which makes me feel completely worthless because I fancy literally all men. I just someone in the world would I’d me as hot as I find them.

The thing is that i don't care anymore that im lonely. People can say/do whatever the fuck they want, taunt, bully or punch i don't fucking care.

I have learned my lessons a long time ago, and im not affraid to fight back with you fuckers...

This is just an update in my journey, not ""whining how lonely i am"" or ""how much i hate being alone"". If you are up to that, you are just pathetic... Those kinds of people can't just accept the facts that nobody cares about them lol.

Loneliness is okay if you are used to it. Ofc if you are weak minded (like most people are) its gonna be hard, but thats not my problem. 

Obviously the awful memories are still there, ain't those going away, but they have given me so much hope on my future of never need to be around fuckers anymore, and it also gives me joy to think how shit the life is currently on those who had the guts to punch me or taunt me...

I'm really feeling the loneliness tonight, or maybe just this past week. My bday came and went, I took the day off from work and nothing really happened. I bought my mom a gift that she liked for mothers day so I'm pretty proud of that. I end up going to my room and just be on my phone and pc for the rest of the night. Not talking to anyone or doing anything that I was planning on doing. I feel like I'm in depression again, something that I've been struggling with for a majority of my life. Once I turned everything off and lay in bed, that's when it hits me. I want someone to hug. Idk if it's me wanting to hug them in order to comfort them or them hugging me in order to comfort me, but I want to feel someone's warmth and hear their quiet breaths as they feel safe in my arms.
I don't know why there's shame in to feeling lonely, people making throwaway accounts or making up lies in order to hide our loneliness. I do it to some degree. I don't really use this account so I feel more comfortable to just post here.
I have a hard time maintaining my friendships cause I end up just wanting to curl up into a ball and lay on my bed for the night, holding onto my pillow like if it was someone to hug.
I realized how lonely I was when I got fired from my previous job. I was just roaming around with my car, with no goal in mind. I would just roam malls and fast foods while I just watch everyone pass by me with a friend to accompany them.

3808,Coffee_120,1652160766,1,"It feels therapeutic to just write about it.  Here's my story.  

I grew as the 'nerd' in grade school.  I had some friends, but never had much of a social life up until the 10th grade.  I thought I was destined to be the kid eating lunch by myself, but then life unexpectedly changed for the better.  I switched high schools in 10th grade, and my prior reputation as the 'nerdy' kid didn't follow me.  It was the first opportunity I had to make real friends, where people got to know me without any preconceived notion.  And it felt amazing.  I found people similar to me...people who were curious about the world and didn't think it was weird to work and study hard.  I made close guy friends and also started dating an amazing girl.

My confidence really grew in those high school years and continued to grow throughout college.  I instantly formed an awesome group of guy friends and started dating another wonderful girl (although I was still a bit torn up about my high school relationship ending).  The next 10-15 years of my life were just unbelievably fun.  All my guys stayed in the same city, where we went to college.  We saw each other multiple times a week...dinners, going out, traveling together, etc.  I had ups and downs (like many people do) with romantic relationships, but all in all, I met some amazing women.  And I made great friends at various jobs I had post college.  I didn't know how life could get any better for me.

At some point during this journey, I met the woman that would eventually become my wife.  While the first few years of dating were on a sugar high, we started to go through some major ups and downs post marriage.  One of the major arguments we got into post marriage was regarding where we would live...my wife wanted to move to a different city, but I had no desire to move given the number of 20 year friendships I had in my current city.  In a bid to make things work in our marriage, I agreed to move across the country.  I vowed to stay in touch with the many friends I was leaving behind.

After moving, things were really bad.  I was miserable and resentful.  No friends or family.  And I worked in a job where I work from home and didn't have much opportunity to meet new people.  It took me multiple years and days/months/years of arguments for me to finally decide it was time to let go of my resentment and try to find some peace and happiness.

And I found this peace and happiness through my children.  I could not be more obsessed with them.  They have been my saviors, and most of the time they are all I need in my life.

However, there are moments, like right now....the children are sleeping.  My wife and I are civil with each other, but the light heartedness has faded.  My old friends have become increasingly difficult to stay in touch with...everyone has kids.  Text chains slowly go dormant.  And my new 'friends' are basically just social acquaintances...primarily people whose kids go to the same school.  And in these moments, I miss the closeness I used to have...sitting around with a buddy talking about recent news, going to watch some mediocre sci-fi movie with a group, receiving a text on a Friday night that says, ""hey, what are you up to this weekend?""

Not really looking for advice...I'm content most of the time, but sometimes my mind wanders and wishes for something a bit more.  I had no one else to tell, so I told you guys.  Hope you don't mind.",lonely,Just sharing because it's therapeutic,2022-05-10 15:32:46

welp, where to start. you know why i'm here, it's the same reason you are. 

i used to have a few more friends. i believe i was genuinely robbed of the proper opportunity every kid should have to build relationships and things like that. i grew up super traumatized and i had attachment issues and anxiety so bad that in gradeschool i would literally just cry so hard and beg the teacher to let me call my mother. this being said, i obviously did not make friends. nobody wanted to be around that kid, and as i'm now in highschool i can definitely say that sentiment has barely changed. i made a few friends in middleschool, none of them lasted genuinely. highschool, i made barely any this entire time. in 8th grade i made friends with a dutch girl named jade online and we have remained best friends until a couple of weeks ago when she cut me off completely over something literally so miniscule it is insane. 

i made a friend named jinx sophomore year who was like everything to me. best friend for so so long. genuinely one of the only completely positive friends you would have, you know, and we understood each other perfectly. she cut me off a few months back because i got into a relationship and she felt jealousy towards that and even after we talked about it she still ended up cutting me off. i sent a funny ass meme, ""stop texting me"". that's all she wrote. 
literally.
and i listened.

last night was prom. it was eye opening to how few people i actually have. by few, i mean zero. i have my boyfriend, and the second he was gone there was nobody. i have one, quite literally one friend, aside from my boyfriend, named mars, who i have known from grade 5 who has been through hell and back with me. 

anywho.

I helped her get through that by giving her all my love and affection and attention . Was there for her whenever she needed me. I always wanted to be her friend because we lived in two different states and it would have been hard to maintain a long distance relationship but she insisted on being one and I eventually agreed because she really needed someone good in her life after the mess she had been through and I kinda fell for her by trying to be there for her. A year later she says it's hard for her and she doesn't think she deserves me and she's not a good person and she's having conflicting thoughts which basically means she wants to screw with her abusive ex and she wants to end our relationship. I am heartbroken and clueless because when no one was there for her I stood by her picked her up got her on her feet and now because she's horny she doesn't want me anymore and rather go and be with her abusive ex. I'm so depressed I can't get her out of my head no matter what I do and it seems like she left me the way I found her and I feel helpless and I just want the pain to stop. I feel like killing myself but I have certain responsibilities which are stopping me from doing that. I just want to know how can I stop this pain . How do I shut out all my feelings ?

3847,kerohp257,1652143931,1,"So...I was something of an extrovert kid of myself back then when I was 5 and I remember being really talkative with the entire class and my ""shy"" cousin who sat beside me would always be quiet...then the downhill started since actual school started and left the kindergarten

I was shocked by the sheer number of people there compared to the kindergarten which was like a lot lesser than school and that made me feel scared and tried to find a seat and see what does the future holds for me there...

I got into class picked one of the rear seats and we were 3 classes where 2 would get science and maths and 1 which took them too but in another language (arabic the local language)

Most people were quiet and friendships were already formed there because that same school allowed kids from 3 up to 17 to join the school and my parents chose the kindergarten instead because it was nearby to home

Break starts I go and make my first friend and having fun then I try to find another one but most of them wouldn't appear or be shy or just introverts so I couldn't really make another friend that day...and unlike our class (which I will name B) the other class A had mostly extroverted people but I didn't make friendships with them cause they were another class blah blah stupid 6 yr old me tried to come up with reasons for his shyness or fear of people...

2 years ahead I found that I had 2 relatives there 1 of them was in the same class which I was glad for and we talked me and him and the old one until one day... The popular kids decided to play games together and were inviting most people so they got my 2 only friends so I thought ""well I must play too"" and went there just to be faced with a ""no"" from this annoying girl and that planted inside me the fear of rejection 
So every day I would do my best to keep my friends with me
And if a new kid joins the school I would try to be his friend before they steal him and I would do my best

And since I mentioned that those friends were introverted/shy they wouldn't take any activities in summer (there is nothing wrong with being introverted but when you are affected by behaviours you are not used to your true self starts to disappear

2018 me decides to buy a new pc and dad told him that he would buy it from an old friend so we went there bought the pc and waited for the games to install (early 2000's games that everyone played but it was still ok)
Dad leaves to pick up mom
His friend leaves his son to supervise the pc 

So I talked to kill the awkwardness and he was responding to me (wow I was excited for a stranger to respond to me) and started talking about the private courses and things we shared and didn't know (and luckily this time he was from class A the extroverted kids) and by the time we reached a close friendship level and being able to talk to people easily (specially girls since the first one made me avoid talking to a girl at all costs) I start to realize...

""i feel like i was like this before..."" ""why did I not be friends with anyone from A... I'm the kid who cared only about games now and not do any activities...""

I really felt steps behind when I learned that everyone could swim now...(maybe useless to you but for me and the trips that the school does? It meant much)

I was the one begging my old friends to stop our laziness and go learn swimming in 2016 

And when the relative made a dumb choice to block all our female colleagues I followed him too even though most of them was nice but because he thought all of them were bad he did this (now me and him undid this of course but why we did it in the first place)

Now remember the extroverted friend?

He used to tell me about stories in the courses he had and the people in them and oh boy i was acting like ""oh that's really cool"" while inside me I was in pain knowing that I wasted years worth of joy I could have had 

Don't get me wrong my introverted old friends are not the ones to blame here but it's their nature that ruined me and I can't change their nature 

I guess I was dragged down due to wrong match of friends... 

But im still 14 wahoo i can try and fix these things right? 

Well no.
The damages has been done and everyone is now having their own friend group so making a friend now feels really late and that if you manage to get one...

But I got out with a life lesson
And that is I shouldn't wait on someone to do something I also want and unfortunately I learned that the hard way

3849,justtrying2727,1652143267,1,"Don’t know how to keep going

Life is going by fast but it’s being looped.

Made plenty of posts detailing what i have been through.

I’m a  and i’m near the end of high school, and 3 years have passed by i still feel like i’m 15.

I’ve never had friends or a girlfriend, my personality is the same as it was when i was 13-15, i’m very childish and immature, I’m considered annoying to people. This isn’t the reason I have any friends though, as i’m terribly scared of talking to people.

I’m incredibly insecure of my body and who i am, i have terrible acne that doesn’t want to go away, and many other things such as my height.

I’ve became so much better mentally from what i was in the past, and now i’m solely focusing myself in trying to improve myself, but it’s really hard because i feel like it won’t matter.

I struggle with suicidal thoughts alot.

I have plenty of medical conditions that are ruining me but i can’t get a doctor.

I have no social life other than my 15yo cousin that lives in a different city, and i get bullied by him(all jokes).

Going to school for me is completely useless as i do not have any social life, It feels like the same shit everyday. 

Getting a girlfriend is almost impossible as no girl has ever showed attention towards me. Even if they did, I can’t get a girlfriend at the school as everyone in my classes are 16-17 (i have failed multiple times.)

I feel like i have plenty of undiagnosed mental illnesses as i cannot socialize properly, if one person shows interest, i try to message them everyday which ends up in them blocking me. I’m also seen as a loser and annoying in social circles, i can’t be the “chill guy.” 

Also, i’m saying this like i get any socialization, i am completely devoid of any socialization other than my cousin, who i feel is only making things worse because of my insecurities and he has a different mindset.

We would see each other everyday and always be together. We held hands, we took naps together, we bought each other food, showed each other music , we kissed. Months into this I turned 18 and wanted to do something I could do that I couldn’t before, I downloaded tinder. I didn’t think this was a big deal it’s not like I actually would meet anyone I matched up with. I starting texting someone I matched with and we just innocently texted, it never crossed any boundaries, all we would do is talk. I tell K about this and he becomes angry, we stayed up until 2 am talking about it, I tried to explain it wasn’t serious and that I would never go against him. I realize now that I was an idiot for not caring how he would have felt about. Eventually though, he gets over it and we continue things as we do. A few months later I have an insane depressive episode, which is not uncommon for me, and one of the things I do during these episodes is push people away from me. I invite him over and tell him I don’t feel the same anymore. It shocked me how much I didn’t feel about it. Coming out of the episode, I think I wanted to convince myself what I said was true. I tried to move on. Fast forward I think about K daily, i miss him. I realize how selfish it sounds, but I know I’ll never have him like I did again and it makes me sad. I met someone else (V) and things went well, we went on a couple dates, he was nice and romantic. I really began to like V and could start seeing myself with him, we even began talking about the future. Not too long ago V begins being dry over text and noticeably not putting effort like he would. I knew what was coming but I liked him so much I didn’t want it to be true, i wanted to hold on to what he we had for a little longer. Shortly after though, he began to not respond at all and then, over text, he tells me that he doesn’t feel ready for a relationship but he thanks me for being in his life.

This is not a self pity post, I just really feel like I need to say this so I can get some sleep tonight.
I am 24 and ever since I’ve been a child I’ve been horribly worried about feeling alone in this world. I didn’t have the worst childhood in the world or anything like that but I was always very feminine and went to all boys schools in the Middle East, which made making friends really challenging and I experienced a lot of abuse (sexual abuse, extreme forms of taunting and bullying) and even home couldn’t be a refuge for me because I could tell my father had a really hard time being around me without making comments about my behavior (I wouldn’t say he was abusive but he repeatedly would tell me things like not to act like a girl, man up, yell at me for crying) I also have 5 brothers who all really disliked me because of my feminine qualities and thought they could “fix me” by pointing out and making jokes about how I didn’t act like a man. 
So I end up feeling ostracized at my home and In my school, things eventually started getting better when I managed to make friends as I got older, around 16. 
However I’m now 24 and because of traveling to the US for a few years and then coming back to the Middle East I’m almost back to square 1 with no social life, I have a few close friends but a lot of them are in the US or not in physical proximity to me.
My biggest struggle currently comes from the fact that I realize I’m trans, I’ve known about this for years now but obviously can’t be honest with my family about it or start hormones or anything like that, which I’ve learned to be okay with, I’m fine with waiting.
But at nights when I’m laying in bed I can’t stop myself from thinking about how whatever I choose to do in life, either keep lying to my family or transition, I’m going to be alone.
All I want in life is to learn how to operate in a way that allows for people to love me and wanna be around me so I’m not so alone and it’s just so fucking hard sometimes.
I’m a really social and extroverted person but I just can’t seem to maintain friends and it’s a really lonely position to be in.",lonely,I’m so horrified of feeling alone in this world but I feel like I am choosing loneliness.,2022-05-10 08:38:06

I'm sure you must all be thinking: ***Ah shit, here we go again...;*** but I really don't know where else to go to to let out these emotions pent up inside me so I apologise in advance for the whiny rant

I had my first relationship two years ago, which was my first everything: first girlfriend, first sober kiss, lost my virginity to her, etc... you get the idea. Since then I have been single, and to be honest I had not tried to get a meet anyone new since then up until a bit over a week ago when I decided to install the big 3 dating apps (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble). I consider myself a pretty decent looking guy, I work out very often, I think I can be quite funny, and I feel like I would be a great boyfriend overall, but these dating apps are absolutely destroying my self esteem. I have a decent amount of matches but none of them ever go anywhere. The usual results range from not even getting a reply after I match to getting their Snapchat/Instagram but I end up being left on read eventually, and it makes me feel like there is something inherently wrong or unattractive about me. I find myself fixated on these apps and matches non stop, I'll think about it every few minutes almost and its consuming me. I keep finding myself feeling disgusting and unworthy of any ounce of love or care anyone might have to offer to me.

I keep thinking to myself ""*What the fuck am I doing wrong, what is wrong with me*"" even though logically I know there is nothing wrong with me, but my heart keeps telling me otherwise and it is eating away at my self worth which is already quite low to begin with. Just today I talked to a friend who seems to have a lot of success on dating apps, and I asked him to show me his profile so I could see what he is doing better than I am... and it left me even more confused and frustrated than before. He only has a about 3 pictures, and it is hard to make out his face clearly in any of them.

The loneliness is really starting to get to me, and I am suffering a lot from it. I feel exhausted. You always get the usual advice like ""**Work on yourself before looking for a partner**"" or ""**If you cant love yourself, how do you expect to love somebody else?**"", but I am quite content with every aspect of my life other than the fact that I am single. It feels like a void in my heart that can't be filled by any amount of self care, I crave the affection of another person so deeply and it almost feels as though I am always incomplete, like the final missing piece of a puzzle. I just want someone to take care of and to turn to when I am having a bad day, someone to embrace and make memories with and the longer I spend alone, the more I start to feel like I will never find someone to reciprocate these feelings. When I see my friends in ***seemingly*** happy relationships I feel envious and I hate myself for it, I am glad that they are happy but I wish I had someone like they do...",lonely,[M21] Loneliness Is Driving Me Insane,2022-05-10 07:56:45

Though I’m only eighteen and people would call me too young for this, I feel like I’ve grown up too fast and too soon. I’ve seen the world and I’ve come to know exactly what I want. Problem is, it’s too hard to find. But before I give up, I’ll post this as a last attempt since online dating apps got me nowhere and dating in real life is impossible for someone my age due to where I live. I don’t see myself living past my twenties so here we are. I’ve always felt this strange yet familiar loneliness deep within me. The feeling that no one truly understands me, and that I have no true connections in my life. Though I’m surrounded by people, none of them match me as much as I’d want. Nobody cares for me except for my family and a few friends, obviously. But I want someone other than family to care. My ideal partner is someone who would have the key factors in common with me. A lonely, nihilistic, carefree, laidback soul, simply looking for someone the same as them to share their life with. I’ve never fallen for the false image of a happy family with children, in fact I despise anything that even remotely resembles such an idiotic image. I’m an anti-natalist meaning that I’ll never want to have children, and I’m not interested in adopting either. In fact I’m planning on getting a vasectomy as well. My partner has to feel the same way. So sure that they’d be willing to get their tubes tied up. I’m also an atheist and am anti-religion, spirituality, theism, cultural rules, family rules, strict morality or anything that takes away my full freedom to do absolutely anything I want as a human being. You’d have to be the exact same way, otherwise we wouldn’t workout. I view sexual activities as acts for pure pleasure and I like my sexual life to be separated from my romantic life. That means I don’t expect monogamy and will not be monogamous of any sort. My sexual life is my business and yours is yours. If you’re the type to feel jealous, stop reading. I’m open minded and kinda kinky. Other than gas, defecation and acts that are harmful in anyway such as cutting, choking, et cetera, I’m willing to tryout all sorts of sexual activities as long as we’re both comfortable with it. I’m not one to put up with bullshit so you’d have to be emotionally stable and as laidback as I am if not more. On the other hand you wouldn’t have to put up with any bullshit on my side either. I tend to never make big deals out of any problems as I believe that the best way to solve problems is with calmness and logical thinking. I try my best to never let anything get to me and I expect the same from a partner. I will not accept any form of toxicity in my relationship and will break up immediately as I’ve done many times before if I feel like I’m not enjoying myself. I will also do the same if I feel like you aren’t enjoying my company because I expect you to be honest and feel comfortable and happy around me. I’d never force anyone into anything so if you force yourself, I’m out. I’m not strict about age but if you’re older than me, I will not tolerate getting looked down upon in anyway. Just because I’m “young” to society’s standards does not mean I’m immature. If you disagree, stop wasting your time. I don’t claim to be perfect as I don’t believe in perfection overall, but I know my self worth and I demand respect and kindness. I treat people the same way they treat me. I like my relationship to be fully double-sided at all times. A relationship made of ever growing pure love, trust and acceptance from both sides until death do us apart.

Ever since I went through a breakup just before covid hit, I haven’t really been happy. I did have a rebound in the form of a onenightstand. But I’m craving the affection that goes with a relationship.

Apart from the romantic loneliness I’m also unemployed again after one month of working. I knew the job was going to be temporary but when it has ended you’re once again left with the great big nothing. I don’t want the void, I want to be busy.

I met this possible love interest at a party in April, we had a very engaging conversation, we really hit it off, but she's so incredibly busy and I don't know if or when we'll be able to go on a date. I'm kinda losing hope tbh. What is the point of it all. I've got a mild form of autism, what used to be called Asperger's but I prefer to say I'm on the spectrum.

Anyway reaching out to other lonely souls here, thanks for reading and feel free to hit me up. Would love to meet some new friends to make plans, cause apart from some concerts I have no idea what my life is going to look like in 3 months. I'm open to anything. Wish I could travel to the US but flights are expensive as the high season is approaching, so realistically if you want to meet up, you're also based in Western Europe. I'm down to chill in Amsterdam, Paris or London. Never been to Scotland and would love to finally go this summer.

3907,New_Literature42,1652122239,1,"Dear God am I going to regret this, but I feel like I need to do this right now.

I tell people I don't have any friends, that I am completely alone and that no one wants to be my friend. The truth is that I have ""friends"". I interact with them, talk with them, laugh with them and tell them they are my friends. Yet I don't feel like they are.

If you were to ask one of them if they are friends with me they'd say yes. On the other hand, I still say I am alone, I still feel alone. I can't look them in the eyes and tell them. ""You are my friend"" cause that is not how I see them.

I am completely alone, completely isolated, and completely without one person to talk to. Not because I have to, but because I choose to. I can't trust someone enough to feel like they are my friend. I am scared that they are lying, scared that if I get too close I might get hurt.

I am angry that I can never be myself. That I have to take on a mask every time I meet someone. That my relationships never go deeper than the surface and that I have never told anyone ever how I feel.

I desperately try to escape my life as ""lonely"". I try to talk to people and find it enjoyable for a while, but as soon as I have to keep that going it's no longer what I want. I talk to someone face to face and think to myself ""this is a person, who wishes me no harm"". But as I leave the room they become abstract. I grow scared of that person and feel like they are a hassle. Someone who was my potential friend becomes my enemy, someone who might hurt me in the future.

I want to tell people how I feel, I want to talk to someone, but ultimately I have no one. I can't utter the words I want to say, I can't speak up because I feel like shit, like I just left a vulnerable piece of myself for someone else to stab every time I speak to someone about my issues. 

I am so tired of being lonely, so tired of not having anyone to speak to, so tired of never being able to be myself. 

But in the end, I know that all of that is my fault, that it stems from my inability to trust anyone. And that is what hurts the most.


I am scared for my life that I might never meet someone I can trust.

I have made a few friends in recent years but they all now have partners that they spend most of their time with. I’ve always tried to push myself out of my comfort zone to meet new people but it’s always ends the same. I’ve done stuff that I am really not comfortable with just to try to make people like me.

I feel like I’m being left behind. It’s probably a stupid mind set but I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle that i always end up alone. I’ve tried dating but no matter what I do, I always get ghosted. It’s led to me being really closed off about my feelings and just makes me scared to open up to people cause of all the times before I know I’m going to get hurt.

For some reason I always let myself hope that things will be different every time I meet someone but it’s just hurts more when they leave. I don’t know if I’m doing anything wrong. It always makes me think that there’s something wrong with me. A lot of girls brush me off because of my lack of experience. 

I’ve had a bad past that still effects me to this day but I’ve worked on myself to get to the point I am now and I’m happy with how things are but I can’t shake the feeling of loneliness. Everyone I know goes home to someone who loves them and I’m just at home alone.

I just want someone who cares about me, Someone I can have my own family with and not be alone anymore. Someone who gets me and I get them. That we would be best friends and not just a couple.

Since I’ve just had my gf who’s my world. But I’m still lonely, having a partner doesn’t solve it not by half.

 Sought help and was told to join things, get to know people. So I did, joined clubs and it’s been nearly a year for some.

Haven’t made a single friend. One looked promising as a small group of us formed up and we chatted as a group and met up outside. Nowadays though idk what I’ve done but seems like I’m excluded.

What used to be open invites now are secret squirrel meetings I don’t get rid out. Only hear bout them when someone slips up and posts on the old group chat about what time they’re getting there or at the club when someone says “you forgot this other day” etc one guy I was going fishing with randomly dropped me and says he’s “busy”. Was a regular thing and suddenly no longer even communicates. But he’s one of the secret squirrel club which I guess is why he’s busy!

The worst thing is that I've been so depressed and lonely for so long that rather than being low, I've started laughing at my own misery. The worst of all things is that I did right my whole life or at least tried to. I grew as an idealistic kid, loved by my parents. Hardworking, ambitious and giving.  

Throughout my life, I've been worked over by countless people. I've been cheated on by 3 different women in last 6 years whom I treated like a goddess. I never had a hard time getting girls, still don't. But I'm one of those people who can't even touch someone I'm not in love with. I've an amazing career, good attention, everything. I get all the attention I need but still I feel so lonely. I don't remember the last time I felt I was vulnerable around someone, I'm too scared to open up or ask for help. My friends come to me for life advice, career advice and for everything. I help them and it works out for them well too. But somehow no one is there for me because I'm too scared to ask for help. 

My day is either an amazing day or just a day I'd pray I survive. It's fucking hard to live now. But I only live to take care of my parents else I would have died so early.

From 2019 until 2021 I gave online dating a serious go. I met up with a few girls, hell even one from Discord but no one felt a spark, ghosted me or started things back up again with their ex.

After my last date in the spring of 2021 I decided this shit wasn't worth it anymore and deleted every single profile on every single app and my dating life has been dryer since the sahara since. Nothing.

So, what did I learn from the girls who I did date and had a relationship with? That a lot of them saw me as their personal therapist, ghosted me when they got their fix and that interest is often faked for goals relating to themselves. Hell I had one girl straight up tell me who I was together with for nearly a year she wasn't really in love with me, she just 'felt very safe with me and I brought her great companionship during that difficult time of her life'.

We would have lunch together, go to the movies, text each other on all the socials, talk about everything.. but she was in a relationship so I didn't think too much of it. But then she started hinting that she wasn't feeling appreciated in her relationship... Now I'm really thinking about her everyday, waiting for an opportunity... It never came though because a few months later she started becoming distant. 
I eventually found out that she was scared she was getting too attached to me and felt she had to stick to the commitment she made.. she would also later tell me that the fact that I'm a bald headed light-skinned didn't help. It was hard for her to feel sexually attracted to me because I wasn't physically her type ( and she knows it sounds pretty).
Anyway, I tried but couldn't force her to see the potential. We still work together and it was awkward for a bit, but we're cool now.. almost back to how close we were before but I can tell she's set boundaries and let me in as much anymore.
The thing is, I still really like her. I've never met anyone like her before and I'm kind of reserved so I don't meet people that often anyway. I'm still coming to work and seeing her and sitting next to her every week which isn't helping me move on. I don't even know if I want to move on. Part of me still thinks there's a chance.

3952,Unknown-14,1652093986,1,"Hi y’all. I thought I’d express some thoughts that have been plaguing me for a while, so here goes.

I’m my own worst enemy and my environment is not the problem.

For some clarity, I was born abroad so that makes me a third culture kid. 

Country A, my birthplace, for the most part was miserable growing up in. I was bullied, ridiculed and forgot completely what it meant to be happy. Most of my friends had moved on with their lives and I was ultimately left alone and lonely.

The time came when I could leave Country A and so I moved to Country B. I thought hey, this it! I can finally be happy for once and not feel lonely again.

I was able to make friends and have fun for once in life. However, down the line I sank back into the feelings of sadness and loneliness. Perhaps it had to do with my low academic performance and it added to my overall negativity.

My friends were there and were supportive, but I couldn’t help but sink further in my negativity.

Eventually I had to say bye to these wonderful people and I moved to Country C - the home of my parents.

Having to experience a new culture again, I took my time to learn how things worked and eventually made friends again. I had more freedom here and was genuinely happier than ever. 

Oh but get this, I got sad and lonely again. Thing is I don’t why I do this to myself.

I have all these loving family and friends and have had a relatively good life and yet I succumb to my neuroticism.

So if it’s not my environment or people, it’s definitely me.

I have some issue or problem within me and I’m tired of being sad and lonely all the time.

3971,Minister_of_Joy,1652078046,1,"Hello friends,

Sometimes when I'm feeling very down and lonely, I listen to sad music and it really helps me a lot. It makes me feel like I'm not alone with this pain.

Here are a few songs about loneliness I enjoy a lot:

- [**Solitary Man**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5rVmXyZP5s) by Johnny Cash. Sometimes I play this song when I'm in the shower and I love to sing along to it! I find Cash's voice really soothing, especially in his older age. There are a lot of musicians who sing sad songs but are actually very happy people. When I listen to this and other sad songs by Johnny Cash, the pain in his voice sounds so genuine and authentic. Makes me feel understood.

- [**Streets of London**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiWomXklfv8) by Ralph McTell

- [**Eleanor Rigby**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y) by the Beatles. Most Beatles songs are cheerful but this one is actually quite melancholic in my opinion.

- [**The Partisan**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs5hOhI4pEE) by Leonard Cohen. This is technically a song about war but it's also a song about losing everyone that's dear to you.

- [**The Letter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L13fYjKuFG0) by Digger Barnes. I love this song because it starts out sounding like a happy dream or fantasy, until you realize it's actually a memory and therefore quite sad and melancholic. I have recently been left by the love of my life. We've been married and the pain of losing her (very undeservedly) hurts so much. When I listen to this song, it really hits home.

- [**People Are Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Mz_IqpZX8) by the Doors. I often listen to the Doors during episodes of acute depression because like no other band, they managed to express this feeling of being disconnected and estranged from the world. Reality becomes like a bad acid trip because you're all by yourself and the rest of the world just doesn't make any sense to you anymore. This song is a great example of this.

- [**Yokohama**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH70UQSXkrw) by Hako Yamasaki. This is a Japanese song that serves as a confession of love towards the city of Yokohama. It's a deeply melancholic song, though, because the narrator also feels very lonely there. In the song it's raining and the narrator has given up on trying to connect with other people around her. Hako Yamasaki is one of my absolute favorite artists. She was active in the 1970s and early 1980s, which was also the golden age in post-war Japanese history. When I listen to her music, I often have to think of a rainy November evening in Tokyo of 1975 or 1980, a small bar with some live music, neon lights that flicker in the rain, a few lonely people on the street who can't decide whether they should go inside or go home...

I love chatting with ppl and listening about their lives. But lately I’ve just distanced myself due to the pain when ppl leave.

My heart is heavy today,  as I am becoming more and more isolated. As I go about my day,  I have difficulty connecting with people,  particularly women.  I was dastardly hurt in a divorce  that  left me emotionally scarred. Since then I've been terrified to get close to anyone.  I'm afraid of rejection,  hurt and pain because I  experience it quite intensely.  I usually wake up in the morning from emotionally intense dreams that affect my day  sometimes.  I have no one to talk to about this. Most of my friends are in distant places and I struggle to make new ones. I'm in a lot of pain.  
I'm afraid that  I might never have a close relationship ever again because I can never attract a female. I feel ugly, unwanted,  rejected,  ignored,  despised.  Like a  fly on a wall to be swatted. I observe others being happy,  I get jealous of happy couples especially on social media.  I get the courage to sometimes put myself out there only to  either ignored or rejected.  Sometimes I don't know where I belong.  I go through life without social connections,  yet here I am. I have a lot of good things going for me professionally,  but socially I'm totally empty. Being alone is hard, because it requires self confidence which I'm trying to build. But at the same time I desire human companionship.  Doesn't anybody?  I hope someone reads this.

i’ve noticed that loneliness and fear of contamination overwhelm me and drive me away from going to school. i live in a city where my commute is a little over an hour long trains love being delayed too! time moves so unusually too, that i prioritize just rushing to get back home and make the most out of a few hours following a shower i take everyday after coming home. by that time it’s maybe already 5pm and i hope i can sleep at 10 latest, and ideally 8. i hate it. but what i hate a lot more is the fact that people take the same trains as me, yet i still spent the year taking the trains on my own, crying into my sleeves on the way home whenever i had to take a bus since i couldnt be picked up and brought home as soon as possible.

i hate showing up to school, engaging in small talk and knowing i don’t truly matter to those i speak to. i go to an arts school, and i thought that because i struggle with socializing snd so do many other artist, this would be my chance to socialize more with people just like me. nope. they’re all city kids with lives and established friend groups. i hate going to school knowing i dont matter and that ill go straight home after havig wasted a day— i hate staying home because i miss out and still spend the same amount of hours struggling to focus on work. 

and fun fact? i was the only brown girl in my elementary school, the only one that couldnt take a walk or bus to and from home with friends in middle school, and maybe now the only one not so devoted to their art in my arts high school. i havent even gone to a single concert or art show yet everyone talks about them

it’s 2 am, i’ve gotta leave the house at 6:30 to get to school by 8…. i hate that i feel miserable enough to call off a 4th day of school in a row. i feel like a disappointment to my mom who desperately wants me to go and to my teachers who’ve either called me out on this not because of how IM doing but because my absences interfere with the fairness of test taking since im absent for tests. i dont think my teachers really care about me, and yet i wanna show up to leave a good impression as a student and a person, toshow that im struggling but trying. i guess im also worried about these impressions for letters of recommendation. i have no clue what im doing i just really dont wanna go :’)",lonely,my lowest attendance as of yet,2022-05-09 16:10:10

I've been told I'm fun to be with and I'm empathic enough to read people moods. I'm socially confident enough to talk with strangers with no issues (socializing with people is literally part of my job). I get along well with coworkers and I have a close group of friends. I go to meetups and social events with the goal of getting to know people. I try to make sure people I'm with at least enjoy themselves when we go out and don't feel excluded. 

But I still feel completely alone and socially isolated. I alway have to be the one reaching out. I don't get invited by other people to hangout. When I try reach out to new people I meet they always flake or don't even respond. I get that everyone is busy and I don't deserve anything from other people but hells don't tell me your open to hanging out but then disappear. I believe in taking initiative to change my situation but getting a lung infection after a social event makes me think being lonely isnt too bad. 

I'm at the point where I'm  seriously thinking about reaching out to a patient who gave me her number. Which is a big no-no in healthcare.

However I've also noticed alot lately he seems to make fun of me or laugh at me when I'm just being myself I'm also pretty sure he talks bad about me to other people when I'm not around based off people bringing up embarrassing stories about me that only he could've told them.  I kind of had the same thing happen with my friend group in high school I realized I was more of a jester for them to laugh at more than a friend on equal footing I was always the center of alot of their jokes and I have alot of deformitys on my body that they'd tease me about constantly and send pics of me to other people to laugh at me without my knowledge. I cut them off sadly way too late high school was practically over by the time I really figured out they definitely werent real friends as I also discovered that some completely baseless and untrue rumors about me that had been going around the school for years came from them and these rumors greatly affected how I was viewed by everyone. My last friend I am talking about was apart of that friend group and has been my best friend since the 4th grade I thought at the time he was different and although I dont think he had anything to do with the rumors he certainly never helped my situation.

I want to be the version of myself that you like, I want to become someone you can love. I'm not particularly attached to any aspect of myself, I don't much care for any of it, anything that you want me to change I will change. If the issue is in the way I look I'll change it for you, I'll cut my hair, or grow it out, or style it differently. I'll get tattoos, or piercings, or promise never to get either. I'll gain weight, I'll lose it, I'll exercise more, I'll exercise less. If it's my personality you don't like I'll change it for you, I'll change my sense of humour, I'll change the way I talk, I'll change the way I text, I'll change the way I think, I'll change the things I like, the things I don't. If it's something else, I promise I can change it for you, I can walk differently, I can pronounce words a little differently, I can use a different vocal inflection when we talk, I can stop mumbling words as I write and read them, I can watch the movies you like again and make sure I see what you see, I can text you less, or more, I can work on reading little hints and queues better, or be more oblivious. 

Every aspect of myself is dedicated to you entirely, it's all yours to mold and shape as you like. Please make me into something better. No matter how much I want to say all of this to you I know I never can, because you'll tell me that I'm not the problem, that it's you. You'll say you just don't want me in that way, that it's your fault and that you're not ready, but I know you're not the problem. I have to be the problem, I have always been the problem.

3996,jagoddelgado,1652070582,1,"The advice I see given to people who struggle finding love usually goes as follows:
1. Be confident
2. Hit the gym, get in shape
3. Go to therapy
4. Seek higher education
5. Make more friends
6. Work on your personality
7. Get new hobbies
8. Get a better job
9. Change your wardrobe
10. Hair care, skin care, etc

The crazy thing no one tells you about all these is this. You can do everything on this list. You can become the best best version of yourself and STILL not be good enough for anyone. When it comes to love, it's all luck.

Right person, right place, right time. These are the variables at play when it comes to finding someone. Getting all three to line up is luck and has nothing to do with you at all. That's why Sally met John at the gym, or Margaret met Sam at the market or why Justin met Gwen online. The right people happened to occupy the same space, at the same time and it clicked. 

Further proof of this are the people who are not in shape who find love. The people who are not confident but very shy, who find love. The people with mental health issues, who are being loved right now. The people with only a high school education, who are in relationships. The people with no friends who are in bed with their boo right now. The person working at a minimum wage job who has a partner. The gamer whose partner watches them play. The person with bad acne and a bad haircut who's partner can't wait to go kiss them. 

You can improve yourself all you'd like. And it's greatly encouraged. But realize, it doesn't actually get you any further to being loved. Because who you are right now is actually enough. You are simply unlucky. You don't have bad genetics. You're unlucky. You're not too ugly to be loved. You're unlucky. 

This doesn't soften the blow of loneliness. But I hope it helps a little. 

The best thing us singletons can do is not try and hate ourselves for not being lucky. Because at the end of the day it has nothing to do with you.",lonely,self improvement doesn't earn you love,2022-05-09 14:29:42

4013,Friggin_Wiggin,1652063512,1,"There used to be this girl in my primary school days that I was really into. I fantasized about us on a beach watching the sunset in a beautiful pink hue. If only I had shot my shot... I'd have known whether it could've been. But I gave myself the idea that she was out of my league and that she wouldn't be interested in me. I don't remember how old I was when I was really into her, I was likely 12 or 13.

I then had another crush at 16 and I asked if she'd have me at the valentines ball, she said yes. I was happy at the time and after school hours were over I went back home to shower and got into my nice clothes and went to the ball. We went in together and the hosts played us a song to dance to... What I experienced was not that of love towards her in thar moment... She smelled like she just got from soccer practice, the dancing felt awkward and I just wanted to get out of there. But I stayed, I mustered through the stink of a sweaty soccer jersey and... then the ball was over. I must say I was relieved it was over as I was not sure whether I was gonna make it thru the entire thing or not. Nothing more came of between us, she didn't ask for me and nor did I for her.

I haven't met another crush in all these 8 years, as I'm just in my mancave sitting on my bed writing this and have been cooped up here for far too long.

 I hope one day someone will be interested in me enough to give me a chance like that girl in my teens.",lonely,It saddens me to think of all the things that could have been.,2022-05-09 12:31:52

I haven’t had someone to regularly text in 2 years. I don’t remember what it feels like to have a friend group. I’ve kind of accepted I will never have friends. It seems to get harder as you grow up.

All my childhood friends don’t even remember me, my middle school friends cut contact with me, and my high school friends all did the same. It seems once people aren’t forced to spend time with me anymore they choose not to. And these are people I considered to be my best friends. There’s only one person who’s stayed there half heartedly. I’ve known her since I was 11 and she’s the only one who hasn’t cut contact with me completely.

4022,notanothersloth,1652061438,1,"I have two online friendships. Both of these individuals have always been candid about their struggles with mental health. I've always tried to be there for both of them. I respond quickly to their text messages, express interest in their lives, and feel like I would do anything to help them if they needed it. 

Lately, however, it has been me who has been struggling. My anxiety, my depression, my feelings of worthlessness have all been to such an extreme that it has been impacting my day to day life. I've lost 7 pounds in just 5 days from not eating. I can't find a psychiatrist or a doctor willing to take me until at least three months from now, so medication is not an option. I've been extremely candid with both of these ""friends"" about how alone I feel right now. However, neither one of them seem to actually care. Sometimes I have to wait more than 24 hours just for a response to a text message. They claim I can call anytime, however they know my anxiety won't allow it. Isn't it easier to respond to text messages when you have a moment rather than to take a long call? 

Yesterday was the most traumatic day of my life for reasons I won't go into. When I shared what had happened with ""friend"" #1 all I received was a one text message response: ""that's how it goes."" I shared it with the other one and they simply said: ""how are you feeling now?"" I intentionally sent a response that was open-ended to get a follow-up reply and they have yet to respond. Yet, they've managed to find the time to send multiple group chat messages and pictures since then. 

I don't understand how these people can be so cold and cruel to me. Maybe I'm just being irrational. Maybe I'm expecting way too much. Maybe I'm allowing my standards to fall so low because without these two ""friends"" I literally have no one else. Is it so hard to find a reciprocal friendship? Someone who cares as much about you as you care about them?

Sorry for the rant but I'm feeling so down that I just have to get it out or otherwise it will just crush me even further.",lonely,"My online ""friends"" know I'm struggling but don't seem to care",2022-05-09 11:57:18
4023,CrewCreation,1652061435,1,"Hello all,

I’m just here to vent. Somethings may not make sense so I apologize in advance. I just want to get everything off my chest. 

Recently a few of my close friends graduated university. I would have also graduated if I stayed on track but I still have 1.5 years left. It’s left a bittersweet feeling inside me.

On one hand, I’m super excited and happy for them. Yet, on the other hand, I am sad I wasn’t able to walk the stage as well. I know everyone lives on different timelines but it’s still saddening to me. 

Whenever new change comes it’s exciting but I also don’t like change. I like things to be familiar and when it’s not I feel lost inside and unsure of how to adapt quickly. 

I’ll also be in summer school and I know summer is a time for people to go out, vacation, reset, and what not. But I’ll be inside studying most days since my major is very demanding. Which also adds onto the sadness I feel. Knowing I won’t be out as much. And I know choosing my studies over a night out is a must if I want to graduate but I still feel lonely. 

This week was my first week of summer classes and I already feel lonely as ever. I have a significant other who I’ve expressed my recent feelings to but we are long distance and I’m not able to get hugs from them to feel comfort. I do have a really great support system and I love them all very much. I just have a lot of things on my mind lately and idk what to do. I used to struggle a lot with suicidal thoughts and I can slowly feel them coming back. I’m trying to do what I can to not let myself fall down that hole again but it’s harder this time. 

For those that read this thank you for letting my vent. I hope you are all finding ways to keep yourself going.",lonely,Not sure how to feel,2022-05-09 11:57:15

4025,throwaway457836,1652060708,1,"I went through a short term relationship last year but I’m still hurting very badly. 

We met on a dating app and after 4 dates he expressed his interest in me. He told me he liked me and wanted to take things further. I told him that I do have some concerns such as both of us being very busy with work. But he told me to reconsider and also said that work is always here to stay and both of us could have work dates together.

Sensing that he was sincere, I stayed on and he also tried to hold my hand on a few occasions when we were out so I assumed that he really was into me and wanted to pursue a r/s with me. Then I asked him to define the r/s. 

However, shortly after getting together, he was constantly not being able to keep to his promises and would overpromise but turn out to be flakey. He was also talking about long term plans and marriage initially, which pressurised me as well. It made me very anxious and insecure. 

He would also seem off when we were out together. And when I asked him if he was angry or unhappy, he would just say no. I thought I was being too sensitive.

I recall there was this one day when he ignored my messages for a whole day which made me anxious and I called him 4 times only for him to reply in the evening saying that his mum and sis had a big fight and he just didn’t had the mood for anything. Thinking back now, I felt so so silly for calling him 4 times out of fear and anxiousness. I wanted to be there for him but he didn’t want to talk about it.

Since then we spoke and I expressed that it’ll be good for him to just communicate and let me know if he needs space. He also mentioned that he felt that we were spending too much time together (I was seeing him on zoom 2-3 times on weekdays for a short while and once on weekends in person). So I compromised to once on weekends and once on zoom on weekdays just to catch up with each other(we don’t call each other nor have any common texting time where we are both online chatting). We also compromised to just texting once(a few messages exchanges) in a day. He even told me that he has a lot on his plate namely his mum, sis, manager and boss and my first thought was “then what about me”. But instead I told him I was there to just care and get to know him. 

It was really hurting my heart that he couldn’t even take some time out for me and I was constantly waiting for him to get back to me. I also had to hold back my feelings and wanting to see him at his convenience. 

A few weeks later, he ended things through text message saying that he’s too busy with work and can’t give me the attention I need/expect and he’s too tired to maintain a r/s right now. I was also denied a phone call to talk it out. I was really hurt and sad that he didn’t communicate anything and blindsided me. I saw his profile on OKC weeks after the breakup. 

I’ve been thinking about it and felt like I’ve done my best in the relationship and put in all my effort too. I trusted him so much. That was my pure and genuine heart. 

I’m not perfect but tried to do everything right. But the way he didn’t want to spend time/pushed me away got me constantly questioning myself if I’m way too needy and if I am supposed to withhold my feelings and my need to see/spend time with them because of their busy schedule.  

Almost 10 months later, I’m still hurting but I do think he left unscathed and is already seeing someone else. He even created a Spotify playlist for her. Did nothing of this sort when he was seeing me. I can’t seem to stop this hurt. I really can’t",lonely,End of this short term relationship makes me feel suicidal. I tried my best.

4029,Street_Interaction84,1652059035,1,"People of Reddit, I’m pretty sure a lot of people aren’t going to see this post but yesterday over a 4 hour call with my best friend who’s in New York, I finally told her how strongly I felt for a guy, let’s call him X. A little background on me is that, I’ve been in love before or At least I thought it to be love. I can quite honestly say that throughout those 4 years of my life I had been nothing but honest, loyal and trusting but he at the same time used to gaslight me, cheat on me multiple times and keep on calling me psycho for calling him out on his shit. One day I had enough and I left, I left the relationship which once had meant the world to me. After a year of blocking my ex and no contact I started talking to X who just happened to reply on one of my Instagram stories. We talked and talked and it felt unreal, I had never believed that I’d ever be truly in love after the whole situation with my ex, but this guy kept on coming in my life breaking thru all the walls I had put up. I never believed in love meant for you at the right time, but after this guy came into my life I realised that was true because I studied with X for two years in the same space and social circle and subjects before I moved to london for uni. What was kind of unbelievable is that I had never even thought about this guy romantically until after I left and was 3000 miles away from him. After almost 2 months of texting back and forth, he came to London. He was visiting his grandparents in london along with his mother and he was here for almost a month. Out of 30 days we hanged out for 20ish days. I had been the happiest I ever was with him and the memories I made I still cherish. After he went back home I couldn’t control the feeling I felt for him. Even though I tried to repress it, hide it or just run away from it. I couldn’t because I had truly fallen head over heels for this guy. This wasn’t the normal definition of love, I didn’t love him because he was mine or he was with me. I loved him because it was simply him, in a way he helped me reconnect with god, not by being religious or even talking about religion but just by existing and being such a beautiful human. When I pray to God I do not ask God to give me this person, I ask God to keep X happy no matter what, I ask God to make place for me in his heart and that if he is meant for me, make it easier for me to accept it, to accept him. It’s hard for me come to terms with the fact that what I feel for him is something I’ve never felt before, I’ve never been so helpless when it comes to love. I’ve always got the person I wanted in a matter of days. But for X it’s like I don’t want to rush things in fear of them being ruined, I’m afraid to loose him even though I don’t really have him. Him existing in my life is important, and maybe I don’t want to be in a relationship with him because I think so much of him that the day he breaks my heart I won’t be able to take it. That would be a heart break that would end up consuming my soul. Loving him from afar would be much easier than having him commit to me only to break me later on :(

4030,selfharmthrowaway19,1652058576,1,"I had a bittersweet day I guess. I saw a movie with my brother and his friends, like I said, *his* friends, I don't have any of my own.

I already hadn't slept last night whatsoever, so I already felt/feel pretty bad, the lack of sleep also contributed to the anxiety I've had all day, it did distract me during a good chunk of the movie, but I still definitely enjoyed it and had a good time overall. 

Also, in this group of people was a girl I have a crush on for some reason, even though I don't know her at all, and vice versa. We've never actually spoken one on one  before, outside of extremely hand-waved interactions over the years. 

Today was no different, not that I expected or felt like I deserved anything, but every time I know I'm gonna be around her, in the back of my mind I think ""Wow, what if this is the time where we end up interacting and something crazy happens, like we continue to interact via social media or something outside of this occasion?"".

Anyway, on the way out of the theater, we're all walking through the hallway that leads to the exit.

My brother, whom I pathetically follow around like a lost puppy whenever I'm involved in one of his get-togethers, goes into the bathroom. 

After this, I'm just standing by myself in front of the rest of the group, his friends, they don't notice me because they're all talking about the movie and or looking at their phones, but in that moment I realized that I was staring at a bunch of strangers. They aren't *my* friends, and the idea of mingling with them there was terrifying. After I realized this in a matter of seconds, I just went straight into the bathroom to avoid it. I did also have to go to the bathroom, but that moment was what really motivated me to go in.

I'm in bed now. It's irrelevant, but I spent the 40 dollars of spending money I had on 3 phone chargers and cookies. I realize that I bought one more charger than needed, so I could've had 10 dollars left. Whatever though.

Now I'm gonna try to sleep. I have to wake up at a normal time tomorrow, and I dread that.

Ever since I could remember, my father has been taking care of me. I wish I could have a mother just for mothers day so I wouldn't be left out. I feel left out, seeing kids bonding with their mothers. 

I see my own mother as the equivalent of Satan. She is homophobic, narcissistic, anti-vax, racist, sexist, you name it. She says she'll disown me if I get a girlfriend. She disowns me because she read my diary and found out I'm trans. She says hurtful things like ""I'd rather have a dead kid than a gay kid."" 

People tell me to forgive her. I won't because we're like 2 raging, charging bulls fighting, neither giving up or backing down. She doesn't deserve forgiveness. She's had *way* too many chances to change. She won't. She is very attention-seeking. 

She always babies me. I'm 14. I have zero freedoms when I'm with her. She signed me up for weight loss stuff because ""I'd rather have a dead kid than a fat kid."" I'm very skinny for my age. I'm severely underweight. 

She says she'd ""rather have a dead kid than an unhealthy kid."" She's very fat and overweight, made zero effort in losing it. Blames it on me because ""you made a deal with the devil to make me fat."" 

I only used an Ouija board *once* because I was peer pressured by my friends, who were very popular, when I was 11. I was very naive and stupid, I always wanted to be in the popular crowd. I played the *whole* way through. Not once did I mention my mother. The only things I said were ""Is anyone there?"" and ""Thank you so much for speaking to us, we really appreciate it, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, goodbye."" I was a sweet kid. Didn't even know what an Ouija Board was. Didn't touch one since. Yes, they did claim they were a good spirit named Zoey.

Anyways, she claimed that I was making deals with the devil and cursing her. She's insane. She thinks the world revolves around her. She is very entitled. 

My parents are separated and she once just strolled into my house while I was home alone as if she owned it. Her name is on the deed but still. I told her to (not too kindly) get the fuck out of my house or I'll call the police. She tried to call my bluff. They said that they couldn't do anything as ""well, she owns it too so she can do that."" I was pissed.

When my parents went to court, the court said that I must see her *every freaking Sunday until I'm 16 and can decide* I also have to call her every night, no choice until I'm 16. I'm ashamed of her.

If you're a genuinely good parent, with kids, I'd love an online parent. I really need someone. I'd prefer Discord but whatever works. I'd love to be friends with your kids if they're around my age as well. I'm really lonely. I'd love to celebrate mother's day with a mother figure. I'm in Massachusetts so timezones may be an issue.

I’ve felt like this nearly my entire life whether it be with family or friends but it’s never been more apparent than now. It seems like I have to carry everything in a relationship. Making plans, starting and maintaining conversations - all done by me. It honestly feels like no one really likes me but feels pressured to be my friend through my persistence alone.

And now I’m losing even that. I’ve pretty much stopped looking at my phone now. I never have any messages or contact from others. Where are those ‘checking up on a depressed friend’ and ‘adopting an introvert’ people that seemingly exist somewhere.

I feel like I’m out at sea and all of the life boats are sailing away because they’ve grown bored of me.

At work it seems like everyone is friends with each other and I’m the odd one out. The same at university and with my own family. I’ll be asked the same 3 or 4 questions about work and school and then I’ll be left alone until it’s time to part.

Since kid, people always called me fat (even though I wanst) and said I have too much facial hair (I became completely self aware about it). Teenagers would talk about my nose and acne. The only thing people would complement about me was my hair but with age they changed and people would talk about how ugly it was. So with all that my self esteem was inexistent and I didn’t believe I could be love.

In the other hand, G was never bullied about almost anything, only her brows what she could easily fix and she was always complimented about her physics and how beautiful she was.

M was always complimented too, she’s the pretty older sister that everybody likes.

Till this day I don’t know why but when we were all in social event my sisters or my father would ask to people to rank us to the most pretty to the ugliest… I let you guess who always was the last on

Hey im Mia and im 18, my boyfriend is 18
I just want to open up and vent to anyone because I have no one.

So for a little background me and my boyfriend don't live together and we don't get to see eachother as often , and I'm not a girlfriend to complain to him that ""he works to much"", I keep it to myself. We do text and rarley communicate our feelings as much due to the fact he works and hes very tired and exhausted to hear me complain lol, but we only get to text for 10 minutes and he's off to work again...

Now let's get to the problem, he started working retail about 3 months ago , his shifts start from 8pm -5am . So when he does get home he goes to bed, wakes up around 6pm and 2 hours to get ready to work again, it's the same sceduale every day . My problem is that he's not very lovey dovey as much only when it conveys to his hornyness,  the other problem is that when he does get a 2 day break he sleeps which is fine but he goes straight to gaming and once he's done gaming he goes to bed and does the same thing over again . 
I'm not sure if I'm being too hypocritical about his job or him , but I've been feeling sad and drained putting so much energy on this relationship im constantly the one asking how is his day going, what did he do, what did u eat, Simple little questions.
 
Their was this time he got upset at me for not sending him a late night paragraph. I passed out because I was sleepy . But, he's the one at work having breaks and never once has he sent me one. 

Overall, I'm not sure if I'm sounding crazy or if I'm  doing something wrong in this relationship,  I don't know what to do or say because I just need advice .",lonely,boyfriend works to much ..,2022-05-09 09:14:53

I can't afford a good therapist, though I know which one and I can't seem to forgive my parents and ask for their help. I want them to see me in pain and know how they fucked up my life by being emotionally neglectful. The ultimate your sacrifices were for nothing. Yeah it's kinda pitiful to still be this angry at your parents in your 30s, but I can't seem to let this resentment go. I pushed my friends away because I cant trust them. I had a somewhat stressful childhood and lacked support and a few traumatic experiences but nothing too out of the ordinary. Mostly its short of providing the basics of food I felt that nobody had any space to care and I was supposed to be the mature one at my age and not ask the because even then I recognized how overwhelmed they were. Now I'm older and moved back home to see if I could use it to gain some ground in employment but couldn't. I can't stand the thought of my parents seeing me happy after the shit I've gone through. Now that they are emotional and needy and society wants me to take care of them and they are playing the same guilt games.

This feeling of panic with me thinking, why can't that ever be me became so loud I ended up breaking down for a while. It wasn't about them but what they represented. He was good looking, and so was she. Obviously I know why it will never be me, but just seeing them was too much for me. I know someone will say you can't let that get to you and focus on yourself. Easier said than done especially if you have never had a relationship. The way she looked at him was something I've craved my entire adult life.

Most of the time, didn't really care about being alone. I hear all the time about how Jonah has all these problems, Lauren talks crap, and Ronnie stabbing people in the back, so I figured I'm better off alone. No drama, no new problems or worries, no having to feel bad about not being able to help people. 

This happened every so often where I would feel lonely, but it's hitting like a truck. I'm getting older and I figured by now i'd have made a friend but I have nothing. I have a job, I talk to people, but it's nothing conversations. Work safe BS. I don't have anyone I can connect to on a human level. I have siblings and never had any connection to them. Everyone feels like they're on different planes of reality. It doesn't help that I have borderline personality disorder either, along with autism, and just abandonment issues in general. So I mean, all that combining into me just makes me very untrusting, and worried about any kind of connection, for the thought of it being severed. 

I don't know what to do at all. I've tried going it alone, and it hurts. And for the love of everything you believe in, please, I'm begging you.

4059,Shadowdragon409,1652049392,1,"I've recently realized that if you're lonely, curing it is nearly impossible. When you meet new people, not only do you have to vet them, but they are also vetting you. If you're feeling sad, or you come across as desperate, they won't want anything to do with you. Let's be real. Most people who are lonely are sad and desperate. These qualities are seen as toxic and undesirable. You have to fake happiness and cheeriness to get people to talk to you and like you, and while you're doing that, you feel like you can't be your true self around them. You're giving them a facade and you're not making a true connection. It's a lose lose situation which only worsens the problem. It makes you feel like giving up and asking ""What's the point?"" This makes it less likely for you to reach out to people and try to make a connection, and each rejection makes you question whether it's truly worth it. Eventually you think ""Oh, I guess I'll be alone. I'm ok with this."" Until you get desperate to reach out again and start the process over.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it isn't any body else's fault. Why shouldn't they want someone cheery and fun to be around? Would you want to be with someone that ruins your mood? 

So what's the solution? Honestly, I don't know. Something needs to change, but that's easier said than done. The only thing we can do is keep trying and hope our efforts are rewarded.",lonely,Loneliness is a Vicious cycle that almost nobody will help you escape.,2022-05-09 08:36:32

For a while I stopped giving a shit about myself and what I looked like. I gained weight and stopped caring about my appearance because nobody wanted me. For a while I was like that. I didn't leave my house unnecessarily and if I did I just threw on a  band shirt and some old leggings.  

My mom convinced me to attempt to lose the weight I gained if nothing else for my health. So I restarted my gym membership and I even got a personal trainer.  I dropped weight and I was starting to feel a little better about myself.  With that I started wearing a little makeup and dressing a little nicer. I even bought the platform shoes I've had my eye on for weeks and braided my hair. 

The whole time not one guy or girl even looked my way. I didn't get any dates and I damn sure didn't get a bf or gf. I didn't even have one greasy ass dude in my inbox looking to blow my back out.  It was like this for weeks, I started to feel like shit again so I went back to the band shirts and old leggings.  I bought shirts three sizes too big just to hide more of myself in.

However, I've never really felt like I fit in anywhere, I've had close friends over the years but as time passes and life changes they become more distant. I've never had that 'close' group of friends and sometimes I find that really lonely. Sometimes I feel like no one really knows me. As I was in relationships from the age of 17 (almost 10 years with maybe a year gap) I always had someone who I felt knew me and I didn't have to perform for at all. But I've been single now for around two years and I do struggle with that feeling of being alone even though I do have some close friends. Does anyone else relate? I also find it difficult to balance my energy, sometimes I can feel really drained just by being around people and have to then rest and recharge.

She is jealous if I get better grades than her(I always get). She always jokes about how much I study but tbh I don't study at all(because of my mental health) whereas she studies 24×7.But she is always like ""Ohhh!!

I realize I can’t think along these lines or at least I shouldn’t since I have nothing right now. I’m nowhere close to where I’d wanna be neither I haven’t figured out where I’d wanna be.

I think I’d be able to graduate considering barely any coding heavy courses are left and it’s mostly earth science, math and physics which are relatively a pushover for me, but yet again I find that sentiment so troubling. Math and science shouldn’t be thought of as a pushover but should instead ignite feelings of curiosity. Maybe it’s because most things don’t faze me anymore. Maybe I’ve felt everything I’ll ever feel and so I’ll never feel again. Maybe I’m being cynical towards my own mind and my own feelings. I wish I knew what it really is. Maybe I’m not supposed to know or that maybe figuring out is the real answer. Even writing this feels pointless especially if nobody will ever read this. Since, it feels so pointless coz nobody would be able to really understand and I’d instead get the ignorant “hey, it’s not that deep” or “that’s pretty gay bro”, which is still better than the fake “omg that’s so relatable” or the absurd sympathy. How can one offer sympathy when you can’t even fathom the struggle. Life isn’t exactly high stakes and I’m not losing either, the struggle is with feeling this weird ineffable feeling that even I can’t really understand and you’d offer sympathy when even the sufferer can’t fathom his own situation?

I've written on here before seeking advice/help. Please see my post history for more background. 

I'm turned 30 on 7th May. Looking back I've nothing to show for these 29 years. I grew up waiting and expecting life to happen and it just didn't. Not for me anyway. I've never had a girlfriend and struggle in most social situations. I'm really lonely. The only people I speak to are my family and people at/involving work. 

The worst thing is I try to go out of my way to help people. If I know someone is going though a difficult period, I try to make them smile and laugh. Sometimes at my own expense.

I did follow up on some of the advice I was given. I joined a gym. Lost over 2 stone in 6 weeks but no one talks to anyone. Everyone stays in their own little groups of friends or just stick their headphones on. 

I signed up to online dating. Haven't had anything yet. Don't even know where to start with this really. 

I'm half and half about online therapy. Probably too late for me at my time of life. 

I'm starting to realise that I'm never going to have the life I dreamed of or a family of own that I yearn for. 

You can probably imagine how I'm feeling now if you haven't already guessed. Lost is one and the overall feeling of defeat. 

Anybody have any further advice or hope to offer?

It's sort of like the negative aspects of solipsism, you only know what's in your own brain and that is lonely. 

Sure you can have shared experiences and sometimes experiences that seem to transgress and blur that line, usually with a significant other or very close friends. Once I was on mushrooms and I swear my friend and I were communicating telepathically.

Anyway I've been trying to get out there and be more social. But then I am hang-out with people who aren't super close friends. But they are all happy and gregarious, and I can be too. I can mirror the mood easily. And honesty there is much more factors to my specific situations that prbabsly resulting my lonely feeling being extra amplified. 

However I've had this feeling not all all time, or in every situation but frequently since I was a child. Where I am around others the mood is good people are vibing, but inside my head it all feels plastic. Like I'm not on their level of sociability. And I resky try not to compare myself to others. I almost always feel this sense of alienation and it makes me want to run away; run to where zi can be *truly* alone and in that more comfortable. 

Sometimes being lonely, truly alone, *can* be more comfortable than being around others. And it sort of reinforces why I am alone. I don't like it, but it's somtimez better than being around people  who you don't get or who don't get you.

I then found a friend in substances and started hanging out with criminals and the isolation that comes from that world. That lifestyle doesn't last long. I ended up spending over a decade in prison. 

Now, I'm older, somewhat wiser and I finally stopped and turned around to see the wreckage I caused. Man, I wrecked a lot of lives. 

 No family. Or none that want to associate with me. I have a few friends but not that they will ever understand me. And this lockdown isolated me even more. I don't know if those friends are still there.  I never had a girlfriend. Sex was for getting off and not for intimacy, whatever that is. 

Now I'm in my forties and I went from being alone to lonely. It's somewhat crippling when I stop and let those thoughts become intrusive. For those that are young. Do whatever you can to rewrite the path your on. There ain't no sunshine on this path at all. Just regret. I wish somebody had gotten to me when I was young, instead of ignoring me.",lonely,I never regretted being lonely until my mid forties,2022-05-09 02:11:41
4123,cryoshiki,1652025018,1,"I've never had a girlfriend / boyfriend, never held hands with anyone before, never kissed anyone, virgin (go figure), never had a friend group. no matter how many times i've tried to fit in. i'm quiet so people forget i exist, i'm not attractive either so i'm pretty sure my looks on top of my quiet and shy manner scare people especially women away.

i have hobbies i really enjoy that i wish i could share with people who cared. no one likes the same music as me, the same anime as me, the same games as me. i like fashion but i'm too broke to afford and nervous to dress myself how i want to. i've started more self care last year and working into my looks but i still feel like an ugly fuck when i'm out in public. like everyones eyes are focused on me.

i just go to work. come home to play lost ark alone, maybe genshin. browse tiktok and get a good laugh, probably find a funny video i want to send to someone then i realize i have no one to. end up seeing a happy couple and feeling worse than i started. i can't enjoy the shows i used to love, romance anime make me want to throw up. i have no motivation to open a book anymore either.

i'm an insomniac. i can't sleep longer than 4 hours a night. i survive off caffeine at work as well. i feel like pure shit the whole day on top of my worsening mental health. life could be worse for me honestly. i have a family that cares, a stable household and everything yet i still feel like &gt;!offing myself!&lt; every day. the guilt for not appreciating the few good things i have in my life hurts me even more.

really i just feel so desperate for basic human interaction. i used to log into vrchat everynight just to listen to people talk so i feel like i'm around friends. i only have 2 friends i speak to online. they're both slowly losing interest in me and its been a week since i've called anyone. tldr i'm lonely, desperate for friends, craving feelings i can't experience, jealous of normal people. but i'm a guy in 2022 so who really cares.",lonely,perpetual loneliness is ruining me,2022-05-09 01:50:18

I've done this multiple times to someone I hold dear to me that I've met through twitch in 2020 and I'm starting to feel guilty because aside from deleting them/unfollowing them multiple times I barely even watch their streams anymore (I always leave a lurk tho) I was actually thinking of apologizing since they probably are confused or haven't realized but I'm scared to apologize they'll probs not even open the msg but I can't stop thinking about it.

4127,Delightful_Bandage_2,1652022982,1,"Broke up a month ago with my long distance girlfriend who I met online. She decided that after all this time, the long distance is unbearable, and she said that eventhough I'm so loving and caring, she had to give that up because of the distance. This really shattered my heart and I've cried a lot about it. 

I started thinking about quiting my habit of getting to know new people, because look what attachment got me! But, I later realized that I have so so much more love to give, and a heartbreak should not change my personality into a blunt person, nor change what I deserve from my acquaintances.

I deserve consistency and honesty. I want a consistent friend who is not gonna fake promise things or ghost me for no reason. In return I'll be myself and put my time and effort to make your day better as I did with everyone else previously. All I ask for is matching my energy and being genuinely considerate and friendly.

I wouldn’t survive without coping strategies. Weed is the main one, I don’t know how I’d live without knowing that I can smoke weed and forget about how sad and worthless my life is. 

I also drink alcohol, masturbate, over eat fast food, walk for 5 hours or more, play video games, write self pitiful Reddit posts about how sad and lonely I am even though I know it won’t fix everything and no life advise is going to magically change anything. 

I try do positive coping strategies like picking up litter in the park, making music, etc but it gets lonely and stops working. I would volunteer loads if I wasn’t a social freak, but I hate meeting people because they don’t like me and find me uncomfortable to even stand near.

Most of the time everyone is too busy with mother's day to come celebrate with me. My husband kinda tries, but even when I tell him I want X, Y, and Z, he drops the ball... I told him I wanted a party, with balloons, the big shiny ones with your age, and wanted him to make it a big deal out of me turning 40. 

    I even put a party decorations bundle on my Amazon wishlist. What I got was a dinner with another couple, at one of my favorite restaurants. I loved the food and the company, don't get me wrong, but 40 is a milestone, and I wanted a bigger deal out of it. 

     He got me the exact gifts I wanted, but they are still in the Amazon packaging, he didn't even selected the giftwrapped option (he always does that because he WANTS to wrap it himself, with cuter wrapping), but he never actually ends up doing it, same thing happened on Christmas...

It’s almost unbelievable how sad and pathetic my life is, especially for someone my age. I’m supposed to be at the height of my life, enjoying every day with the company of others. but here I am, wasting my life away reading books and surfing the web. It’s quite depressing, really.
I can’t express how much I hate my life, my past, and my environment. I really have tried to improve my life in anyway possible, despite everything, but I never seem to succeed. It’s like i’m always dragged back to sadness and despair, as a result of my loneliness. I just want to live a happy and fulfilling life, surrounded by people whom i love. But, at this point, such a vision is practically fantasy. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have much hope that my life will improve from now on.

4140,Sharksroar,1652017119,1,"Like all art life is very subjective. No two persons can experience a same event equally, not possible even from a scientific point of view. I live the lifestyle of a natural philosopher, never involved myself with humans personally except family. But 4 years ago the sacred geometry of chance played the dice and threw a person at me, I accepted the person and started to discover the human side of things, not that I didn't knew but felt for the first time. She was the most sensible person that I'd met ever. I was never a person to chat with someone for hours but I started doing it not realizing how addicted I was becoming to it. And for a person like me its a divine bond or friendship. But at this very crucial event of my life while everything is crashing and there seems to be no point of doing anything, nature took that person away from me. The person's alive and left me. Nature gave me a taste of company and took it away in a snap of a finger. And the horrors that I never felt before has dawned upon me.

I'm just so over being single (it's over a year already), just so over having no local friends/no one who has time to hang out (fuckers are busy starting families and building houses) and certainly over having no energy to do any shit on my own.

COVID restrictions are finally gone, I could go out, do shit, meet people, but now my workplace is forcing over time on us again, got off work at 10pm on Friday, wasted my whole Saturday on sleeping and doing chores/groceries and now Sunday is also already half over and I have like 9 hours of weekend left to do what exactly?

And I shouldn't be playing, I should make time to go out and meet new people, no girl is coming to knock my door in after all, I'm 28 it would be a miracle to even find someone who isn't divorced, has a bunch of kids already and is down for something serious these days. At my workplace it's pretty much only guys and IMO it's generally a bad idea to seek romance where you work, yet on the weekends I usually don't have the energy left to go out, especially alone, it's no fun to do shit alone and I'm not exactly so extroverted that I make new friends within minutes, going out on my own usually means being on my own outside.

I had a friend over a few weeks ago and before he arrived, I fully cleaned all my apartment, I fell asleep early and quickly instead of like 4am because I didn’t want to be a couch potato around him and I wanted to wake up early and not wake up around 10:30 and stay in bed staring at my phone until noon. Basically, I pushed myself to be a better version of myself because there was someone around who could see what my life is like. And it isn’t one I want someone to see, so I was motivated to look like I’m doing better than I am and it actually made me feel better. Because I was proud of myself.

I have a job now but I didn’t have one for over a year up until last week, because I couldn’t motivate myself to find a new one and didn’t feel capable of doing anything. I spent a weekend with an aunt and she showed me a job ad : I immediately applied to it because I didn’t want her to perceive me as lazy, and that’s my job now. 

I can spend days without saying a word to another person, and I feel like it makes my brain lazy, out of a lack of stimulation. I notice I tend to be much more eloquent and coherent after being around someone for some time. I can’t imagine how helpful it must be to have someone to talk to daily. Especially if it’s a person you love and have fun with. Someone who stimulates you.

4159,delicoban33,1652002632,1,"There is no one that will pick us up from the ground. Nobody will come out of existence and give some love to us.  Loneliness cause us to seek more love, in other words; it will make us spend our love points to attract some love points. We need to keep our love points. There is no need to be extra nice to people. No need to show your good will. There is no reason to seek for love. It should come if it wants to come. 
Accept the loneliness. Accept you have noone. Wear it. Don't give anyone any love for free. It is so painful. It hurts. But we can't just spread love for free to except it to return back even more. Like everthing else in life, the things you gain without pain, are going to hurt more in the long run... This is how shitty this life works. So feel the pain of loneliness. Pay the price. Wait patiently. Keep your energy to yourself. Even though it can be so painful, you don't need love to live your life. We need to love ourselves first. Be a bit selfish. And people will come into our life by themselves.

There’s one quote in the Bible saying something like that. Why care about the hot chicks? It’s vanity. Why care about having friends? It’s vanity. Why care to stay busy or to occupy my weekends? It’s vanity. Why care to have a good response or to resolve insecurities or incompetencies in life? It’s all vanity. A couple of things I think that keep me attached are physical health and money I guess. I love the idea of being wealthy. Seems exciting and fun.

He sounded tired and stressed out from the day. Already made me feel guilty and want to leave but I stayed. He asked me basic info ab my situation and relationships. He kept asking questions and I felt better bc he cared enough to keep asking. It was like he was waiting to get to a point to make. Then 27 minutes passed - nothing. He basically thanked me for my time and ended the conversation. It was like he was reading a script (which I’m sure he was). I barely talked ab anything. All he did was agree and act like he understood to make me feel better so I wouldn’t get triggered. But knowing that just triggers me. Nobody helps. Mental health is a joke to the world.

Being an introvert, sometimes being alone is comfortable and gives me time to focus on things I have to do or like. But every time I come back to college I feel very crushed. I see people having a good time together going out to party or eat every day and having a group of friends to hang out with. Its not that I don't have friends.....they are mutually exclusive a lot of the time and have their own groups to hang out with as well....and hence I get to interact with them one on one but I don't have a group for myself. So at the end of the day...I end up not going anywhere ever, never going out for movies, not going to eat out and not being able to enjoy and being holed up and studying and wasting time on the internet. 

On top of that I don't even have a boyfriend and I see couples all around me and at one point its starts bothering me. Everyone I know has someone in their life and it makes me feel lonelier than ever. 

On top of that if I ever mistakenly mention to someone that oh I spend time alone or anything people start saying ""oh that's so sad""....does being alone have to be a sad thing? I know I shouldn't care about what people say but when three or four people say the same thing it makes me start questioning myself.

I am trying to put my efforts into studying and all but it doesn't pay off either. I am in constant fear of bringing bad grades and fucking up my gpa.

Sometimes I just wonder what actually happened. What went wrong, why did people stop talking to me, what is it about me that makes people avoid me. Ever since I left school I’ve been pretty lonely, my ex cheated on me and I was messed about by another girl. I wake up to find no messages, no new adds, no nothing. Just a few streaks on Snapchat. In my head, I am a confident person. I used to struggle with social anxiety, that’s no longer a bother. But why is it hard to make friends with new people? I’m not like the rest of the crowd who do drugs and drink etc. Not into hookups either. Relationships are worrisome for me cause I wouldn’t want to be hurt again, neither do I think I could fully trust someone again. The ‘friends’ I do have only usually want me when they want something, or when they’re bored. Any other time, like now, I’m in my bedroom on my phone scrolling away for hours. Even though I don’t want to. I see others out with their friends and old friends having fun and doing things, and I just ask myself, why can’t I do that? It’s been like this ever since I left school and all throughout college. I kind of accepted that this is how it is but at times like this, all I’m wanting is for someone to message me",lonely,What happened…,2022-05-08 12:04:40

it kinda fucked me up and i have depression so i spent 2 years after that thinking i wouldn’t be able to get a girl to want to spend time with me and that i’m not worthy of love. I tried a couple online dating apps because i live in a small town and all the girls i know are in college farrrr away from here. 

my friends make fun of my because of my lack of relationships and sex life. and i can tell they kind of think i’m a loser because of it. i’ve been on online dating apps for a while and have nothing to show for it. 

i usually end up getting ghosted or unmatched. I was actually talking to this girl and i thought it was going well because our conversations flowed perfectly. we have the same hobbies, a lot in common, and same music taste. 

as time went by she would take longer to respond. she actually apologized to me because she’s been taking a while to answer. ( i get it we all have lives and jobs to attend to.) but after that she ended up ghosting me and it’s been 2 days. that did kinda hurt tho lol.

one of my friends gets lots of female attention and dates but he’s pretty toxic. he treats woman pretty badly. he told me “ you’ve got to break girls down so they want you more” ive told him that’s messed up because i’m totally against that way of thinking and acting bc it’s fucked up and girls have feelings like we do. but it’s been working for him.

do nice guys really finish last? would being a toxic asshole get me female attention or should i just settle for being a mid guy who’s not interesting. i try being nice and focus on getting to know girls rather than fucking them. 

what am i doing wrong? i’m probably the problem. i’m not that bad of a guy like i’m told i’m funny and i’m not that ugly. slightly below average- average looking.

i’m tired of feeling lonely and unworthy and i’m also tired of my friends making fun of me because of how lonely i am.

4231,CheekyCzechChungus,1651969785,1,"Hi everyone, 
my story is a weird one (as am I) but kinda normal.
There was a girl, we saw each other daily for years, friendship developed, we talked a lot texted a lot, I grew to love her so much, she was the only bright thing I my days. But the love was one sided, it was devastating, but what could I do, give up the only light I have in my life? So we were friends, it was killing me and keeping me happy at the same time, I couldn't think of anything else or anyone else. In the morning and during the day I would be so happy and (other words describing ""happy"" I can't think of) and in the afternoon and evening I would cry like an idiot because I knew she was my one. 
This went on for years, but hey emotionally net positive for me, so I was ""happy"".

One day I fucked up, and I fucked up big time.
I tried to repair it but the damage was severe. 

And she was gone. Cut off all possible way of contact. And I was alone. So alone in the darkness, floating trying to paddle through stuff.
I can't talk to girls, I can't go to public really, when I see a pair of people talking, I start to fall apart. When I see someone kissing or holding hands, I feel so alone. Just alone and empty. 

I would give anything to just talk to her one more time. Just talk, about anything, weather, I don't care just talk. I looked around for help but I don't trust anyone and professionals are way too expensive to be viable. So I'm just sitting in the darkness alone and empty, without any emotion on the outside and all the bad emotions on the inside. I haven't been happy one single day since.

Not a throw away because fk it, it's reality.
Last year I ended a 10 year relationship due to escalating domestic violence. Subsequently, I relocated to my home state. I don't have any close family or biological children, only distant aunts and uncles that I don't have established relationships with. I moved home because I am familiar with it, found good therapy and I believed it would give me a sense the safety I had been in desperate need of. 
 A childhood friend offered to share his home with me and I gratefully accepted. I immediately found a wonderful job that is professionally satisfying and gives me a modicum of human interaction. Unfortunately my new roommate is a sever alcoholic and when I'm not working I'm either alone or tending to the household needs. 
 I've spent the majority of my life alone. I was orphaned in my preteens and cared for by a neglectful grandparent until I was 17. After college I lived alone and worked obsessively. In my later 20's I had friends, parties, camped, hiked and enjoyed the company I kept on a regular basis. At 30 I met the previously mentioned abusive SO. Over time that relationship soured and inline with run of the mill abuse I became more and more isolated. I reached my limit last year when he attempted to break my arm. After escaping that state, I find myself more alone than ever.
 My roommate stays blacked out during the day (I completely avoid him when he is drunk) and awake at night while I am sleeping. He's a wonderful person when he's not loaded but it's very, very rare.
 At 44, I have no idea how to change the situation. Bars are terrible (I honestly detest drinking after my ex), online dating is hellish and gross, most of the people I know are busy with spouses, children and work. I'm relatively attractive, loving, empathetic and kind. I am a bit ""quirky"" for my environment- tattoos, facial piercing, non-Christian (it's the south).
 I've began to dread my days off. I know I'll be alone, sometimes never speaking to anyone. I compensate by working much more than I should. 
 I know its corny but I literally just want someone to play with. I feel the bitterness creeping in and I don't want it.

4235,bikersquid333,1651968042,1,"Friendships, dating, work relationships, it's all been absolutely hopeless for me and they've all had knock-on effects to each other. I have struggled immensely in making, but most importantly keeping friends my whole life. Eventually at some point I figured that it's pretty much hopeless and I should just focus on finding a partner/girlfriend which would fulfil my social needs while also being potentially easier to find since it's just the one person I'd be looking for. 

Unfortunately the dating game has been hopeless for me. While at uni I didn't make any friends (as per usual) and so I pretty much never went out and found myself in situations to meet new people.  That left me to try my luck on dating apps which as most guys know is wholly useless and self-esteem destroying. I changed up my profile so many times, tried different apps, swiping tactics, you name it but I never got a single match along with maybe 6 or 7 likes total (over 4 years). I am not a bad-looking guy and I have (from an objective) perspective, a lot of things going for me but for whatever reason I have not had any luck. 

I think many romantic relationships are formed and found through friendship groups which I just don't have. It's like, I just need SOMETHING to start with. A base level energy to work forward and upward from, but when you're starting from zero or even below zero which is what it feels like for me, it's almost impossible to make any progress. 

As a result of all this, my overall mood and demeanour has obviously taken a massive hit and it's continuing to get worse. As a result, I think this comes across to colleagues at work who then avoid me or make fun of me or take advantage of me. My last boss downright abused me for absolutely no reason if I'm perfectly honest. Well.the only reason I can put it down to is the fact that I was fairly quiet, soft-spoken, timid and so he figured he could treat me like a doormat. The other reason is probably and most likely racism. I've dealt with that kind of behaviour/person before and It's always been the same treatment. 

Bottomline is I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't. It's an endless cycle of misery, confusion, self-doubt, anxiety, hopelessness, emptiness, anger, etc. 

I've written a couple posts like this already to which I've got almost zero response whereas there are posts which the OP simply states 'I'm very lonely and I feel horrible' and it gets so many comments and offers from people to talk. I wish even someone on here would care enough to offer their listening ear and maybe even some advice!

4237,singingsn4kes,1651967578,1,"TW: mention of suicidal ideation at the end 

It was my birthday yesterday, I turned 23 and spent the whole day alone. I cried so much my eyes swelled shut. This is the 5th consecutive birthday that I’ve spent by myself. 

My birthday has always sucked but this year was especially hard. I moved a few months ago to a whole new country where I have no friends (not that i had any real ones back home either) and a few family members that i’m not close to. 

The person I thought was my best/only friend had promised me for months that she’d come visit me for my birthday but she cancelled the trip last minute so she could spend the money&amp;time on her boyfriend instead then lied and blamed me for it. That really hurt because I was counting on her to actually care and not let me down. We’ve spoken before about why I hate my bday and I thought she was different. I let her get my hopes up, not that I wanted or expected a big extravagant birthday, but at least a brief chance at companionship and to be celebrated. 

Maybe I can’t blame her because pretty much everyone else forgot it was birthday too, including all my friends back home and my family I live literally next door to now.

This isn’t the first and probably not the last time I’ve been forgotten, my whole life has been like this. I looked through my old diaries yesterday and every bday entry since I was a child has been me wondering why i’m so unlovable. What makes some people worthy of recognition and celebration while I struggle through every year invisible. Im not important or valued by anyone in my life. I’m kept just close enough to be useful when needed but when it comes to my own needs and wants, everyone conveniently assumes I have some other closer group of people elsewhere that will actually care.

I feel so stupid thinking back to how excited I was just a few weeks ago. I even though that my bday falling on friday meant I might have a whole weekend of celebrations. How amazing it must be to have people willing to celebrate u for a whole weekend. Im so jealous of those girls who every year will have a bday party and a dinner, get their makeup done and dress up in special outfits, have people bring them balloons and a cake with candles to blow out. I can’t remember the last time I had a birthday wish. 

I feel like i’m kind of rambling so sorry about that. My mind has just been spiralling these past few days thinking about it all. My birthday feels like my yearly reminder of how unimportant, disposable and unloved I am. A confirmation that i’m truly alone. It reignites thoughts of unaliving myself because it’s so hard to argue i’d be missed by anyone when they clearly have no interest in my life. I’m supposed to move back to my old country soon but honestly I don’t see the point going back. I just want to escape forever.",lonely,birthday blues,2022-05-08 09:52:58
4238,throwaway0183701,1651967379,1,"I know I like her, she's all I've been fucking thinking about for days I'm honestly fixated on her to an unhealthy degree, all I want to do is sleep so I might dream again about her liking me. I'm not 100% sure she'd think I was a disgusting loser for not being able to drive now that I know how to use Uber, I could at least meet her places without having to ask her to pick me up every time.

But I'm still a worthless piece of shit even with Uber. I'm depressed and have now pretty bad anxiety, especially social, so I'm barely functional as a human. I don't see what I could ever add to her life. My therapist says I see relationships as transactional and implies that's the wrong way to look at it, but what other way is there? Either I'm useful to her, or I'm not, and she either values me or she doesn't depending on the answer.

But I mean, I guess I could still try. But I only ever see her at school. I've already missed the times when she came up to me asking for help on chem stuff, she's not gonna do that again, so I'd have to make my own opportunity. But wtf would I even do? Accost her right as class ends? In plain view of everyone, so they can all watch me trip over my tongue and get rejected and laughed at, or called creepy? That sounds like an unbearable experience, I don't think I'd come out of my room for months.

And she would just call me creepy, she wouldn't be interested in me. How could she be? She's the most beautiful girl in the school. The only reason I'm even typing this shit out instead of dismissing the very idea as abject lunacy is because that stupid dream infected my mind with hope, and got my head in the clouds. But I know if  I tried to actually do anything, my wings would melt and I'd come crashing back to reality. I don't know if I'd survive that, if I'm being completely honest.

Oof, wtf triggered my pretentious side to come out? Eww

Yeah, idk. The thought's great and all, and I'd be really and truly happy with her. God, the idea of getting to do homework with her every week in fall is so tantalizing. But that's all it is; tantalizing. Perfect and beautiful, but forever out of reach. She probably already has a boyfriend because who tf has ever seen her and not felt what I'm feeling? Surely somebody better than me has already been here, and succeeded. But even if she was single, she's better off without me. I'm just a detriment, me wanting her to like me is pure selfishness.

4254,Fabulous-Advantage,1651963824,1,"22 m. Never had a girlfriend or kiss, I felt like I tried but I know you can *always do more: you can always try harder, join more groups, etc.* Tried getting on dating apps but didn't have any friends for the pictures and was tired of it just being me, me, me and me. I've tried putting myself out there, volunteering, chatting up strangers, but each time maybe we had a good talk, but there was never any lasting interest that brought you back. It was a chore, ""Ok I gotta try to meet people now,"" I wasn't having fun with them, but I didn't really do anything fun that I enjoyed. This was because I try to be productive most days because otherwise I'd feel like since I'm not having fun with others, I might as well work. And when I take time to watch a show or something, I start to feel empty and feel like I have to be productive again. so it was my way to feel hopeful. 

I Joined the gym, try to talk to people but then they look away and I stop, because *I don't trust that they will respect me*. Here I am putting effort into normal people, when I've put effort into people over and over again and no one stayed. I always keep my hope up but sometimes *I forget* that I've tried making friends since I started college, now graduated. Therapists weren't able to help me apart from helping me correct some of my negative thinking patterns. Eventually one did say that some people don't have friends because they're too focused on things and productive and smart trying to do things in life. And the disappointing thing was the more I tried to not be that guy, the more I felt that was the path for me. I never wanted to be different.

At the very least, I'm still occasionally trying to meet people, still trying to find out what I like and what I want in a friend, but the same patterns keep repeating. Using dating apps, if I ask a question, they answer but don't ask back, now I don't even want to try a second time because I can tell they don't care. So I used to try again but then you feel like you've overextended and then it's fuck people man, the only thing I have is the consistent work I put into myself.

We used to text each other randomly, send memes, talking about our favorite artists, she would reply fast and we'd continue the chat until late. Ngl I also miss pillow talk with her, it's been a while, but it seems like it's only me feeling that way. I guess now that she has even more friends, she don't need me anymore lol. I mean, well, I get it that we'll have a whole different lives and growing up anyway but like, just wondering why it's only me who have no friend. I'm happy, but I'm lonely. Do you really need a lot of people to keep you entertained and happy? Idk.

I never had that life style as i chose to leave school early due to be bullied alot which led me to depression and even attempted suicide which my mum got through to me and helped me get my head on straight, then through some training program to help get some sort of qualifications to help get a job, i actually managed to do that, now because of how bullied i got i lost all confidence in myself and well fast forward to now aged 36! I still have no confidence in myself and my partner she does pretty much all that talking for me as she knows i struggle, 

I've never had a friend besides my partner which I've known like 20 plus years but the sad part is she was talking about some old guy stalking her and we said about me acting as if i gotten with her and we ended up being a couple so even then i didn't have the confidence to ask her out,

I try to evade myself every day focusing on studying or my favourite hobbies like lifting weights at the gym but I just cant stop thinking about her. Every day I am more and more tired of this. I know she knows the feelings I have for her, as the rest of the group, but it is clear that she doesnt reciprocate.

I always tell everyone I am ok but it is not true. I cry hard every night when I am finally alone.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

4337,Keyoism,1651926919,1,"Sup, never wrote one of these before. So I’ll be direct about it. I feel like a waste of space. I wanna die, so badly. Nothing I do or have done has meant anything. I come from a broken home you know the usual trivial shit. My step father treated me like shit and destroyed my self confidence of ever becoming anything with words that just won’t leave me alone till this day. Things he said and did to me still haunting me every fucking day.

I’m a black dude, I’m 27 and will be 28 in a few more weeks. Currently trying to get certificates so I can get a job troubleshooting somewhere — but other than that I’ve had nothing but dead end job after dead end job. My mother when she and my step father left each other ( this occurred on my 17th birthday - after years of abusing me and my siblings but mostly me almost specifically me actually — he’d decided that he was tired of looking at me. And that I needed to go because I was the reason why him and my mother couldn’t work or so he says. He has been there since I was 5. And has hated me since day 1. He never treated my brother like that but that’s because my brother's father was still in his life and would get him regularly , he had protection from him. Once I graduated that year we left. But my mother found out he was cheating - or so she told me. So that’s why things really ended but he used me as the excuse. Something that occurred for years and years prior. )

My mother, not liking the ultimatum, decided we’d leave together. Me, her, my little brother , and the child her and my step father had just made 3 years prior. Of course he'll dump her out with a baby. Despite being there for his original two kids who grew up with us , and he treated as if they could do no wrong. 

My mother grew resentful of me once we moved away however , blaming me for the fall of her relationship despite reassuring  me prior that it wasn’t cause of me — all I wanted was to go to college but she forced me to get a real job and make money to help out. I did this until I was fed up with it and we got into another heated fight that year about school before she ended up kicking me out as well. 

And that’s when everything goes to shit. I get a decent job but I end up letting years go by. Love is lost over and over. I become a toxic person but mostly because it’s how I’ve had to survive up until that point. I look back on all the things I’ve done and I realize that a lot of my hardships are because of me, and only me. And now as I get older and I am currently without a job again after holding one finally for 2 years after moving to Florida from South Carolina where I lived my whole life -  currently living with my girlfriends partners and trying to get by. They say they’ll let me finish my classes but everyone has said they’d help me before and they turned their backs on me so I don’t believe them. I feel like I’ll let them down with the opportunity they’ve given me. And that the easiest thing to do in all of this. 

Is to just die. Why go through this, put someone through dealing with a no good piece of shit who can’t hold work and has no skills to get proper work. I’m nothing and shouldn’t have been born , I can tell , nothing I do goes right. I suffer from depression and anxiety on the severe scale. But I don’t take medication. I also have severe ADD and it makes it hard to stay focused. I feel as though sometimes with all the shit that’s wrong with me that ending it would be easier on everyone. 

Off topic but my little brother ended up getting into a horrible accident 2 years ago that left him a cripple - kid was huge to you know. Big and strong , and was only 21. Now his mind is broken due to the accident and all I could do was feel sorry that I wasn’t there enough before the accident and how I’m a shitty brother - I’d just seen him the night before after not seeing him in months prior, and then bam. Life changing accident. My luck must’ve attached  on to him. My mother takes care of him with families help. I once stayed there to help, was the first one to at that. But me and my mother didn’t see eye to eye and she ended up telling me to leave. It’s deeper than that but that’s as far as I’ll go. 

Now In Florida I’m desperately putting the pieces of my self together and have come to the conclusion that for a waste of space like me that maybe just dying would be easier on everyone who has to deal with me. I’m tired of being so negative in my head , hating myself for loves lost. And how I’m a colossal failure as a man and a son. I hate myself. I’m a fat waste of space. And I honestly just wanna die. 

I only typed this here because I felt like it would make me feel better if I got it out. But honestly it didn’t.",lonely,What’s the point of it all. ( talking about nonaliving - fair warning ),2022-05-07 22:35:19

4356,GlitteryGhost1,1651912085,1,"It's official, my mind is broken. Every day now I have all these negative memories flood through my mind, all of these unanswered questions, the disbelief and heartbreak. 

I'm now in a place where I'm so uncomfortable in my skin, nothing can shake me out of my trance long enough to be happy. Whenever I try to pursue a hobby, I can't stop remembering the people who left. I question that if I was more interesting, maybe they wouldn't have left. So the hobbies I have are wrong and bland... 

Then it can be simple stuff like feeling good about myself, but if I was such a brilliant and comforting person like I used to describe myself as, why would people discard me like nothing and leave me with bruises? I must've been so boring, pitiful and wasteful...

Then stuff like making jokes. You think you're funny? Well, nobody can remember that personality trait of yours. They all left. You're disposable. 

And it's been tormenting me daily, because this is all that I went through, while anhedonic for 2 years. During the time I was anhedonic, I've been through a lot of hurt. 

I've had people enter my family home, sit down with us at dinner (special times) and say with a heartfelt smile that ""I've never felt so welcome at someone's place before!"" only to eventually declare that we're awful pieces of garbage and leave. Only to try robbing money from us, and leave. 

We had someone else come in, try to make out that she was going to be a long lasting family friend, only to become hateful towards us in the end. 

I had a therapist who was trying to help me regain my confidence, I never went outside much. She asked if I had any friends living in this town and I had one. We didn't speak for a year, but I remember how we used to sit together during college break, went for long night walks, hung out at the park for a laugh, he helped me walk to my first job because we got lost, I visited his place and would watch stupid videos. We were STILL in college! 

So I was brave and reached out, when we began talking it was like nothing changed. I wrongfully thought maybe there was a chance. So I invited him out for a drink (just a coke) and he could've said no, he had every right to say no, but he agreed. 

During out meet up the one thing he comes out with is how ""weird"" it is. He looks at me as if I've done the most batshit insane thing. ""It's weird how you invited me out"". 

He then goes on to talk about how he was a bad person and that there was a girl called Chloe, that he briefly dated but kept ignoring her until midnight and would avoid seeing her etc. It sounded just like how he treated me... I didn't know if he forgot... or if there was some girl called Chloe who he did the same to... 

When we left, I texted him on Facebook and thanked him for meeting up, but I was also curious. Why did it take until now to see each other? His response, ""fuck off, I already met up with you isn't that enough?!"" 

Then I had another friend, well... I hadn't seen her for years but she was one of my best friends in school. I had so many awesome childhood memories. Just imagine how shocked I was when she added me on Facebook and told me she wanted to reconnect. She remembered that I loved to draw so asked whether I'd like to hang out at hers and maybe help decorate her room too. 

She was always so nice to me back then so I didn't expect anything bad. Well, when I tried asking if she wanted to hang out again sometime, she told me ""no offense but our friendship sail years ago. No offense, but I don't like you anymore!"" 

When I asked if she used me to paint her room, she just said something along the lines of ""LOL, that's right"". 

...crushed. 

Another person I got in touch with, I had a crush on. He discovered this and weirdly we became FWBs. We never saw one another in person though. He kept on telling me that he could see us being together someday, etc. He also kept mentioning how he was loyal, genuine and would never hurt anyone. 

Well, one day we arrange to hang out and I'm looking forward to it. The day passes and he tells me that I can't come over, because he has to take an ID photo... even though we were planning to visit town together. Afterwards he then bluntly tells me that I can't ring him anymore, even though before he said I was welcome to anytime. 

Eventually he does this thing where he on and off puts me on ignore, while I'm wondering what I did wrong. After this we chat over the phone, I'm in tears and he tells me to stop being dramatic...

He tried contacting me this year, asking if we could ""talk please x""
I never answered. 

Then there was another friend who a speech and language therapist recommended, she was in this group I joined so it was a good idea. I really related so well to her, she was the kind of person to be so down to Earth about everything, she was a fan of being open and communicating properly with friends. In fact, she had tons of friends, who got on with her because of her openness. 

Well, at the time I was going through severe anhedonia. She knew this and told me I was free to vent whenever, because she'll listen. Nobody should have to see a therapist just to talk, she said. 

I did... and eventually she told me that I was seeking so much validation, it was toxic in her eyes. So I stopped bringing anything up. Afterwards I remember a conversation where she told me that I can't just judge someone for what they've done wrong (correct!) because everyone has good in them (okay!) 

Yes, even my neighbour that threatened to kill my dogs when I was a child, even the neighbour who bashed my fence in while violently yelling at us, even the neighbour that attempted to crash my dad's car by cutting the belt (the belt to control the car). Even the neighbour who spread rumours about us. 

Because they're human too, she said. And if I got to know them, they might be different. 

Then I had another friend,.who didn't really do anything serious but it still kind of hurt, as I wish she would've just been honest. I asked if I could hang out with her, she said yes. So before the day I get there she tells me that she doesn't want to hang out, because it might rain. It doesn't rain. Then when I ask why she changed her mind. She said, ""wow the weather was sure bad, huh?"" 

Then the biggest one of all. In 2016, I had finally overcome my depression. It was a huge step for me to be able to go out into public, with a massive smile on my face and not be afraid. I was able to catch buses anywhere, whereas before I was frightened. I started cutting out caffiene, took care of my body more than I've ever done (dental hygiene, vitamins, eating, etc). I was on top of the world! 

Well, a friend at the time, was happy for me. He was someone I met in school, he knew all about the dark thoughts as he would sit down with me during break and hear me out, things we're so rough with my neighbours back then and the bullying. But he wanted to be there, and I appreciated it a lot. 

One day, he mentions to me about dating and how great it is. At the time I wasn't interested and only wanted to focus on me. In the end, I was brainwashed into getting together with him. I fell for him in the past, so I didn't turn him down. Well, whenever I wanted to visit his place, he'd often tell me that his mum didn't like strangers visiting. 

Which at the time was a massive lie, as my dad collected him from his house once so me and him could go to a theme park. His mum said hello to me and was kind. 

But I didn't see this and one day he lets me over, his mum isn't there, he uses me for favours. I'm used, discarded, and he turns our mutual friends against me. When he broke up with me, he was shocked when I didn't want to remain friends... he had no expression when I cried and hid his laptop screen from his mum when she entered the room... 

Then another friend! This guy I met online and I was still dealing with anhedonia (2020). He read some of my posts on Reddit and felt bad for me, and asked if I needed someone to chat with. When we began chatting, it became an every day thing. We would share memes, talk about life, etc. One day he decides to stop and ignore me. I asked why, he didn't respond. So I said, ""I thought we were friends?"" He told me, ""why label it"". So cold... 

Then another friend, this one was an LGBT rep at the college. She was known as very friendly and supportive, in fact the student counselor thought it would be great if I got to know her. Well I did, and one day she invites me to an LGBT bowling night she sets up. For each ticket we got a burger, fries and drink. 

At the time, we used to talk a lot on Messenger. Whenever she reached a low, I'd support her and lift her spirits. We spoke about meeting up in person. She was awesome! 

So the last thing I expected was for everyone to finish the burger and fries without saving me a plate... the last thing I expected was for her to ignore me the whole time, as I'm sat in the corner not knowing anyone (and having situational mutism didn't help, as I couldn't physically speak, so it was hard to introduce myself to anyone even when I desperately wanted to. My voice box refused to work!) 

I didn't expect her not to notice when I left early. 

And when I brought up how I felt during that night, I didn't expect her to tell me that she did her best so it wasn't HER fault that I missed out. 

Our friendship ceased. LGBT rep... 

So many things at once, and I just don't know why... I wish these people could've not bothered. I wish they could've kept me at a distance, instead of saying we're friends. I wish we never met. 

I really just want to die. Imagine questioning your entire personality and being so distraught and ashamed about it.",lonely,It hurts... it just hurts...,2022-05-07 18:28:05

TW: Mention of suicide

I’m so tired of moving from school to school.  I just want stability in my life.  My parents have moved many times and I’ve been through several different schools.  I’m tired of trying to make friends; I think Ive forgot how to.  Having no friends will give you such a miserable outlook on the world, you begin to despise everyone around you, leading you down an even more isolating road.  I remember getting back home from middle school and having to watch my 4 younger siblings after a draining day of school.  It was the most miserable time of my life, I felt so misunderstood and lonely.  I nearly killed my self.

However, I’m going to a new High School at the end of summer and I’m doing a lot of mental preparation.  I’m going to really try to make friends this year, I’m hoping high school will be memorable for me.  Staying positive; there’s no time to waste. 💞

4372,PixelBits_49,1651904325,1,"The dream started with me in some kind of class. We were doing some work, and I was sitting besides this girl that I instantly recognized as one of my classmates during secondary school. The weird thing is that I've barely spoke with her in real life and we didn't know each other at all, for me she was just another random classmate. But apparently in this dream I was close friends with her, and we talked about some work stuff without feeling weird or anxious like I usually do when interacting with other people. In fact, I actually felt relaxed talking to her, the conversations went smoothly (obviously since I'm tecnically talking to myself in a dream) and I was being myself basically.

After that, the dream cuts in to a different scene. I was in the backseat of a car with her, and someone else was driving us home during midnight, after the class. We were both quite tired so we didn't talk much, but I still felt good around her. I was distracted looking at something through the window, when suddenly she laid her head on my lap and fell asleep. This really took me by surprise obviously, but at the same time, it made me feel... fuzzy. I've never received any kind of physical affection from anyone other than my parents, so what happened in this dream made me feel actually happy and deserving of love. I started caressing and playing with her hair, and at some point my vision started to blur and I also fell asleep...

Then, my dream completely changes into something unrelated that I don't remember, and that's when I realize that everything was made up. I woke up feeling both sad and confused. Knowing that all that comfort and wholesomeness was just a product of my imagination made me feel quite pathetic to be honest. It was like a reminder of how alone I am, and how touch-starved I feel sometimes...",lonely,Just had a dream where I received affection from someone I don't even know,2022-05-07 16:18:45
4373,joshuabra,1651903393,1,"I used to post here on my old account. I’m 27m and just moved to a new city with much better dating opportunities. 


I just don’t have the confidence to date, and I’m not sure who’s in my league. I love being alone. 


I’d like to date an introverted girl. I’m very introverted. I make decent money, have a nice apartment, I look okay. I just got a gym membership. I love getting tattoos, I even do my own sometimes. I ride a motorcycle. I’m financially responsible. I like learning about the universe. 

I’ve been in relationships, but never really felt anything except for one person, but they were a narcissist. So that messed with my mind for a while. So I decided to be single for a while. I’ve done a lot of psychedelics to heal and think. I think a lot but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Some people don’t think enough. 


When I’m feeling lonely, I just don’t feel like downloading an app or talking to people. I’m really introverted, and I feel like they could choose better options (even if that’s not entirely true). 

I’m comfortable alone. Time flows slowly and peacefully. I’m trustworthy, calm and observant. I don’t do hookups, I think I’m demisexual. I’d like to find someone like me, but that requires actually trying. I can’t do it for some reason. 

I hate taking pictures of myself. I don’t know many guys that do though. So if I had to take some for my dating profile it would be a hassle. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m just an observer of this world. I watch everything pass me by. I see couples and feel happy for them. I feel like that could never be me. The earth keeps spinning while I witness the birth and decay of matter. People living their lives while I float past them like a cloud.

Silly, I know. It’s too cliché.

A grown ass woman filling her loneliness with wine and a feel-good romance story? Tale as old as time.

I would like to think tonight is a turning point.

Sitting on my bed wrapped in a towel and unmotivated to get dressed or brush out my sopping wet hair I am mourning the loss of things that never were, and never will be.

Yeah, I’ve mourned them before. So what makes this time different?

Admittance.

I haven’t admitted to a single soul that I haven’t moved on from things that happened over a year ago. The same week that I was ready to move forward with a risky and intoxicating relationship I was assaulted by my best friend. 

Within a week I lost the two men who were most important to me.

I spent a week after the assault processing and shoving everything down but after that week passed I forced myself back… you have to keep moving forward, you can’t just stop your life… but when I resurfaced the one I wanted was already with someone else. The one I wanted turned out to be an ass-hole no better than the one who took advantage—the one I wanted just used trickery instead.

It’s more than a year later. I’ve dated other people. Yet my mind still travels back to the passion that we had. Or... *I* had, and he pretended to have long enough to…

Like I said, tale as old as time.

My problem is that when I’m not catastrophizing I’m romanticizing. I’m color blind when it comes to warning flags and see potential rather than reality. I fall for season two Zuko before waiting to make sure he reaches the full potential of season three Zuko.

I fell for season two Zuko last year. It’s a year later but season three hasn’t been released yet. And like a fool I still pretend that it might be. It won’t. This show was cancelled.

What makes tonight different is that for the first time in months I’m admitting that I’m not over things—not to a perfect extent, at least.

My current loneliness makes me long for my last real passion—passion with a fool. I was the fool.

Today is different because I’m disillusioned. Today is different because I’m acknowledging that *I* was a naïve fool to think that that asshat meant anything he said to me. I was a fool for pretending like I didn’t think my oldest friend would jump at the first chance he thought he had in my pants. I was a fool.

That doesn’t mean he and he are not shit—If there is shit in the world they’re there—but there is no growth in not owning up to where I made mistakes.

I want growth. And I want to be comfortable by myself.

And godammit, a hot bath with wine and a cliché romance bring me comfort. So I’ll drink my damn wine. Watch my fingers get pruney, and sob when protagonist sobs.

But I will also mourn this loss, and move on to find my Sokka, instead.",lonely,A piece on mourning possibilities that never were.,2022-05-07 15:02:05

I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore

I 17nb have no clue what’s happening anymore. I don’t have many friends, the relationship I have with my mom is more like a teacher and student, and me my dad treats me like I’m stupid. My entire life I’ve felt like I don’t fit in. I barely have any friends and the friends I do have I’m afraid hate me, I don’t get invited anywhere and I’m getting kinda bullied at school in classes I once loved. I feel bad saying I’m getting bullied, but I think that’s what’s happening. They were all nice to my face and we were texting quite a bit, but then one of my “friends” threw a small party and I wasn’t invited, even though the rest of the class was.

It kinda hurt, but I guessed there was a reason I was the only one not invited. Then the next day I overheard the teacher talking to her classroom aide and she was complaining about me. I always do my work, I never talk back, and I try to be nice.

I shower and take care of myself so I don’t look or smell bad, I don’t talk about my interests that are a bit weirder, and I’ve tried being interested in what everyone else is but nothing works.

I’ve also dated people even tho I don’t want to, just to try to prove I can. Almost no one texts me first so I don’t talk to many people. And recently I had surgery and only one person from school came over to see if I was okay. 

I just am numb ig, I do nothing anymore except isolate myself and come to Reddit to try to make friends, but almost none of them stay. I don’t want to hurt myself but it’s like there are voices in my head that won’t shut up. I don’t want to die but I feel like I should just to see if anyone would show up to my funeral because they miss me. I hate myself, I hate my body, my personality, just everything because I’ve never been good enough for anyone. Not even my own family.

The only one I’ve ever felt loved by is my brother, he’s alway there for me but I don’t get to see him much because he is an adult and has his own life. 

I’ve just had it, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Why am I not good enough?",lonely,Is it all my fault?,2022-05-07 13:25:10

I probably only enjoyed the last two or so weeks, I think because I knew I that I was going home soon and was finally looking forward to something. In my last few weeks there, I finally felt like I truly connected with some people and felt comfortable around them, something I hadn't felt the entire year before that.

I came home about a week ago and feel super lonely again. I haven't interacted with anyone besides my parents and siblings, so I guess that's probably contributing to it. My friends and I used to always be on discord playing random shit pretty much every night in high school, but now someone will send a message maybe once a month at most. I miss being able to get on my computer pretty much whenever and do something fun with someone. Now I just feel so bored and don't know what to do with myself. Playing games alone makes me feel even more lonely since I'd rather at least be around my family.

I feel like a huge part of it is also that my sleep schedule is so messed up. About half the time I'm awake, I'm just sitting in bed while everyone else is sleeping. I've tried everything to fix my sleep schedule and nothing has worked. It feels like a lost cause at this point.

4418,CanSlow8086,1651890139,1,"Hi all.

I hope you're doing well. So, storytime:

In my final year of high school, I (29M) attended my prom with some friends. I didn't take a date, just arrived with some friends. The previous week I had begun to walk my 2nd cousin home from school and babysit her until my cousin and her husband arrived and talked to a girl who attended high school with me. I wanted to ask her for a dance at the prom, not a date, just a dance.

At prom, I asked her and she declined. Unfortunately, I wrongly took that to mean ""Not right now"". Let me stress that I didn't have any ulterior motives, I asked another girl later that evening and was even approached by another. I hung out with my friends, and later tried asking the 1st girl again but she edged away. I don't recall cornering her, or blocking off an entrance, I didn't get up in her personal space or call her names. I just thought ""Oh, OK."" I caught the message then. I left early, having developed a headache (I suffer migraines from childhood) and left early, leaving my friends.

I had been reported to the school for harassment. The last person to see me leave was the same teacher who'd been informed, a mentor, and I had no words. I just told him what I've said here, he suggested I simply stay away from her. But for whatever reason, 19-year-old me thought ""I've got to apologize!'.

I tried to, said ""Hello, X."" and I just froze. I shut down and she hurried past. That was 10 years ago and I am still indescribably ashamed of the incident. I feel like a monster. I don't hate women. It used to revolt me when other guys would tell me ""Oh, I'm gonna f--k a b--ch tonight."" and I obviously know I'm not entitled to anyone's time or attention. No one owes me an explanation.

I thought I was getting better when I mixed up a pair of co-workers after I started a new job, both smaller blondes and stared a bit too long as I registered it was a different person. She seemed miffed, and I went up and apologized. 9 months later, she came up and wanted to know if I was going to the company Christmas party. I said no, and she says: ""Aw. I'd really liked to have seen you there.""

I ended my shift, curled up in my car bawling. I was so happy she saw me as a normal, ordinary person and not as I see myself. I just...I feel like a monster. Like, I hate myself. I hate my sexuality. I'm so terrified. I would never hurt someone.

Therapy is the obvious answer here. You can tell me I'm a POS - it's important, to be honest, and not pull any punches. I was inappropriate. I just...I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to take solace in the incident with my co-worker and some other positive comments other female friends have made (I've never told anyone), and part of me wants, well, I'm better \*now\* but I used to fantasize about leaving a note saying ""I can't hurt anyone now. You are **safe**.""

I know this is a drop in the water compared to what a lot of people experience. I suppose I'm simply fragile. Please let me know your insights, good or bad. Thank you.",lonely,"I Creeped Someone Out, and It Haunts Me!",2022-05-07 12:22:19

One of the biggest reasons for it is because I feel like I have to work on myself. I'm not where I want to be in life at all and people can tell when you're unhappy even if you don't explicitly say it.  

And also, being single is OK so long as you have friends. All I want are friends. Not just one, but a group of friends, with a strong dynamic, to laugh and joke with and just do any activity with. I used to have groups of friends but they've all since disbanded.

I've always had mostly online friends, as soon as my family got a computer with dial-up when I was a kid. A woman at church said maybe I socialize online better because conversations aren't dependent on body language. (I have social anxiety severe enough that a lot of people misdiagnose me as autistic. Nope, just shy and anxious.)

That's what I thought it was until I took a trip and met some internet friends in person. Their families and their other friends _all_ liked me, even if our first conversation was face to face. There were so many people who wanted to make plans, there wasn't time for everyone. Happy times for an extrovert.

4494,throwaway0183701,1651857156,1,"I dreamt last night that I had the courage and charisma to ask her out before the semester ends, and that she was crazy enough to say yes. Recently I tried Uber and it didn't go horribly wrong, so as a person who can't drive, I don't feel quite as locked in my house. It made it possible for me to imagine actually going out with her, I didn't have to pathetically squeak ""I'm a worthless nondriving piece of shit, so if you want the pleasure of my company, you'll have to drive me around like a goddamned chauffeur"" .

But yeah, she said yes, and we exchanged numbers to talk about where to go. Ended up going to the aquarium (one of my favorite spots) , and it was awesome. She didn't hate me, and I didn't feel like trash.

But the problem is it was just a dream. Now I have this memory that's so much better than reality, but it isn't even real. And I'm fixating on it, it's all that's in my head. I'll see if video games can help get it out, or at least let me have a break from it.

This is why I hate having good dreams. Sure, they're pleasant as long as your unconscious, but then reality pulls you away from your happy place to be tortured again. It sucks, it's not worth the momentary pleasure of it.

God, I wish it was real. I was actually happy. I wasn't having to fake it to hope I end up believing it, I wasn't having to focus only on the positive and ignore the negative.

4506,User101197,1651851262,1,"My mums been suicidal &amp; an alcoholic all her life. My dad wasn’t in my life until recently, I didn’t even know he’s my biological dad until he contacted her, I thought one of the other guys that she introduced me to was. She’s had multiple boyfriends while I was younger, and she’d make me call them “dad” but then they’d all leave. We were living with my grandparents at the time as they were the ones raising me whilst she was out drinking &amp; partying. She would come home everyday and beat me with sticks, shoes, hangers, and anything that was in sight. Once she tried to drown me. She never attended any of my school events &amp; I felt so so alone watching other kids have dads that are present . On Father’s &amp; mothers Day my school organised events for kids and their parents to do fun activities together. I would always be sitting in the library and it was so hurtful.  

Once my biological dad was back in our life, things had been better and smooth. But her alcoholism &amp; narcissism still remains the same. I used to be a huge extrovert with an outgoing personality but now I’m just a shell of that person. She never let me have any fun as she always barged at places I was and humiliated me by causing a scene while she was drunk. 
I’ve become really anti social now and never leave the house at all. And all of this is her fault. I’m diagnosed with major depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, bulimia, sleep paralysis and adhd. A lot of these things are because of childhood trauma too. I was also sexually assaulted as a child but I haven’t told anyone in my family about it. I’m in therapy and medicated but living with her is so tiring. I was having a conversation with her as we are supposed to go out in a few hours &amp; I was reminding her that I have my doctors appointment in the morning too, and during this conversation she started drinking and I tried stopping her saying we have to go out in a few hours please stop drinking. We got into a physical altercation, she doesn’t hit me anymore as I’m taller and stronger than her but she still was trying hard for 30 mins. I kept trying to snatch the drinks away from her to go and dispose them but she kept yelling like a maniac telling me the usual things “I wish I aborted you” “I wish you were never born” . She’s said these things on all of my birthdays too. Never had a good birthday till date in my life. 
Finally I got a hold of her drinks and went to dispose them and she grabbed my hair and pulled me back to hit me but I pushed her away fortunately. I’ve to always be on guard as she has tried to attempt sûïcïdé many times and all the blame comes on to me. My dad lives out of the country &amp; my family is sick and tired of her, they’ve given up ages ago . She gets into car accidents often &amp; injuries herself here and there due to her alcoholism. I am so tired. I really wish I had a normal family or childhood. My relationships have also been horrible. I don’t have any in real life friends at all, I only have online friends. I’ve really wanted a best friend for long but can’t ever make one as almost everyone has a best friend now. Nothing is keeping me going except my dog.",lonely,Alcoholic parent,2022-05-07 01:34:22

4531,_bythealley,1651820892,1,I used to be extremely popular at my school for the activities I participated in and being fairly good in my academics before lockdown. during lockdown I became kind of an ambivert who tried hard to keep up with being extroverted like before. but when I went to school I realized that my grades went downhill during lockdown and it made me feel inferior and that turned me into an insecure introverted person in school because I felt inferior and that led to me not participating in activities and events. it may sound like I assumed everyone was judging me on my grades(I'm trying to be better) but trust me everyone were infact judging me sorta + my personal life with alot of my friends is also kinda (actually alot) messed up. it's taking a toll on my mental health and it's very frustrating and depressing.

I want to be alone but not like this it's draining me so much I am lonely for years now and I really don't have friends or even someone to talk to I'm just doing the same thing everyday and it's getting  boring but I have no one and I have social anxiety so I don't like going out much because I'm scared.
Everytime I think about how lonely I am it makes me wanna kill myself I'm so embarrassed for myself for being a loner and I hate my self so much because I can't communicate properly and make friends,i have been cutting myself bc I feel likes its a coping mechanism to me and I deserve to be hurt but at the same time I can't handle the pain I'm going through right now but I feel like I deserve it even though I did nothing wrong or bad.

I feel like I'm delusional bc I have imaginary boyfriend and I'm talking alone to myself bc I feel like my imaginary boyfriend is there beside me but its only my head playing tricks on me and I keep hearing voices that aren't even there I'm always alone in the house but I keep hearing voices and I don't even know what is this and ppl keep saying this is normal but really I don't think this is normal anymore and I need help but idk where to seek help anymore.

Please don't tell me to reach out to my parent bc my dad will never help me when it comes to emotional needs and his very emotionally detached from me.",lonely,I'm so sick of loneliness and I'm becoming delusional,2022-05-06 14:28:13

I think its something universal collective vibration or wave or something. We all are feeling loneliness. Our relationship with family and neighours are also nothing now. I mean, we  never had any fights with anyone. Its a WAVE or something. I had 2-3 so called ""friends"" and they even stopped talking to me.

4571,Puregoldpanda,1651809601,1,"For context, I used to have a lot of friends when I did sports in high school. In early college I smoked weed and had a lot of friends I did that with. I started having delusions at 19, and was eventually diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Without weed and with medications I’m pretty normal (except for mood swings) but I relapsed on weed multiple times which made me psychotic again. People that witnessed me acting psychotic have distanced themselves from me over the years. This and other things have drove me to attempt suicide in the past.

I graduated college recently and got a certificate to teach abroad, but had no one to celebrate with besides my mom. I have one friend that I occasionally text, but he lives across the country. For the past 5 years I feel like I’ve adapted to a loner lifestyle because I’ve lost everyone I’ve ever had in in my life, and I’m afraid of making new friends because I’m afraid I’ll just lose them. I mostly just work out, play video games, and watch anime these days. I live in paralyzing fear of running into people who have seen me in my psychotic state so I spend most of my time alone.

Right now I’m applying to work abroad. Maybe I’ll be able to make a new life for myself somewhere far away.

I (19F) have spent my entire life alone, I did not get my first genuine friendship until I was 13 years old. My parents and siblings ignored me but the only thing I had was the family computer that was in my room. I was a mentally ill neglected child who just wanted a friend or a kind voice but instead I would spend hours on the internet, mostly YouTube and Tumblr. Because of this, the internet became my closest friend. I do have one close friend irl that’s the person I met when I was 13 but we go to college in different states and she is starting to make other friends so I try to not bother her. Because the internet is my closest friend I spend all day on it. Recently I started arguing with random people on all platforms, mostly racist people but anyone I feel like arguing with. It’s honestly pathetic and time consuming but this is the only constant social interaction I receive. I am in my second year of college and all I’ve done is gain weight and become more depressed. I spend every Saturday night since January crying because I have no friends. I’ve gone to some groups on campus like once or twice but I’ve never really belonged because the people there are always interested in anybody but me. I’ve only belonged online. Please don’t comment corny shit under this post I will block you but I just feel so drained and pathetic.

I suck it up sometimes only to deal with the painful reminder of how lonely I am when I see families, lovers or friends while I go about my day. 

I have made a post here for platonic friendships and chatted with friendly folks. Unfortunately it just fizzles out for various reasons.

4578,throwaway0183701,1651805977,1,"Why are people talking to me? I don't get it. I mean, each time they talked to me, it was just to ask me a question about the chemistry lab final we were prepping for. But do i really look like I have answers? I just got a 61 on a test, mostly cuz depression was eating at my mind more than usual. If they knew that, would they still have talked to me?

But I did know how to do the lab, I think. And it felt good to be helpful.

But then my mind goes too far. Instead of just stopping at ""either you were useful to them, or they were being friendly, it jumps to ""but what if they \*were\* interested in you, tho????"" and it drives me insane. I know they can't be, and I fell so gross for even considering it. But it doesn't stop me from wanting it to be true.

Today, this morning, girl in my calc class came and asked me a question. Tbh I can't even remember what she asked, I was so nervous that none of the details got remembered. But I think i was helpful. Oh, wait, I just remembered that she said something to the effect of ""you looked like you knew what you were doing"" . So that was it. I don't understand. Y'all don't even know, dude, I look like an abused puppy in public. I am so fucking scared of everyone. I'm the opposite of confident. How did she come to the idea that I'm smart or confident academically? She's wrong, I'm barely making it through. Maybe she lied. I was the only fellow chem student in that calc class, maybe she thought I was the only person she could ask in time? Idk, I'm so confused.

And she has a boyfriend (because of course I'm a facebook stalking perv) , so I extra know she doesn't like me. But I still like her, and I can't stop it. It's so fucked up.

Earlier in the week though there was a girl and her lab partner who caught me in the hallway waiting for another class of mine. She came over and asked me to help her and her friend. she didn't say why, but I think it must've been convenience, too. They just happened to see me, it was probably easier  and quicker to ask me while they were there working on it than to go and try to catch the professor.

But she was she is so fucking cute, and that's like all that was in my head. I just wanted to be useful to her, I wanted so desperately to be something she valued, even if just pragmatically.

And she was one of the last one's out of the lab today. Me and my usual lab group, girl #2, and actually girl #1 too were the last one's in there. I really wanted to go casually ask girl #2 how she thought she did, and to ask what answer she got in her calculations (cuz my numbers felt weirdly big, and I'm really scared that I fucked up) . But I don't know how to be casual, all I would've been is creepy. She'd see right through me and know that I liked her, she'd be disgusted, and she'd get away as soon as she could.

I hate that helping her made me feel so happy cuz it made me feel useful. You know the most pathetic part? I'm pretty sure me and her are gonna be in o-chem in fall together, and I've been fantasizing about her asking to do homework together. Because homework is so fucking hard for me to force my broken ass brain to do, but I know that if I was doing with her then it'd be easy. Not even just cuz it's her, but cuz I genuinely enjoy doing schoolwork with people, it's so much fun. So it's not even like necessarily romantic fantasies. Idk, that just feels so stupid for some reason. Are my hopes really so low now that I can't even fantasize about her valuing me as anything more than a living Google? she's way fuckin out my league tho fr, ain't one motherfucker in the school in her league. Swear to god she looks like a fucking model. Guess that's why it scared me so much when she asked for my help, her noticing I exist was terrifying.

I can't help but notice how juvenile this sounds. This ""i cant talk to gurls"" is shit people outgrow in high school. I'm almost 20 fucking 3. And I wonder if this is because I never went to a real high school. I was homeschooled from 6th grade on. Maybe if I had grown up normal instead, I would've had the fucking balls to talk to her. But nah, nah, I'll just bitch about it on reddit instead. God, I'm a fucking loser. Hope to god she ain't into me, cuz can you imagine the disappointment finding that your man does \*this?\*

4581,willowsbabymama,1651805225,1,I’m doing terrible right now. It’s my junior year and I was diagnosed with an iron deficiency that negatively impacted my grades. I have always been a straight A student but this year I’ve witnessed a drop in my grades due to my poor health. I really wanna get iron transfusions but my mom is doing everything she can so that I don’t because she believes the best medicine is a change in diet. I’ve been on a specific diet for a while now and I feel little to no change. The school year is almost over and I can’t get over the feeling how I failed to reach any of my goals. I’m trying to be kind to myself but I just keep comparing myself to others and how they did better than me and beat myself up constantly for how bad I’ve done without taking into account the state of my health. It’s so unfair how this had to happen to me now of all times. With my dreams of attending a prestigious university my hopes and dreams have been dashed due to my performance junior year and I constantly feel its my fault that I’m sick and that I should stop being so lazy and work but I physically can’t due to severe lethargy I experience in a daily basis with the deficiency. Its so frustrating because everyone else is doing way better than me at such a crucial time for people my age and I constantly ask myself why I can’t be normal and why this had to happen to me when my academic performance mattered most. Sometimes I pray that I don’t wake up at night because I can’t deal with the fact that I’ve failed. Sometimes I pray I get hit by a car on my way to school. I keep beating my self up for circumstances and it hurts so much cause life can be so unfair. I just wish I can be normal again and go back in time to re-do junior year so that I even stand a chance to the colleges I want to attend but now that’s impossible and I’ll forever live with this feeling of a sort of “uncontrollable failure”.,lonely,Failure.,2022-05-06 12:47:05

I can speak from experience that going out alone because you want and know you could be doing it with other people because you have friends or a SO doesn't really feel weird, and that is because you know you're doing it by choice, but when you literally have no one to go out with you then it just makes me feel incredibly lonely and hollow inside.

Back when I was younger I was already depressed and had social anxiety but got ""adopted"" by some friends and honestly those were the happiest times of my life, but they were short. In 2017 I wanted to go see Justice League but no one really was interested in the movie so I went alone, even though the movie sucked I had a good time, I didn't feel weird or anything because I knew I still had people to do other stuff with. In 2018 I started to go down a very deep dark hole I still haven't climbed out of and my friends basically abandoned me, but I still had one friend who would hang out and stuff, we are both nerdy who love Star Wars, Marvel and Lord of the Rings so we usually went to the movies together but the pandemia stopped that but we still continued texting, but I noticed I was always the one to initiate everything.

In 2021 when stuff started to open up again I asked if he wanted to go see spiderman no way home since he really wanted to see it too but outside of the movie it felt to me like he really want to be there, he was on his phone a lot didn't talk, just answered when I spoke, a few other movies we went to see was the same thing but I thought if he really didn't want to be there he would say and every time I tried to talk about he shrugged it off saying stuff like""what do you mean? That's just how I am"". So a few weeks ago pre-orders opened for the new Dr Strange movie and I asked if he wanted to go see it and he said he didn't have money and might be busy during the week, so I went alone and man it felt horrible, I really liked the movie but seeing the packed theater full of friend groups and couples while I was there alone made me feel lonely as hell!

4594,Aggravating_Cat_5653,1651797442,1,"TLDR: My wife of 10 years decided she was done having sex with me and wanted to have sex with other people; and I discovered in the process that I am lonely introvert, so I am going back to church to see if I can fix myself/get myself fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

1.

I turned 40 and discovered I was lonely. Not cripplingly lonely. Not yet. But I felt, really felt the kind of loneliness a young-ish male, having left school and entered the workforce, now expects is his lot in life. You know: the kind of loneliness that has the potential to become crippling loneliness in his 50s or 60s, if he isn’t careful. The sort of thing on which a person wants to keep a weather eye. And, for the first time in my life, I am worried.

I grew up an introvert surrounded by other people. I was born into a family of Dutch immigrants who came to Canada in the starving years after WWII. They came to make a new life for themselves. My progenitors hired themselves out as farm labourers or bought farms right in the middle of Southwestern Ontario. They started churches. Later they built elementary schools; and still later, a high school, a college, and a graduate school. I climbed this educational ladder out of the immigrant community that raised me; and, being an introvert, lacked the wherewithal to replace it with something else. 

I have a distant memory of being nine or ten and forcing tears to express the frustration I felt at not being able to connect with other kids at school. The frustration was genuine, the tears were not, which produced more frustration and more false tears. Eventually something snapped inside me, and I learned to live with my introversion. But I was in a safe space in which to be an introvert. The crowd in which I was alone included parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles, parents of other children at church, and teachers who were parents of still more children at school. I felt alone, but I really wasn’t.

The frustration returned in high school. But I was a little older, and a little wiser, and the world had grown just a little bigger. There were more people around, more opportunities for friendship, even if these weren’t always satisfactory. And then, in the 11th grade, I suffered what doctors described as a catastrophic head injury. It left me in a coma for two days, relearning basic motor function over five or six months, and regaining control of my emotions and mental functions over the next few years. For better or worse, this put me at the center of a lot of people’s personal and professional attention. I have rarely been happier.

Then I graduated from high school and went off in the year 2000 to the Dutch college my immigrant community had built for its young adults. By my second year, introversion caught up with me again, my grades fell, and I slipped into a sort of mild depression. Nothing so serious that I required psychiatric intervention. Nothing other people would have perceived. I could maintain a cheerful exterior because I was more or less at peace with myself. But too much social interaction exhausted me, and I was equally happy to take refuge in the library bookstacks.

This story continues. High points and low points. Big changes, then relapses into introversion and minor bouts with depression. I won’t try to narrate the ups and downs here. I want simply to present my street cred. I know myself to be an introvert, someone who presents well enough in a crowd of people, who is friendly and can even be gregarious when the need arises, but is nonetheless an introvert.

I understand an introvert’s experience of loneliness. I know the powerlessness one feels to effect a change in one’s mood in all too familiar places. I understand the impulse to start over, somewhere else, somewhere entirely different, because this is the only way you can wrap your head around forging connections with people.

I am now 40, and I am supposed to have made something of myself, be in the process of building a life, enacting a well thought out plan. But that’s not where I am these days.

I climbed the educational ladder out of immigrant community that raised me, pursued a couple of Masters degrees, enrolled in a PhD program; I got married and followed my wife to Washington, DC, where she got a law degree and a good job with the federal government. At no point along this climb did I think I should make an effort find new communities. Various professional frustrations along the way, most notably the failure to complete the PhD program, drove me out of communities which had embraced me—out of embarrassment more than anything else. I had my beautiful wife, my carefully curated collection of history, philosophy, and theology books, my intellectual pursuits, and a non-profit job that gave me enough responsibility to feel like I was doing something productive but also enough headspace to let my mind wander through human history. I was set. For life. Or so I thought.

Then COVID happened, and my beautiful wife did some soul-searching, and she concluded all was not well in our little world, that her heart is not in it anymore, at least not in the way that it was in past.

That last strut of communal support got pulled away. For the first time in a good number of years, I discover again that I am lonely. And for the first time ever, it scares the shit out of me.

2.

I won’t introduce my wife. If this series of personal reflections ever appears in a forum where others can read it, she would be furious to discover her dirty laundry aired in public. I will refer to her as S. and refer to her actions and/or motivations as circumspectly as possible. Since she is an integral part in this story, it would be impossible to avoid reference to her entirely. That’s probably her preference. But ten years of marriage must rule that out.

My rude awakening to the fact all was not well in our little world came after a disappointing attempt at love-making. She announced we were done having sex. I said: What? She said: No more. I asked: For how long? A month? She paused before replying in a very frustrated tone of voice something to the effect of the following: I don’t know, forever. I said: What? What do you mean, forever?

I don’t remember where the conversation proceeded from this point. I do remember being profoundly confused. Such things just don’t happen. We are both young, capable, and all that. Well, I was feeling a little under the weather and also in need of physical exercise, but that’s besides the point. These were mechanical concerns which could be remedied. S. hinted at something much deeper than mere physical incapacity.

I spent the next two and a half to three months trying to understand what provoked this response. I will not pretend my efforts in this regard were either mature or well-thought out. The shock of such a categorical denial does strange things to a person’s brain. It makes them act in unpredictable ways. I switched hard into “caring husband” mode and became as attentive and concerned as I possibly could. I had to get to the bottom of things because spouses just do not, not have sex.

I would only discover much later that she spent the same time trying to understand what she was feeling. But she was certain about one thing: our sex life had officially come to an end.

I was 40, she was turning 32.

FUUUUUUCK.

S. and I met in university. She finished her undergraduate degree and I gradually fell out of the PhD program in which I was enrolled at the time.

We were an unlikely match. Neither of us expected to get married. Professional success had consistently eluded me in ways that made me doubt my long-term financial success and made me doubt my fitness for the institution.

Her reasons were slightly different: she wanted to become a spy. I was her mark. She “encouraged” me to introduce myself to her. In a fairly short order, I suggested marriage. (My idea, not hers, this time.) I proposed on a cold winter’s night in Quebec City, QC and we were married on the beach on a hot summer’s day in the Caribbean.

She passed the LSAT with flying colours, and I followed her to Washington, DC, where she attended law school, graduated, and went to work for the federal government. I was set. A beautiful, successful wife with a good-paying, stable job. I was making a marginal, financial contribution, but I was everywhere present to support her in the other ways that I could.

Somewhere along the way this idyllic picture no longer fit with S.’s picture of herself. She would tell me, I helped her become the best version of herself, just not the truest version of herself. She still had a deep-seated need to become a spy, do spy things, blow shit up, etc. A comfortable life in the suburbs with me held questionable appeal.

And the sex got boring. News to me, but that doesn’t mean it was untrue for her.

After almost 10 years of marriage, 11 years of being together, that’s I discovered again that I was lonely. S. pointed out my social group had narrowed down to exactly one person: her. That worried her, and she thought it should worry me.

What to do about it? After a few months of stewing, I went to the one place I could count on making a personal connection, even if only with someone who was professionally obligate to care; to the one place I knew I wouldn’t be turned away or treated as an uncomfortably needy irritant. I went back to church after nearly 15 years of being away.

3.

The educational ladder I climbed up and out of my Dutch immigrant community was raised by a network of Dutch churches spread across Canada and the United States. The specific church congregation I grew up in was started by great-grandparents on my father’s side of the family. I was probably related to 10 – 15% of the congregation of 500+ members. Maternal and paternal sets of grandparents, aunts and uncles, great-aunts and great-uncles, cousins, second-cousins, and presumably third-cousins, though the higher the increment, the more meaningless these the degrees of consanguinity become.

It was a perfect place for an introvert to grow up. I wasn’t actually alone. I may have suffered the usual things that introverts suffer at church or at school, with family and with friends: constant emotional bruising that comes with not quite comprehending how to navigate social situations, continually stepping back to let others take the lead because I didn’t know how. That’s all true. But I wasn’t actually alone. There were always people around looking out for me. Not just for me, but for me all the same.

So I climbed, more or less insulated my own introverted proclivities. I climbed from the local Dutch Christian elementary school to the public high school where I encountered my first real taste of a wider world. I climbed from the public high school to Dutch Christian undergraduate institution, only very recently accredited as a university, after the catastrophic head injury I referred to earlier. This was a good first step for me because I was still putting my head back together. The small tight-knit community let me do that.

I climbed from the undergraduate institution to a graduate program in History the nearby public university. Once again I got a taste for that wider world, which I realized for the first time was a far more anonymous, lonelier than I had before. I climbed from the graduate program in History to a graduate program in Philosophy at the Dutch Christian graduate institution where I spent two years pursuing my own intellectual problems, not necessarily thinking about career options. And finally, after the graduate degree in philosophy and an aimless 10 months spent at home on the farm slopping hogs and milking cows, I climbed into a PhD program in Humanities at McGill University in Montreal, QC. I got a taste of that wider world again. The taste was slightly more sour than it had been before. But I was hopeful. I was doing something with myself.

On every rung of this educational ladder, I found myself thrown together people of all different backgrounds, and the higher I climbed, the more diverse was the group of people. This was convenient. Educational institutions drew people together for one reason or another, and you met people in the process. No pressure to do so; it just sort of happened.

I met people in classes and in the library, in my capacity as teaching assistant and later as instructor. I met people at a coffee shop down the road from the Faculty of Religious Studies at the corner of Milton and Parc, where I could be regularly be found reading, smoking, talking, etc. I met my wife there—or she saw me, and then “encouraged” me to introduce myself to her, which I did.

The final couple of years at McGill saw me take a step back from all these opportunities for social interaction to focus on reading, research, and writing. It’s what graduate students did, so no red flags were raised. Plus my wife and I were busy exploring the city, new love, and new possibilities.

Dissatisfied with dead-end jobs after she finished her undergraduate degree, S. buckled down and passed the LSAT. About the same time, I came to realize I had lost the mental focus to complete my PhD program. The option to follow S. to Washington, D.C. and take some time to figure out exactly what had gone wrong made implicit sense at the time. I made that final, fateful step off the top rung of the educational ladder and stepped out into wide open air.

I still didn’t see it as a problem, because I was with S.

4.

The story I must tell about church differs from the one I tell about school. In the Dutch immigrant community that raised me, church, (extended) family, and school formed a compact, three-legged social stool. I was born to sitting atop this stool. The newspaper, magazine, books, television, and radio put me in touch with a wider world. I was never prevented from accessing informational material. I was encouraged to absorb as much as possible with frequent trips to the local library. But the world of my immediate experience was circumscribed by the stool.

Until the age of 19 the convictions of the immigrant community who came from Holland during the starving years after WWII meant very little to me. This is really not all that surprising. The intellectual ethos a person imbibes, unless that it speaks to the heart, is ever an alien form imposed on an ambivalent or rebellious matter. This was my situation through most of high school. I recall, having come from the Dutch Christian elementary school, repeating an argument against the existence of God on the basis of the existence of moral evil in human life. If the loving God is all-powerful, how is it possible that evil exists? Ergo the loving God is either not all-powerful or he does not exist. Point to the atheists.

Indeed, I had absorbed most of the stories in the Bible and could recall some downright obscure details from memory. But I had absorbed the stories as information, not as occasions for a matured, moral self-reflection. I did not steal, not because I had a firm idea of myself as someone who did right by his fellows, but because I was scared of being caught. I did not lie for similar reason: doing so made me feel uncomfortable with myself. I did not commit adultery, I suppose, because I was scared of girls (and I have to think that I was unlikely to be successful committing this particular sin). But how did Absalom die? Or where was Moses buried? (And who buried him?) Or what did Tamar ask of her father-in-law Judah?  (And why?) I had those answers down cold

Then, a year after my head injury, having seen and been seen my numerous specialists and other persons concerned about my well-being, finding myself out of immediate danger, I found myself once more alone with my introverted self, feeling profoundly empty. I had what at the time I would have described as a conversion experience. In retrospect, I will say that for the first time I reached inside of myself to find the moral resources to take ownership of myself. At one point S. commented that the intense poignancy of the experience was probably a consequence of the head injury or part of the recovery process. I think she meant to say that I was loopy. That’s fair and true, to a point. It doesn’t discredit my subjective experience of being “led” to take ownership of myself by the circumstances of my situation. What I reached for was the thing that was already mine, though only in a superficial sense: my parent’s faith.

I am too distant from the event to be able to convey the particulars of the experience. What I have is a generic sense best expressed in a novel I have read, re-read, pondered, and re-pondered every couple of years. Walter M. Miller’s *A Canticle for Leibowitz* begins with a young novice in the desert on a Lenten fast searching his heart for evidence of a vocation with the monastic order: “a clean parchment of the spirit whereon the words of a summons might be written in his solitude—if that other Immensurable Loneliness which was God stretched forth Its hand to touch his only tiny human loneliness and to mark his vocation there.” The anthropomorphic language in the quotations misses what is true about quotation, or at least what is true for me, so it’s best not to be distracted by it. The immensity of existence, which hitherto presented itself as impassive, unmoving, and utterly detached, seemed to “wake up” take an interest in me. Either that or I “woke up” and took an interest in it.

The trouble with this sort of “waking” is that its “object” is absolutely incommensurate with everything else. So it was natural I went looking for a much more mundane language in which to dress up the experience in order to make sense of it. My parent’s faith had a solution to the problem of incommensurability: divine incarnation. It also had a more than 2500-year old tradition of text and commentary reflecting on the problem and told a story about the Incommensurate willingly submitting itself to the horrors and indignities suffered by a people it called its own. That story spoke to me. It made sense what emotion distress I was feeling, and it dignified my introversion. The curious result of internalizing this narrative was that I found it very easy to sympathize with most other people, even people I had never met before. It became almost second nature to imagine myself in their shoes.

Something else happened too: the loneliness borne of my introversion became almost comfortable.

Unlike the young novice in the desert on a Lenten fast, I didn’t “receive” a vocation; I went looking for one. I went looking for a vocation knowing that I might not find one, but nonetheless believing that the search itself was valuable. But church attendance became more and more difficult as I climbed the educational ladder higher. I didn’t see this at first. I think I chalked it up to a sort of lay-about laziness. Who wants to drag themselves out of bed on Sunday morning? Not me. But I noticed in the churches either attended or tried out a much more assertive conservative politics and/or had a strange attachment to bowdlerized biblical interpretations like six-day creationism or pre-millennial dispensationalism than I was able to comfortably ignore. Bed looked more and more attractive as the months and years passed by.

The handful of attempts I made to find a church during my PhD program in Montreal met with uniform failure of precisely this sort. A pastor or an elder saw that I was a new face. They learned I was a PhD student attending McGill. Then they took it upon themselves to challenge me on this or that pet point of biblical interpretation or critique of secular society. I grew frustrated and despised them for it. Not wanting to do so, I didn’t return; and, in a fairly short order, I stopped looking.

It was around this time I met S. Life became much easier; decisions, more obvious. When I ran into difficulties completing the PhD program, the decision to follow S. to Washington, D.C. where she attended law school was almost a foregone conclusion.

I tried a couple of churches in the first year we spent in D.C. The experience was much worse than in Canada. The American version of Evangelicalism caused such feelings of revulsion that I was happy to content myself with my own thoughts. Recognizing that I found a certain intellectual satisfaction in my parent’s faith, S. encouraged it as a quasi-academic pursuit.

Which is where things remained until S. discovered that things were not well in our little world.

5.

I want to differentiate between the cause of something and an occasion for something. For example, if a building burns down, the cause of its having burned down will be found in whatever or whoever started the fire. However, if a student learns a solution to a mathematical problem, the teacher is an occasion for the student having learned the solution, not the cause. The student is the cause for themselves having learned the solution. The teacher merely provides the opportunity and the material for the student to reflect upon.

This, as I conceive of it, is the lot of intelligent beings like ourselves, who are neither inanimate, merely nor passive to external stimuli. So, when I say that S. is not the cause of all my misery and woe, I mean exactly that. I am not an innocent bystander who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Allow me to elaborate. When S. announced we were done with physical intimacy, I lacked the emotional resources to deal with myself in this suddenly altered state of affairs. That’s obvious in retrospect, even if it wasn’t at the time. I had allowed my social world to narrow down and focus on a single person. The consequence was that I was unable to see S. was also in a state of emotional distress. All I saw was a unilateral move to change the nature of our marriage…for some unknown reason. Had I done something wrong? Was she unhappy with marriage? Was she seeing somebody else? My mind reeled at the possibilities. How did I misunderstand or misconstrue things so badly?

The only certainty I had in the moment was that if she said no, that meant no, and there was very little I could do about it. We might talk it out, but the harder I pushed on the issue, the more likely it was that I would disrespect her or disrespect myself. Which meant I had to accept things *fiat accompli* as they now stood.

FUUUUUCK

For a couple of months, as I mentioned before, I switched hard into “caring husband” mode, trying and more often than not failing to get to the bottom things. It was at this point that S. thought to bring up the fact that my social world had narrowed down to a single person: her. That was a problem, not just for her, but much more for me. It wasn’t fair to her, but I was also depriving myself of a needed outlet outside the home.

I had to get out.

Have I mentioned I am introvert? I may present well-enough in a groups, there is a non-zero chance I am accumulating small emotional bruises, which in time will add up to a need to withdrawal somewhere private to find an emotional footing. Tiny things like questions that pop up in my head and ask whether I handled that situation right over and over again.

I still had to get out.

Church is a natural fit in these circumstances. As I explained it to S., who won’t go to church and has no feel for the religion things, church was a place to go without any explicit intention of meeting people, but you would still meet people. Much like an office environment, where you go to work, but you end up meeting people and making friends in the process.

So I returned to church after 15 years of being away, comforted by the prospect of once more being alone in a crowd. I met people. I had conversations. Things that I had tucked away in my head once more were allowed out into the open air. Nothing especially deep or profound, you understand; but it was familiar.

That’s it for now. I am not sure how this story ends, whether it ends well or poorly. The story is true, or true enough for me. As I tap this line out on the keyboard, the narrative arrives at the present moment.

I can report, since returning to church, loneliness has become ever so slightly more comfortable.

I just wanted to share and maybe ask for advice.

I'm a very introverted female that's almost 30. A few days ago I got dumped by my BF of 7 years - with no fight, no reason given, nothing I noticed indicating it would happen - he basically just told me it's over and walked out of my life and it all lasted 1 minute during which I was so shocked I didnt get to say anything or to say goodbye. Just like that.

We met in college and all of our friends were mutual friends - so I either lost them now or can't really talk to them about it or about him. Can't even go out with them because I will surely have moments of feeling awful and crying and I don't want them to think badly about me or about him. My family really liked the guy and always told me he seems to be crazy in love with me  (and I thought so too, even at the day the breakup happened...) and they will tell me it's my fault and that there must be a reason and I surely had done something awful that made it happen. They blamed me before for him not talking about marriage with me after so many years. I don't feel like I did something awful... Sure - there must be a reason for the breakup to happen, it even might be my fault in some way, we both had our good and bad moments, but I'll never know now. And I keep thinking about what I might have done wrong to cause it.

The thing is I'm a total weeping mess right now. Can't sleep, can't eat, can't focus on my work so had to take my time off (which is ironic because I planned to use it for our holidays next month, won't happen now). Havent really left my house.

For context, I am close friends with the girl (too deep in the friendzone it seems). We hang out a lot and talk a lot then stuff, so it's not like I was some secret admirer, I thought that I had some realistic shot even if it's small. So anyways,  I heard that the guy rejected her (strangely enough, the girl claims that the guy likes someone else which isn't true). I confirmed this with her friend and the guy. The guy told me he rejected her for a relationship because he thinks they won't be together. Her friends then told me that it's worth a shot to ask her to prom even though at this point I'm sure it's already gone. By this point I was already devastated twice.

Later, the guy told me that he had already agreed to go to prom with the girl. So oh well, life sucks. Guess what? Just yesterday, the guy posted on his instagram that he asked the girl out (it's staged.). There was a video and stuff, and a photo. I literally wanted to just off myself. It was too much to bear. To see that happening. I was already defeated, but this just keeps getting worse. I don't even know why I keep crying. ""it's just a girl"" but yeah, you don't know what it's like. It hurts so much. No words can describe my pain. To see that happening. Btw, I'm not going to prom. I can't stand it.

I started to distance myself from the girl more and more, and I even rebuff her advances to talk to me (given we're friends). I just want to forget her, but I can't, because I still like her.

The worst part about this was that sometimes some important news regarding exams or courses would be given but they wouldn't tell me, which always led me to hear about it after literally everyone, but when it was the other way around, when I told them J would look at me with complete disinterest, like I'm bothering or something, but when I didn't say anything, Y would always give me a moral lesson on what friends are meant to do, that I should tell him about those news, while I'd be looking at him with total disbelief hearing his audacity and hypocrisy.

What hit me the most was when J literally starting hitting on the girl that he knew I was crushing on for nearly two years, he'd basically see me talk to her and just put himself in the conversation which always ended up with them two flirting with each other and I'd simply go home without anyone noticing, with Y being completely aware of it but supporting him in his actions and telling me to forget about her, that it's no big deal, etc..., and two weeks ago Y came up to me while I was talking with a classmate, inserted himself in the convo and after 10 minutes he happily and jokingly informed me that J and her are now dating, like I even gave a crap anymore...

So yeah after some time I moved on from her and started talking with another girl about 4 months ago who J was talking to regularly a year prior but got bored for whatever reason, guess what ? she still was crushing on him, told Y about it and he didn't give a crap, his reaction indirectly gave ""you're not enough, he's better than you"" vibes.

At that point I already started distancing myself a lot, obviously J couldn't care less, and Y told me 5 months before that everyone tried to communicate and reconnect with me again but I was too childish because I distanced myself and so everyone gave up on me, when in reality, when I needed people who were my ""friends"" the most and Y especially, they all disappeared, while J even made jokes and mocked me.

 I'm not even mad anymore, and although they say hi like nothing ever happened they just feel like complete strangers to me now, I completely cut them off, and that's for the better even if I'm all alone because I feel good about it.",lonely,"I had enough of being a third wheel and constantly disrespected, so I ghosted them all.",2022-05-06 07:02:59

So I am turning 23 tomorrow and honestly I dont really feel anything, I know as you age people are generally less bothered but for me its because I just dont enjoy my life and each birthday passes with me being sad and lonely. I do really try change my life such as leave my old toxic colleagues but just end up in a different job I dont like.

I am grateful I do have one really close online best friend but other than that my life is pretty much the same every birthday and I just wish one year that I would have an irl friend or partner to go out with. Ofc this is just not a birthday thing, I do wish these things for my life in general too,  but I am just thinking about it all because each year I hope to have a better birthday the following year but however hard I try life just screws me over :/",lonely,Its my birthday tomorrow but I am not even bothered,2022-05-06 06:27:31

Me and my twin brother live together in college. 
I haven't got a lot of friends, nevermind best mate pal sort of friend. What I have is a twin brother who I stay 99% precent of the time. Basically, I lived my whole life with him. It's not the best experience. I don't get enough time for myself.

That's how my life feels, ALL. THE. TIME.
And it's not like you have eachother support or something else because in our relationship, it's kinda cringe to talk about this things. And it's almost impossible to start doing it now cuz it's weird. 
Back to the point. As an individual, I feel like I haven't developed at all. All of my friends are his friends. An example: 
I started talking with a girl 7-8 months ago. He didn't knew about this for 80% of the time. He eventually found out. I don't know how but he did.

4684,someplaceelse_,1651764351,1,"I know I’m not the only one who makes mistakes and regrets them, the whole world does. I make so many to the point it’s really just a joke. I used to feel better when people told me things like “I’m sure everything will get better”, “one day you’ll find that person “ or “don’t worry it’s gonna be ok” or just like things along those lines (for some reason my minds gone blank). Anyway, I’m just so sick, of hearing these things over and over again. 

I’ve been waiting for that day to come, and people say “oh you’re so young you have so much time ahead of you” but I don’t know if I want to wait that long. Being lonely and being alone seem like two totally different things to me. Sone people WANT the solitude, but it’s only because there are so many people around them, they’ll never get tired of peace and quiet if it’s gonna be like that. People like me however, don’t want to be alone.

I used to be one of those people, enjoying the time by myself but now it’s getting extremely lonely with only my thoughts to keep me company. I have family, I have a few friends sort of, but why is it that I always end up alone. “I’m sure more people will like you”, “I would want to hang out with you” then why don’t you? I mean, stop trying to be nice if you don’t mean it.

I’m just sick of it, I’ve had enough. If I really am a good person and am deserving then where is my share? It’s ridiculous that I’m still alone. I try, yet no one seems to want to be there. And some of my real friends go to different schools. Even then, it wouldn’t be fair to them to always have to rely on them to keep me from falling off the edge of my own consciousness.

Most people are oblivious and naive, these are those same people that say these things because they aren’t the ones having to go through it all. Why can’t I just have more propel around me? More people who genuinely care? I don’t want to be one of those back up friends for them when everyone has left them, I just want to have a real friend.

Once my dad left my family all I had was my mom and my sister growing up but once we got separate  rooms I would stay in my room morning till night over the summer ( we weren’t allowed outside by ourselves, which meant we never went outside) and watch tv never moving from in front of it. It made be feel numb. It made me feel nothing . And I liked it that way. 

I discovered porn around 13 years old and would watch it incessantly. I would watch it ones again to feel nothing but also to mentally put myself I. Those peoples shoes as someone who was attractive as wanted and desired when all I’ve ever felt, even now was invisible. Doing that plus being ashamed coming from a Christian background I began to mentally berated myself. Hate myself. Would even avoid mirrors  at one point as I thought I was hideous and grotesque to even look at. 

And I was so severely depressed and anxious in school I wouldn’t even talk when people would ask me my name. I made one friend in middle school and we are still friends now but I think we wouldn’t be friends if I had a backbone back then because she didn’t treat me well at all back then. I am fiercely loyal to my own detriment, but looking back I think it’s because I didn’t want to be alone that I took so much crap from others. 

I came out of my shell more in high school. Even had a boyfriend for half of senior year , the summer, and in the first semester of college. But my depression and anxiety made me feel unlovable. I loved him as much as a teenager could and I thought he would be the one I’d marry. I had no interest in dating. All those tv sitcoms like boy meets world gave me unrealistic views of the world. I though your first love was your last love. But no he broke my heart and treated me like I was nobody, like how I always felt and my depression got worse.

I went to college, sabotaged that because of the severe anxiety of being around more people than I was use to  and being on my own for the first time in my life made me so anxious I would come home every weekend to be with my boyfriend. The only one that could make me feel better at the time 

I dropped out my first semester got a job but would whole myself up in my room on my free time feeling more like a failure than ever before. 

I joined the army late in life as a means to get out as I was slowly but surly losing what little friend I had. I wanted to know I could have some stability when everything else in my life fell apart.

To make a long story short, she’s been diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (an ultimately terminal condition) as well as as the beginnings of rheumatoid arthritis.  This plague of illness that she’s confronting is really just “hollowing” me out emotionally &amp; physically. I go through the motions of daily life, and endeavor to be as strong &amp; supportive if her as I can be… but it’s all a facade. Bit by bit, day by day, there’s less joy and hope.  Physical intimacy has crumbled away because of her health. I’m still working, which at least keeps me occupied during a workday… but once work’s done I’m left with an ever-widening chasm of hopelessness &amp; loss.

I hate having to work up the confidence and effort in a relationship only for the person to not even try or at least let me know they're not interested. In the end, I'm the one always left broken and looking stupid while the other continues with their day. 

Like if you don't like me then straight up say ""I'm not interested"" and let me off rather than giving me false hope in nothing. That way I can at least know I tried and I can move on with at least knowing rather then being left in the dark only to recieve the news later. 


As why I'm ranting, I just recently got a phone number from a girl I thought was really sweet, beautiful, and overall a good person. So here I go, making myself look like an idiot and try to talk to her and try to put effort into getting to know her thinking I was doing alright, only to lead to again failure. When I tried talking to her, she genuinely seemed happy to talk and was overall kind. So when I told her she had a nice smile as a compliment to her without expecting much in return then to just compliment her, I was alright with leaving empty handed and just move on. Then she makes the daring move to offer her phone number which I felt so much joy and excitement from the offer, which I did take. 

Anyways, next day I try to text her with no response which I thought was reasonable. Next day I try again with again no luck. I wait another two days without trying then finally I try one more time today but this time to be more daring and decide to call her. However when I did, I was greeted to a slightly annoyed and confused person on the other end (which is reasonable since I've been texting to their number like two or three times already). I obviously tell them I have the wrong number and I hang up. That was when I realized she gave me a fake number to me. She could have left me alone or just ignored me but no, she wanted to rub salt in the wond by giving me false hope in giving me  a fake number only to be made an idiot as a result. I don't understand why she did that but I feel like absolute shit and overall feel like I've lost hope in just finding a relationship. I feel like an ugly person with no chance of being with anyone special. I think after this incident, I just confirmed my fear. I think I'm just not going to even bother anymore. I'm sick of trying only to be ghosted or made a fool in the process. In a way, I've lost hope in people and just lost confidence in myself as a result.

foremost i know internet is not a safe haven and people will judge you no matter what all are you passin through, but i can't help.
iam so lonely, i intensely wish if there someone who i can say this all, could just make me happy. but by fate, i have'nt anyone.

lookin at my story, it was yeah, kinda normal middle class stuffs. born poor, grew up poor.. everything i have experienced back in my life was poverty
and my family was always broke. so it would be pretty evident for you that i haen'nt any privileges growing up like going for a amazing vacation, pretty clothes etc...
still tho my parents had hope in us( i have 3 siblings, glad i remembered it now lol) and admitted us into an english medium school(thats how you call it in India/ great pride if you're in one).
about my parents, mom is an homemaker and dad is in abroad. all the money they saved was thrown into our education. guess their decision was'nt bad eventhough, atleast i can write in english right?( i believe).
and then i just passed my high schools with a good grade(yeah ngl) , got admitted into an engineering college( what did you think an indian boy would choose otherwise lol).sophomore was not good enough, made some freinds ... and all of a sudden this pandemic got us and just had to move to home.

this part of my life; this part is called *happyness

yeah, that sentence is a minimum, i was so happy. i fell in love with this girl (not mentioning her name becuase i still love her , but i wont get here from this day( 4th may|her wedding)),
i was so happy that days( god! i'm gonna cry) , we talked like 6 hours a day(for 3 years,can you imagine?). we shared everything. we were new into these relationship scenarios we havent dated anyone before. we loved each other unconditionally. i had never made her felt desperated, and she did always mention shes so happy safe with me.
i dont know i felt so in love, i couldnt even survive a more than 4-5 hours without her. i just needed to know where is she and is she safe(please dont think im toxic, i've never demanded anything from her, i just request and she would inform me where she is). we were so cute each other , we even cried each other. i play with her, ask if shes fine always and she also does the same to me. i dont know if y'all believe this but we had only 3 real dates during these 3 years(1 for 1 lol).
but we didnt need that cos we were transparent to each other and knew everything bout each other.

new season of my life:
i dont know how to say this, iam gonna shed tears if i try to explain what i've been through, what all previously happened. in a contrary, in all of a sudden her father fixed her marriage on may 4th(for those who wonder, i just knew about this a month ago(april i guess)). i was in utter pain, didnt know what to do. already mentioned i dont have much freinds, so i just thought myself and decided to call her father.hands were shakin, my heart was just gonna rip out of my ribcage when he took the phone and say hello. that was the most heaviest hello i've ever heard. but i need to save my relation right. i just put up some nerves and responed.
we talked and i somehow said things to hime( i mentioned iam her boyfreind, but in a subtle manner). he didnt agree and threatened me he would meet my parents.i didnt afraid, bc all i had in my mind was her.
he cut the call, but after sometime just called me back and said shes crying bc of you. i have to speak with your parents about this.
and..
i knew he wouldnt agree bc she was so rich and iam, pathetically poor. who would marry his girl into a poor home. so he became mean to me and said this is'nt gonna happen. i was so broken, thought this world is gonna end now( atleast mine).


i dont know if i could complete this, maybe this is why because nobody wants to hear me. im so sad rn, hey internet people: this is my story so far.

ps: last week i got a notice about my 25k college fee due( aapproximately 300$), if i paid it in a month, i would not get mu graduation. asked many for help, tried to lend. no one helped. asked in my home, my mom just literally cried, how i could even ask her again.
if i cant pay that fee, i wont be graduated this year. so it means , i would have to go a daily wage income for a year and can get graduated in the next year( only i've 25k and i'm alive to expereience that all). i dont know if anyone gonna help me.just watch everything i had in my life drowning away. some often i think about suicide, i know its terrible but i cant help. please god!.

A friend I could climb mountains with 

A friend that trusts me and I trust them so much we literally think alike

A friend which id give my god damn life for and he’d (hopefully) do the same.

A friend I could grab a beer with .

A friend which I could participate in a joint mission with risk (which enhances trust) in which brings both of us great fulfillment and strengthens our friendship in great and deep levels.

A friend to play with the dog with.

God bless this friend, if he’s in my future, I hope you come soon 😭.

4751,Dangerous-Walk-845,1651721388,1,"I'm a young male, still in High School, i'm, admittedly, a little stupid too. Almost 4 years ago I meet a very important person on Discord. She was around the same age as me and because of her I was introduced to so many other people that meant so much to me. I had never been in a friend group like this or have so many people care about me before. Over the years I never planned to be apart of a relationship with this individual. My feelings said otherwise. At the time I had already come out of a pretty important and admittedly short relationship with someone. So she and I started a dynamic. She previously stated that she was ""love sick"" because she herself have never been in a relationship, and I happened to have a lot of traits that she liked. We started the whole thing in roughly early October of 2021. It meant everything to me. I realized that this was the woman I loved. She was irreplaceable. We had ups and downs but we both appeared to enjoy each other's company a lot. My infatuation with her got in my way with being a good person. I focused so much of my energy on her and that dynamic that I feel like I just became a worse person because of it. Mind you she's extremely important to a lot of others that I used to consider my friends as well. It was in mid March that she put an end of the dynamic. At first I tried to be mature about it and just simply move on. That's what would of happened if I wasn't so codependent on her affection to help me. I felt alone again and it tore me apart. I let it get in the way of my mood and I constantly brought it up in conversations just between the two of us as some stupid and unknowing way of guilt tripping. One night she just had enough. And left me. Alone. The next day she said she just needed a break from me but that doesn't feel like the case anymore. I last spoke to her back on April 1st and she just seemed so angry at me and didn't appear to want any sort of friendship back. She only went with the whole dynamic as a way of helping me cope because she knew how much it hurt me. It was nothing more to her than that. I haven't spoken to her, or anyone else in that friend group since then. I've fucked up so badly and I just want to fix it.

4763,monmonmi,1651719121,1,"Hello to those of you reading this post. I am curious, what’s your story? For me it started in 2020, my graduation year of high school. We were supposed to go back to school in April but the rest of the year ended being online. I had social media and was consistently on it, checking content every minute of the day, texting people, posting random things on my spam account where I considered people who were my ""close friends"" who followed it can only see. It was just overall very silly and fun for me back then. Then one day I decided, what if I just deleted all my socials. 

Reason was is I wanted to do more in my life than just stare at my phone and pick up a hobby or two. Not to mention, it can help with mental health and with college starting a couple of months I wanted to focus more on school. So I did it. All my socials were gone. I thought my ""friends"" were going to reach out to me since they had my phone number. Days, weeks, months passed by and nothing. People who I thought were my friends, who saw my spam posts of me venting, ranting, my personal stuff, never did reach out to me. 

Well I did have one friend who stayed with me and of course I am happy but devastated. So many people who I talked to school, have their contacts, never bothered to reach out to me. Especially this one person who I knew practically my whole life. I am a person who reaches out first but I stopped doing that now. Eventually I came to accept that people come and go, while some decide to stay. Once I overcame that I became happy and spent most of my days alone. 

Then Fall 2021 rolled around and that would be my first time going to live on campus, since I did remote online for a year. I was anxious but excited because that means I can finally become social in the way of face to face. Turns out I have lost all my social skills and developed pretty bad anxiety due to not leaving home. My only friend goes to the same school as me and they have a pretty hard time telling how I feel since I don't talk much. I haven't made any friends either this whole year. So it hasn't been well if I'm going to be honest haha. Me and my roommate are on pretty great terms but now we drifted apart. It's to the point where I see her when she comes back from her friend group late at night. Like an hour before bed but I naturally become distant when stuff like this happens so we don't even talk. Even if they talk to me I just nod my head, give non-vocal responses, or just say one word things. It's just a thing that's been with me ever since I was a kid when I haven't had any socialization in a while.

So as of now, I spend my days in my dorm all alone, doing my schoolwork, watching my shows, listening to music to entertain me, check my plants. Stuff to keep me busy at least. Sometimes it get's pretty bad that I don't talk for hours and until I make a sound or say something, I surprise myself haha. 

But now, knowing that this semester is almost over with a couple of weeks left, I can go home. Where I can hangout with my siblings as have fun and be myself around them. That's the only thing that's pushing me during finals season. I know it's probably way too positive of me but I look for the good in my future. I'm hopeful that I can find people who want to be with me and if not, it gives me more time to learn more about myself. It's also okay to feel bad just as long as you don't give up is what I tell myself. 

So that's my story on how I'm lonely. It hope it doesn't bother you with how cheesy it is at the end haha. Thank you for reading this far and take care! (°▽°)/",lonely,What’s your story?,2022-05-05 12:52:01

Was hoping to find a male to talk to on the phone or something to pass my time. 

About me: I read a lot. JG Ballard, Thomas Pynchon, Bret Easton Ellis and stuff like that. My favorite book is Infinite Jest or Crash. 

I really like, idk what to call it, indie music maybe? 
Elliott Smith is my favorite musician, followed closely by Conor Oberst/Bright Eyes. I also love Wilco, Tom Waits, The Shins, Elvis Costello and stuff like that. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for mid 2000's emo as well. I know the words to every Fall Out Boy song, that's not a brag really, more of a confession. Lmao. 

I used to write about film and television for a living and am heavily opinionated on this matter. My favorite film is Punch-Drunk Love, not because I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan or anything, my love is more for Paul Thomas Anderson and the film speaks to me in some way. Other films I love include: A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Royal Tenenbaums, Escape from New York, The Warriors, A Cure for Wellness, Ghost World, Alien and Aliens, Naked Lunch, Dead Ringers, Flatliners, The Machinist, I could probably go on forever with this list. 
I am not really into anything Marvel or many super hero movies or shows. I love comics and have about 150 long boxes full of them. My favorite superhero is The Flash, but I can't stand the TV show, minus Tom Cavanagh, yeah, he's hot. Haha.

It's so bizarre. A lot of the people on this sub work hard. Much harder than your average person but are still very much unsuccessful. Is it some personality flaw we all share? Just a general inability to connect with other humans at a deeper level?

But I've never found anyone who wants anything long lasting with me. I think I'm just not attractive enough or tall enough or something... Everyone around me is beautiful and they have no issues finding people who want to be with them. But when it comes to me? *Crickets*

Because it is no longer socially acceptable to physically speak to people you don't already know, I finally decided I would put genuine effort into some dating app profiles. Got a few matches. One doesn't respond for three days and then with a very apathetic low-effort answer. Another doesn't respond. A third responds, exchanges two messages, then ""thank you for your time."" I hardly think anything of the first two but the final is just depressing. Not only was she uninterested, this person (who listed ""Mental Health Awareness"" as one of her passions) first had to match with me solely in order to dismiss me with a flick of the wrist.

People are not human beings on these apps. They are objects worth only the amusement they can provide the other user.

I will never attempt to find someone via those channels ever again. 

Because these loveless profit-based apps are now the only socially acceptable way to meet someone, this effectively means that the doors of love (such as ""love"" is when everyone treats fellow human beings who are only looking for companionship with such disregard) are closed to me. As an introverted man who is not especially confident or outgoing, I will never be loved or accepted for what I am. I have the option to play a character who is confident and outgoing, and then, if I'm lucky, someone might grow to love that character (not me). But actual, uncynical love, from someone who accepts that I'm not the most confident in social situations, is unattainable for me.

My bf mentioned this girl to me and so I decided to be friends with her and wanted to be her friend so badly bcs she seemed absolutely amazing but I’m still hanging out with her group at lunch and I feel so out of place and just a waste of space and today when she told me she made up with some girl she hated the other day and started to walking with her I felt like such a third wheeler. When I got home I just couldn’t stand living the way I do and it living at all. I always feel so out of place everywhere. Is it bcs of my height? Bcs im a lot taller??

4837,Fantastic-Speed2023,1651689412,1,"So I’m 25, with a bachelors degree, and have been single for about 5 years now. I have mastered self love. I take myself out on dates all the time, movies, theme parks, travel, dinner, brunch, you name it. I spend my free time trying to better myself, I’m financially independent of my parents. Support my friends in their endeavors and make new friends often. 

I am ready for serious relationship. Family connections and friendships are great but Those aren’t fulfilling that romantic void in my life. 

I’m tired of hearing “oh it will come when you least expect it, continue loving yourself and you will attract that special person, put yourself out there more” 

I am on dating apps, I am always out and about dressed cute, I work remote so I try to work often in coffee shops etc. And I’m just convinced now I may be destined to be alone forever. I know that’s dramatic but it’s just how I feel.

I’ve dated different men for a series of a few months here and there but nothing ever blossoming into a true, committed, long term relationship where we can fall in love and see each other in our futures. 

Im sure no one has advice and I understand that. But I just need to vent a little because I get tired of hearing the same things from both men I’ve dated and friends and family that root for me. “You are so great, beautiful, smart, any man will be lucky to have you” okay? then why are zero knocking down my door and why are zero dudes also not stepping up to the plate when they, themselves, are the ones that see me in that “ any guy would be lucky to have you” light? 

I don’t want to think I’m giving out that sense of desperation I try to keep things cool and coy when meeting new men and I don’t ever try to rush them into something like exclusivity. Sigh.

4847,throwaway0183701,1651684341,1,"Super cute girl in my chem class actually fuckin talked to me. I don’t get it.

Me and my lab partner were prepping for our lab final, just in public near a public computer. She walked up and asked for help with doing hers. And that was fucking terrifying, I can barely keep my shit together with my lab partner. I was psyched up and ready to do stuff with him cuz we scheduled it ahead of time, so it wasn’t as bad. But then she shows up, and I’m at first flustered cuz she’s cute, but then I’m just freaking tf out in my head cuz this is a new person I’ve never talked to, and if I’m gonna help her then I have to put forth ideas that might be wrong and might embarrass me. I know I looked like a fuckin beaten puppy, I just hope I didn’t do anything stupid aside from being an anxious pos.

But yeah, that I chalked up to my lab partner. He’s confident and personable, and he’s helped people before. The thought didn’t even really cross my mind that I was what she wanted to talk to, I was just an impediment. But today, I was waiting on another class, and she and her partner happened to be working on their prep outside the room I was waiting on. And she walked over and asked for help again. My lab partner wasn’t there, I was just alone and listening to music trying to pretend I didn’t notice they were there, but she still asked for my help. So it wasn’t just my lab partner. I guess it could still be that I was just the best option they had, not that I was a good option. But this girl is pretty bold about asking questions in class, and she’s asked plenty of stuff to the professor after class. I’m sure she could’ve asked him.

Idk. I’m confused. I’m not good at this, I just pretend to be. Why would she ask for my help? She’s smarter than me, I’m sure, and her lab partner is, too. Is it possible they really could actually use my help? It seems ridiculous. But the only alternative is that she *wanted* my help, which seems even more ridiculous. As bad as I am at school, I’m so, **SO** much worse at life and being social.

I guess with either option, I should feel a boost to my self-esteem. Either I’m academically valuable to her, or I’m socially valuable. But I just feel more self-hatred, mainly cuz of how much I wish I could be socially valuable to her. And especially because I have a crush on her now. I hate myself so much for that. I don’t deserve to even imagine that she might care about me, I’m just a worthless failure of a person. She’s super cute and has actual aspirations, I’m trash that’s just here cuz I don’t know where else to be. Not only do I feel I’m not worthy to even imagine such a situation, I feel gross for it. I’m sure if she knew I wished for that, she’d be disgusted. Declarations of affection are only compliments when they come from attractive lips, they’re insults if someone like me speaks them. They don’t make the person feel happy and warm and fuzzy, they make the person feel gross and exposed and sick.

And I feel that bad just for having these fucking feelings. I don’t want to feel like this, I want to be able to just see this as either her normally having a question, or normally wanting to be friendly. But instead, my fucked up head can’t stop wishing that it was some romantic gesture. I *know* it’s not, I’d have to be clinically insane to genuinely think that asking for help on a problem is romantic. But it still *feels* like it is, because my stupid love-starved mind is so desperate that it lunges at scraps.

I’m so mad. If I was someone else, if I was someone *better*, I could’ve offered her my number in case she needed more help, or I could’ve asked more social questions and participated in small tap that indicated that I enjoyed her company instead of only focusing on the problem. But no, no, what I did was look like a mouse in the claws of a cat, stick perfectly to the problem, and dart away as soon as I could. The best I managed was to squeak “good luck tomorrow” on my way out. Fucking idiot.

4849,ThrowawayJ10112,1651683422,1,"I lashed out at a friend again. I felt hurt and abandoned yet again as they and a small ‘clique’ of other people in my online gaming community went off to do their own adventure together. 

The 4 of them went off and there was room for a 5th person and instead of asking me or anyone in the larger community-group to come along, they found some random person instead. It sounds insignificant when I write it out, but it’s a continuous pattern of this friend only involving their ‘clique’ and no one else, unless it’s convenient for them.

I told him off because it feels like me and everyone else outside of this clique are just on the sidelines, and they rarely involve other people outside of their group. Because I know that if the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t think twice about trying to get a friend in for that 5th spot. But this friend didn’t, nor did any of the other 3 in the clique.

What hurts a lot is that it makes me think ‘Why am I not good enough?’ I could be a great friend. But they don’t try to involve me. They don’t talk to me. They talk to each other so how do you even get a foot in the door? 

It’s like I’m trying to prove I’m not a horrible person, astonishingly, and they don’t even give me an opener to try.

But, I lashed out again (not the first time) and told this friend it feels terrible to be looking in from the outside and see them have fun without me.

A day or so later, I apologised. They’ve not said anything in reply yet. I don’t regret what I said because it’s the truth and it’s how I’ve felt for the past several months. But I do regret lashing out.

I just want them to be friends with me like I want to be friends with them. I don’t think that will ever happen given that I’ve yet again kicked the hornets nest.

Hi. As the title may make it obvious, I pretty much have no friends. I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone but I went to a different school growing up and the people who live here now are nothing like me (A lot of people do drugs here pretty much as a way to fit in and socialise and I am not into that at all). I do have an amazing gf which I live with but I cannot help but feel the need for my own friends like she has, I have always been quite quiet and I do suffer from anxiety so making friends hasn't been easy. I have always kind of described myself as a social chameleon, I can fit in anywhere but I will inevitably usually fade into the background. I do like the idea of having friends from other places around the world and at the risk of sounding rude I wouldn't mind not feeling the pressure of having to meet up in person a lot due to my anxiety as this can be kinda stressful for me at times. 

I do enjoy playing games and I have been part of a few Discord servers in my time but they always seem to have already established friend-groups within the server so it deters me from trying sometimes as I feel like I'm just butting in..

Basically I am wondering if anyone else relates and has any words of wisdom to an outsider like me or would like to chat or play some games together, anything would be appreciated!

I had someone to throw memes, sometimes I even had a lot of communication (for me it's 3-5 people with whom you can correspond almost every day). And when I lost that opportunity, people left me for a variety of reasons. I began to feel the same ""loneliness."" So I still have a good friend and a couple of cool internet ""friends"".

I don’t want to give up finding someone to love but it’s really hard when the past 4 people I have been romantically involved with/ sleeping with have ghosted me and never checked up on me again. Thought dating guys was my mistake, met a girl off hinge last week and we slept together (I’m a girl and was my first time with another girl). She seemed really into it and we texted a couple times after that but it’s been 4 days since I last texted and nothing… I know it was only new and we barely know each other but the constant rejection just hurts so much.

Used to be I’d sink almost a year with a person before reaching the point where I had to cut them off, now I don’t make it past a couple weeks. I told the most recent person I’d been talking to online that it was best if she stopped messaging me today. I know it was the smartest thing for both of us, I thought about it a lot, but it doesn’t stop me from getting that feeling of regret, knowing that once I’ve said something like that I’ve turned it all dramatic and I can’t go back and change my mind because of that. 

I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I don’t have anyone in my life at all, never had friends, only member of my family I liked is dead and I don’t talk to the rest of them, I can’t have relationships because of my issues, so obviously I get lonely and when that gets really bad I cave in and let someone talk to me about shit. But I don’t know why I don’t learn, I’ve gone through this same loop so many times and it always plays out the same way.

Logically, there’s just no circumstance where it can work out. I can’t be lighthearted or carefree and take it as it comes at all anymore, it feels like an act so the longer I try to just be a “normal” person making jokes and having “fun” conversations, the more drained I feel talking to that person, so I avoid them. And it also feels like that’s not who I am anymore, so I’m betraying my personality and who I want to be by acting like that.

So I the only things I can talk about without feeling like I’m faking something is the serious shit that pertains to my traumatic history and mental issues. But I don’t want to talk about that stuff with anyone because it makes me uncomfortable and it always leaves me feeling alone and misunderstood even when they “get it”, so I’d rather just say nothing at all. So I know there’s nothing I can talk about without feeling drained or worse about everything, but I can’t think of any way to combat the loneliness than by trying to talk to people, knowing full well it’s fucked as soon as I open my mouth.

Just feels like I can’t win. I’m either stuck being alone and feeling lonely, or stuck going through this same cycle, having it turn out the exact same way every single time and somehow never fucking learning my lesson. It’s just so draining trying to maintain this type of shit, it’s a constant stressor and I do feel relieved once I get to drop people and don’t have to deal with navigating it anymore, but I also just end up feeling more and more nihilistic each time because it’s just more evidence on the pile that this shit doesn’t get better, and that despite the years of therapy and countless medications or whatever, that it’s an issue that only gets worse as time goes on and I have to push more and more people away and cut them off.",lonely,I’m stuck in a constant cycle of loneliness and pushing people away and I don’t know what to do about it,2022-05-04 19:11:58

Some woman also on the site pointed out what would I even have in common with people who are 10 years older than me... and while I do think people can have friends who are older &amp; have things in common, I haven't been a adult for a long time so I don't really know how friendships work outside the school setting.

We wonder how they did it, and often their advice seems lost on us. Overly personal, quaint and lacking the modern perspective. We must ask ourselves collectively not if we are able to ""make it work"" (especially since so many of us can hardly seem to find someone to even begin to fail with), but are we able to we recreate the conditions that led to their happiness? 

In the past, communities were more tight knit. Depression was unheard of, if it can be believed. Of course, there was sadness, but its prolonged, often seemingly rootless modern manifestation was not. Family was more emphasized, even to the point where marriage was a family affair. I'm sure many have heard that in places in the world where arranged marriage persists, its success and happiness level is in fact not less than our divorce ridden western ""marry for love!"" landscape. Of course, the vast majority of aforementioned western old couples we know weren't arranged. But they were also more engaged in real life, something which probably is a boomeresque eyeroller to many readers, but there was actually more life worth living before we all collectively retreated into the media which has surged in recent times, be it on a computer or television screen. 

Indeed, this sub and all of social media in fact is merely a surrogate community. Ironically the internet's promise of connection has alienated us further, by tempting us with the promise of curating our communities only to have them not measure up to a physical one. People had to interact with neighbors, among other real life community members, before the web. Maybe they were annoying but out of necessity, people compromised with each other. Neither felt they were the main character with a Flanders or Dinkleberg who'd be better written out. On top of this, they had a physical space in common, which probably means more than similar music taste or even sense of humor. And this meant more than just one next door neighbor, it was a whole neighborhood that saw a lot of each other and came to see the community as an organism they had a responsibility to maintain. This applied to both childrearing and being part of a local workforce. Society was a group project, not something astroturfed by corporations and a government completely unaccountable to the consent of its governed.

The media saturation peddled by said corporations also has the detriment of mental sugar rush. The upvote, the like, the retweet, and even the coom, we all live for these tiny, artificial moments of validation. Our dopamine receptors rely on the constant stimulation of both these and whatever media we binge, consoom, daily. It's very easy to see how this overexposure quickly fries the capacity for pleasure. But more specific to the loneliness aspect, the social media mediated, technologically soulless abstraction of ""the soul"" from the physical. Humans did not evolve to have our emotional needs satisfied in text. Each day someone posts on here longing for contact. But the question is: do we have the strength to kick our addiction? Must we tear it down so it is no longer a social requirement to have a smartphone?

So I return to the core question: can we be as our grandparents were? What will it take? In my view, the diagnosis is simple: ask ""what's different now?"" and compare the less lonely days of our ancestors to the situation we're in now and assess with clear eyes whether or not the progress has improved things. It's the treatment that will prove difficult. Can we allow the technological (and social) conditions to stand if they are indeed the root of our collective alienation? And if we cannot, what can we do to replace them?",lonely,Diagnosing the Roots of Modern Alienation,2022-05-04 12:30:00

Looking back on it now, I wish more than anything I could go back and warn my sophomore self not to fall in love with him. Because when I fall, it is not a small thing. I put my heart and soul, my time and thoughts, my hopes and reality, into the idea of a person. This is the story of the time it happened.

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know I walked up an extra flight of stairs every day for a full year to get to class? I could ignore my aching feet after a long day, because all that pain washed away when I would pass by your class. Every time you saw me, you would smile and wave. Then I would wave back. Like clockwork. Did you know that those waves were your greatest weapon?

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know that when we would have an assembly, I got less and less interested in the actual performances? Instead I would silently search for the aisle right in front of the stage, where you would be peeking out with your Nikon D3500 to get the best shot for the yearbook. Did you know I hate the yearbook?

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know what you were doing when took a picture of us during our project and made it my contact photo? How about when you moved your desk next to mine in class and gave me an earbud so we could listen to music together? Did you know what you were doing when I said my hair was messy for Homecoming and you brushed it out of my face? I hate the feeling you gave me. I hate the suit you wore, and I hate the dress in the bottom of my closet that I cannot touch. Because all along I thought it meant you liked me. You never did.

Did you know what you were doing when you fell in love with my best friend?

I didn't. But I do now.

There is something about a broken heart that needs someone to blame. But who? Not my friend-- she had to keep her feelings for him a secret for months because she was afraid to hurt me. Not any of my other friends-- I couldn't open up to them, so they never even knew. And as much as I want to-- not Photo Boy. Because he never saw me as anything but a friend, and I never told him otherwise.

Dear Photo Boy:

Like I tell myself now, I no longer love you. But falling out of love is not a linear decline; it comes in waves. Like when I catch a glimpse of Her phone in class and see months of text conversation with you. Or when you ask her to slow dance at Prom and she asks me if I think you 'like her or not'. these are the moments where I feel myself slip. how DARE she ask me for crush advice with him? a year ago I was counting WAVES. Do you know what I would have done with a single text? But then again, I can't be mad. You didn't choose me. For reasons I will never know, reasons I will spend staring at the ceiling at night over, reasons I still can't understand-- you chose her. and more than anything, I want to see her happy. Because she is my *best friend,* and she is dating the boy she loves. Now my job is to let go of the past for her. But above all, for myself.

Sincerely,

A friend.",lonely,An Open Letter to Photo Boy,2022-05-04 11:04:21

4933,Unlikely_Response125,1651623465,1,"I used to be miserable. Now that I’m on antidepressants it’s been replaced with nothing… complete emptiness… is it better? I mean, I guess. I don’t cry myself sleep anymore because well I can’t cry anymore. I still feel sadness, anxiety and a desire for some purpose in my life however. 

I feel like I tried my hardest to set up myself for success despite my flaws. But it was to no avail, I’ve simply come to learn there are flaws in my character that make unlikable. I’m not a bad person, in fact I have a lot time for people and have never intentionally went out to harm someone. I just cannot connect with people. How many times do I have to put myself out there before people stop gaslighting me and telling me I don’t try hard enough. I mean understand why they offer me the same generic advice, because it works for them. I do take care of myself. I shower every day, have a nice hair cut, nice style, go to the gym. I’m not a good looking guy but I don’t think it’s my looks holding me back it’s something deeper.

I’m just out of solutions… I can’t hold a job… hell I can’t even get past interviews these days because of my awkwardness. You read on linkedin about how “progressive” these companies are regarding neurodiversity but it’s all virtue signalling bullshit. Being awkward and behind socially is essentially a death sentence. People treat you like a murderer a creep, all because of something you can’t control.

To sum things up I’m just painfully tired and alone. I’ve felt this way my whole life… like I’m missing something… that I don’t belong. I’m entering my mid 20s and already done with life. Will I kill myself? Most likely not. But my god I do struggle to see how I can handle another 50 odd years of this living hell.

I’m not special in anyway. But I just don’t think the same as most people. Everything I’m surrounded by feels so superficial and vapid. I try reach out to people but I get ignored a lot

Growing up biracial, I always identified more with one race. Half white half mexican. My parents don't have friends, my mom is an immigrant. I am the only daughter, 10 years older than my brother. The small amount of extended family who I grew up with were all mexican and spoke spanish. But now they are very distant. I grew up in pre-dominantely hispanic San Jose. I picked up all the spanish I could, but I always felt different. I wanted to fit in somewhere so bad. My close childhood friends all moved away. My highschool friends were all mexican/hispanic. But I never let people in my life get close to me because I was insecure about being biracial and my family dynamic. I felt boring and weird, scared of being judged/rejected. During covid I got really isolated and find myself now with no friend group. My parents moved as soon as I started college so now I live alone with my grandma.. I feel sad and alone, craving connection. I have anxiety and consider myself a social introvert. I'm a weird mix between shy and outgoing, but definitely struggle with being vulnerable, communicating, and opening up. All I want is some consistent connection and to finally be able to just relax.

They just complain about how expensive it was the last time they had to deal with it, and give me absolutely no sense of direction.

I'm someone who is considered ""highly functional"" and at the same time treated like garbage. This competition is so unfair. 

To be so below everyone else. 

Right now there is a ""party"" at the university and as I am a useless, human trash I will never have the opportunity to meet someone and live these ""good times"".

My social interactions, my appearance, my voice... It makes me cry all day

I also can't get over the insults I took in the past in high school. ""He won't be anyone in life"", ""He has his family to take care of him"", ""He has a problem""

Just to summarize my problems in a small equation.

Aspergers * extreme social anxiety * loneliness * anhedonia * depression (dysthmia) * Non-existent social skills * (babyface + nerd stereotype) * despersonalization = Most fucked up person on the planet of my age in more developed regions.

Since we’re on different courses and have slightly different schedules, we barely meet each other for breaks. Plus, there isn’t any reason for me to feel petty about it since her set of friends are her classmates and it is technically essential to befriend them to help with projects, etc. Tho, it still kinda hurt.

Hear me out.

For the past 3 years, I have been feeling this inexplicable sadness. Sometimes it gets worse and sometimes it fades. I can manage the sadness; it doesn't make me feel too tired, or render my brain completely useless. There are some days im uplifted but other days I feel dead. My therapist said she would not put a name, but js place it as ""I'm mentally tired.""

Last year i did go for counselling and therapy after telling my parents. However, the effects of the therapy wore off soon after it ended. At that time it was quite bad and i almost took my own life. There were also penknife marks on my hand. After seeing the way my parents reacted, I decided that I don't want to hurt them again by opening up to them that therapy hasn't worked. Anyway, if end up taking meds for this, there is a high chance I can't attain my dream job in the future. 

I don't really have anyone to talk to in school, and my friends generally have other friends too they can talk to. My parents don't find friends important, and I just wasn't happy. I got into a 6 month rs. The girl got toxic towards the end and my parents found out and made a total shit show over it. Frankly, I js haven't been happy in a long time. I have made 1 close friend  and she's the sweetest, but I do want more friends, and friends I can be closer to. 

Loneliness is the big problem here. Not too many people are there who can understand me. Besides, I don't think my life is as tough as others in this subreddit. People tell me I'm a nice guy, but in my heart, I just can't believe that. I've caused lots of pain to others. I don't think I am as good as what other's say. I need to live up to their expectations.

I've been dying to get to know and love someone since my breakup. On top of that, not many people seem to want to be my friend, simply because I take a friendship too seriously, and also I score As is most of my subjects. Sometimes, I really feel like flunking my tests, but it never seems to help me get friends. 

I've been indoctrinated to believe that relationships and friendships aren't as important as studies. I haven't had a close friend for the past 15 years (im turning 16 btw). 

Thanks for hearing me out. Does anyone know what to do for the unexplainable sadness I feel? Is it just me feeling lonely most of the time?

(Note: I am religious, and I seriously love my religion. Its the only thing from keeping me going insane and genuinely ending my own life. I love what He is doing for me, and I accept this as a challenge and I know He wouldn't give me such a challenge if I can't get through it.)

5037,VeryMentallyStable,1651581223,1,"I wish I could just remove whatever pointless part of my mammal brain is responsible for turning human contact and touch into a need. 

It doesn’t serve any purpose for me at all, I don’t need it for my survival or anything, and so all it’s doing right now is adding internal conflict to my head since I don’t like people and I don’t want to be around them, and the type of person I want to be would have very little to do with people, but the pangs of loneliness and touch-starvation still hit regardless of who I want to be, and how much I can’t stand people. And it either leads me to do stupid things I regret and that don’t represent who I want to be, adding to my internal chaos and self-hatred, or I have to push it down and ignore it until I become crippled by how alone I feel. And both outcomes contribute pretty heavily to my underlying, constant suicidal thoughts.

It doesn’t matter how much therapy I do or how many medications I try, nothing makes a difference to the fact that I don’t like people and I can’t connect to them. 99% of people are just garbage. But even the ones that “get it” are problematic to me. I can’t feel or maintain a lasting or deep connection to anyone. I don’t feel comforted by people telling me they relate to me, I still feel misunderstood in some way. 

Even the few times that I have had relatively positive experiences with people for a while, it always ends one way or another, and most of the time it leaves me feeling confused, angry and bitter. I can’t “let go” of it, no matter how I try to frame it in my head, or who I talk to, or how much therapy I do, or whatever else I try. I’m always just left with more memories that I don’t want to think about, places I can’t visit anymore, songs I used to enjoy but don’t want to listen to, movies I can’t watch the same way, and everything “good” about it turns to shit with hindsight and I just want to forget the whole thing ever happened. 

I can’t seem to just enjoy things for what they are or take them as they come, because my head just doesn’t work like that, I can’t look back on the time I had with those people with any fondness at all, it all gets tainted for me. And it makes it almost impossible to see the point in engaging at all, because I’m not going to get my needs met either way, and 100% of my previous interpersonal relationships have fallen apart in the past and I’ve got nothing but bad memories and regrets to show for it. Doesn’t leave much room for wanting to try again, just makes me feel like I’m not learning my lesson, which is that people aren’t for me.

But the alternative is awful too. For over a year now I’ve been completely alone, apart from my sister who I talked to occasionally, but she died just over a month ago, so I really am 100% alone now. No friends. No family I trust. No one at all. And it works for a while, but eventually the loneliness and touch starvation grows until I can’t push it down anymore, but I can’t do anything about it either. I know that interacting with people will only make me feel more alone, so I end up doing really pathetic things like holding onto a pillow in bed every night, pretending it’s a pretty girl who loves me and wants to be there. Just makes me feel pathetic and weak, not at all the stoic, independent person I’d like to be.

I just wish there was a surgery or pill or something you could do in this position, when your mental issues are seemingly untreatable and only worsen as time goes on, and they prevent you from being able to get these needs met. Something that could just remove the need entirely, so I could just be the person I want to be, and not have to deal with any of this, just be 100% independent and capable of fulfilling all my needs completely on my own.",lonely,It feels impossible to do anything to help my loneliness with the issues I have,2022-05-03 22:33:43

Now with all of this happening around me because of that one man, who also took my loved one away on March 10, 2020 (sanctions, isolation and even more misery), and everyone either being just plain ignorant or embracing that freaking letter nationwide I feel like I'm the only one in the entire world with nobody to talk to. The only person who seems to acknowledge my existence without me acting out is some girl from the university, and I don't know how to respond to it.

I don't expect anyone to reply to me. Besides, I enjoy talking to people from BC, Canada and West Coast the most because I feel like I belong on that beautiful Vancouver Island, and my loved one who was taken away from me is from there. Even if it everything goes to hell and I survive, I will try to find a way to get there.

I was builled when I was younger for having acne and it fucked up my confidence and self-esteem ever since. I’m having a hard time socializing since then as I’m scared people will hurt me again which is why I don’t have that many friends and never been in a relationship I believe. I finished my studies last year (which was so fucking lonely because of COVID and being in a new country where I knew no one). I came back home after my degree and ever since I have been isolating myself and I barely leave my house. 

It’s sad but I feel like I need to be in a relationship so bad to not feel like a fucking loser anymore. I want to feel desired and loved by someone. I feel like I need men validation so bad right now to feel better about myself but I’m scared to put myself out there and be rejected. I’m spending hours every single day hating myself and finding new flaws on my body. Since COVID started I haven’t meet new people and I feel like I don’t even know what I look like to other people if that makes sense. Do people think I am ugly? Am I average? Are some men attracted to me? Am I pretty enough to be loved? These questions are driving me insane. I’m almost missing the times where people will bully me because at least I knew what people thought about me and I knew what I could potentially change to be more attractive which is fucked up I know. I feel like I don’t look as good as I could potentially be and it makes me sad.

Men keep saying that women have it so easy and that they can easily be in a relationship which makes me fucking depressed because I’m wondering what am I doing wrong? I went to the doctor today and at some point he asked me if I’m on the pill and it made me feel so bad because this is the life I’m supposed to have as a 24 years old, be in a relationship and having sex and possibly thinking of having a kid soon.

5053,indiums_895,1651571463,1,"22 M- I've grown up with an abusive father which I'm only now just starting to come to terms with and getting some professional help to deal with the after-effects years on. Throughout school, I was bullied relentlessly. Changing schools didn't help either. I've never really had friends. Work colleagues, classmates, etc but never any real friends who I say had my best interests at heart. I was lucky to score my dream job out of school at a large multinational entertainment company but I stuffed that up as covid hit and had to move back in with my parents. Eveything I worked and dreamed for had vanished.  2 years of no job, no one to talk to, and no friends drove me insane to the point of several attempted suicides.

Eventually, I took work up in a warehouse. I became even more depressed and eventually moved out of home after the abuse came back. Now I'm living in a city with a bunch of housemates with who I don't speak to. Unfortunately they do not share the same values of cleanliness, and lack of drug-taking. As a result, I've become even more depressed and extremely lonely, confideing in my room for 99% of the time when I come home. 

I've also come out to my immediate family as Bisexual but I can't shake years of internalized homophobia (Thanks to the media and my school years) towards my sexuality and see my attraction toward men as a negative attribute in the eyes of women if I ever were to date a woman again. I agree that toxic masculinity exists and that there is no stereotypical ""Real man"" - However, I'm left feeling worthless in the eyes of a potential female partner in the future because of my sexuality. I have so much love to give to someone regardless their gender. - this feels quite pathetic. 

I'm trying. I can see a small glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel. This year I want to start studying finance or cyber security governance at university and I'm hoping that I'll meet more like-minded people there but I'm incredibly socially anxious. Almost as if the lockdown period has made me weaker. I honestly can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy and I'm starting to think about suicide daily. It's almost ""too casual"" of a topic for me. 

I'm seeing a new therapist this week but that will take time (If they're the right fit). I'm really trying and I don't want to kill myself. I really don't want to.

When I finally got the apartment, I completely neglected every responsibility in my life and spend the majority of my freetime planning and working to make this my dream home. I felt like this could be the chance to make some changes in my life.

After the first week of living there, I already knew that it's not gonna happen. Hell, it might even get worse. Back home I had my parents and my brothers but here I have absolutely nobody.

I don't have friends that I could invite over. No girlfriend. Most of my family lives too far away to come visit regularly and my parents and brothers are the only people that sometimes come over.

I thought that the independence and freedoms that come with living alone would help me get out of my comfort zone and make me go out more and socialize. And even though I'd love to, I don't know where to go, where to meet people and even how to do it. I'm terribly introvert.

5059,VeryMentallyStable,1651565115,1,"Things just work better when I’m alone. I wouldn’t say I’m happier, but I’m never happy so that’s not really the goal. But things just feel more functional. Being around people just makes me feel like I’m having to grit my teeth to get through until the social interaction is over, and then all I want is to go shut myself in behind as many locks as possible in a place where I know no one can reach me. It usually takes all my effort not to say or do something that goes against who I think I am or who I want to be, and when I do slip up and say or do something like that, it gets added to my internal conflict and self-hatred that I always feel.

I’ve found that I only really like the idea of people, how they appear in the fake scenarios I daydream about from time to time. But reality is never like that, in reality people are always disappointing or frustrating or hard to deal with or they let you down constantly. Always leaves me either just having to tolerate and go along with shit I don’t want to because I don’t have the energy to fight it, or I do have the energy and end up feeling like I’m beating my head against a wall.

I know that I’m better on my own, that I’m more myself, I’m more mentally stable, and I feel less self-hatred when it’s just me. I have zero friends, no one I even talk to at all anymore because I ghosted the last people I knew over a year ago and have been avoiding social interaction as much as humanly possible since. Only consistent person I’ve ever had in my life at all was my sister, but she got hit by a bus just over a month ago, so there is literally no one anymore.

But the frustrating part is that I can’t seem to escape the overriding feeling of loneliness that comes from living like this, even though I know for a fact it’s the best thing for me on every level. I play out scenarios of running into people I used to know at the gym or something in my head on a loop, even if the scenario involves me being angry at the person and probably walking away without even talking, because it’s still some type of meaningful social interaction. 

And today I was walking out of a store and the greeter at the door said goodbye to me and I just had this overwhelming feeling that she just looked so gentle and sweet, she wasn’t even exceptionally attractive or anything, but it just made me think of how much I’d like to be able to just have someone like that hold me and let me lean on her for a while. But I could never do that, I don’t even like people knowing about my past or anything like that, so there’s no way I could ever bring myself to break down like that in front of someone else. I’ve tried to talk to people about the stuff that makes me uncomfortable before and it make my skin crawl and they always treat me differently, even if they become more caring towards me or something “positive” like that afterwards, it makes me feel sick.

I just don’t know how to stop feeling like this, how to stop getting these extreme pangs of loneliness and touch starvation, or at least lessen them so they’re tolerable and don’t put me at risk of doing stupid things I know I’ll regret. I’ve been in therapy for almost 3 years across multiple different therapists, multiple different types of therapy, been on more medications than I care to remember and none of it helps at all.

Kurzgesagts explanation on loneliness is one of the best available. It can help a lot of people if they heed the advice given:

[Everybody feels lonely sometimes. But only few of us are aware how important this feeling was for our ancestors - and that our modern world can turn it into something that really hurts us. Why do we feel this way and what can we do about it?](https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA)

To properly heed any advice, you must employ the Stockdale Paradox:
-&gt;To succeed you NEED to honestly face your reality while at the same time have faith that you will prevail in the end. &lt;-

You Must maintain both Faith in your success (seeing it as inevitable) and an honest view of your paradigms (clear unbiased perspectives and understanding) if you will overcome your loneliness, 
there are no alternatives.

5075,HypnoticOnion,1651555406,1,"At my first school I was that one lonely kid that didn't fit in but drifted between the social groups. I didn't fit in with the nerds or the cool people. I just hung out with whoever would have me on that day. Its like I was a ghost and just nobody noticed me. I very rarely got invited to peoples houses. I didn't have one solid friend at that school. 

My second school was slightly better. On my first day I was mediately introduced to a friend group by someone I knew from the first school. It wasn't all bad. It did feel like the only group I ever belonged to, but it was only for the last 2 years of school. I clearly still had some issues though because I was eating myself to death. There was a fish and chips shop close by and I bought chips almost every day with the box sizes getting bigger. It was to the point where I had to get my gall bladder removed because I had gall stones. I'm slightly better now and I don't eat as much. 

College was the worst. The first year my group had a fight and nobody got along. We all split into groups and I temporarily joined the group of people who I supported but that didn't last too long and somehow I wasn't included in anything they did anymore. Then covid happened. The last 2 years if college was pretty much online so I had absolutely no friends that wanted to hang out with me. I didn't get invited out once. I don't feel like I made a single real friend at college. It was also the same story again of drifting between groups before covid. 

Now I've graduated and I'm sitting at home job hunting. I'm trying to find something that will help me get started in life but its difficult.

I have been trying to date lately but…

I make good conversation. Things have gone well with most that don’t ghost or stop responding. I have had a couple dates. 

This weekend I thought I had it good. Met someone, all things clicked, had a really good time. Then I went into all the things I wanted and to have and where I saw it going…because I’m lonely af and being with people I enjoy has lately turned into “please love me because I’m doomed to be alone!”

Well, this isn’t the first time. At least this time someone responded to tell me how it made them feel and why they wanted to run.

5092,vinedeotroplaneta,1651546082,1,"For a little context, i was lonely all my life. When i was 14-15 i would cry to my dog saying he was my only friend. I've never had a girlfriend, and i also just kissed 2 people in my whole life. 

I met this girl online, after a month i fell in love with her and she said she was in love with me too, we talked about everything for hours and hours, she made me feel like that was real love. It's hard to describe and even harder in English (I'm from Argentina), but the chemistry we had was beautiful. She always told me how beautiful i was and once we would meet she would kiss me and Hug me and be together and all this beautiful things that gave me Hope, because that was the first time that i've ever felt something like that. She was perfect in every aspect, and was too good to be true.

The problem? More than a 1000km between us, but she promised we would meet soon and i searched for a job just so i could have the money to meet her even sooner.

As soon as i started working she started caring less for me, chatting less, and... i think i spoiled you the end. She said ""the distance hurts me"" like she didn't knew from the beginning how far apart we were, stopped talking to me and started dating other guy. 

A year ago I tought i could eat the world, now i don't even want to get out of bed.

Had a lot of projects, hobbies. I was passioned for the things i did. I did want money, new clothes, a sports car, have my own apartment, be with girls, have fun.  

Now the passion is gone, i don't even try flirting with girls because the answer is always the same. I wanted a gaming pc for years and step-father bought me one with all the things i wanted, i turn it on maybe once a week and i play videogames once every 2 months or so.

I'm also in college and i won't pass this year, sorry grandma.

I know I'm not the only one that has passed something similar, so if a girl that did something like that is reading this, fuck you.

I never told him I wanted more because quite frankly I don't think he's into me whatsoever.

After a few months I saw him again at the bar.  Apparently, he was really happy his friend started talking to me so he could.  He asked how I've been and about my bf (who I've been broken up with for a bit now) and why I haven't been snapping him.  He was being all flirty and I brought him back with me once again, but this time he asked to stay the night.  He has never stayed the night or even asked to.  And then he sat and talked to me in the morning before crawling back in bed to sleep more together.  Haven't seen or heard from him since and vowed I wouldn't snap him first again, but I really want to.

I know he doesn't see me like that.  Honestly, I'm not even sure if he's actually attracted to me or just thinks I'm easy.

For me it's the characters in Star Trek Voyager... I don't know why I didn't even like Voyager that much. 
My way of thinking is something that comes packaged with high IQ, low social awareness, and a high intolerance for stupid people... Yet I have come to see that the more intellectually unaware people are the happier they seem to be and the more socially accepted they are. I'm pretty sure some part of this is a function of having a face that always looks worried. That even when people do talk to me and I talk back it seems like within a few sentences of alienated myself somehow and as far as I was aware I was being nice. Usually they tell me they have no idea what I just said. Sometimes though they will respond to a single word I used completely void of the context it was spoken in have at me. Like I blew some sort of hate whistle...

Like I know why Im alone. Im too introverted and dont have that strange social anxiety to keep the convo going. 

I also cant relate to a lot of stuff that people are interested in. And things I like I dont want to talk about. I dont feel close to someone if I do have 2 or so many things in common. Like an example is I like to watch baseball - but only live. And I dont know many players and I know absolutely no history about them or numbers. I just like the actual sport being played. I dont have any affinity for celebrity things or wealth as entertainment. And Ive sat mostly in 2nd row behind first base seats like 1-2x a year but everyone I have taken doesnt like even watching the sport. So I dont go anymore bc I have no one to go with and baseball fans are usually die hard people whom know all the players want to see certain teams face off and all their numbers. 

I also am really bad at pretending or faking interest as all I got is smile and nod. And you do it 3 times in a row etc. 

Im an introvert and also prefer talking about facts or science. New inventions and discoveries. Or how something works. I like pets but I dont really want to hear about peoples pets at work - or tell them about mine. I like experiencing the animal and meeting ur pet is the only part that Id be interested in. One ex friend I told a year and a half ago that Im adopting a cat! And they went off on a tangent about things I need to start doing right away like brushing their teeth. I dont want to hear any of that. Id first say have you ever owned a cat before? And Id say yes 3. End of that chat. Would be my happy place.

Like how asking what kind of music I like is really a pass. IDubbztv has an episode on it that describes my feelings about that to a T. Its not a way to get to know a person or relate to them.",lonely,It sucks when you know what your problems are…,2022-05-03 08:58:54

I feel like a failure and that there is no future for me. With each new big step in my life, I tell myself that it will change. New people, new environment and nothing changes. I make efforts to be more sociable, to be interested in others, to pay attention to my appearance and I remain invisible.

5148,SnoopDoggnYay,1651522909,1,"I see a lot of honest yet overwhelmingly negative content on this sub. So I just wanted to add my perspective / a kind of mantra I've been saying to myself to get me through. I hope no one takes this the wrong way as I am just trying to be encouraging and obviously don't know everyones situation. 

Yes I am lonely, very terribly lonely, and I want nothing more than to meet my future husband. I want to have someone to hold and care for, someone to share the experiences of life with, to share my authentic self with and everything that I think and is in my mind. But this will not happen by magic, everyday I must either work on myself to be the best version of myself that I can be, or work on meeting new people. If I have to focus on school or work at the expense of my social life, then I will go to a cafe, and desensitize myself to making small talk with the barista so I can get better at socializing. If I have to stay inside to work I will take time to learn more about my psychology and read how to be a good partner in relationships. When I do have time to go out, I will be brave and try my personal best. I might feel anxiety, face rejection, or just not vibe with anyone. But I will put myself in situations that I enjoy the activity anyway so that if I don't meet anyone, I still have a good time. I like going to the art museum so I might as well go when they are having an artist talk event and chit chat with other people there. Maybe I will meet someone, but worst case I will have some good convos and enjoy myself. If I'm painting I can take my paints and canvas outside to the park to be in vicinity of other people. It might not seem like much, but over time  it adds up. You will have better social interactions, feel less anxiety, meet new people (some good some bad) and most importantly of all, avoid falling down a pit of dispair and self pity. I remind myself I am a unique person which means I don't make friends or connections with people easily. There are some things about myself I can not change, and many things that I wouldn't change even if I could. I like my perspective on life, my weirdness, and the path I have chosen for myself, even though it is objectively more difficult. I focus on the fact that I don't hate myself, I just want to grow as a person and meet my people! Life for me will be more like running around collecting rare pokemon than having an instant group of friends and connections, and I can learn to enjoy that process. 

I know what you are going through right now feels so hard, and so overwhelming, but wallowing in your own loneliness is actually the easy choice. The harder thing to do is to try and do something about it every single day. Most of us can, and so we should. So I encourage everyone on this sub, in addition to acknowledging and sharing the experience of being lonely with others, also share your successes. 

Today I went to a restaurant by myself to eat and felt very lonely, and pretty overwhelmed with the feeling that I am getting older and the one thing that matters more to me than anything else, finding a life partner, hasn't happened for me yet. I started to sink into feeling like something is wrong with me, questioning why my past relationships ended and feeling like everything was my fault, ""I should have tried harder or just stayed and been unhappy so at least I wouldn't be alone."" I felt pathetic about how much I daydream about being in a happy relationship with someone. But then I actively chose to focus on the fact that I have grown so much. I went from completely alone with absolutely no friends and very limited contact with my family, to having one really good female friend who I can talk to and share almost anything with and a better relationship with boundaries with my family. If I can grow enough as a person to make and maintain one long term friendship I can make and maintain one partnership.

5154,Possiblyovrthinking,1651521267,1,"Dating is really tough in this world, at least when it comes to having a genuine connection with someone. I (25M) have had two long term relationships in my life. The first, I never should have been with as we had NOTHING in common, but she was cute and I had been chasing her for a while. Also, I was seventeen. You live and learn. 

The second relationship was a much more genuine connection and I am so thankful for her being in my life even though we wanted completely different things by the end of it. 

Aside from those I have had dates, and flings, and complicated stuff in between, but nothing that was tangible. 

I've been on dating apps for a while now and after several, uninspiring dates, I recently went on what was probably the best first date I've ever been on. I've never felt some comfortable with someone so quick. The next two days she didn't text me back and I felt miserable. Then she did text me back, explaining that she simply didn't feel the same. 

That's how the cookie crumbles. I think finding a person a person in your life that you ""get"" is such a special thing, but also... It's not everything. 

You have your family. You have your friends. You have little things like books, and movies, and music that you enjoy. Maybe it's tv show or a sports team. Maybe you have a hobby. At the end of the day, we are individuals no matter what. It's easy as all hell to feel ""incomplete"" without someone to share your life with. 

So I think what I'm saying is put yourself out there, but don't feel too bad if you're not having any luck. I think a lot of humans feel the same way. The same frustrations and short comings. It's rare to find something real and you'd be surprised to see just how many people are settling. 

Focus on yourself and what you enjoy and what makes you feel alive as best as you can, because waiting to live your life for a second person, in my opinion, is no way to live.  Enjoy yourself. Love yourself.  We're only here for a short time.",lonely,Feeling a little down and thought writing about it might help somehow,2022-05-03 05:54:27

I'm an awesome guy, do anything someone asks of me within reason. Works out, will eat anything, will talk about anything.

I just wish people would initiate with me. Ask me to do something (that involves them, not baby sitting). Send me a funny text or meme. Tag me in a vine or tiktok. Anything. Maybe once every two weeks or so someone will ask me to do something. Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't.

Student loan repayments and other life issues that have happened to me have only magnified all of it as the years have dragged on. As it is, I basically have no one and the few people who do show up in my life inevitably disappear soon after.

Once a ""friend"", a very tenuous definition of one but still someone I talked to on and off, offered to listen to what was bothering me one day. After telling them about some things that had been really weighing on me, instead of just being supportive and trying to be a part of my life to help with the loneliness, basically just said I was ""too negative"" and didn't have any fight in me so I should go get therapy. After I explained to them that I literally couldn't afford it when I'm already struggling because therapy is expensive, they said that if I actually wanted my life to get better I would find a way to make it happen. When I was just like ""that literally isn't how any of this works"" they ghosted me and haven't spoken to me again, in years.

I'm so sick of things like this happening, because this wasn't the first nor the last time something similar happened. People offer to be there, but what they REALLY mean is that they want to feel like a good person by doing something but don't actually care enough to give you time out of their lives. So they throw some generic zero effort ""advice"" at you and pat themselves on the back, then when you say that it doesn't help, blast you for being too negative or some other nonsense.

If nothing else it exemplifies how few people care unless you serve some kind of direct benefit to them, and how few understand or care to understand how lonely and crushing life can be for others.

it's been couple years since then. while i do still hate myself at times, i finally able to accept myself as who i am. but it took me so long that i missed on so many things in life, because i was just confused the whole time. I know I'm unattractive, I guess I can try my best to look better. I know I have trouble making friends, I guess I just gotta force myself to socialize more. I live in a third world country and it is pretty conservative and I am not straight. What the fuck can I do about that? 

seeing teenage story makes me extremely depressed. i know it's ironic because I've been replying to some thread in this subreddit positively as if i even know what I'm talking about. but it's just fucking suck i wasted all those years doing literally nothing. not that even if i know myself then what i know now, i can do anything about it. i want a normal life. why am i like this.

i have a family. i have roof over my head. i don't have to work to earn money. am i selfish for still wanting more? why do i still feel lonely. it's the loneliest i have been. maybe because i know i can't really be myself, and have to keep lying to myself, and making sure no one knows.

Somedays I feel overwhelmed by my emotions and all I can do is cry and harm myself. I don't know what to do anymore.

Why do I work so hard at making friends yet I am still alone. I do not understand...

I am considering giving up and just accepting the fact that I was born to be alone. I feel trapped in a loop of being broken and not having the skills or the support to fix myself. I do not know what to do anymore. I just am alone so much of the time and it brakes me. 

Not to mention all the trama that I have to deal with. From childhood abuse and isolation. I find it hard to love myself when all remember was being bulled. Whether that be my sister, kids at school, teachers, or even my parents. I have so much trama. From kids in my elementary school saying that they would rather kill themself than date me to high school bullies making fun of me. Teachers use to blame me for stuff like valium or spreading lice (never had any in my life) to constantly saying ""stop giving your mother grief"" (That was said by my elementary school special ed teacher).

She’s my most favourite person in the world, it’s just sad that now I am not hers, possessive as that may sound.

There is a part of me that has never felt more alone. I rarely see her now as she always goes to see her boyfriend (who lives a few hours away), and even when I do see her it feels like he’s all we talk about. That or my love life (nonexistent) which gets frustrating after a while.

Sometimes it feels like she’s tired of being around me, today she passively mentioned that I make no effort, which felt sort of unfair as lately it feels like neither of us have. After a while of having my invitations to go out ignored I’ll admit I’ve stepped back a little. Thing is I have no one else to run to and that used to be okay, but now when I acknowledge that around her she seems judgmental. 

I want to make other friends, I just seem to be atrocious at it, we both used to be. However now she’s grown out of that, whilst I still remain face down in the dirt. I don’t resent her, but hanging out with her makes me feel inadequate, I don’t know what to do.

Today she also said she wouldn’t come out with me for a while to save money for a trip her and this guy are going to go on. That felt like a stab to the heart - some sort of confirmation that she really wants to be with him more than me.

Even then I feel so lonely. Friends can only do so much, a person needs to find genuine connection and I always feel so out of place. Maybe I should just let go of that idea and allow myself to become normal but I have tried many times and it never made me feel alright. It feels so uncomfortable and limiting.

I find it so weird how a lot of people can easily connect with others, maybe they're just comfortable with themselves that in any situation they find themselves in they're okay? 

Am I the weird one for feeling so extremely out of place? I just don't get it. I've only ever felt complete once in my life but life ain't like the movies so it ended and that was almost 6 years ago.

I keep wondering when my moment would click when I'm fine being where I am and okay with whatever tomorrow brings and find enjoyment with that peace. I feel so out of touch, this is something teenagers worry about not adults like me?

I have a job where I'm actually really good, got a place to myself which isn't a big one but that might have to change soon to a smaller one if I ever get forced to work back in the office or I quit.

5189,EERMA,1651510928,1,"There’s little we can control in the world. Other people, the stock market, weather, or world events are outside of our influence. However, we can control ourselves, and that’s all we need to control. Changing our inner world leads to the changes we wish to see in our lives.

It may be hard to believe that changing our thoughts or attitude can make us healthy, wealthy, and wise. However, making inner changes can have dramatic effects on every part of our lives.

### Enhance your life by making these internal changes:

**How you view failure.** Do you view failure as an embarrassment? Is it something you should avoid at all costs?   
 

● What if you viewed failure as simply a step along the way to success? **Failure just means that the approach you used didn’t work.** It’s an opportunity to re-think your process and try again. If you keep learning and making improvements, how can you possibly fail in the long-term?

● The way you view adversity plays a big part in your overall wellbeing. How do you view setbacks? – are they personal, permanent and pervasive or temporary situations to be built upon?  What view would be most useful to you?  
 

**Values.** Suppose someone valued charity, kindness, and modesty. What type of life would they lead? Suppose someone else valued freedom, adventure, and courage. Now, suppose a third person valued money, power, and greed. It’s easy to see how these three people would lead very different lives.

● What are your values? Do they support the life you want to live? Or, is your life in line with your values?  
 

**Beliefs.** Beliefs frame how you view the world. What you believe about yourself may be limiting. Beliefs evolve through time: do you believe the same about Santa Claus now as you did when you were six years old? 

● List some of your beliefs about the world, yourself, and life in general. **How are those beliefs helping or hurting you?** What beliefs would be helpful for you to develop and enjoy the life you desire?

**Attitude.** Do you expect things to work out for you, or are you primarily pessimistic? You’ll be less likely to try to do something if you have negative expectations. A positive attitude can help with your patience and ability to persevere when things aren’t going well.

● Consider how your attitude is impacting the results you’re generating in your life.  
 

**Gratitude.** Giving yourself a reminder of what is already working in your life can positively impact your attitude and expectations. It can also reduce anxiety and benefit your perspective.

● Take a few minutes from time to time to list the things you’re grateful for. Notice the small things – they’re often, actually, the big things!  


**Thoughts.** Our thoughts are under our control, though it might not seem that way. It’s easy to prove this to yourself. You can choose to think about an ice cream cone or a green cow. You can choose to think about anything you like.

● It’s valuable to take control of your thoughts. **If you’re predominately thinking about negative outcomes, you’re going to struggle.**

● Monitor your thinking, keep things in perspective. Note those recurring, unhelpful, thoughts: challenge yourself to challenge yourself. 

Changing yourself internally can support you in living your best life. **Without making those inner changes, any behavioural changes are likely to be superficial.** You’ll be constantly fighting yourself – and that’s hard work!

Inner changes align your thoughts with your behaviour: you with the world around you.",lonely,Changing From The Inside Out,2022-05-03 03:02:08

The friendship was pretty open (not THAT open), we would sit by the fire together and chat for hours.  I would hold her and we would support each other with our relationship problems and other life issues.  We would see each other many times per week. I adored her but I also knew she was WAY out of my league.

And then, one day, I decided to tell her how I felt. As I expected, it wasn't something she was interested in but what I didn't expect was that it would change our friendship forever.

Gone were the frequent outings, the multiple text messages per day, the chats by the fire, all physical contact except for the sterile hug one gives to someone they don't know very well. She stopped telling me about her relationships and other life issues.  All interactions became very acquaintance-like, devoid of any emotion or feeling. Our IRL interactions dropped from multiple times per week to maybe once or twice a year. I would get occasional ""how are you"" texts but if I actually tried to tell her how I felt, she would shut down the conversation quickly.  She did NOT want to talk about it.

Over the next 10 years or so, I was sort of able to convince her that my feelings wouldn't get in the way of our friendship so she opened up a bit but nowhere near how things once were.

I was never really a very emotional person. But as I got older and mid-life kicked in, my crisis kicked in full speed and I started having emotional feeling I had never felt, including love like I have never felt. 

Over the past few years, my friend has had to go through some major personal tragedies and there would be days where I would spend them with her helping her out with various things. Just being near her would give me these intense emotional highs.  Any physical touch, no matter how platonic, was electric. I stopped seeing her age or physical attributes and started seeing the most wonderful, amazing, and beautiful woman I have ever seen. When she makes eye contact with me it feels like I am listening to an orchestra full of rainbows. I am literally high on emotions and hormones.

That high of an emotional feeling doesn't happen without a crash.  After a weekend together helping her out, I sit here at my desk at work with this indescribable emptiness and tightness in my chest. I keep staring at the text message notification to see if I got one since that last time I looked 5 seconds ago. The 40 ton pressure of loneliness is just relentlessly crushing my soul and I cannot stop it. I cannot get away from it. I can't just stop loving her. I cannot work, I cannot relax. I have severe withdrawal symptoms. 

When I am with her, it makes me so happy. All of my worries and concerns are just gone. But once we part, the sadness and emptiness returns along with the realization that we probably only have a handful of times left to be together.

It is torture.

5198,Affectionate_Area476,1651506703,1,"I used to think I didn't need anybody. Like I'd skate through life on my own, and never look back. I thought I could make it.

I can't. And I don't know how. It feels like too much, all at once. I'm so lonely that it actually hurts a little; there's an invisible hand reaching into my chest and just squeezing my heart. I feel so alone. No one's ever told me that they cared about me, or that they loved me. I think I was still a kid when I figured that out. It's weird, you know. You grow up watching all of these TV shows with happy families in them, where no problem is ever too big to solve. You grow up thinking *love's the answer*. And then you just grow up, period, and realize *Oh*. *No one actually loves me*. It's not a happy, loving home. It's a house full of strangers that used to coo over you when you were born, strangers that won't look you in the eye anymore now that you're 20.

I haven't had any friends in years. I haven't laughed with someone else in so long. I haven't had anyone to hug. I haven't had a conversation last longer than an hour. I haven't had someone to trust. It's not for a lack of trying, either. They say you're supposed to make best friends for life in college; I haven't found anyone like that. People tend to avoid me. I've tried everything to fit in, even with my anxiety. I try to be normal. To be the kind of person people talk to. Nothing works. I've tried making friends online, too, but I think something's wrong with me. I try so hard, but something's wrong. I can never keep friends for very long. I end up saying the wrong thing or I take too long to reply, and everything falls apart. I can't do it. It just hurts everytime, so I've stopped.  People reach out to me, sometimes, when I share a little bit of myself like this. But I don't want to be someone's charity case. I don't want people to befriend me on the merits of my heartache and struggle because that's not who I am. I don't want to be that person. I want to be a friend. But I don't know how. No one ever teaches you these things.

And here I am. I'm so pathetic. Some days, when I'm feeling dark and gloomy, I resort to going on anonymous chat sites for conversations. I figure that's easier; they're just one-off chats, anyway, and if I can make someone's day better, then that's great. It's simpler. I don't have to be afraid of getting left behind or abandoned, because it's a total stranger. We talk about our days, and that's it. But then, socialization becomes a necessity, a bar for me to fill. Other days, I just talk to myself. I pretend I'm two people. I text myself on one account, and reply with the other. I practice having normal conversations where everything goes well, and I say all the right things. And then I stop, realize what I'm doing, and feel even worse. 

Recently, I read something online that made me think about myself, who I am and why I find it so hard to socialize. It's such a big thing. I want to tell someone about it, but there's no one I trust. I want to open up to a family member, and say *hey, I think something's wrong with me; hey, I think I have autism*, but I can't. I don't think they'll care. I don't think it matters to them. I'm so tired.

And that's me, all told. I thought it'd help to lay my soul bare like this, where no one knows my name. It's easier that way. I don't like associating any of these Real and Present Problems (yes, capitalized) with me. With my identity. I don't like that this is me. Tomorrow, I'll probably feel a little better. I'll draw, and I'll write, and I'll cry, but I'll live tomorrow. It's just awful that this isn't a phase. It's a cycle that never ends. I hope things start looking up for me somehow.

On weekends you catch up on things you couldn't do during the week. It's all stupid lol."" - Neqina Wright

Adulthood is tough for every teenager. Going through the uncertain and unpredictable phases of life at this stage, from which our personality and dynamics of behavior are moulded, we are developing with age and time. Social situations etc make us react to them which mould our emotional responses and this in turn adds to our emotional growth. Many teenagers are confused and perplexed with the changes they go through, it is tough for some to even comprehend, and tough for some to even face.
Even though being surrounded by tons of people, many of still feel that void within us, something that is still empty no matter how much we try to fill the gap with the presence of people. Maybe it is not such a great feeling after all, but it does definitely keep one wondering for the rest of their life. The void makes one think about their existence in this hustly bustly world surrounded by people, from which we obtain happiness in their presence, while us being alone are left with thoughts of loneliness.
How would one overcome this void? Is it something us humans can get over? Is loneliness something all of us humans suffer from? Why does the feeling of being lonely, being all to ourselves not keep with the concept of self-love and self-growth?
I hope people get more clarity with themself and their loneliness, i hope they overcome this and enjoy their own company for not everybody, except a few people whom we seem to get a reciprocation of maintaining a relationship from, are the ones that would define us and  social circle.

5231,MoparMan831,1651488430,1,"Hey guys,hope you all had a great weekend.so…I live in Oregon and it’ll be my two year anniversary of living here in August. I grew up in Santa Cruz California and I miss it every day and lately home is all I’ve been able to think about. It’s such a magical place,I mean it truly is. I left my heart there and the only real “friend” that I have. Me and hun haven’t been in touch in quite some time now. We both stay busy because of work related stuff and what not so it’s understandable but I often just feel like happiness is far behind me now and an eternity of loneliness has positioned itself for good. I work 50 hours a week,therefore I don’t have time to even think about going out to meet new people or do anything spontaneous even as much as I dream about it or would like to. All I can seem to find comfort in is sleeping and spending time with my dog which isn’t even much now given my situation. I just miss home non stop. Constantly. 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I’m in southern Oregon and about an hour and a half from the ocean as opposed to growing up where I did and being a two minute walk away from the beach. I miss waking up to that fresh salty breeze flowing through my open window,the sound of seagulls,sea lions,the late night and early morning fog…watching the surfers,sailboats,stingrays swimming close to the shore. Going to the wharf for an amazing warm bowl of clam chowder. I took a drive to the Oregon coast about a month ago and was so disappointed. The long drive being one thing,but the atmosphere once I got there and a million other small aspects made the experience enjoy so pleasant. In fact the journey made me more depressed. My heart remains back home. It’s an 8 hour drive which isn’t bad by any means but it’s not something I can take time out to conquer whenever I please. But I am on a mission to get back as soon as I can. I watch videos almost nightly on YouTube just so I can watch and listen to the waves crash upon the cliffs over in the west side.

 Rant:
Hayo, I'm a 15 year old girl. I've been homeschooled for 4 years. it started off great, and I still enjoy it because I can learn things the way I want to and I don't get bullied. But, at the same time, I have become extremely lonely. I have 0 in person friends who are my age. (And yes, I do get out of the house. I take in person teen Martial Arts and I go to local concerts) whenever I attempt to talk to another teen, they look at me like I'm a complete freak. I'll try my hardest to introduce myself, but it always comes off as cringey and weird. Some people will blame this on .e being homeschooled, when really, I know of a lot of homeschooled teens who actually have friends. I have never been good at socializing, even when I was in public school. I have always been awkward and different. All of the public schools near me are trashy and complete shit, I wouldn't feel safe going to public school. I live near the ghetto... too many gangs. 


Now it's been getting harder than ever to deal with the loneliness. I have a lot of online friends, and they are all going to school dances, chilling at the mall with friends, going on dates, going to parties with friends.. and I have to admit. I'm extremely jealous. Don't get me wrong, I love my life. My parents are amazing, and I go to a lot of great concerts. But at the end of the day, I wish I had someone to hang out with and actually talk to In person... Like my age.. who's genuine, and not fake. But again, I'm just really fucking shitty at introducing myself.. Especially in groups of multiple people. I never know the right things to say.. I wanna give a good first impression.. but I also don't wanna lie. People will always tell me to just ""be myself"" so I do, and then I get viewed as a freak. I really don't know how to handle it. It's always just a loose loose situation for me.


When I was younger, I always dreamed of being a teenager. (From watches TV shows, movies, reading books) Now I'm actually a teenager and im experiencing none of the things that I think a teen should experience. For fucks sake, in 15, turning 16 fairly soon... and I haven't even had my first kiss yet! Or anything similar. Infact, nobody has EVER actually even thought of me in a romantic way. I fell like I've been lied to my entire life by media. Altrough.. other teens (including homeschooled teens)  are experiencing the stuff that media shows.. so I really don't know. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but it's really not working out. Any advice is strongly appreciated.",lonely,I feel like I'm missing out on being a teenager sometimes,2022-05-02 17:57:13

5252,Icy-Essay4371,1651475816,1,"I’ve been with my wife (dating - marriage) about 8 years now. Throughout that time she’s always had a serious difficulty making female friends. It makes me feel terrible because I have a healthy amount of close guy friends, but she has no girlfriends she can consider close. Particularly speaking there’s a friend group that I have been friends with for about a decade (3 married guys). I’ve also known their wives for almost as long. They’ve all known my wife for quite some time now, from the moment I started dating her really. The issue is that all their respective wives seem to take absolutely no interest in truly being friends with my wife. And although I can understand how this is bias coming from me, my wife is one of the kindest, funniest, down to earth women I know. She’s very outgoing and positive and everyone I know in my life loves her. Even the wives of my friends, on a surface level get along with her and seem to like her as well. I’ve seen her initiate conversations with all of them, invite them out, try to ask them questions to get to know them better. All the things you’d expect out of someone who is sincerely trying to make friends. The issue is that when it comes to a real friendship forming, it never happens. They are in their own world amongst them 3, and never include her in outings, group chats, photos, etc. It’s become an issue because my guy friends invite me and my wife to do things with them regularly, but my wife feels perpetually out of place because she can’t break the clique barrier that she feels is there. Furthermore, my wife isn’t a desperate, people pleasing type person, so if she feels she’s being thought of as not good enough or excluded on purpose, she closes up and it becomes hard to convince her to give the situation a chance. I’m at a crossroad because part of me feels like I should have her express her feelings to the girls (seeing as that we have such a long history), but at the same time I don’t feel like it would help anything, because it might just be seen as a desperate attempt for approval. At the same time, I can’t just cut off my friends because not only won’t that help the situation, I know it would make my wife feel terrible. But I can feel this situation is reaching a breaking point with her where she will simply cut them all off and I’m not sure how that will affect my relationships. Of course if that’s what she needs I am willing to support her. But I would like to avoid buring bridges. I can admit that there are some issues that I can identify that may be at the root of the problem. First of all, these aren’t all my best friends. Only one of them is. That friend has always told me that he and his wife see us as their closest friends, and that now that my wife and I are married They see my wife as a sister. But that has never actually been the reality in relation to how his wife treats mine. She’s cordial and we hang out from time to time but there’s never any real connection that forms between them. my relationship with these guys has fluctuated not because of any issues we’ve had but just because they’ve always been in different phases of life than me. For instance they all started dating their current wives before I dated mine. They all got married around the same time whereas I married my wife 1-4 years after they did. Now they’re all having babies and we don’t want a child. Also, my wife is Trinidadian, and all their wives are Hispanic so they have an underlying connection that they don’t share with my wife. Although I don’t think that it’s right that those differences should make it so hard for us all to get along, my wife is convinced that it might have something to do with ethnic background. Not that she thinks they’re racist but she thinks that the fact that they’re all Hispanic has added a layer of difficulty to them accepting her as a friend. I’ve never had issues making friends with guys and I’ve always been perplexed at why it seems many women tend to have issues making good friends of the same gender. From what I’ve observed their friendships tend to be competitive, shallow, and full of insecurities. So it’s very hard for me to connect to her situation and give her good advice. I’ve done all I know to do to keep her patient and positive with the situation. And of course I can’t nor do I want to force her to try to get along with people who are clearly not interested in her value as a friend. I’m hoping someone can help me navigate this situation.",lonely,Trying to help my wife make friends,2022-05-02 17:16:56

As of recently, it has gotten to the point where I am having nightmares that continue to increase in frequency as well as intensity. Tonight, I want to try for the first time in a very long time to articulate my daily struggle in hopes that maybe it is heard. Here’s also hoping that maybe venting will help me cope. 

Every single day without fail, I live my life utterly terrified of other people. I can’t be in a room full of people for too long without getting extremely anxious. My heart beat picks up, my mind starts to race, and I lose my focus. All my emotions get pushed aside so I can appear as though I have it all together. When I leave the social situation, I’m always asking myself whether or not I came off to them as a bad person and I begin shaming myself. I also have to physically catch my breath and comfort myself on my worst days. 

Whenever somebody even so much as looks at me, it feels as though they can see all of my flaws and are judging me for them. This leaves me feeling ashamed and it makes me wish that I were just invisible.

Loud noises startle me so badly and can even almost send me into a panic on my worst days. This also happens if people are loud around me. If someone shouts, I presume that they’re yelling at me and I get this sense of dread and shame. This also happens when someone around me is mad or sad. I also worry that it’s my fault and it results in the same emotional response. 

Because of these issues and more, I do my best to avoid talking to other people as much as humanly possible. I can’t even make a phone call without my anxiety rapidly spiking to panic inducing levels. I put up so many walls in fear of being hurt. 

The worst part about it is that I don’t always like this life I’ve chosen for myself. I try to tell myself that I can make it on my own and that I don’t need anyone’s help or company, but then I look around and I see people forming friend groups. I see other people communicating happily and without worry or shame. God how I wish that I could do what they do. They always make it look so easy. 

Making friends is so extremely hard for me. It’s made even harder by the fact that I’m plagued by the sense that none of my thoughts, feelings, or anything hold any value to anyone. Not to mention I also have this fear that someone is going to come out and say the harshest thing imaginable to me and just destroy me. Is it silly that I worry about that more than about whether or not someone will physically hurt me?

I’m not sure if these paragraphs make any sense, but I just needed to get it out there somewhere. Daily life is such a huge struggle for me and I am just so tired of suffering like this every day.",lonely,Living in fear,2022-05-02 16:38:10

Anyway it went the worst way I possibly could have imagined, and we didn’t dislike each other she had a nice vibe but we didn’t exactly hit it off. This was my first chance in awhile and I sucked at it. I want to try it one more time and if I don’t like it I’m done. But I can’t help but feel like this is gonna be my life forever. Lonely asf.

Because she basically treated me like someone she can just hit up to game with when there's no one else around. A second priority. At least that's what I felt like.

Now I woke up from a romantic dream involving her. Nothing too x rated but basically a textbook romance with kissing hugging etc. And I don't even remember my dreams 99% of the nights.

I don't think I'm gonna do anything about it. I cut her off and she lives too far for me to have a proper relationship where I'm at in my life (barely 20, no car nor license, late work times in retail)

I’m a social butterfly. I have a lot of acquaintances in my life, I have no problems socializing or meeting people. But for some reason, no one wants to be close to me for very long. I don’t know what I’ve done to become so deeply isolated. Why doesn’t anyone see the value in my friendship, or want to partake in all the fun, love, and excitement I have to offer…. I just want people to be close to. Best friend(s), family, a significant other, even my own child doesn’t really like me much of the time. I try so damn hard to please everyone, to be generous and courteous. I love life, I’ve found so much joy in everything it has to offer. I’ve spent the last two years in an existential crisis that eventually led to growth and healing in so many areas of my life and my identity. I spent a large part of my 20’s getting comfortable being alone. I figured it out, and it was beautiful and so liberating.

The spring term hasn’t treated me kindly. I experienced panic attacks, high anxiety, and days where I just cried and cried. 

Right now I only have two friends which one is my roommate and a long time friend. But as of now things have been a bit distant. I barely see and talk to my roommate. When I wake up they are gone. The only time I see them is an hour before bed and even if we talk it’s super short or I just nod my head when they ask me questions because at that point I just kinda become mute.

My other friend, they’re great but they been busy and I understand. When we hangout it’s alright. They hangout in the middle of the night and when I have to get back to my dorm it’s like 3am and I get scared and tell them if they walk me back but they don’t want to. So I kinda avoid hanging out with them during those hours. 

I just spend all my time alone in the dorm in silence. Sometimes I forget how my voice sounds like until my roommate comes back. I don’t know what to do most of the times because I lost interest in my hobbies. 

I tried to make online friend and online dating but it ended up being bad because it overwhelms me so much that it spikes up my anxiety.

I am a 14 year old male in high school right now and my life has been a mess ever since quarantine. For an entire two years of my life I didn't speak to a single person. All my friends have forgotten about me except one.

I met this one girl who invited me to sit with her and two other girls. We became friends and I was still depressed and felt horrible everyday. At the same time during lunch, I was bullied by this group of people and they were horrible and I felt horrible everytime.

This one girl in that group of friends, hugged me for the first time in my life. That feeling, I miss it so much, my entire week felt amazing just from that. She stoped after like two weeks and only hugged me four times. I felt horrible after that, I was wondering what I did wrong. I've been hugged two more times by one toher girl since then, and one of those times was when I started crying in class. I love my four friends so much, if I didn't have them, I dont know how I would survive.

I introduced one of those girls to my friend that was a guy and after only after like a week of knowing each other, they started hugging everyday, and holding hands and stuff. They were doing that as friends by the way. I'm so jealous of them and wish I could do that with her.

Now, I'm in my room and I cry every single night from saddness and loneliness. I know I should be grateful for at least some friends but the stress and everything is too much for me.

I took my savings and spent it all at the casino but I just got mad for about two hours then woke up fine. I use to drink a lot till I’d pass out on previous break ups because I was so sorry for myself because I couldn’t get any other girl. Then got duis and quit drinking will be 3 years this month.

My familiy put together a shitty cake for me yesterday and rushed through the celebration to move on to their own activities. I understand others have their own things, but man, it was painful. And today has been lonely and painful and I have nothing planed for tomorrow other than work… I don’t understand why life has turned out like this for me. I have put myself out there to find a relationship but everything seems to fizzle out … and now i feel old. I feel like i was a good catch and now i missed my opportunity. I have tried being positive and not focusing on that too much.. but i have to come to terms that my life is just me my job and my dog… my dog has been with me for 13 years and she is slowly fading which is super hard to think the end is coming, and so even more loneliness and heartbreak is in the horizon. My heart is broken by my view on what life should look like.. and by the people who have come into my life and chosen not to stay. Ive tried to be strong to keep going but i dont want to wake up tomorrow to 38 with the same life ive been having. I pray to God to let me see my life’s purpose so that i can be ok with my loneliness but i can only feel my heart’s desire to be loved and married again . I cant stop crying rn.  I feel like everyone else is too busy for me. I reach out to friends and extended family but everyone’s always postponing plans we make or just busy… some people dont even answer.

When i was in first grade, one of my only two ""friends"" was mean as fuck to me for no reason and the other friend like her more. In 5th grade my two new friends liked each other more and would do stuff like go to the movies during their sleep overs and never did that with me, then they both left me for other people in middle school. The new group of friends I met had known each other basically their whole childhood up until that point. 

Thats how it's been my entire life. I try to join peoples groups but i can never really make it in and eventually they just fade out of my life. 

I decided I was gonna put myself out there and actually try to make friends when i went to college, but that still happened. I literally got replaced by someone who was more popular than me. 

Now im a junior. I thought I had something with this classmate, and eventually we started having casual makeouts. It's pathetic, but it's the closest i've had to a serious relationship. She even convinced me to be an RA with her over the summer. 

Lately she hasn't been talking to me as much. I wanted to get food after dnd with her and she completely blew me off and got food with her roommate. I was worried I was starting annoying her, but decided i was being anxious and over dramatic. I got the confidence to ask her if she wanted to room together during the RA thing, sure she would be excited, and she just said ""I'll think about it,"" and i tried to save myself by saying ""that's okay, i'll be fun to meet new people with the randomly selected roommates"" and she like the message and didn't say anything else.

Obvs there's more to my relationship with her but i'm p sure it's over at this point and I don't know why. I don't know why it's so hard to make friends and foster that kind of relationship. I don't know why it seems so effortless for everyone else and I can barely keep up with having more than 2 people in my life.

5344,Draconian000,1651444680,1,"I'm a 25 male from Tunisia, my culture encourages sociable behavior and puts great emphasis on community values. I felt disconnected from all the social fuzz ever since I was a little, on the surface I had friends and a normal community life but deep down I didn't really trust people and always felt ashamed of myself, probably because of my parents and because of my own internalized thoughts and patterns of thinking. Things were fairly normal but started slowly getting worse and worse until I got where I am today, I'm 25 and I only have one close friend and few meaningless acquaintances and old friends from my town  (I cut off so many close friends because of my radical borderline reactions and behavior sometimes).    


I'm not quitting on my life, I crave friends and I want to fix all the mistakes I've made and cure my social anxiety, but my own thoughts are blocking me, and this is the point I'm trying to make: I feel like I lost the opportunity of having ""true social life"" which is in my definition being a true part of the local community (my town) and having connections in one way or another with all the people there, basically like any other person in town. I feel like I want to have solid roots and a deep connection with my town before I can go out to the world and know different people, I don't have that connection, and because of that I feel ostracized and a ""no body"", I say to myself how can a person have a future without having a past? Without having an origin? That's how I perceive my culture.  


Possible solutions:

\- I completely start over in a place far away (could end up really bad).  
\- I try to reconnect with my community and I sacrifice more years of my life and more energy that could be used in different things such as investing in my career and making money.  
\- Accept the situation, suck it up, and get out to the world knowing that I will never find myself where I want to be.

5348,treneod,1651441757,1,"Hello everyone

Firstly, I want to apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors, english isn't my native language

I'm not sure where to start, so I just do as I feel like..

I don't have many friends. In fact, there's only one person I consider as a real friend- everyone else in my life just seems to be a temporary appearance, which I might even get along with, but won't ever create any deeper connection to- probably because of my own fault

At the moment there are some people I might call friends, but those are only very loose connections, and it's feeling more like ""better acquaintances""

And there's also someone I'm chatting with since quite a while, but we actually don't really know each other because we met on reddit. That was quite a comfort because I actually felt like I got along very good with this person, but somehow this changed at some point and now we're barely chatting anymore.

Although I'm not completely socially incompetent I really struggle to approach people, get to know them and afterwards actually keep the friendship going 

With my more introverted personality, especially in my past, I allways was rather shy and reserved in presence of others, and even though I managed to make some friends at school, I lost contact to them pretty much the same day I left school.

Overall, I feel like social interactions sometimes still challenge me, but I got better in handling them. That does mostly only apply to superficial contact though. 

Due to all of that I feel like I have only comparably small experience in basically any subject that requires social skills, what really causes me to feel somewhat inferior to others. 

When I think of my life in retrospect I can't really find a point in which I was happy. Of course I'm not always sad, it's not like I can not enjoy anything, it's more like my general state of mind has been overshadowed by some melancholic feeling since I can remember. It's sometimes more, sometimes less noticeable, but always there.

Now I'm 22 years old and I feel like my life is already over- I've been feeling like I'm just existing for more than the last two years. Like I have no purpose

I sometimes ask myself if my severe loneliness is the only cause for how I am feeling, but I'm not sure about this. That's also the reason I put the (?) in the title.

The thought of my life going to stay like this makes me anxious. It feels like my current state slowly but surely consumes me. I'm losing interest in things I used to like, I barely can sense excitement or joy for things and overall my whole emotional state feels kinda dull. 

I don't think that I am depressed, at least that's what I assume. But I do think that I'm on the best way to actually getting a depression if it goes on like this

And the best part of all of this is that I am completely aware of the fact that I am the major problem in my life, so I can't really blame others for my situation, and if then only to a small degree

I honestly don't even know what my first intention of starting this text even was. Probably to feel less lonely by writing something instead of just staring at the ceiling

Thanks for making it that far, kind stranger",lonely,Loneliness (?) is slowly consuming me,2022-05-02 07:49:17
5349,TheTomBerengerEffect,1651441526,1,"I’m so sick of being alone and having no one. Literally NO ONE. 

Throughout my 30s, I had friends. A lot of them. 3 of them (sisters) were my very best friends since I was 10 yrs old. Well, at 10, the eldest of the 3 was my age, in my same 5th grade class, and we both rode the same bus to and from school. And we lived a path through the woods to one another’s houses. I was a new student. With a mean older sister who has never wanted anything to do with me. We lived in a huge old house, with wings, and a library and shit. But it was my grandfathers home. He was cheap and cruel - aside from the mom beatings and locking us away in the attic, it was a very ‘Flowers in the Attic’ kinda family vibe. 

Those sisters see each 4 yrs apart. So the the other 2 and I bonded over time - real friends as adults. Both had -our families. Both had outdoorsy fun-lovin’ adventurous dads who loved to joke around. They were the sisters I wished I had had. I never understood why my own sister was so rejecting of me. She always has been and it continues to this day. 

In my 30s, I hung out with a huge group of party types, hippies, Grateful Dead lovers. Grand ‘ole time. Falling in with them was like a fate I look back on and realize, wish, had I just shown up 5 mins later, or left 5 mins later. If I’d just stopped for gas or to bring some beer, or simply drive just a tiny bit slower, maybe hit 1 single red light on the way to my 30th bday party at the condo or the above mentioned friend… my whole life would be different. Better. Showing up, at the moment this girl was leaving…I knew her sister from us. As soon as we passed one another -I entering and she exiting- she wouldn’t have targeted me, cornered me and pushed me to go out sometime and give my # to her. She just happened to have stopped by there with someone’s friend. It was a fluke. 

And she pushed a friendship forward with me to the point where I could go along to get along or be cruel. So I did the former. She was a good friend at first. ….within months it became clear she was a raging alcoholic. The first time we hung out, I showed up to this party she invited me to and found her screaming and hysterically sobbing demanding to know where her bf -who was clearly hiding from her- was. 

I said to someone who knew her once and kept saying she was crazy and unstable, that she’s been a great friend so far; that I believed she was just going through some stuff. He said “‘she’s always going thru something”.

Within the next year, I’d become completely entwined with the aforementioned huge hippie group of friends she hung out with. They became my friends…but more aquaintances. It also became readily apparent that she either had bi-polar disorder or - the more likely - Borderline Personality Disorder. Though vastly different, the latter - when coupled with extreme alcoholism - can present as extreme manic episodes followed by extreme depressive episodes. 

And when I say extreme alcoholism, I do mean just that - extreme. 3 duis and a 3 yr license suspension kind of alcoholism. A 2yr nursing degree that she will never be allowed to b licensed to a professional nursing job, nor allowed to work in any type of true caregiver capacity since the above is evidence of addiction and abuse ….of anything. And she does do many other drugs.

So thru my 30s she was in my life and became a horrid friend thanks to the bpd stuff. She set me up with the man I was supposed to marry. And deliberately manipulated events or got involved resulting in many long term and painful breakups. We got engaged when we both realized it was all her. She then managed to turn the above 3 bffs since childhood against me. My best friend the oldest refused to come to my wedding and then said things about me that made no sense and said she didn’t want to ever be my friend again. 30 yrs she was my best friend. She made her sisters choose. So I lost them all. 

The group I’d hung out with for a decade…stopped inviting me out. Even some of the closest friends I had didn’t even invite me to their weddings, while she - the literal gold medal winner of alcoholic disastrous scenes any and everywhere (a night where she showed up, was 100% guaranteed to end very badly and it always did even at weddings). Yet, I was ostracized from my entire group. My 3 best friends turned on me. And she even managed to turn my cousin - who was like a little sister to me me- against me. She blocked me 3 yrs ago and I still don’t know why. I haven’t heard from her since….but it all came back to that girl. 

Due to the constant drama she caused in my relationship with my bf and then fiancé, even tho we’d both cut her out. We went thru a tough few months during our engagement for other reasons. But it just SEEMED like it was a constant thing. It wasn’t. We’d been fine for 3 yrs. But it still felt like this was another huge problem like the ones before. At this point we’d been together for 6 yrs and in the midst of our wedding planning. Even my dress arrived on this day. 

So that night he said he was going to bed, I said I’d b in in 10 mins and when I got to the room, he was gone. His stuff was there, lights on, his personal car was there. But his work car was gone. …I never saw him ever again. 

This August, it will have been 3 yrs since.

I lost every single friend I ever had. And I’ve been living alone for the first time in my life for 3 yrs. And when my dad fought Covid for a year on a ventilator and then died. Not one single “friend” I ever had called, texted, sent flowers to the funeral home, or eve bothered to show up….including the ones that grew up in our home. Despite me being their for them 100% of the time when EACH of their parents died. Not a single word from anyone. I went alone. I sat in the back alone. And then I left alone. 

I go months without speaking to other human beings. My phone doesn’t ring anymore, I don’t even charge it for days. When Indo….I’ve missed nothing. I don’t even get texts. I could literally have a heart attack, a stroke, or choke or something. ….and I would b a rotten corpse before anyone even knew something was off. In all likelihood, I’d b all bones, just a skeleton - no one in my life or family even comes looking for me when months go by without a reply from me….and I almost always reply immediately if something comes thru because I’m so lonely for human interaction. Still…not enough for anyone to give a single shit of concern If i never reply. I’ve evn let my phone get shut off….nothing.

This Xmas, the only text I got was my 15 yr old nephew saying “hi aunt [name]! I’m so excited to see you tonight for Xmas! I miss you! You’re coming right?”

I think I’ll remember that fas having been one of the worst moments of my life for as long as I live….having to tell him that I love him and miss him so much, but that I wasn’t going to be at Xmas, because I didn’t know anything was even happening. I told him “they probably just forgot about me”. Maybe they did… or maybe they just pretended to one another and to themselves that they did, when they simply didn’t care about me enough or want me to Be there at all.”

That was the worst part about losing my fiancé. His family called me daughter and acted like I was to them. They said i was. They always wanted me around. …and I never heard from him….or them …..ever again. I felt like I lost a family that actually loved me. That sucks pretty bad still. 

So now I have no friends. And haven’t heard from a real friend since spring|summer 2019.

I try to Be the best friend to people I can be so they never feel the way I feel. But it doesn’t matter I guess. The shittier people are, the more People seem to care about them. Idk.",lonely,I just can’t make friends and I’m so sick of always being alone. I’m sad all the time.,2022-05-02 07:45:26

5352,Arnetty,1651438844,1,"For one, I'm glad this subreddit exists because this is by far the most common feeling I experience every day. It's crazy how difficult it seems to have gotten to make friends these days. I've tried probably over ten times this year. Conversations don't start unless I start them and never last. Starting to really hate texting because I keep getting ghosted. Never mind dating which I somehow keep failing out, apparently even just making friends is just as hard.

I'm sure she didn't mean it but this girl I dated and then stopped because she wanted to be friends instead... I felt shamed because in her words she couldn't understand why I feel the need to talk every other day or so. Sheesh sorry I'm not as independent and can't go a week without wanting to talk to you. And apparently several other of my friends are like this. I get there are people out there like this. Respect. But Idk, I didn't like the way she questioned me like that. 

It's hard finding friends who are willing to talk a few nights and hang out like at least once a week. I don't even know where to go to meet new people. Seems like online is the only way to meet new people, friends, dates, and if you're lucky not get ghosted.. 

I love bird watching but there's no birding groups near me. I love hiking but no hiking groups anywhere close to me. The most social I've been this week is when going to the coffee shops and talking with the baristas and I don't wanna bother them and their time if I wanted to be friends with them. 

Like I've always heard it said that you need to be happy with yourself and love yourself first. But do the people saying that mean that you have to do that in practically isolation? 

All I can really think of doing is just setting a daily schedule for enjoying myself, reading, writing, exercise, watching good movies and shows, and having good me days. But like I wonder how I can refrain from getting sad even when I'm having hundreds of productive ""good"" days if it's just spent alone with myself all the time.

I've already lost my motivation and I feel more lonely than ever.

I do happen to be lucky and I have people to talk about my things to but it all feels pointless and selfish. I just can't talk about anything to anyone.

I listen to music and also to podcasts. I listen to some hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi  and some times arabic too. Well I have a huge list of podcasts. My favourites are Simple ken. I wanna learn Punjabi, but I can't find some resources. I will have to go to a book store and get some book, claiming it will teach me it in 30

I am really into reading novels. I started reading recently but read a good number of books. I will be buying some novels soon. So, if you have any suggestions suggest me. Right now I am reading Complete Adventures of Feluda

I am currently trying to learn mimicry, Sketching and a lil bit of origami. I wanna learn painting too but no time 

Also I have started to write my dreams. They are weird. So, I thought why not write it. So, that I don't forget it. I have written one. I can share if you wanna read. 

Well I like talking about religions. I don't really know much but I try to know about religions. It's kinda cool btw I don't follow any religion.

I like learning languages and cultures of different places. The types of rituals, festivals people celebrate across the world. 

I have started to watch some cooking shows idk why, maybe I will learn cooking, tell me what's your favourite dish I will order and eat. 

You can shit talk about others too

A little about myself:
I'm a 31 year old male. I've have the same job for 10 years working at my parents business where I make very little money because it's a non skilled job. Even then I tend to become lazy and I'm still late for work often even after ten years. To be honest if it wasn't my parents who were my boss I'd be fired a long time ago. 

Even though I use to have friends and girlfriends in high school my crippling anxiety and depression ruined that and I did nothing about it.

Even though people say I'm a good looking guy I've pushed away all of my friends and most of my family. When I get off of work I go straight home and just hang out. My friends stopped trying to hang out.  Also because they all have started a family and most have kids and it seems like life is passing me by so fast it makes my depression worse. I only sit at home and smoke weed and play video games with my brother and sister online sometimes. I've become addicted to porn and I'm very impulsive. I've also become addicted to pills in a bad way. 

During my twenties I've had one girlfriend a few years ago when I was 29 and she was 19.. it lasted a year and the relationship was toxic. She ended up cheating and leaving me.. making me feel that much more of a loser. 

I started to lose my hair because of my addiction and stress. I let my health go even though I'm skinny and semi fit. 

My social anxiety Is so bad that I won't even leave my house if my neighbors are outside for the fear of them striking up a conversation and me telling them that I'm a single high school education loser with no motivation for my future and no goals. 

I just want to be better slowly but surely. Any encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

5380,Jealous-Tea4559,1651425166,1,"When i was a kid I was raised by just my mum after my dad committed suicide when I was a year old. Really I'd say my sister raised me. My mum was an alcoholic for a large part of my growing up and would spent most days in bed and most nights talking to people on a C.B radio. There would be times where she would disappear for weeks at a time, there would be times where we'd be locked in our rooms with the upstairs electricity turned off so we had no light and times where my birthdays were forgotten. I used to have a fond memory of visiting my sisters school one day and all the other girls in class looking after me, but I found out when my mum passed away that it was because she moved in with a guy  and his kids in a differnet town and didn't tell us. We used to pay for electricity back then putting money into a meter and we had no money so we'd spend the nights by candle light playing board games. We had a gas oven and we'd eat fish cake sandwiches. I remembered them as fond memories, but the reality - wow.

Growing up I was always guarded. I couldn't let anyone get close and fully trust them and this put a lot of people off. When I allowed people in I would scare them away when they saw the real me. The amount of times I would warn people and be reassured is too many to count. I worked at a place for 5 years and only two people knew my private life. One left after 6 months and I didn't speak to them for over 10 years and the other was killed when a car hit him. I remember my boss hearing me talking to my then girlfriend and not believing I was talking to someone and taking the phone from me to confirm I actually had a girlfriend. When that place shut down I didn't say goodbye to anyone. I went to the work party, but didn't have a group to talk to.

5381,PandaVortex98,1651424947,1,"This is just a dump of how I’m feeling. I have struggled with the feeling of guilt since I’ve been a kid. Watching my family work hard to earn every single penny to hearing my mom talking about how grateful we should be and that we should be cognizant about where we have reached and from where. 

But instead of feeling grateful or anything, it would invoke this feeling of guilt every time I would have “fun”. All I’ve seen is my parents prioritize spending time and money on things that are “needed” than what they “wanted”. This made me also always question this feeling of having fun and whether it was right or wrong. Somewhere I realize now that coming back from college to me home country and city and spending time with my family again, I started internalizing this again. I stopped myself from being in positions where I need to spend money to enjoy my time. Whether it be going out to club (which is an activity deep down I do have fun in as well) or going on a trip with friends, I would overthink and feel like I don’t deserve to have fun. Lately, I have started fearing such situations, I feel excited making plans but scared to follow through and go. Im working on this lately changing my mindset from productivity to being happy, but everyday something reminds me that I’m not worth anything because I may not have a direction in life.

I know this entire thing doesn’t make sense but idk this is what’s in my head and I just want it out. I feel so many things these days, I’m tired. 

I feel alone: I know we are alone in this life and that reality is what you make of it, etc. but lately every second of my life im aware of that fact and it’s only made me feel more isolated and lonely all the time.

I feel guilty: I feel guilty of being the bad guy in my parents eyes, I feel guilty of not spending time with them but I find myself in a constant debate with myself about if I want to or not and somewhere I always choose the latter. But I’m tired of trying to fix stuff, I’m tired of facing this issue. Im always aware of the flaws in my parents and that is a struggle I need to get out of where I need to accept them as human and also accept them. But somewhere that acceptance hasn’t come yet. All I see are flaws that make me irritated everytime I spend time with them.

I feel lost: I feel completely lost in life. I don’t know what I like, I don’t know what I want to do, I don’t know how to disassociate productivity with my life, I don’t know how to live honestly, like not in a suicidal way but in a I don’t know how to be happy in life anymore. One second I feel good spending time with people, the next I feel completely alone and lost. I don’t know how to get out of it either.

I feel tired: I’m just tired of dealing with all this, I’m tired with chasing after happiness, I’m tired of just having to make the most of where I am. Idk I’m just tired. I struggle to get out of bed 99% of the time, I struggle finding the motivation to gain control of my life, I just feel tired.

That’s my rant. I know I need to work on this and I am, slowly, but I am. I guess I’m not looking for any answers or any judgement but just someone to open up to. I know I may not be the best of people and I have a lot of flaws too but yeah. I just needed to get this out of my system.",lonely,I’m tired of dealing with everything,2022-05-02 03:09:07

You know what sucks? I never even had problems coming in terms of my sexuality or even bullying. I never really minded it all because I know back then that being yourself is powerful. But is it tho? How come that I am still single after all these years? Not even dated nor in a relationship? 

I envy people like Nick or Wilhelm because they get to experience what is it like to be loved by a man and who would stick to them even if they are figuring themselves out. That there are people who would literally do everything just to make them happy, even if they cannot reciprocate properly. I wanna have that life. I know I would reciprocate, maybe even more. I would never hide my love. Yet, I am not even given the chance to be with someone. 

Loneliness is such a huge storm I could never escape. All I can do is distract myself from even feeling it. Drowning myself in my hobbies, work, and studying but then at the end of the day I am left no choice but to confront that loneliness back. At this point, I am tired and defeated.

Being a lonely person has have its effects both good and bad over the days months and years, yet they always make me question peoples behaviours.

For 15 years i've tried to be friends with multiple people, yet they never wanted be my friend.
For 15 years i've tried to find a love one, yet i have get laughed on for my miserable attempts.

I don't want to try anymore.
It's obvious, that there is something wrong about myself, or the people i have unfortunetly needed to be dealing with. Sounds like im playing the victim, but how else could i say it...

I hate social media (mainly instagram, tiktok, twitter, facebook and snap). People who use those apps makes me sick to my stomach. Its not right, that a person like me, who tries to be happy, tries/tried to make friends for about 15 years can't find one, yet, people can be friends or start dating someone completely random in minutes. Its like people likes to talk with some completely random, but they don't understand the concequences on what they throw themselfs at, and its really a shame...

Its better be alone, far away from others, even your family members, since its all about being In social interactions these days... I hope i die alone without nobody knowing/caring, since well... If we are honest, who even wants to remember a failure? I bet nobody.

Lastly. 

I know this post is gonna be deleted from here...

I know that people are gonna see this and ofc the want to ""be friends""... I think its littlebit too late at this point... I have wasted too much time trying to find people both irl and here on reddit &amp; discord.

5407,Crafty_Rip7662,1651411082,1,"There’s two types of people on this sub, lonely people who know what they need to do, are actively doing it, and come here for a much needed boost so they can continue putting in the hard work. Then there’s the people who are lonely, blame it on everyone else and refuse to take responsibility for their situation. It’s the worlds fault in their eyes, and they deserve everything they don’t have but the world has taken it from them.

To the former I have a few parting words, keep on pushing, it’s painful now, but your hard work will pay off. Keep on grinding, placing yourself a little more out of your comfort zone every day and just force yourself to talk to people. Little steps every day add up, and the momentum you carry will only continue to grow.

To the latter here are my parting words, get a fucking grip. The world is not your enemy, you are just being weak. Your existence is not pathetic, the choice you make to let it rot away is what makes you pathetic. There is not a super breed of humans who get all the social attention purely based on genetics and hereditary factors, most of them worked bloody hard to get where they are, and a lot of them will have faced the same challenges as you. The difference being they had the courage to overcome them. We all have immense strength within, it just requires effort to use it. Stop finding the easy way out and stop giving up, and if you are adamant in doing so, you have no right to complain about anything other than your own lack of courage and will. The world is not out to get you, you are just unwilling to do the work to be a part of it.

Some advice to everyone, try to get off this sub. In the short term sure it helps, but it also reinforces bad patterns and a mindset of extreme cynicism due to the fact everyone on here has seen the absolute worst of people. There’s a whole world out there waiting for you, go out and seize it. Good luck everyone, and goodbye.",lonely,I’m done here,2022-05-01 23:18:02

And then he didn't talk to me for few days and when he came nack to talk he said so many terrible things to me like i actually told him something so bad. I apologized so much and he got better with it but now he tells me he still hates me even though i still tell him how much i love him

The cycles can last even for a few weeks when I eat nothing but binge food. Particular products do not matter, I do not care about sweets and have binged on boiled &amp; unsalted potatoes for example; it is only the mass and the quantity of food.

Ironically, cycles of binging are mixed with two or even three month periods without a single incident. It seems I can only function for that long, and after that I need to ""recharge"" with distorted and harmful, yet functional and semi-logical mechanism of binge eating. Call it willpower or depleted neurotransmitters, but living day-to-day life with a fundamental need that has never ever been fulfilled requires a lot of it.

I know there is some criticism to the hierarchy of needs theory, but it seems it applies to me. I cannot derive happiness from middle blocks in the pyramid and work on achieving the top blocks, if there is a huge empty space at the very foundation that I cannot fill. The only help seems to come from my lizard brain that attempts to patch up said hole with binging on food, but it is only temporary.",lonely,The stress of being lonely manifests for me in devastating cycles of binge eating.,2022-05-01 19:54:25

tldr; I'm very lonely and have never started a relationship, how can I make the first steps

I have like zero social skills, I don't know how considering I had a decent childhood, I had some friends at school and one friend at home, was never the popular kid but I talked to  people nonetheless. I have almost no connection with my family because I can't open up to them so I just sit and speak in one word responses like a robot. I believe I realized how bad I am socially around 8th grade when I first began to go downhill mentally. Before then i just assumed everyone was like I am. I struggle with everything socially, but I improve the more I do it. I still struggle with telling people how I feel about them. I just can't get it into my head that someone could possibly like being around me like I like being around them. I'm 16 and have never been in a relationship, I'm like the most no bitches ass mf around lmfao but I just can't push myself to fix it.  I have even had girls that have told me they are attracted to me but still don't believe it. I think I'm just deathly afraid of rejection for some reason. I've begun to rely on temporary ways of coping (drugs, masturbation, etc) instead of stepping towards a relationship. I understand that the fact that I hate myself is probably the big thing holding me back from being in a relationship, but I don't want to fix it. I don't want to love myself for whatever reason.

I just felt so left out because I was never invited anywhere, no one would hang out with me at school, I never went to things like prom or anything, and I obviously never experienced what it’s even like to be in a relationship.

I thought things would change once I went to university but the social dynamics were almost exactly the same. Everyone had their friend groups no one was really there to make any new friends. I tried joining some clubs but it really didn’t change anything. I felt even more invisible and unwanted going to uni and I’d feel so sad whenever I’d see people with their friends.

I wanna get invited to parties. I want to text people and tell them about my day. I want to wake up exited because I know I'm not the only person I'm gonna see that day.,lonely,Dos anyone else have a idealized image of what friendships should look like?,2022-05-01 13:30:18

I graduated college in 2020 and have a great friend group from school but most of them moved to other cities after graduation. and i know this is a ~super confusing time~ and post grad life sucks a lot at first but it seems like none of my friends are having the same experience as me. even my roommate who is my best friend from school has her high school friend group she’s super close with and i literally have no one. 

it’s just hard seeing my friends living in nyc and dallas, etc. all together having so much fun and i’m just here. i went to school in georgia and moved to atlanta afterwards and it honestly fucking sucks because no one is really trying to meet people since most people have their friend groups from college here. idk why i’m even posting this i guess i just want to vent…i’ve always considered myself a social person but this past year has been so difficult and has made me feel like maybe i’m not as social as i thought i was. i mean i probably haven’t don’t a great job putting myself out there but i’m just not happy here it sucks",lonely,i’m so fucking lonely,2022-05-01 13:12:02

5486,liberalsRmindless,1651373364,1,"So I got sober from meth, alcohol, weed, caffeine, and tobacco 2 years ago. Something about the way I work internally meant I had to be all or nothing about it. Unfortunately, I suffer from severe chronic back and neck pain, as well as jaw pain from tmj, and I have been taking something called kratom for the past year for the pain. I haven't really decided if it is a relapse or not. It is definitely addictive, but it is the absolute only substance I take and without it I'd be in so much more pain.

I feel like I long for a mentor right now, or a spiritual leader, or something. I am so lost. I'm crying right now, as I write this. I don't know what to do now, I don't know how to find purpose anymore. For the past year I have been treading water, living off my measly SSI payments and starving myself to make it each month.

But I live in the world of distraction. I live to be distracted, I can see it so clearly. Starting to take kratom, I feel, might be part of the problem. See I was sober completely, and I had to have my wisdom teeth removed. My face got way too swollen afterwards, and they put me on codeine for a week. During that week, my back pain completely disappeared. Once the Codeine ran out, for an entire month I remained sober. I took 3 Aleve per day for one month, but relative to the absolute painlessness of being on Codeine, Aleve couldn't compete. Relatively I was in extreme pain. Somehow my body had acclimated to the pain before Codeine, and I dialed with it by excercising once every 3 days, but since I couldn't handle it after that first month of Aleve I started to buy kratom. I have now been addicted to kratom and nothing else for a year.

Before I relapsed on the kratom though, I had been experimenting with removing porn and social media, and video games from my life. Something about being on zero addictive substances makes your mental addictions suddenly stand out strongly. I caught myself slipping away to the bathroom to jack off whenever I faced a difficult decision or stressful situation. I realized I was using the porn as a way to ""feel good"" to counteract ""feeling bad"", just like I used to drink alcohol whenever I was stressed out before I got sober. So I had actually spent 90 days free of jerking off, and I had deleted all my porn, etc. But after the codeine ran out of my system it was suddenly open season on porn use, it's like I returned to it with a vengeance. Same with video games and social media. Just scrolling, making sure to avoid thinking about all the terrifying things at all costs.

I feel like I need an acid trip, I fear I traumatized myself with my last meth binge. It was horrible, and it was the first time I was put out on the street by everyone I loved. My best friend, then even my brother made me beg and pander to him to avoid getting kicked out. I lost all sense of stability, and I can still feel it, I do nothing but fear right now, all I can do is be terrified I'll end up on the street again, terrified that no one will ever love me. I am completely removed from my authentic self, I have no clue what I am supposed to do now.

Because of my physical disabilities and especially the tmj, which, after almost 20 years now of neglect has become horrifying, I can't talk for more than 5 minutes a day anymore. So I can't get any job where I'd have to talk. I am starting to feel so cut off from the world.

I am feeling horrible bitterness. I see people leading normal lives, and complaining about things they experience that I can't experience. They complain about problems with their friendships, and I feel like I have been avoiding my friends because of the jaw issue specifically. So it makes me hate those people, I loathe them. I feel neglected by the world, left to rot.

A lot of this probably has to do with the fact that I have been pretty isolated for the past year. I pretty much only speak to my therapist once a week. I have a brother, but since he got a new girlfriend he barely has time for me once a month. Otherwise I stay in my room. I am terrified of people. I don't want to be. But I feel like something is missing in my brain. The peace that I found the first time I got sober (2 and a half years ago), I completely destroyed when I relapsed just to get help again. I was told that I couldn't get more help unless I used meth specifically again, so I did in a desperate fuck it moment, just to get help. Because I was thriving there, and they released me to a shelter and I wasn't ready for it and it was terrifying.

But now I find myself battling with myself. I don't know what to do. I dropped out of UC Berkeley 10 years ago, was diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic two years later, worked in bars and restaurants ever since. I really do miss learning, I used to be so good at it. I feel like I can't get myself secure feeling enough to focus on learning anything, but I don't know if that's true. I doubt my intelligence every day. I fear that my drug use has destroyed my intelligence and that I am no longer capable of returning to school.

I try to motivate myself to learn coding, or design, or something that I used to be good at, but some voice within me tells me that I am not supposed to just work, something about living in Berkeley has me feeling like I'm selling out somehow by working. But when I'm not working I spend all of my time worrying about how to make it to the end of each month, skipping meals to make it every month. Surviving with only $150 to spend on food each month after rent.

Part of me thought the answer would be to buy a car or van and live with it. I could borrow money maybe and then if I owned the place I lived in then I could spend the full SSI amount on food each month. But then I'm like If I had enough money to buy a van, I should spend it on fixing my jaw. Get orthodontics or whatever it takes.

Then I'm like just learn coding to get a job to fix my jaw, stabilize myself, and then I can decide what I really want to do after I do that for a little while.

But my therapist just discouraged me from that plan, when I told it to her a few days ago. I think she was trying to help me, but she used my inability to remain motivated as evidence for why maybe I just didn't like doing these things I said I wanted to do. And it really fucked me up in the head man. How am I supposed to change when every time I am about to they say ""how can you be sure you want to do this when historically you haven't done this?"" That's why I always had to move friend groups, so I could be new people over time.

I used to be so busy, now all I can do is think about what I should do, but never do anything.

I personally think the answer is to just do something, literally anything, just pick it and see if I can let the world fall away and start focusing on it like I used to be able to. I think putting so much emphasis on what to pick is what fucked me up in the first place. At Berkeley I had changed my major 6 times, and felt horrified of the decision because I feared that whatever I ended up with would be the last thing I got to study. When in the past my skill was being able to study and be good at a variety of things. I was the kid who won the math olympics, and also tutored English, and was good at drawing. I didn't believe in the science/math/artsy person being different, and I didn't want to have to stop learning. But Berkeley put so much pressure on me and told me if I didn't pick soon I'd run out of financial aid in one semester, they said I was already above the unit ceiling because I had taken too many classes and I already had enough credits to graduate, I just needed a few more classes for psychology in particular and I could finish. But I didn't feel ready. And then of course I started hallucinating and had some freak outs and the whole things just ended and I couldn't return until I paid back my grants for that semester so I just stayed out because I didn't have $6k.

And here  years later, feeling like an absolute loser. I spent 8 years drinking and working in restaurants and bars, and now that I'm sober and my pain has caught up with me I feel incapable of continuing to work in those fields, my body can't handle it. So if I'm going to work I need to use my mind, but I can't pick what I should do. I wish I could just live with my parents for a while and just spend some time learning anything just to test the waters, but my parents are toxic and I've stopped speaking to them recently. And I doubt that decision every day too, but my therapist supports it because I'm incapable of saying no to my dad, so at least if I don't pick up the phone I can't be controlled by him.

But that leaves me with no one. I feel completely alone. I used to have my brother but now he's never around because of the girlfriend, so I'm left with nothing. I left Facebook a few years ago because I couldn't handle it, but by doing so I cut myself off from my old college friends.

I've just made so many horrible decisions. Isolated myself out of fear too many times, and now I'm left broken and alone with no one to comfort me or guide me. I'm starting to think being controlled by my dad would be better than this, at least he still likes me sometimes.

I'm so filled with hate lately. I know the answer is love, but I'm filled with hate. I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/a1lcp9/comment/eaqx6uv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) when I got sober the first time, when I felt so at peace. Something had clicked in me, I felt. Now I look at it and it feels like it was written by a different person. I can't make eye contact with people anymore, I can't do anything but fear what they are thinking about me anymore. What have I done to myself. I regret so deeply smoking meth again, I was harder on my body and mind that time than I had ever been before.

And I can't tell if I can't focus on things now because I am clouded by fear or because I damaged myself beyond repair. I have been set free by acid in the past, it has allowed me to clear away the chatter and clear my mind and focus, it might be able to help me again, but I do not think I am in a good enough mindset. If I were to do that I'd have to reach out to some old friends first.

That's one plan, I searched and searched, and recently found the phone number for this one old friend who had previously helped me gain some peace of mind.

The problem, and I know it's the problem, is that I am waiting until I have figured something out to do things again. The revelation that set me free the first time I got sober, I think, at least, was that I was willing to try to do things whether I felt ready or not. Now I always feel like I'm not ready and so I never do anything. I am nothing but a pot of doubt.

But working isn't spiritually dead, right? You have to support yourself, right?

To be totally honest a big part of me wants to check back into a mental hospital. I've been in several throughout my lifetime. This is starting to feel like one of those times where I would benefit. I'm just so terrified of being turned away. It happened twice. But I need somewhere to start, I don't know what is best for me right now. I'm not sure if I have to live off disability for the rest of my life, or if I'm actually capable of coming out of it.

Something feels so wrong about coming out of it. Or trying to motivate myself to come out of it. Like is it so wrong to motivate myself to learn coding just to earn money? Something seems so spiritually bankrupt about that. Like I'm supposed to be doing what I love or something, right? Do I love it? I used to love just learning everything, I would try learning anything, and make it a challenge to wrap my mind around it. The thing is I haven't been doing anything I love either. So it's not like by not learning something to help me earn money I've spent more time doing what I actually love. I spend my time in a waking horror. I feel terrified of everything, I need to find some breathing room. My therapist just recommended medications again, I think I'm going to say yes to trying it this time. I'm living in a world of distraction, like I said at the beginning. I'm not doing things I love, I scroll through endless tiktoks and feel hateful and angry at people being happy and living their lives and expressing themselves because I cannot. But I do it anyway, why? Why do I keep distracting myself like this when I feel so horrible? Or I will play a video game and hate myself the whole time. I cannot quiet my mind at night anymore.

I stay up all night a couple times a week because I just can't fall asleep, it feels like something horrible is about to happen and I have to figure out a solution to something. So my mind just spins, and I need to find peace.

If you have any guidance I'd love it. Especially about getting some mental peace. I tried to meditate to sleep and the way I did it used to work but it doesn't seem to as well now. I try to focus on an invisible point above my eyes, and then any time I start thinking about something I visualize the thought dissolving and then keep doing that until I kind of stop trying to think and then hopefully find some mental quiet. But lately like with the jaw pain and stuff it just comes through it, the thoughts come anyway.

I feel terrified to post this because I have come to expect hate from others. I feel I will be mocked for being lazy and not figuring it out by now, etc. Please be kind, I am trying to change, I don't want to live in the world of distraction anymore, but I don't know how to find what I love, and I don't know how to learn again, I have so much doubt in my ability to even try learning.

It's not that they're not good people or because I think i'm just so interesting. I guess I just really dislike small talk (after like the initial introduction ofc). And if you don't share common interests with someone, thats all the conversation can revert to. Ik it's horrible but i feel this way even with my own relatives. I dread it when they call bc I have nothing to say to them? We have nothing in common so it's just awkward small talk for 5-10 insufferable minutes. On top of that, I value humor probably more than anything in a person. Of course I can have serious conversations but in general I'm laughing even when there's not shit to be laughing at. But not everyone is like that and not everyone gets my humor in particular. So when i'm talking to someone who can't match my energy or doesn't understand me it just becomes draining bc I end up having to basically shrink/hide myself in order to not look crazy. Ultimately I just wish it were easier to find people who I can relate to.

5507,Space_Lion7,1651367060,1,"a week ago ago while walking back to work i fell and sprained my ankle, the pain was absolutely unbearable i couldn’t put any weight on my leg at all, i was on the verge of tears in the middle of the street with nowhere on sight, the only cars that passed by didn’t even bother to slow down, I didn’t had any money for an uber much less an ambulance and my contact lists consist of my own number, and my favorite pizza place (my family cut contact with me, long story)

I knew i had to move so i sloooooooowly walked by way back home, when i woke up the next day the pain was way way worse, I had to improvise and make my office chair my wheelchair and i move around on it, while it’s mostly fine, the exit to the yard where my dogs live has steps so i had to let my dogs in to feed them since I can’t maneuver around, the dogs has been pissing and pooping all over and I can’t clean properly so the house stinks terribly which irritates me to no end since im a little obsessed with being clean. they tried to play with me or want to go for a walk or go outside but i can’t take proper care of them and it gets on my nerves, i still love those dogs with my life and if it weren’t for them i probably wouldn’t be here.

At some point while sleeping my glasses fell through the crack of the bed and the bed, i psychically cannot move the bed and i cannot reach my glasses, so I’ve been mostly blind for 2 days, im a normal guy, relatively young and fit young not very fit but im not fat or anything, but today while i was on the bathroom i couldn’t pull myself up, didn’t  matter how hard i tried, i just couldn’t take it anymore and i started crying like i have never cried before i have never feel so powerless i just couldn’t hold it together anymore, i realized i could die right here right now and no one would know, no one would come to my help for weeks, no one would take care of my dogs, no one would claim my body and hold  a funeral and my death would have 0 impact for anyone that ever knew me.

5531,DUFFinitelyMe,1651357996,1,"I don't know how these things work but I just have to let this out. I just don't understand myself anymore. I just turned 25  and it seems I didn't have any self improvements at all.

Well for starters, I'm plus-sized/overweight like my entire life, well, I started to gain weight when I was 8 I think, thanks to my brother who challenged me on who can eat the most rice, well, I won, I had 10 platefuls, yeah seriously, then I found out it was just me all along who's into the game and ever since then I became that Fat Girl. I love my family but they didn't seem to help. I don't know if you can it call it supportive, but they always encouraged me to lose weight and they're sooooo VOCAL about it, like you'll-never-hear-the-end-of-it lectures kind of thing, comparing you to other skinny girls, calling you a cow, you know, those kinds of things. I guess I just got used to it. Like I said, I love my family but your family's your worst bully(did I say that correctly?)

 So, it became my issue and I always get offended and defensive when my weight gets called out, especially in school. I'm not a bully, but I sure damn know that I wouldn't let anyone, especially stupid boys, bully or undermine me, like, I remember punching so many guys wayyyy back elementary and highschool just because they're making fun of me, calling me names. I mean, you're the only person who can help yourself and forgive me for choosing violence. 

I guess that's why I have very low self-esteem, lacks confidence and I don't take compliments well(I'm just gonna deny and contradict your compliment) . I guess, when things start to creep and get into your head, you start to believe and eventually, just live with it...

Most people know me for being funny and friendly but I'm super duper shy, gets easily anxious and hates being the center of attention(duhh) because in my mind, when people look at me, all they see is this fat girl. Fat. Fat. Fat.
I mean, I tried to embrace the idea of being plus size and curvy (but honestly, for me, plus size and curvy are just sugar-coated words for fat, I seriously don't mean to offend people, it's just my take on it with all of the years of being one) But, at least there are times that I felt confident about my body, provided that I'm wearing decent stylish clothes. 

It took me yearsss to build up and have that confidence, but it could also crumble down with just a single negative thought or criticism. It all goes downhill when you start to compare yourself to others. You'll just end up asking yourself, why do I even exist?

 It came to a point where I avoid looking at mirrors, especially those big ass mirrors in the malls, fitting rooms or anywhere wherein you get to see your body's reflection and just feel ugly, disappointed, ashamed, disgusted and so on. I think that's when I stopped posting pictures on my social media, stopped taking selfies and letting someone take pictures of me when going out with family or friends. I still call myself lucky because I have my friends and family(not all of them obviously) who got my back and understands me.  

I've never been in a relationship or even on a date, like none, whatsoever. Sometimes when I get asked if I ever had a boyfriend or been in a date, Im not sure if im gonna be embarassed or offended by it. The last time someone liked me was this boy when we were in 3rd grade, and I rejected him; considering the fact that I'm not even pleasing in the eye, but yeah, karma's a real bitch haha.

Of course, I also want to be in love and feel loved, it's just that romantic relationships are just sooooo foreign and alien to me. Like, I could never imagine a guy liking and falling in love with me. With me! Im such a hopeless romantic and I can imagine myself being clingy in an acceptable way. But Im scared of guys, and I always have this fear of interacting with them, like what I said before , I always assume that they all think and see me as the fat girl, fat, fat, fat. Also, I'm boring as hell, no interesting hobbies and super awkward. 


I might sound desperate but ... It just get so freaking lonely. Like it's not even funny anymore, like, does the universe really hate me this much? ""You have your friends and family to love you,"" bitch don't even start me with that shit, that's different.

I may not be alone but I am definitely lonely.

No hands to hold, shoulder to lean on, hair to play and mess, cheeks to pinch, ears to whisper stupid things and sweet nothings, back to massage, lips to kiss and body to hug, spoon and cuddle with. Is that too much to ask? 

I know that I'm still ""young"", still gonna meet a lot of people and I have a lot of things to work on myself, like self-love and acceptance, ugh. 

So, to my future SO, I just want to say: Duuuuuuuuuuuude, where the hell are youuuu?? How long are we going to wait for each other? Im dying to meet you.",lonely,"So, what's exactly my point here?",2022-05-01 08:33:16
5532,Xuthii,1651357678,1,"I have a bestfriend who’s a very likeable person &amp; someone who I love and value in my life and would do anything for if it came down to it. I’ve known this person for about 5-6 years and we’ve had two fights which lasted over a year each fight. The first two years of our friendship were extremely good, lots of communication &amp; hanging out and going places. After those two years things went downhill tremendously .. she would screen me, cancel plans when I’d plan ahead of time, make excuses saying she was busy or tired all the time, not text me for long periods at a time (like 2-4 months) and I would purposely wait to see if she would text me out of the blue but never did. I would be the one to initiate conversations almost all the time. So I kind of got fed up with the relationship being one sided and deleted her off everything because I felt as if my presence didn’t matter to her and she didn’t care about me. I did this 2-3 times during our friendship and she got really frustrated with me because I would essentially dip without saying a word to her. I felt as though I had always been there for her if she were to ever need anything but felt like she wouldn’t return the favour because she didn’t ever check in on me when I was severely depressed and suicidal even though I told her about it. She would basically say “me too” and sort of joke about it but also in a serious way. She’s told me a few times she doesn’t really care to have friends or talk to anyone &amp; that really broke me hearing but I never questioned her .. afraid that it could be directed at me. Her reason for never texting first was “I have to work on myself before I can put in work to others” kind of deal. Which makes sense but she’s done this for years. I was always respectful to her and kind to her so I don’t know why it felt like she abandoned me. I would overthink like crazy for months and cry for quite some days just thinking about how things could go back to our first two years of friendship again but I don’t think it’ll ever be the same. Fast forward to today and she still seems to have the same bad habits. Ignores my text for days, cancelling plans, seems to only want to stay at home, barely making an effort to text me. The thing that keeps me around is that when we do get to hangout it’s almost always fun and good vibes between us. We get along very well and I feel like we can actually listen and talk about random stuff no matter how crazy it is. She also has bad communication with other people including her boyfriend so it also makes me think I’m overthinking. Her bf is also my best friend I basically view him as a brother. Im curious if she is taking our friendship seriously and actually cares about me because I’ve been hurt by previous friends I thought cared about me. When I truly care about someone I am willing to help them in every way possible, psychically and mentally if I can &amp; I feel like if they cared about me they’d do the same? I keep overthinking things because of the lack of communication on her part and it puts me in a really dark, depressing mood which is why I don’t know if the friendship is worth it.. Also she never ever texts me when our friendship goes sour, I would always have to be the one to apologize first and try and win her friendship back.

5535,WithinButWithout,1651355335,1,"I'm temporarily in a bad spot right now and I feel like the only person in the world going through what I'm going through and I just need to say something to someone. It seems like where I am I can't have a conversation without the conversation turning into an angle.

I'm an atheist but my family and community is Mormon. I love them and they love me but they can't seem to accept me. I have the personality of a 1950s day time television dad - positive and hopeful -- and especially very little grunge. I've been described as ""Jared Dunn from Silicon Valley without the tragic backstory"". I grew up in one of the most Mormon places on Earth and there is very much a social binary that exists here. Everyone assumes I'm LDS just because I'm a happy looking guy although I struggle more than I let on. I have a strange personality -- which people like -- but I stick out. I have tried to exist in both universes but I feel left out of both (although I originally felt accepted before \*coming out\*). Dating is a nightmare because I'm not interested in doing weed and being drunk every Friday night. More often LDS women seem drawn to me and I seem very Mormon but I'm radioactive as soon as I tell them I'm not LDS.

I'm trying to be and do what young people should be and do at 21 and I consider myself mostly successful. I'm in school and I have a great job with great prospects for the future. I try to contribute to my community and be the best person I can. Despite these things I get told that I'll waste my life. That I'm not becoming the person I need to be and that I'll lose sight of all the things that make me great. The people who tell me things are trying to love me and help me by pointing me in what they believe to be the right direction. On the other side of the coin, I'm told that I should leave those people behind -- ""fu\*\* 'em"" they don't have a monopoly on what's right for your life -- I should remind you that I am fiercely compared to grunge-less Jared Dunn --""What do they know?""

Generally, the people saying ""you'll waste your life"" seem happier, more successful, and definitely more confident lol. I find it hard to not be fully accepted anywhere. My family is afraid that I'm trying to be grunge (which I'm not). I try to just accept myself but sometimes it's hard when you are truly alone in what you believe AND how you're perceived is in direct odds with how those with shared beliefs are usually perceived.

I guess this a little different from most posts here. I'm fairly social but I always feel like I'm looking through a window into personal lives of those around me rather than being invited into the entryway on either side of the coin. I want to love my family and respect myself but those seems often seem at odds.

What I lack the most is friends who I can really connect with from a deep level and understanding..

I went from having 6 friends in my inner circle to needing to gradually disconnect and part ways from each of them due to our own level of change, interest and lack of understanding for eachother.. I was finally left with zero friends.. I just wanted a more real connection with those whom I consider as friends.

I know until am able to earn I'll have to live being broke.my live has been so montonous that I dont even remember the day until I see it on some news channel or on my phone by chance. I need someone to talk to. I really need it. I try talking to god sometimes. Ask him what has he planned for me. Thank you guys for coming this far. Im not venting. I just wanted to share my feelings.

5585,ginger-m-thrown-away,1651330381,1,"I've been trying to reach out to people again recently but I keep just getting ignored. The reason for this (if I had to guess) is that I never finished school and have never had a job yet because of serious mental health issues. Because of this I can't really talk personal stuff and I don't have any work/study talk to chat about. I avoid talking about anything depressing about my life - dysfunctional and abusive family, lack of work, no special or even basic skills - because I know that's just not a good idea. I leave these things out but usually they come up eventually anyway. They'll ask what I do and I don't feel comfortable lying or changing the topic if they're asking directly so I'll tell them I'm jobless and not studying. Even “friends” who are former NEETs will start avoiding me when they hear stuff like that, I guess it's a red flag.

This means I'm left with a very small selection of things to talk about and a high chance of being dropped as a friend because all I have are memes and talking about media I've watched/read. I want to change all this but it seems like it needs to be all at once. I need to do some kind of volunteer work but in order to do that consistently I need better mental health, which means I need to have more friends, but to have more friends I need improve my life, but to improve my life I need more friends, etc. I know there's other stuff like meditating and exercise that you can do on your own but overall I have to do all these things at once and maintain it all in one go or else it's back to square one. I've managed to do some of these things for periods at a time but never for long enough, let alone all the stuff I've never done.

I'm not trying to be self-pitying about this, I know its my responsibility that I've failed (and continue to fail) at keeping, it's just I never see much talk about how if you aren't in the loop on these things then you can't escape isolation. Whatever, that's enough of a ramble.",lonely,You have to do stuff to make friends and you have to have friends to do stuff,2022-05-01 00:53:01

5587,FitAbbreviations4197,1651329962,1,"So I used to be a lonely kid, I didn’t have many friends, and got bullied quite a lot. But, when I got a little bit older, and finally graduated out of my emo phase, I stopped getting so much hate and actually became quite a social butterfly. Im now at uni, I have lots of close mates who I hangout with all the time, and who I can talk to and vent to. Basically, I have everything that 14 year old me thought I wanted, the only problem is I still feel the same loneliness I did back then.

I still feel like no one really cares, and I still feel like no one understands me. Even though I have the connections I wanted, none of them feel real. I jus feel extremely separate from everything that’s going on around me. The best analogy I can think of is…(this sounds bad but hear me out) all my relationships feel like owning a dog, (hear me out). Although the dog loves the owner, and the owner loves the dog, the two will never be able to truly understand each other. So imagine all your friends were dogs, u might love them and they love you, but you’ll still feel lonely, and want a more understanding connection. 

I’m not saying all my mates are too dumb to get me, or anything ridiculous like that, the analogy works the other way round too (I could be the dog). My point is that I jus don’t get how other people work and I don’t think they understand me either. It’s like everyone else is on a wavelength that I’m not apart of, and never will be, like they all get something that I don’t. 

It feels like I crave a type of connection that either doesn’t exist, or is just unattainable for me, and that’s what hurts and scares me the most. 

Any advice or similar experiences will be helpful :)",lonely,Will I always feel lonely?,2022-05-01 00:46:02
5588,throwawayasdf100,1651329951,1,"Hey, 

I felt like posting here even though loneliness i experience is not conventional.
So I've gone through a mountain of shit despite my young age and eventually found peace of mind by ripping apart my beliefs and habits which I felt limited me. Some years ago I experienced a moment of clarity,no-self, whatever you call it. I saw through my beliefs about myself and about the world, and for a while I was no-one in my experience.
So now I'm left with no beliefs and I observe life living me instead of the other way.

This led to lasting peace of mind but now I can't really connect with anyone because everything kind of lost meaning when there are no beliefs. I just exist and am and this is all I know for sure.

I used to trust in science but even that assumes that there is a physical universe out ""there"" and it doesn't really question the reality of reality.

So while I have some friends and a loving family, the relationships feel like bunch of thought-made constructs and information coming from the senses (hearing and seeing). No-one gets the 'true' me, the awareness and never can. Observing the external world with mind empty of thoughts is calming but lonely. I feel like this transition is irreversible and sometimes I wish I could be immersed in my character and the external world again.

So this probably sounds ridiculous but it would be interesting to talk with someone who gets what I am talking about. I live peaceful life with my dog in the woods. And yes let's go with assumption that I am sane. I have no problem with this but would love to connect with someone who resonates. I only feel peace and gratitude which is awesome but I miss the immersion.





TL/Dr: I don't trust my thoughts and have no beliefs ---&gt;  I am a no-one feeling a bit disconnected from the external world and other people. If you resonate, feel free to pm me:)",lonely,"In my 20s, lonely while surrounded by people and friends. I feel like watching a movie through my external character.",2022-05-01 00:45:51
5589,smortcow,1651329631,1,"this isn’t really a question or scenario but i guess i’ve just been feeling really lonely recently and not sure what to do. 

i’m 23F and recently all my close friends have been getting into romantic relationships or creating those relationships too and i’m still hanging around. 

I’ve been single for 1.5yrs and have never felt more confident in myself. i’ve always had (and still do) have the mentality to never push or ‘search’ for a relationship because it will come at the right time. i guess i’m just sick of being alone and not having someone around who i know cares. 

i’ve been getting caught up in “talking” stages and there is a specific guy i am interested in, but despite our interactions and cute messages/care he shows me i have this sight that it’s just to continue as a fwb situation. now my previous relationship has resulted in a few trust issues etc. but i guess i also am confused/ feel more lonely and worse because i don’t know his intentions and just don’t want to be used. 

i know a lot of people will encourage me to discover a new hobby/figure out my life but currently i am happy with the future i have planned (job/studies etc) and have been succeeding so far. i also have ADHD so i tend to either fixate on something for a month and leave it, or i just can’t get into anything such as a TV show, movies, readings etc. 

thank you to anyone that reads this - i just need someone to tell and talk too but again, everyone i know is occupied with their partners recently.",lonely,i just want to let out how lonely i feel,2022-05-01 00:40:31
5590,Physical_Reflection7,1651329025,1,"I’m 28 (m) married have a house a decent career and relatively healthy but yet I’m slowly slipping further and further into this state of sadness. 

I love my wife she’s overall a fantastic person, but she does have her share of health issues mainly mental health issues. This makes it really difficult for me to communicate my issues and when I do I feel like I have to tone it down because I’m suppose to be the strong one in our relationship she can’t handle too much because otherwise she’d spiral. 

Even when I’m not okay I still have to push through and do everything because my lows are low but her lows are lower. I don’t really have friends that I can talk to because well they just blame her or judge her and I don’t believe this is any of her fault. 

So because of this I just sit and think and when I get a chance I cry to myself quietly. The lows are getting really low and the highs aren’t high enough. Idk what to do with myself",lonely,Silently suffering,2022-05-01 00:30:25
