Then lockdown happened and I got super into porn, strip clubs &amp; weed when I’ve never smoked before. 

I think I had an Epiphany yesterday that this whole time, I been depressed. Idk if I even believed in depression before honestly. I got my first job and started making good money so that kinda masked it. But now I’m dedicated to pulling myself out.

I just think all dudes want a hole and maybe an oven to ""expand their legacy."" I know that this can't really be true but I feel it is the case. I just have never or very rarely felt like someone likes me as an individual unless it was a woman. I didn't need to be useful or sexy or cool, I just needed to be myself. Now keep in mind, I am a recluse that spends time with ppl on the internet (around ages of 19-25 year Olds, including myself). So maybe it's just a thing ppl do anonymously? Or when they are young? But if that's how they act with no repercussions, then isn't that how everyone is deep down?

For context i’m a 21 yr old girl, I grew up with a an emotionally abusive dad who id stay with every other weekend and the only memories I have of him from then are of him drinking, smoking, being passed out on the floor or just crying and telling me how awful of a person my mother was to leave him when he was so depressed. I was also raped many times as a child by a babysitter. Definitely could have been worse though I suppose.

He told me everyday how much he loved me and that he’d be there for me no matter what and we could work through anything.. 2 months later he dumped me and ghosted me 3 days after I got out of the hospital for a suicide attempt. I know it’s hard for people to see stuff like that but I really don’t understand how someone can leave someone at their lowest if they truly loved them. I ripped my fucking heart out for this boy and he left me like I meant nothing. He won’t even talk to me and yet I miss him more than anything. I have never felt like this before, not proud to say this but I have tried to kill myself many times because I couldn’t imagine finding anyone that would love me the way he used to. Tonight is one of those nights, I miss him so much I feel like my heart is constantly heavy.

I’m just myself around them but I always end up overthinking things tbh. My last experience really hurt, I wasn’t expecting that from them it was a complete curveball. 

I started talking to this girl from work as we had both found each other attractive. Our mutual friend had told me she was a cool person and just gives off good vibes overall. So I made my move and began talking to her. We clicked right off the back, we began taking more often. One day we agreed to hang out. That day came, I thought it went well. We ended up getting to know each other better. That same day I also held her hand and kissed her. Which surprised me since I’m not an affectionate person, it takes times for me to get comfortable. With her I didn’t even question it, she made me feel like I could trust her. Which I really liked about her.  Things were going great we were talking on the daily and hanging out more often.. We were feeding of each other’s energy things we’re beginning to get more serious as well. The question had come up about “what this was?” We would discuss about it. She told me how she felt and what  she wanted too. At first she had said she wanted to hook and just see what happens. However for me I also wanted something more serious. I just hadn’t told her what I wanted, I just hate saying what I want because I feel I always either fuck it up or it either goes wrong.  

I took my time and was just thinking about what I truly wanted at the end of the day. Two days had passed since she had asked me what I thought about the situation. I had just told her I didn’t want to lose her as a friend if things went wrong. Since at the beginning I had also mentioned how I end up not being friends with ex’s cause I cut them off. So the day I was about to text her and tell her I do want to try things with her and see where they go. She messaged me telling me it’s better off if we end things and just remain friends so no one gets hurt. That  sadden me as we had talked for over a month straight. 

Idk what to think.. all that was on my mind was I had just lost her. One of my worst outcomes had come true. I had agreed to give her space and see if things still might have a chance which I told her. This is where another problem came up. I know I told her I would give her space, but something happened and I needed a friend to talk too.  So I reached out and texted her again. I got no reply… she ended up telling our mutual  friend that I wasn’t leaving her alone. Which saddened me to think she thought like that. 

It sucks seeing her at work, especially when we are right in front of each other. She doesn’t text me but she randomly says hi and might make small talk at work. I wonder if she does that cause we have a mutual friend. It’s been weeks since we truly had an actual conversation. At times I want to go up to her and hug her.

I love her dearly but she's not giving me what I need to not feel lonely within the relationship. I can feel it ending, and it's me that's going to end it soon if the feeling doesn't change. I know some of you may think that being in a relationship is the answer, but the fact is for me personally is that I've never felt soo alone in my life.

I was alone for most of my life, didn't have a lot of people early on in HS or college. I used drugs, I partied but I was always alone and I was actually pretty ok with that at the time. As I;ve gotten older though. It's become harder to feel ok alone. It's become harder to accept being alone.

I've been trying to view it like I used to, which is that I have the freedom to do what I want. However, now that equates to me sulking and playing video games with people just so I can not be alone, even though I feel lonely around them. It's not their fault of course, I crave a certain connection \*not sex\* just a connection that I am severely missing.

It just sucks when you find that connection to someone and they cut it off. To finally find that, and to suddenly be cut off from it completely without much to go on or much support is....daunting. It compounds the lonely feeling by 10x.

I should be asleep right now, my mom may have cancer and is having surgery soon but you know what my selfish ass keeps thinking about? I've got to go at it alone again, even if I stay with my GF. I'm beginning to realize that I may never get that connection back again. Which means I truly am alone....

I've cried three nights in a row. I've debated trying dating apps again and breaking it off with my GF so I can search for a connection without guilt but to be honest with you.... I just want to be ok alone again. There was a simplicity there, that I hope I can find again or find the connection I'm searching for.

For those of you who are lonely, I'm sorry, and I hope you find that connection soon. Just like I hope for either me to feel ok alone or to find that connection again with someone. We all need that in life, and this world the way it is, is not really good at bringing that true connection forward.

I haven’t really socialized in 2-3 years because of the places I was working right before and during the pandemic, and having any of the people I was close with either move away or just not care about me.

I have felt lonely, depressed, and anxious since my early teen years. I had decided to join the military since nothing was working out for me, and to get away from my home town. While overseas it was rough for me, but then I met someone. They perused me, which was a shock for me. This was my first and only relationship and before this I had only experienced rejection. So it was a huge deal for me when someone showed me interest, care, and wanted to be in my life. 

I had undiagnosed mental illness, and at the time I really didn’t know what was going on with my mind. I know I made mistakes, had a drinking problem, and I could’ve been a better partner, but I also feel like I received no grace. I overlooked their flaws and I really invested in the relationship. I tried, even though mentally I wasn’t well I know that I tried my best given the circumstances. Looking back I realize how much I gave and how one-sided the relationship was. 

During my visit to try to mend things…I could tell they were over me. The switch from happy to see me to faces of disgust and disdain. That killed me. I really don’t know how to process it. How you can love someone and care for them deeply but they don’t feel the same at all. How can they leave so coldly, move on so easily, even have a little laugh with their friend about me changing my Netflix password. While I hurt. This experience was heartbreaking for me. In my mind a conversation with them would help me find closure, but I guess that’s coming from an unhealed place… I’m just tired",lonely,Losing a significant relationship… seeking advice and support,2022-06-30 15:49:20

I'm 27 M, living in Texas. I've held a few jobs and been up and down in gainful income for the last several years. Moved to Texas to live with parents at Dad's explicit request with the intended plan being he house me while I go to college. Got in, but then Covid happened, and all the classes became online-only and I just can't learn through just a screen. Since then I've had a job or two, motivated primarily by not wanting to be a net drain on a household. I'm currently unemployed and still living with parents, no one in my area is responding to my applications, so now trying now to sign up to a trade union for on the job training. In the meantime, I'm trying to lose weight and fat with an indoor bike: every two days, for between 9 and 12 hours a week. Its hardly a concrete ""plan"" for life, but its all I've got.

But during all of this, I live daily with an everpresent and oppressive pain. I don't have any friends in the state, and I haven't been able to make friends with strangers or neighbors since I was 10. I am a virgin, and have never gotten anywhere close to getting a date with a girl/woman, and I have extreme difficulty envisioning a future where thats no longer the case. Whenever I see or think about women, my anxiety manifests a voice in my head and attacks me; *""She's busy. She doesn't want to talk to* ***you.*** *She hates you. You're not her type. You're not funny/interesting enough.""* These assumptions, baseless as they may be, grip me and don't let go, and I don't know how to fight them, ergo I surrender. In this context, its not out of line to describe me as a coward. Despite this, I have a near inexhaustible libido and am compelled to masturbate several times a day, after which of course depression hits like a bomb. Sometimes I'll succumb to depression before even finishing, stymieing the act for up to half an hour.

Contemplating love and sex in literally any other context causes me to sink into a cold, dull melancholy, and it genuinely hurts my chest. I become physically and mentally sluggish, and even feel my arms lose the will to move. And god forbid I walk in on a scene in a movie or tv show with people having sex, in which case that whole day is just ruined, and I can't talk to anybody. I literally am compelled, pathetically, to curate my own media habits and check imdb for even a single sexually romantic scene in everything I watch to avoid this reaction. Every few months or so I have a day where I just need to hide in my room and cry silently into a pillow on my bed, throat going hoarse from self-loathing.

I'm convinced bringing any of this up with my parents is pointless. Its a pathetic issue that effects no one in our lives but me, and plus they're in their 60s, dealing with their own far more legitimate problems.

I’m very spiritual and I’ve been working on manifesting love and today I’m just letting myself feel the loneliness instead of trying to be positive. And I am positive but I think I mean instead of trying to feel like my soulmate/boyfriend/partner is here or on his way. And idk. I wonder sometimes if this is karma. If I’m gonna be alone forever. I had to get away from family because they’re so toxic. And I do have friends here and there but no one close, no one to celebrate wins with for example. I’m tired and can’t stop crying. I know this’ll pass. It mostly only happens at night. Sigh. I have hope it is temporary even though my fears are all there too. 

I think more than anything, I want reassurance that life won’t always be this way. And that I’m not the only one. I want to know someone is listening.

Hi, I’m a psychology honours student from RMIT University in Australia and I am currently seeking participants for my research project that will contribute to my final thesis. 

We are seeking to understand if loneliness contributes to an increased reliance on possessions and which behavioural and cognitive emotion regulation strategies contribute to this relationship. 

The survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete and includes questions about your background (e.g., age, gender), general wellbeing, emotion regulation style, level of perceived loneliness, materialistic values, experiences of nostalgia, emotional attachment to your possessions and your accumulation of possessions (this includes items you have bought, gifts, mail, free giveaways etc.) 

Participation requirements:

104,IndianManlet12345,1656532643,1," jesus christ this shit is incoherent sorry

So I'm 17 and Indian, growing up in the west. I have started hanging around with more people and have become more outgoing recently. All well and good until the talk comes to previous sexual/romantic interaction. Which in my case the only intimate interaction I ever had was a)unwanted and b)i was fucking 10 only like 3 people IRL know this and it still bothers me to this day so yes i am inexperienced and i am completely okay with it but when i think like person X says ""this girl wants me bad but i'm ignoring"" or ""i did this and this with x and y person last night"" and then they prove they aren't fucking bullshitting. I think like ""damn someone actually desires them that bad"" and then i come to the realization that no one likes me as anything more than a friend yet and i have a hell of a lot of friends rn which is cool but sometimes you want more

So on the outside i keep playing my hard ass character and keep saying shit like ""well it's their fault they don't want a piece of this i'm such a catch"" but on the inside i think ""you're too fucking short/ethnic/etc. no one is ever going to like you in any way that is not platonic ; you are just that one dude no one notices ppl like you but no one *likes* you""

so in order to combat these thoughts i remind myself of the things i am good at and the things i like about myself and then i come to the realization that no one likes me as anything more than a friend yet and i have a hell of a lot of friends rn which just brings me back to this and it makes me feel like shit

Thing is, I've heard the ""you'll find the right one"" stuff many times from guys who have successfully attracted many people before so until i find the right one i just got to prove to myself that i have what it takes to actually be desired by anyone which frankly i don't feel yet and the thing is IRL, in actual interactions i am hella confident, I’m not a simp or a niceguy, I have some amount of bravado so the just be confident shit won't be actual advice.

keep reminding myself that I am attractive(i hope so; pics on DM no spicey stuff) funny(i hope so) and smart(i know so) but still i can't escape from the shit that's on my mind except when i'm drunk or with friends but then again i still return home at night and am trapped again in this loop and it's seriously fucking with me, am I literally no one’s type? No one’s No.1? and i have no idea how to escape it

Normally I try to change up my mentality and work on myself when I'm depressed but this time I just can't and if i tell my parents this or seek professional help I'll be seen as a goddamn joke

so I'm fucking stuck

Not the usual post here ill admit, but hear it goes..

I am a fan of a sports team, it's not my local team, the stadium is one/two hours away. We had some though years as a team. And we got better and just won our 2nd title in a row. Last year, tho the distance factor. I bought two season tickets, one for me, and the other was supposed to be as gift for my dad. I bought it with the knowledge that he wouldn't come to every game and i would try to invite friends or just live with the expense.. The year went by, it was rough. He didn't like where the sits located, and sometimes just grunted for no good reason. Also he didn't like driving the train. Its hes character to geunt so i figured maybe just live with it, but now there's is a new season, and i come to acceptance thats its not ideal, and he wouldn't come. With inviting frinds it sometimes did and sometimes didn't work out.. but i dont have many friends and dont have close connection with them. Tried maybe even so invinting them to split the coast with the new season, again to no success.

I like going to game, but it feels like it doesn't live for it full potential when im alone.. its also hard for me to connect with strangers or even anyone for that matter, and the nice cool looking group that sit next to me doesn't seam to including me even the slightest.. I'm bad at talking i guess..

Anyway i will renew one season ticket for me . But i dont know what to do with the other one.. obviously i dont have anyone to invite. But the demand went out. It's a sold out season (again) and next year probably going to be the same. If i won't buy another seasonticket. I wont have a chance to invite a friend in the near future.. however who am i kidding?

I was born to a family that would've rather seen me hanging from a coat hanger  had they known how raising me would have felt like. No matter what the topic is, I am always wrong. I have always wronged. I keep getting reminded that I am a huge mistake.

Nobody seems to remember that I exist, even if they spend a lot a time with/around me. I have to remind them that I'm in the same room when they start bitching about me. Sometimes, they do that even if they acknowledge my existence in the same room. I just deserve it I guess. I wonder why I'm so untrustworthy, uninteresting and uncomfortable to be around. 

My family doesn't love me. My friends don't love me. I'll never have someone to come home to. The best part is that the only people who care about me are the ones trying to fix me as if I were a broken toy. 

""Am I broken?"" Now that's a question that lives rent free in my head. I've spent countless days trying to figure that out. Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

123,_Forever_depressed_,1656523283,1,"she's not just my best friend, but also my only friend. I like her a lot and she told she like me a lot too.(At least thats what she told me)

However, recently (like 1 week ago) I noticed she has been giving me the cold shoulder. She sounds really dry most of the time in my dms and i often feel really awkward because I have no idea how to sustain the conversation. Like I tried my best to make it interesting by asking her questions, but she doesnt really say much, and she doesnt ask me any questions back.

The only time we have a proper conversation is when she's bored and that none of her other friends are online. But when the others are online, she would just leave me out or suddenly act uninterested and spend a lot more time with them. Its almost like she is only using me to keep herself entertained when all of her other interesting friends are busy.

This upsets me a lot and because often times she made me feel special and she said that im her best friend and the only one she can trust. But all these changed like a week ago and I found it kinda strange, but I do speculate that perhaps the reason why she's acting dry is because I sound too much like a deadweight, and thus boring her a lot. 

And her friends are not like me at all, they dont really suffer from any mental health issues and therefore able to be so enthusiastic in their conversation 24/7. And I cant do that because I have like severe anxiety and possible autism, so sometimes talking too much can be really draining for me.

i could try communicating with her about this but im just afraid it wont work because she tend to overreact whenever I try to confront her about this, even if i did it in the most polite way. 

This isnt the first time it happened as well. But those times were before she admitted that I was her best friend and the only one I could trust. So now I really not sure, I just dont want her to feel angry when i confront her.",lonely,im too obsessed with my best friend and i cant stop thinking about her,2022-06-30 03:21:23

A couple of years ago, I had been through so much trauma school/family related that I became a social void. I cut ties with everyone and I was not (and am not) regretting it.

I have some moral values that, well, people my age never do. For instance, I am straight edge and have never and will never do any type of drugs. I am also sexually abstinent (and a virgin) as I don't see sex as something worth pursuing for quote on quote ""self satisfaction"", but as a symbol of adoration for someone, something that you do to someone who means everything to you and something that should only be shared between two like-minded people. These values, coupled with many more, amount to my ""options"" being practically non-existent.

I never found someone to connect with, I never found someone that I'd like to be around and get to know, because I never met someone that shares (at least part) of my values. That's not to say people are not interested in me, I often find myself being chatted up and flirted with, but I simply don't reach anything close to a relationship as I always shut it down whenever someone else has values that do not match mine.

I tried various things like working out, playing sports and all of that stuff to remove those thoughts. I watched porn in my childhood but somehow stopped watching it, so I can do something good in my life. But the truth is Im very bad at whatever I do and I'm a very slow learner. I'm just about to graduate in a year and I've done nothing I can be proud of and I know It would be very difficult for me to get a job with these skillsets. The only thing I'm good at is sports and especially Badminton and I love it very much but I can't make it my profession for various reasons. If I just got to play I'd be really happy and Id won't be seeking help here.

I've never been in a relationship, I tried to talk to women IRL but they never seemed to like me because I have nothing to give back in return. From what I've observed is that people only like someone who have great personality and all of that stuff and to give back something in return. I'm not intelligent but I am always seem so desperate to learn, but the problem is that I can't talk to people that well and it's killing me everyday.

I try to fix myself everyday but those perverted thoughts never go away, even when I am working out, studying or playing badminton.

I don't know what I want at this point, if just get good at my studies, that would be more than enough, then I can get a decent job and can have a relationship. I know most of the women don't like perverted people but I want to change myself but nothing is helping. I can't go to a therapist too because of some personal reasons, I know they can help.

I'm really tired of my life, I keep studying, working out, do various things that would help to get out of this situation but nothing's helping. At the end of the end of day I've always been called a loser and a creep.

189,Elegant-Somewhere468,1656471267,1,Hi I am a 16 M going to my junior year of high school. I moved to America when I was like 10 and been here ever since. I have always found it very difficult to make friends in here as it almost seems like I can never relate to people and everyone just sees me as a weird kid. But somehow I managed to make a friend in my old apartment. He was also from my country and we had similar interests and were also both well lonely. About 6 months ago he moved from the apartment to a new house that his parents recently bought. (He is also 16 now) And almost like a miracle happened ever since he moved there and went to the new school a girl got a crush on him and he has been together with her for like 4 months now and he also has made many many friends. So much in-fact that he barely talks to me anymore. I am happy for him I really am but I really wished that something like that would have happened to me too. Not trying to seem like a pick me guy but I been bullied a lot in my life and have had many fake friends too. I have also barely ever felt loved before not even by my parents as they literally never say “I love you” to me.I literally can’t figure out what I am doing wrong that makes people just avoid. I don’t talk that much in school so I don’t think I am annoying. All I can think of is maybe it’s cause of my looks cause even I hate how I look. I have never felt more lonely in my life and I feel like I need someone to just help me and support me to live my miserable life but the sad thing is that’s exactly what I don’t have.

195,GERGAAA,1656468663,1,"Ok, so a little bit of context.

I started college during the pandemic, so most classes were online. I'm a very lonely person, but there was a girl that got very close to me and made me feel good. Six months ago I met her in person and we started going out... for just a week. I was feeling very anxious with how she was in person (her personality wasn't as I had imagined and she would say really mean things about others) and I had to stop the relationship. It wasn't the best way to end it, just a week after, but I had to do it.

Since then I'm feeling lonelier. In the past she made me feel better by being always there, but I also felt really anxious with her around. Very weird thoughts, huh? I'm still glad it ended, but the repercussions weren't as expected.

We kind of tried to keep being friends for the first few weeks but I think she was expecting something different, like, I guess, me being the same way I was when we had feelings for each other. We haven't talked since April.

But I have some high school friends who have had the chance to meet her now that classes are in person. And they have alerted me that she has been telling everyone about our relationship and how I ended it in just a week. Someone told a friend of mine that he didn't like me because of this, even though he doesn't know me. Now I feel a little bit isolated, even now on summer vacation, but I can't imagine how I'll feel the moment classes begin again.

I mean, we are a very small group, and even though I don't consider myself an introvert, she is more skilled than me in meeting new people. I fear she will antagonize me with the whole group just as she did with other classmates a year ago and I reaaaally don't want to be very close to her now that I know what she's been telling everyone about me and our relationship. I think I will feel uncomfortable and would prefer not to hear about her while in classes. 

Any ideas on what could I do to feel a little bit better during classes?

203,idrovetoofaragain,1656466830,1," About a year back, I had an amazing friend. We'll call him A for the sake of anonymity. A was my best friend through the entirety of middle school, and high school, and for the years after graduation. We always stuck together, always helped each other through tough shit, and I truly felt like I could be vulnerable around him as he did around me. We talked about life, about our pains, got advice from one another, and whenever there was something going on- we had each others' backs.

We had two little groups. One of which was the group with him, I, and a few other old classmates from high school. Probably...4 or 5 people total? We'd always get food together every now and again and I considered myself very close to them.

The second was my group I introduced to him, and they loved him, *at first*. It was 4 of us- 2 girls, and us 2 guys. We went on trips together, spent a lot of time around each other, and truly had a grand time every time we got in my little car together.

I started dating one of the girls from group 2. We kicked it off very strong and started doing about everything together. We'll call her S. A and I began to drift apart, and it took less for us to get upset at one another. Fights are normal with close friends, but we'd always repair them.

A lot of it was on me. I'm not saying I'm the sole culprit of the issues; there were some things he did that weren't cool, or that I didn't agree with, but I was immature in my attempts to rectify them, and chose the route of being a dick back.

One night, my ex-girlfriend (S) was driving, and I had a little bit too much to drink. I wasn't operating any vehicles. We met up at a park to talk, and I went off on him. All the tension that had been building up between the time we started dating and the day at the park erupted out of my mouth, and I basically told him that he was a terrible person, a terrible friend, and that he was wrong about everything he had to complain about.

I turned group 2 against him. I watched them block him, smiling. I was a complete, utter, jerk. I treated him like he was the antichrist.

I am aware what an AH move that was. If this was an ""AITA"" post, I'd absolutely be the AH. I compared him to another ex-member of our group who was, quite frankly, an awful and manipulative person, and basically said that if he didn't get his shit together he'd be nothing better than her.

I'm sure that shit cut deep. He drove off with another member of group 1, and I stopped talking with that entire group. So, now minus A, I had group 2, one of which I was in a very invested relationship with.

Quite frankly, a lot of that confidence (or...arrogance?) came from that relationship. I thought I was better than everyone because I was with S. We were very intimate, lived in the moment, and had a great time. I thought that she was all I needed- never crossed my mind once I may not have that, despite how different our priorities in life are.

Group 2 fizzed down to three. Myself, S, and S's friend. I started coming to her social events, a few parties, get togethers, and befriended a lot of her other friends. We did something just about every night, and I truly felt like I was on top of the world. I had a whole new arsenal of friends who I genuinely cared about, and cared about me. Beach days to hot tubs to jam sessions with a few of their little group's band. Lots of beers and lots of memories that, despite it all, I still cherish to date.

Then, we broke up, maybe 8 months after hooking up for the first time. Over time, she had become extremely harsh and hurtful, and I'm not just saying that to make myself look better this time. She was extremely distant, didn't communicate, and hurt me. If I had a grievance about something she did, she flipped it on me, and I didn't feel like my feelings were valid. Taste of my own medicine I guess?

I ended it. She smiled when I did. We were intimate for the last time that night, and went to one more party together at her house as ""friends."" Then, three days later, she was with someone else, and I was alone, as I am to date.

I tried to maintain relationships with that group of friends, but they all removed me as a contact, stopped responding, or even blocked me in some cases. I don't know what she told them about me, about us, but I don't want to know in the slightest.

So friend group 1, and friend group 2 is gone, and has been for a year now. I have had people to talk to online, but not a single true *friend* since then. And, man, I'm lonely.

I have so much regret over my choices in their entirety. I destroyed my best friend, the person I went on roadtrips all over the place with, who always had my back, who knew me better than even I knew myself. The one who woke up at 2:00 am to jump my car in the hail, driving illegally before he had a license to get to where my car was. The friend who would do anything for me. The group who I loved and cherish, and the second group who I knew would always be down to have a grand time.

I've tried to reconnect with A- but he's uninterested. I can't say I blame him in the slightest. I sent him two texts, one just inviting him to connect and one as a huge drunk apology letter, begging for forgiveness- never got a reply on either, so I stopped trying. I saw him driving the other day (he didn't see me) and he looked truly happy. I'm insanely happy that he was able to push past the bullcrap I put on him and the hurt I caused him to continue living life.

I know that, eventually, people will come- but it's been really lonely recently. I've probably been drunk at least a third of the nights I've gone to bed, and picked up a couple really bad habits to help dull the pain. I keep putting myself out there, going out, doing things, trying to live- but nothing's being yielded, and it hurts going home every day knowing that if I were to die, the only people that would even know would be my work and my mom.

Being twenty and having nobody sucks. Having nobody because of the actions you took, things you said, and way you approached things- that's a much, much, worse feeling that I don't think I'll ever be able to shake.

I just had to get it off my chest. I'm prepared for the hate. I've never told a soul this, and think writing about it in the full truth helps take it off my chest a bit",lonely,"I used to have ""ride or die"" friends who always had my back.

211,TopComprehensive7312,1656463331,1,"idk. I’m having so many thoughts and feelings. I’m hoping maybe writing it down in my notes and posting it for people to react to and help me might be something worthwhile? and I know that sounds slightly selfish, I just don’t know what to do anymore and feel like the people around me don’t care to listen or don’t understand, so I wanna see what other people have to say? 

so into my problems: I just feel so alone in general. I have no relationship with my family, just casual “hope you’re doing well!” texts every once in a great while. I have like maybe 2/3 friends that I can reach out to who I know will respond, but at some point you come to the realization that nobody’s waiting for you at the end of the day. no one’s asking how your day was or what it was like. my days are spent doing nothing but work because nothing brings me joy and I’m unable to find the energy to put myself out there considering whenever I do hang out with my close friends, we seem to do nothing. I’m ignored. just aimless conversation. it feels like I’m constantly going in one ear and out the other. it feels like I’m there physically but they wouldn’t notice if I wasn’t. I can’t just tag along to eat or go shopping when they’re just on their phone the whole time telling me about their future plans with other people. I can’t keep texting them and waiting hours or days for a response. I’m always alone. with my thoughts and they aren’t good ones.

I’m trying to find joy in little things, but honestly doing everything alone and going day to day with no one to talk to, and no one to go out in public with, no friends to take pictures with during funny moments. it’s all I’ve ever wanted: to be included and indulged in, but no one really cares to. being alone and doing these things just constantly reminds me how alone I am, and how there is not one person who I can take with me. idk I’m bad at writing this out, when I think about what hurts or what I really define as a problem in my head, I just feel pain, so it’s hard for me to write it out. 

I feel like I’m doing something wrong, that it’s my fault I’m distanced from people, when I’m a very personal person. I love going over details and picking someone apart in conversation, but it seems no one in my circle is interested. 

TL;DR:  going about my day to day extremely alone and depressed makes me remember how alone I am, and how much I long to be a part of someone’s life.

It can prevent them from hurting others and themselves, they become calmer, easier to handle and release from prison. It's done in Europe, in Germany and Czech Republic.

254,PieceOfPOS,1656442538,1,"Let me first make clear that I am by no means an incel if you include misogyny as part of the definition. As of writing, my voice is shot from attending anti-Supreme Court protests both in my city and in DC every day since the horrific ruling came out. I also have female friends, although they are significantly older than me (retired women who I’ve met through my volunteer work).

I am, however, an incel in the literal sense of “involuntary celibate”. I’m a 23 year old cishet guy who’s never been in a romantic relationship before. I never get any likes on dating apps and I always get rejected by the women I approach in bars. 

I don’t see myself as being a bad person, and I actually have high self-esteem despite women viewing me extremely unfavorably. I see myself as an adventurous, interesting and kind-hearted person. I moved to a developing country to learn a rarely-studied foreign language for one year. I’m involved in two different volunteer programs to tutor immigrants and refugees in English skills and run prep classes for the American citizenship exam. I don’t have a massive social circle, but I’m not completely socially isolated either (I would say I have 4-5 friends who I meet up with at least once every two weeks, and some more acquittances I occasionally text with). I’m not ugly, maybe like a 5.5/10? 

Despite all of what I see as positive, attractive qualities, there aren’t women who are interested in me. Nothing ever seems to work, just endless misery and rejection. It makes me so upset that I considered chemical castration so that I don’t have any desire for romantic or sexual companionship, but I was told that I’d still have romantic desire so I decided against it. 

I don’t understand why women hate me so much, because I certainly don’t hate myself. I feel like the current dating culture is the reason I’m in this position. With the advent of dating apps, even unattractive women have 200-300 men pursuing them at any given time. I just feel like I’m not good enough and it’s impossible to get attractive enough to start dating, because the bar for straight men is at near-perfection since straight women have hundreds if not thousands of options.

I really don’t want to end up like all the violent misogynists that get posted here, but the further I go getting inevitably rejected by women, the more I start to empathize with their worldview.",lonely,"Don’t want to end up like an incel, but no one wants to date me and I feel like I’m falling into the incel sphere due to my frustration",2022-06-29 04:55:38

258,RlVERofRUlNS,1656439451,1,"Im a 21 year old gay guy who has been in relationships before but it always felt like I wasn't ready or that I was depending too much on the other person. 

Witnessing the relationships going on around me or in my family only makes me notice red flags in people a lot quicker (because no one in my family can find someone who isn't either abusive or really weird and annoying). I feel like witnessing love going on around me only makes me realize how time consuming and stressful a relationship can be. 
Of course, I still like to have sex, but the romance isn't there at all. After some time, I really only saw relationships as a way to try and find happiness that you can't form, and I only see that as weakness for some odd reason. I guess it just rubs me the wrong way having to depend on someone for serotonin. 
I wonder if I truly am aromantic, or if Im just pushing away people based on things around me and experiences from other people. 

Who knows? But either way, I'm still not interested in finding a partner, and yet I still feel lonely in a sense because of it. Even sex doesn't take that loneliness away sometimes. It's like I'm wearing some sort of mask or I'm hiding away a part of myself from ppl. 


It's confusing, but maybe if I can feel comfortable with feeling vulnerable, maybe I could develop feelings for someone again?

I thought I had it good in my sophomore year I thought I had Friends, a community, people who liked me. And I thought the same through the pandemic. Now that, where I live it has reasonably come to a close, none of these old friends called me once, messaged me once, or even thought to tell me that a good friend I had committed suicide.

It's, terrible man; it's almost like I never had them as Freinds, our meeting and interactions were all circumstantial and those days that I spent with them in school, those days that felt so real and meaningful are in hindsight, entirely superficial. The more I think about it the more it dawns on me, we practically never met up after school, I barely messaged them because, ""bah I can tell him in school tomorrow anyway"".

And the thought that all this is over now, I will never see them again, school has come to a close for good; who are they to me? Who were they to me? Who was I to them? Was I really *anyone*? I saw a trailer for some Netflix show the other day, that show where the trailer goes, ""this summer, this boy, this could be my dream"" or some such thing. Shows like these are set in high school,  should I not have had at least some analogue of such an experience? One fun night out? Highschool romances and other related stories, I am past their target audience, aren't I? That feels so weird to say. 
    I feel not older than 12 and I feel like I wasted and am wasting my youth. I have no Friends who care, not family that gives a shit beyond schooling.

273,929yiyi,1656428644,1,"Tw I guess, does mention suicide.

I’m a teenager, not too young but not too old, and I’ve always had an empty life. My life was filled with people throwing me away then using me when the needed me, wether it be for money, lifting something, it doesn’t matter.

I made it through primary school (kindergarten to year 6) with no friends, then friends who had gaslighted me, and manipulated me into doing what they wanted. But the worse one, kept telling me that she was being bullied for hanging out with me, that they were bullying her for hanging with the fat kid, the weird kid. And that just made me feel so- dead.

As I made it to high school, I approached a kid on the second day and became friends. But sooner that year, more people joined this small friendship group and took the attention and any connection I’d ever had to the others. The only one I felt I could confide in were these two friends.

Friend one, my “best friend” who’s a female, has been stolen away all the time by my step sister. Who joined my friend group since she wasn’t one to socialise. She took friend one from me, I never really even get to talk to her anymore as my step sister makes her leave where the group is sitting to go somewhere else. 

Then my male best friend use to be close to me, yet he’s just distant now. And I just feel so lonely, not even my parents have time. For me, my parents are always dealing with my suicidal mentally challenged sister, if I were to get the smallest bit of attention then she’d take it away by pulling a suicide stunt. 

I spend my days now, curled up in bed with the slightest hope someone may finally care about me on discord, when I go to school, I’m just often sitting alone, listening to music as my friends don’t even look for me, don’t ask where I’ve been, hell, I’ve had some say they didn’t notice I was gone. I feel so empty.

I’m too ugly for anyone to love, too fat for someone to want to hang around me, and I’m just never happy anymore. I feel so damn lonely that I don’t even care if I’d die.

277,sad_and_bored,1656424830,1,"like the title reads, I just wanted to make it known and a little reminder how skewed the view of the world is through the lens of social media and dating apps. the cold hard truth is; these companies are not nearly concerned with the quality of the information you are being fed rather than the quantity. that’s how they make their money, engagement. they don’t care about you making friends. 

In fact, you are more likely to be shown something that is borderline provocative that will get you to quote retweet in a rage to you rather than something interesting that you will like and move on. tiktok is literally made to keep you on your ass for hours. same with YouTube which is unfortunately my guilty pleasure and escape. i credit Facebook for being the first real big platform to fester this culture of isolation and alienation, since zuckerfuck of all people literally created it just to rate who was hot or ugly at his school. makes you think, doesn’t it?

anyway, a lot of people my age credit social media for their networking and their capabilities of keeping their circle close. i ended up deleting instagram in a blind rage a couple years back and I still get some anxiety just thinking about going back to my account. for years I was under this pressure to meticulously craft some sort of facade of myself to show how fun I was to be around, that I deserved friends and hoped I would get invited to more things, but shit barely matters in the end. a lot of the time people want your company to look good, if they deem you as such a popular person. true friends will reach out to you just because they want to see how you’re doing. Instagram has definitely screwed up the way i experienced my adolescence. 

even Reddit, a lot of good comes out of this app but it doesn’t quite even out all the bullying and rude people. I’ve seen people try to reach out for help here and comments would read just, awful awful things I wouldn’t imagine saying to a vulnerable person. 

Don’t even get me started on dating apps. They are meant to keep you alone, no matter how they market themselves or how many acquaintances of yours are tinder success stories. they quite literally want to make you feel low just so you can come back to the app and see if you got any matches, just for that one tiny dopamine hit. i have been on tinder for years on and off, yet I’ve never been in a relationship. I’ve been on countless dates with people who seemed like they needed a rebound or some company. I would take one good night with someone who cares about me over this any day, yet that doesn’t seem to exist on dating apps. I try to avoid them now, realizing how much it is a dumpster fire trying to get your engagement so they can milk you for your money until you quit. these companies are fighting for our attention, not fighting for us to be happy. That is their last worry. They want you to keep redownloading hinge. 

anyway, rant aside, I hope everyone is having a good day. If you feel the same way I do, feel free to say something. shit is hard but I believe we can make people feel less alone if we voice our concerns and discuss how these things make us feel. i know im glad to be in a point where I don’t need to social media to thrive yet i feel so alone and disconnected.

First ill give a brief summary of my life and people i know. 
 i go to an all boys school. 
Im in a large friend group and live with my dad while i sometimes visit my mum and her girlfriend. My brother goes to university and he doesn’t come home much but he is currently at home for his break.
My friends at school always make fun of me, Im basically the punching bag to get people to laugh.
So this obviously fucking hurts a lot and I basically have no desire to be around any of them but i still hang around them since they are in all my classes and if i stopped they’d ask and be nosy and I think it would get worse.
Now with my family its a bit different, my dad doesn’t seem to love me, right now i think its just cause hes a guy and not really emotional but he always just complains about stuff me and my brother do and he does not respect my boundaries and privacy. (He’ll open the door without knocking and just look around at my stuff which i dont like and ive told him I don’t but he ignores me) 
Basically i dont get along with him.
My mom and her girlfriend on the other hand i get along with decently but my mum constantly gives me hollow words, shell tell me she loves me but i find it really hard to believe with the things she does.
She lies a lot and keeps a lot of the truth away from me which I guess is fair everyone has their secrets but she does it so much i feel like i cant trust her.
My brother i get along with okay but we have our usual sibling fights, he doesn’t respect boundaries a whole lot but its better than my dad, but I wouldn’t be able to turn to him for help mentally because i think he stereotypes a lot and thinks things like men shouldn’t cry and stuff.

If you look at what ive written above it probably looks like im overanalysing it and incorrectly assuming.(except for the friends ik they are toxic but I dont know how to distance myself from them)
I dont know if im right or wrong but I dont feel loved at all, so naturally i want a girlfriend more than anything so i can feel wanted. But remember i go to an all boys school means i have 0 chance of getting a gf, and even if i talked to girls i feel like none would even like me since i dont have any real friends so how would i get a gf.

speaking of my ex, i do my best to give her everything. shes the only person that ever wanted to talk to me regularly.

And I mean no one likes me. I've been gossiped about for my looks and how quiet and ""weird"" I am. The guys getting attention I feel already look better than me, and they're always concerned with everyone's lives, and put me and others down for superficial reasons. People talk about being lonely, but everyone is just against me. Yes, I haven't had a girlfriend, and the ONLY sexual experience I ever had was right after I turned 21 back in 2020. It went pretty bad, just as I assumed. Being gossiped about your size is pretty shitty. And women on reddit tell me about ""confidence"", yet I get put down and have no friends even if I ""fake it till I make it"". Now, I DO THINK that individuals need guts to be comfortable enough with others, but...

Sex, relationships, and attention all come easily for women. Women aren't really ever alone, NOT USUALLY at least. Their options span is always broad and they can choose whoever and why won't they go for the best? I'm not good looking for people for them to be around me. Preferences are not changeable (maybe with time some ppl like different things I guess) but that doesn't mean people should treat the ones who don't fit them like crap. I'm awkward and my looks hold me back further.

I'll cut the self-deprecating bullshit for a second. I always think back to try and remember ANY instances with girls that could make me feel better. And I do have one. Back in my senior year of high school, which I did in a completely new state and region of the US (something new to me), some girl in a math class of mine told me (completely out of context, as I never spoke to her and was never friends with anyone at the time, or ever, honestly), that I had nice teeth. All I responded to her was something like. ""stop lying"" in a serious tone. I didn't know this girl at all. I thought she was making fun of me.

337,The_Ginger_Sub,1656385860,1,"To anyone who reads this I apologize as it will more then likely be quite long if you would like stop here I do not blame you. For the others who continue I apologize yet again, but for the lack of words I don’t have to describe it I can however describe it in overwhelming detail and I would like to get it off my chest this way once again I do not blame you if you do not read it all. I shall begin now in the with that I am unsure if I wish to live or die. I do not wish to be melodramatic when I say I am in pain. Pain may not be the correct word for it either. I don’t know how to lead into this I want to be strong, but I feel I am weak. I have tried committing suicide in the past I cannot remember why though I just know I felt so alone so utterly and completely alone when I still had others around me. I obviously survived and I then told my parents what I had done. They were understandably upset with me and just asked I never do it again. They asked if I needed therapy and I said no. The reason I have brought this up is not because I blame them for anything it just hurts that was one of the few times I have ever genuinely felt like I was seen by them and the last time I had cried. They aren’t bad people my Father is a stoic man who I have seen cry a few times he has been smoking most of his life and has lung cancer. My mother has health issues and struggles with her depression. They are both good people I do not blame them for me.  It felt nice getting that off my chest I do not like getting sympathy from others due to my parents situation I don’t like bringing it up at all if I can I just wanted to get it off my chest. To get back on topic of my own pain or whatever it is I would like to describe the overwhelming pressure it puts onto me. I would like to talk about the physical pressure first such as this sorta empty feeling in my chest that constantly hurts and makes me feel as if there is a huge weight on my chest and sometimes makes it extremely unbearable to sometime inhale and exhale. As well as being aware of what feels like every hair on my body and what it feels like. Now then this is the last thing I would like to talk about. I would like to talk about my emotions I feel I have a fake self when talking to others a fake happy self I show others so they do not worry. However it doesn’t feel real and I don’t even do it on purpose sometimes I feel I am just watching some act as me while I stay on the sideline and watch. Other times however I feel cold distant within myself and at the same time keenly aware of everything around me and In me. everything around me isn’t overwhelming it’s this feeling of sadness where I want to cry and I went to bawl out in tears and let it out yet my body is completely dead not a single tear will even begin to form and my voice feels trapped within my throat. This is the pain I speak of the complete pain of being trapped within myself and wanting to escape it. The isolation the encasement and just the pressure it makes me consider dying I tried to be strong and overcome this, but no matter how strong I become or believe myself to become I cannot escape it I’ve tried countless times it feels like and yet it always feel like I’m in its grasps. If you read all of this thank you I wanted this off my chest it doesn’t feel any better but I’m content with knowing it was at least written down.",lonely,I don’t know what to say to describe it,2022-06-28 13:11:00

358,BringBackTheOffice,1656376139,1,"My name is R. I turned 23 years old this past January. Just like most people here, I'm a pretty depressed male. It's definitely justified. Our 20s are when we're supposed to be having the time of our lives, but I feel like I've failed in different aspects of life.

Here in the US (for anyone who isn't American) we graduate from 12th grade, typically at 18 years old. 18 is the age of consent and unspoken age we're considered adults and old enough to be on our own. From that point forward, post-summer break we're supposed to be in college with a determined major in mind and go for a four-year course, receiving our associate after two years and our bachelor's at four. Essentially we leave college around 22 years old. Obviously there's differences in time spent based on specific degrees or courses, and gap years that people take sometimes. I didn't receive my associate degree till just last summer. So I feel academically left back. I have little motivation to go for my bachelor's because so many classes are functionally unnecessary. And I don't know what to study. I'm also pretty anxious and have extremely low self-esteem. I don't see myself being good at *anything*.

The last paragraph was probably bullshit you skimmed through because that's not the struggle that makes people post to subs like this, right? Well, my low self-esteem is even worse in terms of socializing and yes, dating, too. I'm pretty quiet. I'm awkward. In middle school and hgih school I was picked at for my awkwardness and looks. Middle school especially was horrible. 

I moved to Florida in 2016 and did my whole senior year here. Florida's known for beaches, spring break, people hanging at the beach or clubs in Miami. The state's partyland. A good place for extroverts. But I'm not that at all. Because I was picked on and never shown any attention, I was never integrated properly in social circles. Maybe I'm on the spectrum because I can't understand social cues. I get teased a lot for how quietI am. But what is to be expected when I rarely get to talking? Or approached? The other guys click with each other, talking about their stupid cars or whatever.

Work has been terrible. I've been treated weirdly for how I am. I've been made fun of before due to not being attractive or chased after by girls. I'm around a lot of judgmental people. Everyone but me gets attention and friends, good connections and relationships. I
ll always hear about so and so dating or hooking up, whereas I'm in the background and ignored. People are better looking, too. Is that a coincidence? I think people REALLY need to cut the crap with confidence. Trying to be outgoing hasn't worked, even if newer waves of people come into the circle. 

I'm short, but I can't change that. I don't know where I stand looks wise. I've had one sexual experience, which was pretty mundane, and I ended up being gossiped about my size and body. ""At least you got some, right?"" This was 2 and a half years ago with a trashy obnoxious, barely-attractive girl a few years older than me. And I didn't even go all the way. Due to this one experience, all my thoughts about sex and dating before this were proven right. Sex is something to be scared of. I've cried about the lack of attention I get whether it's friendship or more.

Which is why I'm currently trying to lose weight and go to the gym. Because let's be completely honest, looks matter. How objectively attractive will I need to be before I'm considered acceptable enough to even be someone's friend? Or to be regarded as a prize instead of someone to be made fun of because they were around or with me? I feel weird at the gym, being an awkward, (probably) less-then-average looking guy admiring all the objective attractiveness and what I need to compare myself to, when my traits make me an easy target to make fun of or be mistakenly considered a creep whereas if I were good looking I'd be welcomed to do whatever and even get approached.

And will working out even be enough? Atractiveness aside, socialization just doesn't come to me. I have little to talk about. I've noticed weird stares at me like they're picking at me in their minds. If I'm not into typical hobbies like cars or sports then I'm a weirdo :P and again, there's a weird ""halo effect"" of looks predetermining how you'll be treated, whether you're a guy like me or a girl (yes some girls have problems like this, too). I have seen guys with asshole personalities get attention because that's what's considered ""confident"" while the same guys take shit about the girls they were with, and vice versa. You seem to be required to be dysfunctional and a shitty person at heart to be likable to people. You have to be immature and hate people and love it. I REFUSE to become a piece of crap like them. Good looks + ""bad boy"" personality = maximum attention.

And remember, I'm 23. I'm getting older. I'm not sure if anyone's heard of the following, but when women get older, don't they settle down for nicer, quieter guys with successful financial lives purely so someone can take care of them? Moreso if they have kids. And ""nice"" isn't appealing so they'll keep on cheating and eyeing the assholes of society. Even if I improve myself, am I potentially exposing myself to another problem later down the road? 

Sorry about the long rant. I teared up a bit writing this. I want to cry a lot. I want to be proven wrong but I've only been proven right. Fuck Florida, fuck my life.",lonely,(Lack of) Update. And a full explanation about me for anyone that happens to scroll through my profile.,2022-06-28 10:28:59

374,burotocockersucker,1656369138,1,"I haven't really made any friends in years now and feel kinda empty inside, I have autism + adhd, I get fight or flight responses when someone knocks on the door / I get a phone call amongst other things so I don't really leave the house unless I have to, I wouldn't say I am like overly anxious or anything when I get to know someone but I'm a creature of habbit trapped in my own mind--

I would say I feel optimistic to find someone like-minded but I realise I'm a minority in society.

If someone messaged me it would be nice if we had some common ground and some info about yourself c:

A few main things about me would be:

I love creepy videos on YouTube and general true crime or horror related stuff such as Junji Ito, or just educational rabbit hole content that youtube algorithm recommends to me xD

I'm a bit of an anime nerd, I haven't watched anything recently other than demon slayer season 2, but my favs were devilman crybaby (mainly for the ost), jojos bizarre adventure, attack on titan, Erased and Made in abyss to name a few\~

My fav music would be EDM, synthwave sort of music but I have several hundred songs on my playlist some artist that come to mind that I like are in no particular order The weeknd, gorillaz, tame impala, porter Robinson, sáimes, basshunter and random game OST stuff like persona 5 or something haha

I'm currently play Lost Ark a bunch atm, but my fav games in general are dark souls borne + sekiro and elden ring stuff, god of war, monster hunter, final fantasy series in general, resident evil, persona 5 amongst other stuff, I also played runescape for years one of my fav childhood games

Also I enjoy art and creative stuff in general, mainly like colouring and lineart stuff so if you like to draw I'd love to see

Lastly I have a pet hamter, he says hi 🐹

I feel like I'm a good listener and don't take myself too seriously or anything like that, I personally hate the feeling like I could be stepping on eggshells around people

I moved from being an excellent student with good grades who was confident in my abilities to feeling uneasy and apprehensive. had so much potential, but I let self-doubt sabotage everything and still continue to do. Now I think about people my age get accepted to their dream schools and pursue their dreams while I can't even see my own future. I feel envy thinking of people my age who are socialising, making friends, and pursuing their dreams in school. I've destroyed myself and will continue to trash my life.

I don't have much to keep me going, except from false dreams and fantasies of my life getting better, and I honestly believe that death is a better place than living as myself.
While everyone at my age has decided out what they want to do with their lives, I'm restricted to my room, playing video games, watching TV/movies, and reading books. I'm worried that as I get older, I won't be able to keep up. Because of my insecurity, I squandered so much potential. Now, I believe that others my age are admitted into the schools of their dreams and realise their ambitions, but I am not one of them. I am unable to imagine my fate. just be a fool.

So I read a lot of different posts here about people being lonely(often romantically), waiting and longing for the right person to come into they lives and give them some purpose.  

All the posts about being some particular age and still being lonely. But who says that it is standard/normal that you have to find your person at young age?Or any other age? I mean everyone has they own journey. I think as long as you don't concentrate on the ""search for the right one"" and concentrate more on your self development, the right person might come to you on this journey.  

And even if not...

Relationship is not only about nice and lovely moment.It is also a lot of work and can even be exhausting. I think people can be happy no matter if they are in the relationship or not. It is about everyday decisions and actions. It also help to remember that ""the grass is always greener on the other side"". By longing for the things we don't have, we start to ignore positive things we actually have. Not being in the relationship also has a lot of positive sides. 

About loneliness particular.

Yes, loneliness sucks  and it is sometimes to hard to handle. BUT I kinda think by reading all the posts here, that many people somehow are expecting that some other person will come and fix they lives, and give them some motivations to enjoy they lives or even take actions to change it.

Yes of course it helps to have someone on your side. But other people can't fix our lives. No-one can.Yes the people who care about us will be worried, maybe give some advice. Maybe plan or organise some actions for us at the beginning, but they won't actually do it forever...

It is again about small everyday decisions. Everything has a positive side I think. Even lonlyness... It can make stronger, or also allows to take risks, (risks that have potential to improve your live) because there is no one that you can disappoint...And a lot of other small things like not handling with unnecessary drama...

Our lives are in our hands...Only we can save ourselves... if we really want this and believe that we deserve it...And if you think, that you don't deserve to be happy than I only can say, don't be mean. 
BE NICE TO YOURSELF. Your are as worthy as any other and this is actually the true. Be nice to yourself...Love yourself...

This was in the beginning of May. I joined a hike from a fb group. Take the train, hike to a cool waterfall, and go back. We took the long way back, the whole thing turned into a 20km trek. I had so so much fun, I like hiking/trekking (not sure which is which). Group split as and the tail fell behind, I was the end, so I'd know noone is behind me. 


Exchanged fb with a few people on the way back, that I met because we were all at the tail. 


Next day I get a message from one woman messages me asking if I was making a joke texting her from a fake profile. Because someone messaged praising her and being creepy and all, saying he was with the group, and said same name as mine. Sends me screenshot of the person's profiles that has completely different name.


She asked around people from the group she met and everyone said it might be me because I looked creepy.


I made a joke out of it, saying ""yeah, and I tortured small as kid for fun, yes""


Quickly put two and two, there was someone else with same name, I don't know, I don't care. Case closed.


She calls me few days later to tell me the whole soap she concocted. She felt guilty dragging me through the mad for no reason. So she went around telling everyone she already asked to tell them that it wasn't me. Some other guy I haven't even talked to, tells her that I tried joining his fb group for trips and he blocked me because I ""didn't say anything"" and he wants to get people to be hiking friends in that group or something like that. Pretty idealistic goal. And I didn't fit, becatI didn't say anything besides a ""weird"" joke in the group chat afterwards. to be noted joke was fucking great. She tells she don't want me to be excluded from their clique and asked th guy to give me another chance.


My reply ""wtf people we are fucking adults here, I don't need you to defend me against some imaginary accusations, I have lively enough social life, I joined the hike because I liked the idea. Nothing more, nothing less. Guy has a fb group, it's up to him who joins. So fucking what? I didn't talk much? I'm not being auditioned for a part in a play or something. Dammit"".



Few days later I got drunk and sad and angry that so many people didn't like me and ruled me out ""creepy"" for joining a hike and not talking much. I texted her ""I find information you gave me about a lot of people thinking I was creepy totally useless, and counterproductive. Either way I'm having some issues socialising with people, this only made it worse. This is feedback, do please in future keep stuff like that for yourself.""


some context: Most people on that hike didn't know eachother. It was a post on hiking group. 
Woman who stirred it all didn't know anyone there, same as me. We met at the station because we arrived at the same and I helped go get around, because she hasn't been on train in 10 years. Immediately was ruled out as love interest. She fell behind on hike so I waited at one point, while making sure I still see the others. At another point we came across an intersection of paths, I choose the right way.


TL;RD. I went on a hiking day trip with strangers, had so much fun, 20 km. Got an epic blister that took two weeks to pop. Later learnt lots of people took for creepy. Because another guy with same name I never met, was acting real creepy online to a woman from that group.

Honestly I’m writing here because the passed few months I’ve been very lonely, and I do feel that this is all my doing I’ve always had the mentality I don’t need friends. when I was in school I would always have three or four friends and that was it I can’t do manny people at once but after school ended I had absolutely no way to stay in contact with most of them and the ones I do still have contact with live in a different state but this loneliness is not about friendships nor even love but some sort of romantic-ish buddy …I know that must be odd to Have these fantasy’s I am 22 and I’m still a Virgin I can see why I’m not the most conventionally attractive at all for some rough description I have lightish  mocha/Caramel skin tone and a stocky build and  when I look in the mirror there are very few features of myself that I say oh hey that’s kinda cute or that’s not bad looking beyond that though I isolate myself I have trouble functioning in larger crowds and it’s hard to imagine finding a place to just go and hang out that’s quiet and not crowded and even then if I did I know what I hope for it absolutely absurd the types of fantasy I have about finding these buddies or two I’d like to have aren’t the same as When I was in school it’s always of a sexual nature those weird porn names that make no sense in real life if you will, though at the bottom end of it I just want to touch and be tocuhed by another Guy/Person  not only sexualy I suppose you can say my life is one of little affection 22 and still haven’t even had my first kiss and I’ve never cuddled with another person sense I was a kid cuddling with his parents. I think beacuse of this is why I feel lonely and empty, what I want is a friend who would do those things with me without need to put labels on it and let each other free to do what we want both with and outside of eachother but I know my wants are to specific and I know that with my lack of going out to even try to meet people there is no way for me to ever find something like that and yet I can’t do it for my own limits both mentally and other more outside factors such as I don’t have my own car so I suppose I write here because though I know or at least feel I can change my situation in my life telling someone anyone about it just maybe might make me feel less empty inside of my chest so telling all the lovely people here who are in similar situations I hope does something anything at all truly. and I’m sorry for pouring all this out to you and I know that this pales in comparison to probably everything else here but if anyone actually listened or rather Read then I thank you I also hope that it has not dampened your mood to much and I hope y’all have a wonderful day ahead of you!",lonely,Empty And Knowing why.,2022-06-28 04:55:24

I have never experienced being looked at just because I'm pretty all the time. I know I am not. I hate my face so much. I don't even take care of myself just to improve my physical self, so it added to my suffering as a person. You can never get lots of opportunities if you do not have the standard of beauty. I can't even take a photo or video of myself without a filter and post it to my FB or Instagram story. It's so frustrating to see how I see myself as not fat but not skinny either. and also not ugly, but not pretty either. That's why I don't like having crushes on people both on the internet and in real life, because whenever I see myself in the mirror, I feel like I do not deserve to like them because I can't even like myself.

415,NoCustomer4056,1656354621,1,"I am a 24-year old guy and I've never had a partner. Which is ironic, as many people have called me attractive and they usually rate my appearance from 8 to 10. So when they say things like 'How can a guy like you be single?', it hurts so much.

I've tried to find a girlfriend countless times, but to no avail. However, recently I met the most beautiful girl in my life. She is incredibly pretty, but not the way supermodels are. I don't know how to describe, but she is beautiful in a cute way. Her hair is wheat-colored, almost blonde, her eyes are dark blue, like the color of a stormy ocean. And even though we live in the south, her skin is quite white, almost pale. Her voice is very soft but at the same time somehow it makes her sound very self-confident.

From the way she dresses to her perfume and makeup, everything about her seems perfect. She honestly looks like an angel. And yet, she is apparently single, too. I've seen her almost a dozen times at the place where I work, but I've never been confident enough to approach her. In my social circle there are people who know her, so from them I heard that she studies English and French, she adores flowers and likes anime. As strange as it sounds, it looks like I share most of her hobbies.

Today I finally had an opportunity to approach her. I decided to greet her first, but when I tried to do so, my heartbeat became extremely fast. I became dizzy and my limbs got shaky. My jaw went numb, so I couldn't say a single word. I knew that if I said anything to her, my words would sound like incoherent muttering and I would embarrass myself. So I decided not to say anything and it felt incredibly painful. She gave me a confused look and started talking to her friends. I felt incredibly awkward.

I feel like I can't respect myself anymore. A real man shouldn't be shaking when seeing a pretty girl, this behaviour is viewed as cowardice in my culture. I barely know this girl and yet I feel like I truly love her. Missed opportunities hurt so much. I don't know how to stop being so nervous and probably nothing will ever help. I don't want to end up single, and I would appreciate any advice other than therapy, as I can't afford it these days",lonely,Failed to approach the most beautiful girl in my life,2022-06-28 04:30:21

I can’t be in hell forever. I don’t know how to start healing. I don’t know how to recover. She was my everything. I haven’t had close friends in so long. She was all I needed. I thought we were going to get married. She covered to Catholicism for me so we could get married in a catholic church. She started talked about our kids probably 8 months into our relationship. She was so in love with me. I don’t understand where everything went wrong. She had a friend that would wear short shorts and tank tops and shit like that. Her boyfriend liked to show her off. She had a huge influence on her. I saw the texts between them. They would talk shit about me and send memes about love. How long did she not love me? It was even her friends boyfriend who set her up with that guy. I don’t understand why I wasn’t enough. I need help, I need someone to talk to. There’s nobody in my life who I can ask for help or comfort from. I feel more alone than I’ve ever felt in my life. I want her more than anything. Even after she fucked another guy. How can I still want her? Is it just because I have absolutely no one else? And she’s the closest thing I have to someone to get comfort from? I just need to hear her say she’s sorry. Say she’ll never forgive herself for what she did. How she would do anything to go back. How she can’t see him again. How much she loves me and wants to stay with me. I need to see that she regrets it. That she fucked up. I want her to understand how much she hurt me. How broken I am right now. And how I don’t think I’ll be able to love again. Or for a very very long time. And by then, what’s the point? But when I asked if she’s going to see him again she said that’s none of my business. How can she move on instantly? Never in a million fucking years would I have thought she would do this. She’s so crazy with every single girl with me. She deleted every single girl off my snap, Insta, tiktok, etc. She would get pissed if a girl looked at me. I obviously didn’t want her talking to other guys, but I was never crazy about it with her. And even when I would try to talk about something she said to a guy that upset me she would just get anxious and scream at me to drop it. I just can’t accept this though. This doesn’t feel real. I’ve had actual nightmares of this exact situation. I don’t know what to do. Whenever I get to this part in the nightmare I just wake up and tell her how much I love her and how I never ever want to break up. I haven’t stopped thinking about it since it happened.

Hi everyone. Yesterday I found this community and everyone seems really nice. I’m a 25 yrs old female and I’m struggling a lot with loneliness lately. Not just lately but I just need someone now more than ever.

I’ve been through a lot in life and to be honest most of the time I had nobody who supported me. My mother used to mentally abuse me and both of my parents emotionally neglected me. I have no words to describe how _horrible_ that is. We used to have fights every day too so I was happy when I left the house. They taught me that who I was wasn’t good enough and it’s the hardest thing ever to change that feeling. When my parents divorced I supported both of them including my little brother. In all of that time there was only 1 person who asked me how I was doing. They just asked my brother and parents because everyone was just like: ye she can handle this. But I needed love and support too. 

I had a really toxic relationship for 5 years, where he used to beat me and broke me mentally. It took me 5 years to get the courage to break up. He cheated too, threatened to kill himself when I left him and he threatened me too. Again, nobody was there to support me. I shut down all of my feelings.

In 2016 I’ve had a rare type of cancer and when I’ve had the operations to remove the cancer I just broke down. I got depression, anxiety disorders and I started to hurt myself. I was all by myself, nobody noticed it and everyone ignored my asks for help. I went into therapy and ever since then I am in therapy. Currently I’m in therapy for other things but tbh I’m not sure if I want to do this anymore. A lot more happend in my life but I don’t want to tell everything because it would be a long story lol.

I have no loving family, no boyfriend, no parents who support me, and I don’t even love myself even tho I’m trying too. I literally told my best friend I’m not doing well and asked her for help, but she doesn’t know how to deal with it so she ignored it. I understand, but I’m so fucking tired of people ignoring my needs. 

Every day I fight and I don’t even know what it feels like to be happy. I’m _lonely af_ and I just need someone to be there for me just how I am for others. I just want some love.",lonely,new member story time,2022-06-27 19:24:36

We just get so engrossed and indulged in the day to day proceedings that we forget to be thankful for what he already have. In the race to achieve greater and good things, we often lose our sense of peace and happiness and it troubles us for a period of time. If we were to appreciate what we have with ourselves at the present, maybe we could try to cherish the little things, instances and moments in our life and thus this way we try to find happiness in the smallest of possible things and therefore in the bigger picture, we would have an outlook and approach that would strive to create a positive and happy environment that would support for a healthy self growth and development. This outlook or style of approach has been helpful for a lot of people and so does research from Positive Psychology supports it. 
Some people do not take the efforts to acknowledge or appreciate the things they have in their life. When sometimes i walk through the streets of Bombay and see the poor people who have not been bestowed with what we have, my heart feels for them. I wonder to myself that such people even though not having all the amenities in life, still have that smile on their face and the happiness speaks through their smile. We would particularly compare ourselves to people of higher status, the ones who have a lot of money, cars and etc but to compare ourselves with a person of poor status is not something people do often.
The human aspect of being grateful for the things they have in life is very important for an individual to attain. Running after temporary things in life that cause loss in sense of peace and health by the temporary world has become very common.

It would have been great to atleast have someone and talk about my problems but, guess what, there was no one. 

After a year, I got mentally frustrated quit the job and went back to college to start a new degree. Seriously, my workmates were no even interested in talking with me other than work related. I thought, I would make new friends in college, but wow, everyone is smaller than me by a good margin. So much so, that they don't even feel the need to ask me out for friendship.

I’m 27. I have never had an actual relationship. I used to go on dates when I was 19-20, but I got very depressed and stopped doing much. I mostly just stayed inside and smoked weed.

I’m 27 now and I’ve finished college. I have a pretty high paying job, around 190k a year. I have basically no close friends, just one or two guys I see once or twice a year. And I have no dating prospects. I went on a few online and in person dates and they have not gone well at all. I’ve felt basically zero connection and they didn’t really seem to like me either.

I’ve been wanting to kill myself for a few years. Life seems very painful and pointless. Not having friends or any real chance at a relationship are the hardest parts but it’s all hard. My dog is dying. My grandma is dying. Once they’re gone, I’m sticking a bullet in my brain.

Yes I go to therapy. I’ve been going for months, it doesn’t help. I’m not willing to take antidepressants as they can increase suicidal thoughts. I don’t have any hobbies but not for lack of trying, I can’t become interested or make friends at any of the ones I’ve tried.

491,sickfromanxiety,1656305529,1,I have no one to talk to and shits been extremely hard for me this year. This summer especially has been one of the worst most suffocating summers. A family member has moved back in and we got in a big fight (not the first). I finally decided I was done dealing with them. They have tried to approach me by for instance putting an ingredient beside me that I would usually use for the recipe I was cooking. I just froze and pretended I didn't notice and kept cooking without looking at them or turning to face them. It makes me feel sad and hurt because I feel sorry for how they must feel but at the same time I do not think I could ever have a normal relationship with them again after how they made me lose it. It does break my heart and I do cry about it sometimes because I just feel like a horrible person. I don't want them to think I hate them as a person (I know they deal with some type of inferiority complex and they want a lot of approval). At times I'm full of rage and contempt for them coming around me when they know I feel anxiety and fear and I just wanna be left alone. I try to be indifferent and literally my head feels so irregular. There is no balance with my mind anymore sometimes I don't even know what or how to feel so my head feels empty and numb. I am depressed for sure without a doubt. My anxiety is active a lot more now. I feel guilt and just like a pos for talking smack about them which I'm trying to not do anymore because they're only human. I know I should forgive them and I feel I have a bit but I can't bring myself to look at them and I don't want to be near them. I still feel rage. On top of that I'm healing from past traumas and dealing with some legal stuff too that is taking my life force out of me. I don't know how to make myself feel normal relaxed calm or at ease. I never talk to anyone and it's all bottling up inside without release. I feel no relief. I hate even burdening others with my problems so I just try to weather the storm but I feel like my whole life is just slipping away through my fingers. My will to try has diminished dramatically and I just feel like this suffering is here to stay and I should get used to feeling hopeless and in the dumps.,lonely,I am sick of containing my feelings,2022-06-27 14:52:09

I've had people who I thought were my friends try to convince me to have a physical relationship with them when I was mentally not doing well and acting out. I've had female friends just use me as a therapist and like only be there for the fun times but not for bad times. Although I've always been there for their bad times. They couldn't be there for mine. I've had one leave me bc I could no longer play the therapist role after going through the most traumatic event of my life. She didn't know what I was going through but she probably thought that I didn't care about what she was going through. A theme in my female friendships is that people don't care to ask to how I'm doing or if I actually say how I am then it's too much for them. I'm going through something very intense. I guess it's not fun to be around and after going through an assault I've had my female friends distance themselves from me bc I couldn't be their emotional support or their fun party friend anymore like how I used to be. I'm no longer of use. I needed them this time tho and they didn't want to be there for me which has broken my heart more than any romantic relationship can.

Context: I've been in dating apps for over 5 years with ups and downs... well, only downs if I got to be honest. Anyway, I matched with this girl and we get along pretty good, we got sale interests, you know the drill. Recently she got horny and ask me to do a video call in which we both get naked, it was really good and sexy (I love this kind of interaction), but later on she felt lots of shame because, as she told me, she gave me another impression not this one. We talk and I explained her that this didn't change my impression of her and that I really liked it and that we could work our way to a relationship including the sex. But at the end she couldn't bare it and dumped me, her reason being that she didn't want to start a relationship with sex and wanted something else. I tried to explain to her that I didn't mind and I was interested in being romantic more than horny and so...

She said ""ok, let's do it"" but at the end she dumped me anyway. Saying it isn't my fault that my action or words didn't influence her decisition, ""It's all on me"" she said and left.


I really think I'm the one to blame here, Idk if I'm cursed or something because simply I can't get a relationship. Was I the baddie?, I didn't started this slide, I accepted it and asked her all the way if she wanted and by the end of all it didn't matter. Really hurts me, because I start to think that maybe I'm not designed to be with other, I end up hunting them by action or inaction, by caring or helping, idk...

I said ""Well, let's keep going"" but that's a lie, I will remember this all my life, I'll carry it even when I don't want to, this will hurt me forever, can I be with other?, am I going to find my significant other?, a girl I can be with before my time expires?

536,Far_Car_8615,1656292057,1,"I had a girlfriend for 6 years. We did everything together. Went through high school, graduated. We experienced lots of “firsts” together. But to say that this relationship had its issues would be an understatement. It was tough as hell most of the times. She suffered from extreme anxiety and was constantly stressed out about pretty much everything. She also had medical conditions that is honestly a whole story within itself. I think a lot of this came from her childhood experiences. Obviously this wasn’t good for my mental health neither, but I guess I’m a nurturer. I love helping people and being there for people, especially people I care about. I want to make them happy and give them a reason to keep going. Anyways, fast forward  a year ago and we ended up breaking it off at the same park we had our first date. We were both exhausted and realized it was probably for the best. We’ve had so many “I think we should break up” talks in the past that I was convinced we would never do it. But this time was for real, and we both new it. Anyways, i told her to keep searching for what she wanted out of life and I haven’t talked or seen her since. I get extreme anxiety when I cross over to the side of town where she lives (I’m not even sure if she still lives there) and I’m terrified of bumping into her one day. I don’t even know what I’d do. She was an extremely kind but lost soul traveling in a world that was way too harsh for her and I wish the absolute best for her future. Anyways, I still think about her constantly but I figure the healthy thing is to start “looking” again. There’s this girl at work that started staring at me hardcore. We would constantly catch each other sneaking glimpses at each other. Obviously I took this as “she’s into me” but because it’s literally been since high school that I’ve actually walked up to a girl and started talking to her, it took me awhile before I actually got the courage to at least speak to her. She seems too attractive to be into somebody like me but maybe that’s just me talking down on myself. One day I decided to finally talk to her so I did and we chatted a little. I asked her what she does outside of work and almost immediately she mentioned she had a husband .-. I get for most people love and attraction are two entirely separate things but this almost seemed malicious. I don’t know, I guess I don’t blame her for have feelings of attraction but to this day, every morning she strikes up a conversation with me as if she still wants this to go somewhere. I’m cool with being friends but it’s kind of weird being friends with someone you’ve caught numerous times catching mad glimpses at you. Anyways, I find myself thinking of my ex more than ever nowadays and it’s making me miserable. After graduation we became completely reliant on each other and cut everyone we knew out of our lives (mainly our friends). So after the breakup I’ve found myself, for the first time in my life, completely alone. But I keeping moving, one day at a time, trying to make the most out of it and not let it define me. Finally practicing what I was preaching to her for all those years. I do wonder if she lives by anything I said I’ve ever said to her. Guess I’ll never know.

I went out alone recently to get something to eat. When I got to the place, as I was about to sit down, I was suddenly overcome with this feeling of overwhelming loneliness and had a panic attack. I left the place in a hurry and went straight back home and haven't went out since. 
I'm feeling so lonely and sad but I try my best to not show it because I know the people around me have enough problems of their own. I hate myself so much for not being able to do better. I just want a friend, someone to talk to... and eat with.

Sometimes the connection and chemistry are on point, but then I am told (or showed) that the dude treats the dating app we met on like an uber eats for pussy. Sometimes the dudes are just nice, but nothing more. And sometimes I feel like I'm talking to a donut.

No disrespect to any of the guys there (most of them have been really nice from my experience), but I feel like I'm swimming in a garbage dump, trying to find a pearl. Is love really that rare?

Meeting people is like having a second job and I feel so drained right now. Of course I'm taking breaks, but each time the desire to get back on apps is less and less encouraging for me. For now it feels like I'll never find anyone, ever.

My university has a long summer break from May 1 until early September. I had made a few friends or acquaintances in my major and had one faculty mentor (who is my age) that I had weekly contact with and considered a friend. When we broke for the summer there was promises from all of regular texts to let each other know we were ok and what we were up to, including the mentor. I was looking forward to that as I knew my summer would be tough.

All of them have ghosted since May 1. It’s now late June, almost July. I sent them texts that were not responded to. When I texted my mentor “how are you” he replied with hostility and basically said: “don’t bother me”.

I don’t know how should I behave around these people in the fall (when they presumably want to be “friends” and “mentor” again)? Standoffish? Confront them? Or ignore the fact they ghosted all summer? I don’t know what to do.

In summer, during May and mid June, I had been living in a location near my elderly parents so I could come by to take care of them. My parents abused me, stonewalled me, and treated me like crap. Wouldn’t let me use their kitchen to prepare a meal (I bought the food) for myself at lunch time, or even eat there, but I had to cook/clean for them. I would eat in local cafes but the service was so bad it felt like the staff might as well throw the food at me. Everybody in that area keeps to themselves so no opportunity to interact with strangers.

I have now moved to another location hundreds of miles away to a university town to take a summer class at another university, where I will be until late august. I’m considered invisible and often go days without talking to anyone. The students in my class are obnoxious pre-meds that laugh at any comment I make in class. The professor in the summer class treats me like an idiot.

We've been nevermets (in a relationship without seeing each other personally) for about a year now and we have been doing everything that we can to get her here. She filed for a passport renewal a few months ago and knowing that we had to wait for the appointment slot for so many months (it's hard to get a passport in Manila) and knowing that she's doing everything on her own makes me proud. 

After she got the passport, we immediately filed for a visa application (which is kind of expensive) and it took us another couple months. She went to the interview with the important papers and her huge hope of coming in here. Halfway through the interview, the consul stopped asking her questions and just told her that they have to deny my GF's application.

We didn't know why. My GF went home with a heavy heart and that was the only time when she could text me (phone's are not allowed inside the visa office), she told me she tried everything but still nothing is happening. She wants us to take a break. But I don't want to. But I respect her so much and now I'm torn between giving her what she wants or I should continue fighting for our relationship. She has done so much and I feel so guilty.

I want her to know that I am willing to compromise. I am here. I want us to finally be together. I want everything and I'm not backing out.

I'm planning to surprise her a few months from now by going there but I'm afraid that I will get rejected. I don't want to fuck this up, she's the reason why I started to believe that something good can still happen to me.

624,J7944,1656267002,1,"My best friend of 3 years is ghosting me and IDK what I did wrong....

Just...I'm not sure, venting. Don't want advice. Please don't give it. Just need to get this off my chest.

I recently celebrated my birthday (in my late twenties), and went bar hopping with Bestie (F 29), another friend, K (M 32), and my partner of 1.5 years. We had a good time, but as the night wore on, I could tell Bestie was getting more irritable. I thought it was because Partner, K, and I got drunk and started talking about anime, and Bestie isn't a nerd like that. But even so, her annoyance really didn't seem to add up. I'm sure we were being mildly loud and goofy, but not obscenely. She even started snapping at me as the evening came to a close. We got back to my place, K passed out on my couch, and Bestie gave me a weak hug and left. 

Later, Partner and K both commented on her attitude and said that she was probably mad attention wasn't on her. K even stated that at my birthday last year, she had attempted to flirt with him and got actually mad when he turned down her advances. Even said, ""Well, I thought you came out so we could have fun?"" K is a very handsome, ex-military guy. But he politely told me she wasn't his type. 

This girl is a handful. I won't lie. We bonded after my mother passed away from cancer very suddenly, so I know our relationship is trauma-based and not the healthiest. But it still sucks. I don't have many friends. I had an unorthodox childhood and wasn't ever around kids to grow up with. I have my own batch of mental health issues, such as avoidant attachment and anxiety, so I know I'm not the easiest person to deal with. But I've always tried to be an uplifting and supportive friend.

I'm not one to text constantly and demand attention or confront someone. I feel like if it's important enough, they will reach out. And maybe that isn't healthy either, but I've always been that way. 

Roughly two days ago, Bestie randomly texted me and asked me out for drinks. I was at the gym and running errands, so I couldn't go. By the time I got home, I asked if she still wanted to hang out, and she said no. She was in a mood and just wanted to stay home and watch TV. I don't know if me not dropping everything to go see her then and there upset her, or what. Then, yesterday, I was bored and had the day off. I decided to go to the movies spontaneously and invited her. But she said no, she was waiting to see that exact movie with her mother (they do a lot together, so that was fine. But it still hurt a bit.)

I know this is a lot. If you read the whole thing, thanks. Like I said, I try own my own issues and definitely know I'm not some perfect little victim, nor am I trying to come across that way. I just feel like I'm losing my best friend. It sucks, but on a weird flipside, I also feel somewhat relieved. Bestie is mildly toxic and demanding and having the month to myself with less drama has been nice. But it also isn't because I don't have anyone to talk to other than my Partner, who is great and supportive. But it's not the same. 

Anyway, that's really it.

It is difficult being around someone you want to be around, but knowing and seeing real-time, over and over, them be indifferent to your existence.

It’s like, I wish I as a person, and our friendship as a whole, meant as much to them as it does to me. But every single day I see them around (online) is another straw needle on the camel’s back - that is to say, every time they don’t talk to me is a reminder that they unconsciously forgot about me, or consciously chose not to engage with me.

We’ve talked more recently and every single time has been pleasant and fun to chat and hang out. I fully recognise she has made the effort to be friends / be friendly and keep it that way, but it still stings. Without sounding too sappy about the whole ‘The heart wants what the heart wants’, I wish I could move on sometimes but I struggle to give up hoping that she might change her mind, even though I can rationally say that is likely to never happen, especially considering she turned me down once already, and only talks to me when I reach out to her (not vice versa).

I 19F have never had a bf, been on a date, or held hands/kissed/hugged a guy. I’m not ugly, overweight, or with any weird physical traits, I take good care of my appearance, I have good grades in college, and I have a lot of female friends but guys just never give me any attention for some reason. I’ve tried being more quiet and chill, but still nothing. I’ve never smoked or had alcohol because I don’t get invited to things and I don’t wanna go to a big party and make a fool out of myself. I have the least experience out of my big friend group, but I don’t tell them how bad it is because I feel like it makes me look like something’s wrong with me. I want so badly for a guy to want me and compliment me and flirt with me, I wanna get married and have kids when I’m older and I feel like I’m so behind that nobody’s gonna want to be with me. I hear girls complain that guys only want them for their bodies, but that sounds better than my situation. 

I got some comments last time saying to just put myself out there more, but I wasted last school year doing that. I started liking this guy in one of my classes (20M) in September because we had really compatible personalities, he’s exactly my type physically, and I was just really drawn to him. I dm’d him on instagram first which is really out of character for me, and we started texting consistently over winter break. We never talked about feelings but I liked him more than I’d ever liked anyone and it really felt like he liked me back. We hung out in my room once in February and I wasn’t gonna have sex but he sat so far away from me, and then he made plans with me twice over the rest of the semester and flaked both times even though I went to every game of his I could (even watched his away games online so I could talk about it with him), I always asked him about his day, and although I wanted to see him in person more I never nagged him about it or complained when he cancelled on me. I only decided yesterday to just give up and move on (we live 15 minutes apart and he told me he was too busy to hang out this summer, ouch.

I also told her how I want to try and lose a lot of my weight because I gained 15 pounds this past month, and she said I’ll be fine and also whenever she goes to the store she’s always coming back with junk food, especially lemon flavored sweets which she knows are my favorite. It just feels likes I’m not being listened to. I plan on moving back out on my own and hopefully then I can start getting some stability and get a routine going so I can lose at least some weight.

Hey all

(English is not my 1st language so excuse the grammar)

I am 31F and i have gotten to the point in my life where i feel i will never love anyone. Has anyone felt this way ? I don't have a problem finding suitors and guys tend to catch feeling for me but i just dont feel the same. I cant help myself. I feel so numb. I just dont gaf about anything these days.

I do want kids and a family, so i am almost starting to think maybe i should just pick someone and go ahead with the family making. I feel like this is something that would make me really happy and suit  
me. I do have a career in my respected field but i really don't get any happiness or self-fulfillment out of that. I do like it but its like...meh. I do it for the money. I wish i had something i truly love.

My last relationship ended about a year ago, it wasn't the best and the guy was ''narcsissist''. Im over that now completely and i have healed. The problem is, that i have so many nice, decent guys interested in me and i just don't like them.

There has only been one person in this life, that i could see myself with but that's never going to work out so im not hoping for him. I think its part of the reason i cant find anyone else attractive because i always compare to him.

I feel so alone, sad and without perspective. I know that me being lonely is my fault and my fault only. People tell me that all the time, that im too picky. But then again, i do want someone who i at least like a little.

I don't have problem meeting guys but finding anyone interesting :( :( I feel like a bad person for that.

Has anyone ever felt this way and actually was able to feel again? Or is ''love'' overrated and i should just pick with my head (like some of my friends have done, but they are not particulary happy i must say) Any experiences similar to mine?

I am so sad about this and i really don't know how to help myself. I have struggled with depression a big part of my life and this situation is not making it better. I do take AD's atm, i think if i didnt i would not be here anymore. I just hate always being the lonely one.",lonely,Lonely and unable to love,2022-06-26 23:58:30

I shoulded be bothered by this but the fact that they dont ask anything back, i just thought its good manners or just polite to ask the same question back 'and you'.

It was no 'mean girls' kind of clique but just a bunch of girls that are not popular, who also just don't want to be alone. Years pass by and we meet each time it is someone's birthday. The set up was not perfect but I learned to accept it and made accomodations to everyone's ""busy"" schedule as well as their likes and dislikes.

This year, I was just exhausted about all my relationship but I thought to myself, this the one friendship I am willing to fight for, turns out, I was already a ticking time bomb and just over it. One friend was ticked due to change of plans and decided to not go the birthday celebration. I was heartbroken. This is the only occasion that I really care about and she knows that full well, and she decided not to go. I begged, pleaded and asked why, what is going on, how can someone be so ticked to decide to just not go to an occasion we have been planning and we have been doing in forever. 

I cried for days, it really felt like she was checked out on the relationship, as for the others, they can barely care. I felt like I was the only one feeling things. I thought this is probably because I was the only one single in the group, I work from home so I barely have social events and highly introverted, so whomever I have, that's it for me. Sigh 😔

I was left constantly second-guessing myself. I started reading 'the mountain is you' by Brianna Wiest and I was presented by an idea that maybe, just maybe, they are not my people. That there is life that exists where I don't have to constantly beg for people's time and attention. Where I am not the only one putting up effort... Where there is a friend I can call when I am feeling down and not just be shutdown by laughing emojis... And there is a friend who would be happy to share life events to me ...

I am not perfect, but I saw myself slowly growing cold because of people like them. I see my light slowly dying because of confusing signs of whether or not you want me in your life.

Meanwhile I was handing out (I work in fast food), not included in the conversation, and started to tear up. I tried so hard to not cry, as it's happened before at work and I try not to let it happen again. I held it in, but to do that I basically couldn't say a word. If I tried to speak, I would've started crying. Occasionally I had to speak up to confirm a customer's order, but from my voice it sounded like I just wanted to break down into tears.

I never realized how alone I was when I was younger because I had my best friend. I stopped talking to her when she moved away. She really just became a new person, not the girl I knew. 

Basically 4 years later me and my brother were messing around and decided to prank call her. I don’t really know why it led up to this. When he called her he was pretending to be some surfer boy or whatever and messing with her. Her friend in the background asked who it was. My old friend said “my lil childhood white best friend”. 

I know I’m being dramatic.. I KNOW. It just hurt me a lot for some reason. I mean that’s all I am to her man.. shit feels terrible. I was always there for her. I supported her in so many ways and that’s all I am to her. Just those simple words. She was all I ever had.. it hurts bro. 

She gets everything she wants in life too. I know she has family problems and all but besides that she got everything I’ve ever wanted. She’s like barely 14 too. This girl goes to parties, completely stunning, has multiple friends, EVERYTHING. I’m so jealous of her. It upsets me man. Why did I have to be the one who gets nothing? 

Just to put this in perspective
I have absolutely no friends. My entire life my only friend was her. I may just be her childhood friend but to me she was my only friend ever. She was the only person that was there for me.

Your soul matters, your living, beating, pulsating mind is very valuable. A repository of all the wonderful personalities that you have. You means a lot in this world, to exist, for someone and yourself.

If you're down lately, you might feel as if nothing matters anymore. Life or death just suddenly seems like it's just a state, just a 0 and 1. But you'd be wrong, there's always something waiting for you up ahead. Something wonderful, something that will make you feel like your life is anything but that thing.

Some people don't care about you, I'd say walk away. There are probably better people, better place, that gives you the care, love, and affection far more than what you have right now. So keep looking forward, up ahead, chin high. For you will be meeting someone, or something that'll give you the genuine care you deserved.

Since that period, I no longer have any social life, I no longer go to school, I don't work, I don't really have any real friends, the atmosphere at our house is absolutely shitty because of  my mother and my sister and there is also this girl who worries me too much at the moment.  I was in a relationship with this girl from April 2020 to August 2020 (4 months of relationship) I did not take this relationship seriously at all.  I was a kid who would rather play video games and smoke than take time for her.  Even a few days after we broke up, I realized what I had lost, but what I felt for her was nothing compared to what I feel now.  My brother and my father died when I was 7 and 9 years old.

The life didn't go like that, the first time I fell in love I watched it crumble. The second time it utterly destroyed me. I picked myself back up so much and tried to put together all those pieces each time being more and more perfect. Until people saw me as successful, but even with all that there is still something deep inside me that cannot be filled. Each day it just gets worse and worse as I watch loved ones and friends move forward in their lives. Finding love and happiness. As I sit here feeling like I'm decaying, falling apart each day more and more. Feeling more alone and more isolated no matter what I do and destroying every relationship that I have from my own insecurities and fear of being hurt or abandoned again.

This lonelyness is different, from anything I have face before. It's almost like it's a weight bearing down on me. Pushing me deeper and deeper into this mindset that I just can't get out. I'm so scared now that I feel like this forever. That I'll grow old and alone with everyone just looking at me with sad eyes for the person I used to be.

Ever since I was born I’ve been such a burden to my family and I did not get any genuine social interaction until I was 13 with my close friend. Teachers were racist as hell, I had no friends, and my family ignored me. My close friend who I met in 8th grade is amazing and has brought me so much joy in the past 6 years. But what I feared was going to happen is starting to happen. We’re both in college but we go to school in different states and she’s moving onto new friend groups and opportunities as my life gets worse and worse. She’s all I have tbh and I didn’t realize that until today when we had our most recent conversation that we might drift apart. We have less time for each other meaning she’ll spend more time with her new friends. There is a possibility that we’ll still be close and be friends but with my life’s track record so far it’s most likely going to be that I lose her and spiral into a deeper depression than I already have. We usually spend my birthday together since it’s in the summer but we might not be able to this year meaning I have to spend it with my shitty family. I was looking forward to spending more time with her but it looks like that’s not possible. I’ll spend my summer crying inside my room as my mental health gets worse as she lives a better life than me. Sure I don’t know the full story of her life but with what I’ve seen and heard so far, she’s doing better than I have in the past 2 years. Which is why I’ve decided to kill myself at 25. My life so far has just been taking constant L’s. Honestly I want to kill myself tonight but I’m too lazy to. Don’t comment Dumbass corny shit like I have more to live for because I don’t. The fact that I didn’t get the bare minimum of motherly affection and kindness has set me up for failure the fact that I haven’t killed myself yet is a miracle. I cannot believe I chose to stay alive in my senior year of high school just for this bullshit. I refuse to spend the rest of my life trying to replicate what I never had. I’ll finish college and maybe make it a couple years and see if my life gets better but I doubt it.

I don’t know, I’ve always felt lonely. My entire life I’ve literally been lonely. It wasn’t the worse life I could’ve had but growing up I was very lonely. No dad but I did have a mother, unfortunately she was gone all the time too. She cared for two kids herself but was always gone to provide. So a lot of my childhood I was by myself at home alone.

Now I’m an adult, I was lucky enough to find a beautiful woman who takes a good stance between women and men and what their needs are. I make sure I treat her really well as a gentleman should. I moved across the country for her (Arizona to Virginia), because I love her and wish to keep her comfortable and make sure she continues school.

It’s a bit harder finding work but I’m actively looking meanwhile she finds work easy being a nanny for wealthy people.

I feel useless trying to be someone she can rely on to find work but even so while I look I try to remain useful. Doing the household chores besides cooking (she’s a good cook while I just cook to eat to survive, I’m no specialist).

Today was Saturday which we choose for dates. Also, we just moved into our first apartment together after weeks of going from Airbnb to Airbnb.

Sometimes I feel like she wants more from me but I can’t figure out what I need to do. I look for work, I make sure she’s okay yet it doesn’t seem like enough until I find an actual job.

Not only that but sometimes we play around. Not like usual couples what we tickle each other because I’ve tried that and she gets too aggressive. She’s literally slapped me hard but I just took it because we’re playing but I definitely don’t hit her. I just don’t know what to do sometimes.

She’s okay with slapping tf out of me, as long as we’re playing around but I can’t ask for a kiss sometimes because she might be busy texting her friends most of the time. I know she’s not cheating but it sucks that she’s more willing to slap me as a joke than she is to kiss me when I feel affectionate.

Sometimes I feel like I’m too clingy but it’s because I didn’t grow up around anyone as a kid. Whereas she’s grown up with many siblings she’s had to be strong for.",lonely,I’m always lonely,2022-06-26 07:15:34

Seeing them all in break, having fun chatting to others on the phone or joking around with one another's.. I tried as best as I could to fit in, but whenever I needed to check my phone, nothing just mindless scrolling pretending like I have some one important to read or reply to.. I don't and I accept that

Then the weekend comes, I should be happy for a break but I'm so tired and alone, I just said fuck it.. bought some drugs and monged out from yesterday afternoon till winding down today

I got myself into some fair amount of debt so Ik I'll at least need to work till the end of the year to clear it or have any options to actually, really change anything..

The last 3yrs have been so hard, 2020 I can't imagine a year as low as.. 2021 sadly I let pass by and now this year I've been trying to get my life more organized.. but idk what to do man, I delete and redownload all the social media apps more times than I can remember, I consume endless crap whether it's music, TV, YouTube, games or porn (yes ik, v bad), I retype basically the same questions about life/depression/loneliness on Reddit every week or so and find nothing, even if I made 'internet' friends, it's not real I won't feel like I actually have someone to talk to, who I care for and cares about me.. a real connection or friendship like in reality 

It's just an endless struggle and it feels hopeless in trying, I feel I'm doing as best I can..

It’s so weird, I’m at work bored out of my mind watching all the groups and couples have fun drinking. I’ve made a lot of changes in my life the past few months. The only thing that gets me happy anymore is the gym and my wonderful bf. But we’re long distance for 2 more months and that’s not even the hardest part I see him every 2 weeks. The hardest part is missing genuine friendships. I had to cut off some toxic friends for my own mental health and I had to leave a very nice job because it didn’t pay well. I miss constantly being around friends and people, I miss how bubbly I was. That’s what I hope to get back in my life. The life in me. I only feel myself again when I’m with my bf I just feel I do not want to be codependent so I want to find other ways to feel happy as well.

835,ServiceNice4614,1656181802,1,"Having no friends is fun. :(. Being betrayed by the people you though cared for you is fun. I am on a ship. People that you were “friends” for over 5 years suddenly become enemies. They stop talking, start ignoring you, make you feel like a nobody. You start to wonder: have I done anything that did not satisfy them? You start to question yourself, why? you ask. You start to blame yourself, what have I done?. The last time you went out, was to give them money for presents. After that they make new group chats making shitty excuses to avoid you. 

Just because I choose to be myself. Not someone they want me to be. Is that too hard for people? I know what is the problem! I am too honest. When I was asked for my opinion I gave my opinion not the opinion they wanted. That is punishable by lies and deceit, I guess. 

I would appreciate them coming to my face and telling me their problems. I would always sit down and listen, I believe they were there to hear from me as well, but hell na. 

The only messages I got from them was for homework and study help. They not only lie in my face but they also think I am dumb. As I said, I have seen this happen before. When we were one whole friend group they wanted to start moving away, I tried to tell them that hiding it is bad, they did not listen, why would they? Now I am in the same situation.

I've always tried to be nice to others but I don't get that much in return. The most what I get is ""You are a good boy"" from people and sometimes they don't even say it to my face. And I'm talking about my real life. I am not that religious but sometimes I question about my Bible is that ""Why people read Bible if they don't want to follow it outside of the church?"" It doesn't make sense to me. I used to serve refreshments to people and clean the church after the  church get finished every Sunday and now I left it know why. 

My loneliness mostly comes when I think I'm useless. I'm in my 4th year of my college now and Im studying Computer Science and I still haven't made any solid project on my own and I have nothing that good to show on my CV. I can't concentrate well during my lectures and I really don't know what will become to me in my future. If I'm just good at my studies I think I won't ne lonely as I'll have something to live for. My favourite thing is to play badminton and seriously I'm really good at that. I can play it whole day. I wanted to make it my profession but my father just wanted to me to study. He just told me to make money just like we did for you. Even if he calls me It's always about me money.  I have irl friends but as we are about to graduate now they seem they are ignoring me, they now have girlfriends, so maybe they are always busy with them.

I studied in a boys school so like I talked with very less with girls. As I started college it was very difficult for me to talk to them and still it's difficult. I never had a gf, so I just started imagining things. At first it was just holding hands, hugging each other but as i got desperate it turned into pervy things, it was fun but slowly by slowly  it turned out be  my greatest nightmare now and it always kills me from inside every night. If you want Know more about me, like what sort of a person I am you can check my profile, I never delete my posts and tbh I found someone online whom I can love and she accepted me as the way I am and I really wanna reach her out in the future and I am trying my best to do that.

I just want someone to just text me Good Mornings and Nights. I tried making friends in Needafriend, I really made good friends but most of them don't start a convo first. I just want someone to just text me first, just a Good Morning and Nights will work and it would be more than enough.

852,beingrandom77,1656172101,1,"Hi everyone. Hope you all have been holding through well, or at least trying to do so. Firstly, a little about me. I am 21 years old, still in College, studying law. I love studying, reading books, listening to varied music, history, art, social science and cultural studies, making trivias, watching movies, doing small things for people I really love and care about and having deep conversations. 

Although I've always had friends, but could never really nurture any of my friendships enough to keep them for long. It's a mistake I admit and want to rectify. I'm still young and have a long life ahead. I want to meet new people, from different backgrounds, with different stories and experiences and get to know them from their heart and hope to nurture a relation with them for long. I recently (this week) had a breakup from a five year old relationship. The girl I loved was probably the best thing ever happened to me. If I see our relationship apart from the attachment and romance, we were really good friends and did a lot for each other. Just this time, she said she was too tired to go through any bad times with me, which is fair enough because I somehow hurt her because of my mental health issues. Though, somewhere I still hope that she will come back and we will resolve things as always, I've been feeling abandoned. Today, I took a therapy session and learned new perspective and understanding. I really feel that everyone around me, all of you as well are going through something, and it's just too hard to deal with all of it alone.

Hence, I want to reach out to all of you and just tell you all that I want to talk to more people and really talk, not just the small talk but actually a heartful conversation. We all carry so much baggage and burden, if I can really help someone lift them, I would be really really glad while also having found someone to keep me company. I'm still grieving but surprisingly, I feel positive about myself most of the times, and want to reach out and spread the feelings of love and care to everyone I can. If you are going through anything, or need someone to talk to, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm there for you.",lonely,Really want to talk to more people and get to know them,2022-06-26 01:48:21

I have friends but I cant really talk about how I'm feeling as I dont wanna bring them down and even though I'm always there to lift their spirits it's not really reciprocated so why bother.

Hey everyone you can call me Goose. I've been thinking about my social relationships and I'm just very unhappy with most of them and to be honest its really starting to get to me. To keep it short I can't really be myself around them, I still like  most of my friends but I think I have  to be a more tame and boring version of myself and I really don't like that.

Being alone for so long I have started to develop some feelings for this gal even though we only went out a couple times. I know I shouldn't be getting attached so quickly but she's so gorgeous and bubbly it's a little hard not to. Little bummed out to hear she attended the Ottawa Protest back in January and is very much antivax. I almost wish I didn't know this but I guess it is better to know. I know couples don't have to agree on literally every single thing but to me that was a really hot button issue and I don't know if this will workout going forward. I'm disappointed but ultimately better to have a bubble burst early than too late. I'm not perfect and I try not to be too judgmental. In regards to the Ottawa Protest there were some issues I agree with but overall I wasn't in support of it. We seem to differ on this one core aspect. I believe in science and vaccination and would prefer to find someone on this same wavelength. I guess 5 minutes of brief but genuine connection is better than none at all. Anyway I've pretty much said what I have had to say. I haven't told her my thoughts on vaccines but this could be problematic in the future. Just wanted to throw my frustration out there.

""The sky, the winds, the sight you have given me, wheresoever I turn, your expressions are there!

Glory and praise be to you, my beloved Lord. Please, never abandon me as no amount of friends, wealth and luxury will change the fact that I have no one but You. And with you, I have everything!""

You were created to get closer to Your Creator, serve Him and become remarkable. Consider it as a blessing that you are not distracted by vain company. This is an excellent time in your life where you have been given an opportunity to turn towards Him, get close to Him, and to accept your purpose:

This happened a couple of years back I just randomly thought of it and decided to share it since it is a fucked up story and I'd like to bring a little bit of attention to it. My friend and I went to a music festival, it was a leap outside my comfort zone but I've read that getting out of your comfort zone helps you become better and grow as a person. So we were at the festival, the two of us just having fun, drinking and enjoying the music and having a good time. It was like close to midnight and a group of 5 guys approached us and started a conversation, we were vibing they were super charismatic and seemed like a cool group of guys so we decided to hang out with them for a bit at the festival, 30 minutes in one of the guys hugged my friend and another put one of his arms around my shoulder talking to me, they sort of split the two of us a bit. We had our cups in our hands, I turned back to my friend to tell her something and I saw her getting hugged I was like 'aww' but, as she was getting hugged she had her hand and the drink in hand to the side and one of the five guys slipped a pill in her drink, which I saw. So I told the guy next to me to give me a minute and I told my friend about it. We were both like what the fuck what do we do now. We didn't want to let them know that I saw it so we asked to be excused to go to the bathroom, but we left the festival as a whole that was super fucked up imo. That was the last time I went out 'partying', which might have amplified my loneliness. Why are some men like this?

886,Moon_And_Stars9,1656150216,1,"All of my friends are gone. They're alive, but they just left.

I had three very close friends, L, S, and Q. I'm probably never talking to any of them again. And what's worse is that they all left without saying goodbye.

L is an online friend, and attempted suicide a few months ago. Luckily it failed, but his parents took his tech until July, and in July they'll be monitoring everything a ton so he can't really talk to me (he's not supposed to have online friends). Even if we could talk again, we've gone so long without talking that it just wouldn't be the same. 

S ended our friendship last year because I was a shit friend and they were trying to distance themselves from people because of their depression. They also attempted suicide. It failed, but we got to talk for a little bit and basically all that happened was that they said not to feel guilty and reassured me like they didn't just try to take their life. A mutual friend told me about them attempting in class and obviously I broke down, and in a convo with the mutual friend and them (I got a screenshot of the convo from the mutual friend) they basically said I was overreacting and it made me feel really shitty thinking that they saw me as ""weak"" or something bc I cried. So yeah we're probably not talking again. We swore to each other that no matter what we'd always be friends, but unfortunately life can't accommodate the innocence of two 10 year olds that couldn't predict the future. 

Q ghosted me and when I confronted them about it, they told me why, and long story short, they had a crush on me, told a friend, and was emotionally abused about it. So much so that they had to ghost me because I reminded them of the abuse. I really fucking miss them and I wanna talk to them again, but I don't want to trigger them. One night I texted them and I asked them if they ever hated me for talking to them (I ghosted them after school ended one year and then we reconnected a few years later) and they didn't respond. I really want to be friends again, but like I said I don't want to bring back bad memories. They had told me that they weren't ready to be friends again bc they were super happy and didn't want to mess it up when I confronted them the first time, which I know means we aren't talking again, but part of my wishes that we could.

892,Naive-River-8334,1656147167,1,"\*\*TW\*\* - Suicide, depression, mental illness

I was bullied in grade K, and so I switched to private schooling shortly after. There I met several people who were good friends for a VERY long time. Met a couple from Grade 1, and the grades following. I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact that people can just say ""Fuck you,"" (Metaphorically) and cut all connections in a matter of seconds. There doesn't even need to be an instance of argumentative talking, but it's so abrupt I'm still dealing with the fact that my life is already over. I overthink way too much, which normally leads to plans for the future, but lately, all of my plans are either committing suicide or having a proper fucking friend group. I don't have any friends, maybe like 1 or 2, but they aren't close. And whenever I'm walking through the halls of my school now, all I see is friend group upon friend group upon friend group. I don't understand. I go to the tables in the cafe, and the moment I sit, every. Single. Person. Gets up and walks away. Legit, what the fuck did I do? The only thing that I've done would've been wearing a dress to school (Male). Which was purely for jokes, but I don't know... maybe people thought of it to be weird? I just can't seem to make use of my life no more. The only plans I have are MAYBE becoming a novelist, but God forbid it's something other than a carpenter or something else. Not to mention how tiring writing a novel is, might as well just put iron in my mouth. Like, I see old friends all the time walking through the halls, and most of the time, it's either they ignore me, or wave. Which is fine, I don't expect everyone to remember who their old friend was, but that's just how it is. I had this one friend for a bit over 5 years, who just started lying to me. No reason whatsoever. It also doesn't help that the mood swings I have are stupid. I find when I'm not feeling lonely I rarely have mood swings large enough to both encompass suicidal thoughts and the feeling of joy. But now that 2 of my 10-year-long friends have both blocked me, it's... something else. I don't know, maybe I should've gotten the hint when I was the only person asking if they wanted to play video games. I was always the first person who asked them if they wanted to do something; it was never them. And maybe that's one of the reasons for the extremely sudden blocking and ignoring. As for saying ""Private school was the worst mistake"" It comes down merely to the loneliness felt by not having more than a couple of friends. The only good part of a private school was the teachers of my later grades. The worst part though is during the summer. I fucking hate summer. Not because it's hot, or wasps, or anything- except the lack of stuff being forced down your throat. Atleast with school, I could (attempt) to forget about the lack of meaning I serve and focus on studying. But during the summer, I look on social media and see old friends having the time of THEIR LIFE. I've never been invited to a party, and I'm (sooner than later) going to graduate from high school, but some of the people I work with are years younger and they have so many tales to tell about the 'best night of their life least. People are having the times of their life, and here I am, just writing. In terms of wearing a dress, I sometimes wear a skirt when I'm bored and because of this, my mom thinks I'm transgender, and my sister thinks the same. If my dad knew he would kick me out in a heartbeat. Thing is, I'm not trans, nor gay, just religious human experimenting; and that's another thing my private school put a stop to. Since it was a religous-based school, everything was for god, but now I'm thinking that if there was a God, then he would've popped the wheels of a semi-truck while I was crossing. I want to do it so badly, but I know if I were to jump out in front of a vehicle, it would both devastate me, and the driver's family. I've had a few times where I put a blade of sorts to a part of my body (ie neck, etc) and have cried. I'm getting sidetracked, but long story short is that my friends left me and mental illness is a douchebag  


TL;DR - Friend's I've known for more than half my life abruptly blocked me on social media, while their other friends post pictures of extremely fun-looking scenarios. And a few life-altering mental issuesFriends

896,lunaag10,1656145213,1,"We’ve labeled ourselves as bffs because we’ve been in each other’s lives since we were literally born. Recently, after a lot of falling outs and betrayals from other friends, she became the only friend i had, besides my partner who I’ve been with since HS. 

I’ve been there for her through all her breakups and heartaches and we lost one of our childhood bffs when we were in college and went through it all together. I was always a phone call away and would drop everything to be with her and comfort her, and honestly still would. Recently i started noticing that i would never get that energy back. The only person who ever did that for me was my partner but i always wished i had my “bffs” support too.

I’ve started noticing that whenever she has a bf, she kind of tosses me aside and doesn’t reach out or want to hang out as much, honestly not at all. And shes been with this bf for almost 2 years now and lives with him and I’ve only met him once. They live with another friend and it honestly hurts me that they all spend so much time together and post it on socials and i don’t get so much as an invite. I’m literally only invited when it’s a “girls” thing.

I’ve tried countless times to invite both of them over to hangout but there’s always an excuse or she would show up without him and would have an excuse for him. I even invited them to hang out during one of my lowest points in life and neither showed up, only my partner’s friends. Before she got serious with him she told me about his life and how he socializes and she would literally drop everything to be with him and his friends, literally all last minute things but when it came to me, i was always a last thought.

She refused to go to a family member’s funeral and it made me disappear and distance myself after i told her it made me upset and after the loss, i went through my first major depressive episode which made me want to disappear more. I just felt so low, from grief, rejection, and feeling so alone and unwanted. I got a couple of texts here and there from her but not much else. I did get an apology but they were just words to me at that point, it felt like she was dismissing my pain and hurt so she didn’t have to acknowledge it.

I invited them both to an event and she said they would both be there and i was so excited because i hadn’t seen him in over a year from the first time we met. Only she showed up with an excuse for him and i felt so upset and i tried not to show it. I had even texted her right before, letting her know that i was so excited to see him again and hangout and she didn’t respond because she already knew he chose not to go and when i saw her i asked about him and she gave me an excuse again. 

After that i felt so unwanted and so rejected and hurt and like there was something wrong with me, i just distanced myself even more after that. Since then, I’ve only seen her 2-3 times this year, only for special events and i still haven’t seen him. But the couple of times I’ve seen her, she acts like nothing happened and nothing’s wrong, for my sanity and mental well being, i chose to go along with it and deep down i know she’s no longer my bff and i no longer have any close friends.

It would just be nice to have a girlfriend and a couple good friends so we can enjoy each other’s company. 

The whole ‘work crazy hard all day every day til you die’ grind just isn’t for me, and I just want to enjoy life with someone cool. Is that too much to ask?

906,Thrower8622,1656138987,1,"Hello all, man in my early 20's here. 

I feel like I do almost everything right when it comes to dating. I'm an avid rock climber so physically I'm not lacking whatsoever. People have told me that I'm a smiley, cheerful guy, and whenever I enter the room people genuinely seem happy. I can cook well. I'm in therapy. I'm passionate about bass, music, film, and fiction writing. In general I love spending time with myself. I'm confident but not egotistical. 

I've only been in situationships/FWB situations, not a real relationship, but I almost feel like I would rather be a virgin. It absolutely drives me crazy just getting a taste of romantic love, like running toward an oasis in the desert and realizing it's just a mirage. I would so much rather just forget about the unadulterated bliss a romantic moment can be than live with only being fed drops. 

I am a bisexual who exclusively dates women, and I find making friends with women quite easy. I have a lot of female friends, but none of these ever translate into romantic relationships. I completely understand that these women don't owe me shit, but it almost feels like women automatically put me in a box when they meet me. It makes me incredibly insecure about my identity as a bi guy, watching guys straighter than me easily get into romantic relationships almost as if by the push of a button by acting domineering and aggressive. 

I feel like most women see my bisexuality as weak. I feel like they see my kindness as weak. I feel like they secretly despise my attraction to men and view me as inferior. 

When I do get into a romantic situation the girl either goes hot and cold, gets gradually bored of me, or uses me. I feel like the work I put into my life makes me almost less attractive to many women, and my willingness to communicate and give love isn't even considered by women who initially see me in a romantic light. I'm their good little plaything, their toy, that they can just use and cast aside when someone better comes along.

I feel like a sexless automaton, existing mostly as a fly on the wall in a sea of courting but not really getting a chance to participate in it. I can get glimpses of what could be, and then it's squashed instantly. It's taking a serious toll on my mental health. I feel completely romantically unlovable, people want to be my friend but something about me just drives them away from developing a potential relationship.

In the winter I would take snow off her car and drive the way she would to the highway just to make tracks because plowing was not done yet. 

Well to sum it up quickly, I caught her cheating, now this is someone I thought I knew. 20 years, but when I expected something was going on I placed a recorder behind our headboard and when I was out she would be on the phone with him. 
Let me say that it felt like a knife was going through me when I was driving and listening to the first recording.  She tells her family it's not true and blood stick's with blood, but we try to be civil for the kids, but for some reason she counties to try and berated me in front of people.

I said hi and asked how they’ve been, and they told me about their summer so far. Then, they invited me to go to the library with them. We talked about our intended majors and how the orientation has been for them. After a while I noticed they didn’t seem to be interested in me. They didn’t ask what high school I graduated from or how my life has been going, and I don’t have any social media so they wouldn’t know. So I started talking about myself, but they started talking to each other instead. That was hurtful to me, though I figured they weren’t doing it intentionally. After a while they stopped talking to me completely and I was just trailing along. Eventually I left.

Idk, it sucks that the people I used to be close friends with didn’t care a single bit. They were my last friends I’ve had since I’ve been friendless these past 3 years.

924,DGW7601,1656131820,1,"Recently, I was between apartments, and during the few weeks in which I was waiting for my new lease to start I had a few friends from work generously allow me to stay with them.

On one hand, the mere fact that I had friends, who were nice enough to take me in like that, felt like testament to how far I've come in the last year; one year ago I was working a janitorial position, I never spoke to anyone at work, had no friends and no social life whatsoever, and life felt thoroughly pointless. I pretty much relied on superficial gratification (e.g. food, escapism through TV/film) for any positive experiences on a day to day basis. In the time since then I quit that job, started a new one, and now I have people who feel like true friends to me, something I haven't felt in a while. 

On another hand, said friends were a couple. During my time with them I was present whilst they engaged in their daily routines, in which they saw each other as intrinsic parts of each others lives. The activities they engaged in on a day to day basis were simplistic; mostly movies, occasional activities such as puzzles or board games, audiobooks, but even so, they seemed so very content.

I guess my point is that while I am extremely grateful to them for taking me in. and while I enjoyed their company during my time with them, it still stung to witness them sharing this mutual connection that I feel I will never get to experience myself. All my life, my social anxiety has only gotten worse and worse, and while as I established earlier in this post I have made some progress recently, I still feel as though I will never know what it's like to have someone to come home to and spend your day with, who sees you as an integral part of their life, just as intergral to them as they are to you. Such a feeling is one that I have yet to come close to experiencing, and as much as I want to, I fear I will never get to feel it myself.

I just finished graduate school and am looking for a job. I’m super excited to work until I die!! 

My dad is dying of stage 4 brain cancer. He was always the parent that I leaned towards because he was “reasonable”. 10 days after his first surgery, I almost found him in a coma. I told my mom to call 911 and that is the only reason he is alive today. He suffered a brain abscess, stroke, and bacterial meningitis. His high intracranial pressure alone could have killed him. Anyway, I bought him time and now watch him waste away in front of the tv, a very different life than what he is used to. 

My mother has not been supportive but how could she be. Her own sister is dying of stage 4 brain cancer too. She has been cold and distant to me. After school, she quickly cut me off financially. She is feeling strained too with all of my dads medical bills. My dad had been the breadwinner of the family all my life. He always took care of us. 

When she cut me off, it terrified me. I had some money saved up but of course with a masters degree I have loans to pay. I was stupid enough to go on a sugar daddy website where he gave me a few thousand dollars. A few dates later, after meeting his brother, I found he re-activated his account, looking for new girls. The money didn’t make the experience worth it. I thought meeting his family meant that I was somehow “special”. I wasn’t enough apparently. 

To be quite honest, I don’t have a boyfriend. I talk to friends but physically I can’t be close to them because they are far away. My father is dying. My aunt is dying. My mother takes her anger out on me. It has gotten so bad at home that I wanted to start sleeping in my car overnight. I feel like I don’t have much to look forward to.

I am bi-sexual and yet even having both men and women be a possible love interest to the shitty game i call life, i can't seem to find anyone.

I'm not cocky, but i don't think i look that bad at all but i guess I'm wrong. 

When it comes to friends, i have none. There's a story as to why on my profile if interested. I have been on reddit looking for friends and for dating (not just on reddit) for a while now and have had no luck. everyone wastes my time just to ghost me the next morning, or they even waste my time for multiple months of chatting. i am fine taking it slow, if you want to chat for a while first I'm all for it. but then when we decide to meetup all of a sudden I'm ghosted. 

I struggle with depression and social anxiety big time. but i have been working through it and unfortunately coming out of my bubble has seemed to make it so much worse. Online chatting is fun and all but i get bored of it. i like to be in person, hanging out with people, doing things. I like peoples company, it is very comforting to me. 

Something i have always wanted was a best guy friend. like a best friend that knows everything about each other, that hangs out on the regular, maybe even cuddle lol. Idk but at 23 i feel like this is an impossible thing to get.

I also became part of the family. His best friend, his baby mama and roommates all loved me. We had many nights just all of us hanging out. I loved him so much. But he said he didn't feel the same anymore and just ended it. I feel like I lost all of them. Like losing a family. I went through this before with my very first boyfriend as we were together seven years. I lost a lot then as well

So out of loneliness and wanting comfort I reached out to my ex before the current one. He is a manipulative narcissist. He caused a lot of mental trauma when we dated. But I just needed someone and he was still a friend. So we hooked up. And did a few times after that. Now he's not talking to me as he said I pushed too much. I will admit I did get a bit obsessive as I got caught up in the affection. It's better this way really as I shouldn't be with him again..but it still makes me feel unwanted

My friends were supportive with the breakup in the beginning but now since it's been a month it's like they don't care. I don't talk to them about it at all anymore really but they still don't text back often or even hang out with me. I really have no desire to make new friends.

1011,Sun2R1se,1656102772,1,"I’ve seen and had a lot of friends, and all of them were always cool and present and there. While when I was friend with them, they weren’t really there or present for me. They acted like I didn’t exist. I posted stuff on Wattpad, they barely watched it. When I posted announcements about MY mental health, they’d change it for theirs or just answer to a portion of it. My family is no better. My father doesn’t want me to show any emotions too loudly, else he’ll tell me to shut up and stop. It just ruined the moment. Then he will never apologize even if I told him he needed to, he never did and never will. 

Anyway, I just think that no one really truly cares, because when I say something about me or do something to help me or even trust someone, I just get shoved away, and they always listen to others and care about others. When I post something and someone else post something really similar, THEY get more attention than me, even though my stuff is better than theirs. Just because they’d know them for longer doesn’t mean to let down the new. This specific friend, that I had trusted over 4 times, succeeded in breaking it all the time, called me selfish for blocking her after I noticed that she didn’t care and it made me angry. SHE asked ME, no, ordered me and manipulated me to beg her to stay. She nearly killed me in the process. She doesn’t know or even understand, acknowledge that I got problems too. It’s not always about her. I’ve know her for 2 years. She always said sorry, I treated her with kindness and was there for her, but she never did the same. She never told me how she felt about me, and would later on treat me like shit because I didn’t acknowledge it, when I didn’t even know she had problems. Never asked her, and she never asked if I had. Now she thinks that she won, when she just lost someone, again. I stopped caring, but when I confronted her about not interacting with my stuff, she said I was supposed to do that, and she never interacted with mine in ways to help the non-existant-anymore relationship. I told her some wise stuff, that I acknowledge that I may had done some bad stuff, and to not do the same mistake as I did. She called me a hypocrite just for telling her that.

I know I talk a lot about her, since she needs to understand I’ve got feelings too. She probably never will since she think I’M the bad guy, when she is the one in the wrong.

Should have called everything off when I talked about having no friends and she laughed and said ""what do you mean"". Turns out I've learnt even more-so just what I've missed and being missing out on these past however many years. I mean, it's 3 decades where I can honestly say I've not had any friends (and even when I was 8 years old calling them friends would have been a stretch). Until last year I'd never had the opportunity to hold hands with someone who wasn't family. To be touched. To hope there was a chance I'd not be alone. But now, here I am. And it feels even worse, now to know exactly what I've missed out on. Exactly how broken and messed up I am that I can't even react well to being touched. I mean, how the hell am I even meant to move on from this, to actually try and interact with people when I know it's been so long that I can't even act normal in those situations.

Ages ago I made the decision on how I wanted to end it. Last year I checked the feasibility of it and felt incredibly sick upon doing it. A few weeks ago a cousin of mine killed himself. How it made me feel, what it did to his family, it just gave me second thoughts. But I really don't want to continue doing this. I don't want to continue growing old with absolutely no one and nothing. I don't want to continue looking around me, living life vicariously through the experiences and expectations of others. But it's a never-ending cycle. It's being stuck in the exact same hole and the only assistance you get from people is a new spade delivered to continue digging down because the old one got too blunt. And it's absolutely pointless posting this.

1024,TheQuietFury,1656100349,1,"Being a queer person of faith is a unique cross. As I grow older, I continue to feel great loneliness. I’m not wanted in the Church because I am sapphic, and the LGBTQ+ community does not want me because I am Catholic. No one wants me. I don’t fit in their assigned boxes. A few weeks back I experienced anxiety over going to Mass at a church - this was the first time I ever felt this way. It reminds me of when kids are at school and they’re having lunch in the cafeteria. One kid attempts to sit at a table only to be rejected by the other kids there saying, “Sorry, this seat is taken/You can’t sit here.” Luckily that Mass went well in the end, but I was scared I was going to hear something homophobic from the pulpit like I have before in that specific church. I don’t really have anyone in the Church to have that sense of community either. I am the only person in my immediate family that tries to practice the Faith daily. I don’t have family or friends to be a part of my faith community/journey. Even though I love my Faith - the Mass, the Eucharist, the Rosary, the Saints and Angels, the Holy Souls in Purgatory, Jesus and Mary - I really do feel that I am going through it alone. The LGBTQ+ community is the same. I have tried dating apps, I have tried going to Pride-related events, I have gone out once with a girl to see if there was a potential spark between us. None of these worked. Clubs and bars aren’t really my spaces - I’m not into alcohol or partying late at night — I am a young adult with the soul of a granny, lol. I am also scared of being roofied or harassed by dangerous people in these spaces. I also don’t do casual relationships. It’s just not built into me. I know there are queer spaces outside of bars and clubs, but they are hard to find. Dating apps are … a mess. I am almost 30 years old, and not once have I ever been in a romantic relationship. Never held hands, never been on an actual date, never kissed. 
For a long time I wondered if there is something wrong with me. Think about it: the entire world can’t be the problem of why I don’t fit in with any communities. I am the common denominator in all of this. I must be the problem. I have been to therapy, I have done self-reflection, I have been working on my shortcomings for a number of years. I sometimes wish I did not have these feelings for wanting to truly belong with a group or desiring to be in a relationship. I wish I could be content with how things are in my life. I sometimes wished too I could be like some of the Saints in my religion who could physically see Jesus and Mary and talk with them one on one. Maybe I would feel less lonely.
I typed this out in a bit of a ramble, so please excuse me if things seem a bit scattered. I needed to get this off my chest. Talking to family and people I am on good terms with doesn’t help. Thank you for listening. It really means a lot.",lonely,Sapphic + Catholic = Lonely,2022-06-25 05:52:29

The stress you are not under with clingy friends or a relationship that has gotten awkward, old or toxic.  Not to mention I only seem to meet toxic people.  

It just really ended any issues with depression when I gave up and just focused on making myself happy.  Eventually you just have to admit a lot of relationships are just based on situations that you may not be in. Nor is that relationship or friendship going to end your depression.

Another issues is that people are avoiding me like I did something bad , like criminal I never have bad intentions , but still sitting home alone , trying to find internet friends dosen't go thru , anxiety and depression is killing me , sometimes I just feel wanna kill my self , because I'm so alone even people around telling that you are beautiful to make me happy , but I don't feel that way. Also trying to have conversation with people they just treat me like child or idiot and pisses me a lot .. Anyways in three years I tried find help but it didn't shrink the issues I have , Asking my mom or father what is wrong with me , but they just saying oh ... you are going crazy , you are schizophrenic but still fighting back , because , they just wanna destroy me and feel so ignored . And starting to ask my sanity wtf is wrong with what I did wrong , maybe I'm sick have some diseases people just avoiding me as hell . Can you people of reddit tell me ?

My parents know I'm really capable and they are proud of me. 

I'm doing well at uni (and is free on my country so there isn't a monetary pressure), I do some programming on my free time.n and I have a small part time job, tha doesn't pay so much, but I cam study there and the horary is really good

My parents don't demand so much from me as long I study. But if there's something they keep asking and asking for is if I have plans for the weekends. For them, sitting behind a screen isn't a plan. I need to hang out with someone else, even if it's at home, but needs to be with someone else.

Last week I told them that I was free to do whatever I wanted with my free time. Their response was (not textually) : ""We know that you aren't a kid anymore and that you are free. We can't obligue you to do something you don't want. But isn't common for a guy of your age to lay on their bed, locked on their room with their phone and games the whole weekend. Is bright and sunny today. People of your age are having fun outside while you are here, arguing with us""

I can't hate them for calling me out because they are right. I'm wasting my youth on what? A bunch of pixels moving through the screen? There's no way I'm happy living like this. I'm not making significant connections, I'm not having fun, I'm not improving myself. I don't compare myself to others but I can't deny that people that hang out with others have a spark on their eyes that I don't have. 

I don't know what I will do this weekend tho.

1089,RealMrCommunism,1656060725,1,"I just feel like venting my life story, so here it is. My childhood is really fucked and no one believes me, and it’s okay if you dont!

But ever since I was a kid I remember my parents always fighting, and most of the time it’d get physical. Though I don’t remember my dad taking the offensive a lot. However when I was about 7, my parents were dirt broke and spent all their money on weed and some white powder, I don’t know if it was meth or what i’m not sure what those drugs look like. I even remember my dad taking back his birthday present to me so he could buy weed. 

But because we were dirt broke we always lived in a trailer without electricity half the time nor water. So we moved in with my dads mom who was recently married, though it only lasted a few months. I’m not sure why they divorced but the man stole my ipod and money I had saved up by myself. I remember he had a very nice car that my grandma wouldn’t let him have after the divorce so he hired people to stalk us and fire weapons at us. I’m not sure if they actually planned to hurt us,  but I can still hear the sound of them pouring gas on our trailer. I also remember my dad freaking out and yelling because apparently they shot a bullet through the window and it had a note that said they was gonna kill me and my siblings and make my parents watch. Or once they slashed our tires and while we was driving the next morning they actually fell off going down a hill and I remember my school bus passing them everyday. 
My dad couldn’t do nothing about any of this because he had a warrant and so did my grandma we was staying with.

Eventually because of all this, my moms mom who lived in another stayed adopted us in 2011 and we have been staying with her ever since. And I wish I could say my suffering ended there. 

She ended up being extremely strict, for example  and im allowed to have my license, or even go outside without her being right by me. I have not hung out with anyone outside school since december. Although I do have a car, I worked everyday to get that though I didn’t actually buy it. One day as I was working she texted me telling me she took MY money from my bank account, bought “my” without telling me about it, and put it in her name. She drives it more than I do currently. 
She also has a problem comparing me to other teenagers which makes me so insecure. There’s a girl across the street my age, and my grandma works with her mom and my grandma is asking me why can’t I be like her? Why can’t I have all As and already have college offers? I told her about my dream job once and she told me it’s stupid and i shouldn’t follow my passion for jobs. She is constantly putting me down and. have such bad social anxiety and low self esteem because of it. 

You’d think me and my siblings would be close from what we went through in our childhood? No. Both my brothers refuse to talk to me and regularly exclude me from plans though i’m the middle child and more of their age.

I don’t get what i did to deserve this?? At school and work no one talks to me anymore and my whole friend group constantly insults me as a “joke”. Even once we was making plans at lunch and someone said “No (my name) isn’t invited to any of this” and everyone agreed,RIGHT INFRONT OF ME.

Plus they refuse to acknowledge raising prices, keeping the wages as low as possible, yet rent as skyrocketed because dipshit fucks gentrificying the town. Needless to say most young people have left after being denied a meaningful career. I would say I am just a handful in this town. 

I have a couple of friends here, but they're a couple so they are always doing stuff on their own, can't blame though. DnD with them gets me through the week. But when I am alone, that is where it sets in. I'm not depressed per say, but definitely not happy. I live with my grandmother and her husband, who has dementia slowly turning into  Alzheimer's. He has his days when he is an angry person snapping at me for asking simple questions and be fine the next morn. I usually just confide myself to my room and listen to music or just play video games to waste the day until I go to bed.

I am working on my degree in paleoanthropology, basically researching our evolutionary ancestors. However, I have been openly mocked for ""believing"" in evolution and going to hell for thinking that, and I quote ""man is grandson of a monkey."" This attitude permeates this backwards town and I rarely ever want to venture out even for a quick trip to the grocery store. I barely wanted to get a job again, but money makes the world go round.

I gave up on the idea of dating here because all the girls here want to settle down, have several kids, and never venture anywhere away from their families. I want someone smart and open, someone to carry on a conversation with and honestly feel worth something.

I want to leave and find a new life, where I can honestly feel peace and educate others on our prehistoric history.

I love creepy videos on YouTube and general true crime or horror related stuff, or just educational rabbit hole content

I'm a bit of an anime nerd, I haven't watched anything recently other than demon slayer season 2, but my favs were devilman crybaby (mainly for the ost), jojos bizarre adventure, attack on titan, Erased and Made in abyss to name a few~

My fav music would be EDM, synthwave sort of music but I have several hundred songs on my playlist some artist that come to mind that I like are in no particular order  The weeknd, gorillaz, tame impala, porter Robinson, sáimes, basshunter and random game OST stuff like persona 5 or something haha

I'm currently play Lost Ark a bunch atm, but my fav games in general are dark souls borne + sekiro and elden ring stuff, god of war, monster hunter, final fantasy series in general, resident evil, persona 5 amongst other stuff, I also played runescape for years one of my fav childhood games

Also I enjoy art and creative stuff in general, mainly like colouring and lineart stuff so if you like to draw I'd love to see

I can't hold a friendship at all. No matter how much I try, no matter how much I work to be as cool, interesting, and funny as possible for them, they always run away. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Is this some sort of curse? Is that it? I'm just some placeholder friend, and now that they've found someone to replace me, I've been kicked to the curb once again. 

This is how it always goes: it starts off *great*, but then conversations turn to chit-chats, the hours spent talking turn to minutes, and slowly, despite how much I try to circumvent it, they ghost me. Not all at once, no, they drag it out for as long as they can until their three, two, one-word texts turn to nothing at all. 

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. I keep trying my best, I really am, but I can never breach just being an acquaintance or whatever the online equivalent of a school friend is. 

I just want a friend, a *real* friend, because all I've had for a year has been fake bullshit that all ends in the same way, but even when people from here reach out to me, asking if we can talk, I get so ungodly anxious and scared and all these billions of thoughts start swarming through my head about how I’m going to mess it up, so it never ends up turning into anything, but even then, if I did message back, it’d break off in a week max, because as established, there's just something wrong with *me*. Something I just can't pin-point, but I know is there.

fast foward our relationship a year, i watched a bunch of video about christianity and hell and it scared me to death and i became a hardcore christian. that ruined the relationship and my ex-gf left me because of that. i abstain from intimacy with her and she went to go meet someone else. 

so now fast foward to today im 33 years old and havent dated anyone since, and i kinda hate life now. and have nothing but regrets in my mind that im tormented with night after night and wish i would of done things differently but shes been out of my life for almost a decade lol and im still thinking about her like a loser.

1126,Pomegranatepirate_,1656046475,1,"So this is something that I haven’t talked to anyone about and I was wondering if anyone here has felt this. You know how sometimes the presence of a person feels lonelier than no one there at all? 

I was with this person for 2 years, and my family basically disowned me (straight up didn’t talk to me for 6 months and ripped me apart when I tried to reach out to them) because they didn’t like him. They insisted I was choosing him over them, that his family was “my new family” as my mom would say over and over again.

The truth is, I have no idea why my parents were so violently against me being with this guy. Our relationship started and I was dealing with their constant disapproval on a very intense scale. My boyfriend saw that and instead of assuring if i was okay, pushed me to do lots of things I wasn’t comfortable with. He would buy me tickets to go in trips with him without asking, just telling me I was going. 

I feel like my whole relationship with him was out of survival. I was in my last year of college, I didn’t have a job at the time, my family hated me (we had always be very very close), and this guy was acting like I needed him. 

I didn’t have a chance to think about him, but after breaking up, I did. My family immediately welcomed me back into the fold. Nothing was EVER said about my relationship… it’s almost like it never happened. It’s so weird.

But only after I broke up w him (I got sick and he kept pushing me to do things and I realized it was just not healthy) did I have the time to even think about him and who he was and what the hell happened in our time together. 

He was my first relationship… but I didn’t love him. I never got to know if I did because my brain was in so much shock from my family abandoning me. I just keep feeling like I was with him out of survival instinct.

I'd say I'm considerably closest to the couple in our group, but I feel like when I go to them about things, I'm third wheeling. I'm happy they're supportive, they care about me, and that they trust me with things. Though, they got each other and I know they discuss the things I tell them, so I feel like I'm being absorbed into their relationship, like I'm intruding on something. 

Talking to people hasn't gotten any easier either. I'm much better than a couple months ago. I've gotten back to a bunch of people, but chatting is such a chore. I hate dry texting so it takes a lot of effort to respond. Though, it sucks when that energy is not matched and they don't seem as interested as I tried to be. No one really checks up on me out of curiosity, they always need something. The sweetest thing in recent memory was my Japanese teacher installing a program on my chromebook to ask if I was okay and to let him know if there was anything he could do. Besides that, I literally trust no one. The one person I thought I could trust had gone behind my back to talk to my ex and it was such a big breach of trust that I don't see them like I did before.

It creates an unrealistic pressure to bind yourself to permanent ‘real’ friends in your late high school or college years and that’s what determines and social success. 
    What most people seem to forget is learning about themselves before learning about others. I (21F) am personally haven’t found anyone to continually make plans with, and I graduate next year. Despite two years of shifting to virtual learning, I firmly believe my ‘loneliness’ has more to do with my perpetual shift in interests. I haven’t found a hobby I can invest in long term, but I don’t think it necessarily makes me unlovable, just selective and independent. Does anyone else have trouble with long term investment or finding themselves?

First, I failed my first semester of my dream college, and had to drop out, on Christmas my Father passed away, and most recently my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. But, with all things, I can try to look at the good. College was giving me a ridiculous amount of stress, the most I’ve really had, and dropping out honestly was probably the best thing that I could’ve done. My father died happy, he fixed up some dumb family drama with my grandpa, fixed some friendships, was the most supportive he could be for my brother and I, and even said he was the happiest he’d been in a long time. Plus, he was born on Halloween, so I guess passing on Christmas was kinda…fitting, I think. And the girlfriend who broke up with me, she only did so, because she realized she was asexual and aromantic, so it’s not like she no longer liked who I was, she just realized she didn’t want to be in a romantic relationship with anyone. And now I’m at a job I very much enjoy, but…it just occurred to me today that I don’t want to not be in a relationship, but I don’t know what to do. Every relationship I’ve been in always started because a girl told me how they felt, and now that I’m single and out of school, I have no clue what to do. At all.

Alone, in a building, with my stuff, and nothing else. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to tell if someone likes me, and I don’t know how to tell someone I like them.

The hang-out part tends to break my heart as I often encounter them enjoying with others without my presence at all. And when I ask them if we wanna hangout together, they would give endless excuses like they are busy or if they have something else to do. Okay, but if they are busy, then why do you hang out with others? That itself isn't an issue. The problem is when you said you are busy, but you are hanging out with your other friends for fun?

She left me on delivered, so I gave her a few days to respond, and she didn’t. Fast forward, I just decided to text again to check up on her. I’m not sure why, but something told me to do it. When I did, she got mad, and accused me of “pressuring” her to answer. When all I said was “How are you? You left me on delivered.” So, she was like I don’t wanna talk about it and I obviously don’t feel comfortable. I stepped back and respected her boundaries. So I said “Okay, that’s fine. That’s all you had to say the first time. We’re not kids anymore you can communicate” to which she replied she doesn’t have to. Any other time something went wrong I was there to help her out. Now it seems like our relationship is reverting back to the way it used to be. She’s more distant and every time I call she doesn’t answer. I know somethings wrong and I don’t know how to help her.

No, people love the idea of me. Once I finally let them in, I am always just too much for them.

People take me for granted, use me, pretend they care about me until I have had enough and confront them so they find someone  who is quiet and stupid. When ever I do find someone who truly likes me for me, they rarely stay around for very long. Maybe it is because we are afraid we will hurt each other, or one is more domineering. It could be quiet possible one is not willing to blend in with the other as we tend to outshine every one. It does not matter though, we are a lonesome type of folk, always have been and always will be. Society was not made for people like me. So no, people do not love me, they love the Idea of me.

Uplifting as much as possible… then I will have one moment, one day, or a week where I am down and out. Where I need a friend, and not a damn one of them can be found.

It lasted an hour during which they talked about topics specific to them, memories they had with each other, with me having nothing to contribute.

I said 4 sentences in total. They replied to each of them which is good. It used to be that when I spoke it was awkward, glad this is no longer the case. Think before you speak unironically helps, I always spend a couple of seconds munching a thought in my head wondering if it's good enough to say and oftentimes it's not so I stay silent.

2 of the sentences I said were jokes. Both jokes got a laughter.

For a second I locked eyes with someone while he was laughing at my joke. Jesus Christ, is something so common for normal people supposed to feel this amazing? Someone liking what you said so much they are completely grinning, their face all brightened up looking at you. He probably forgot about this interaction 2 seconds after, meanwhile I'm teary eyes writing this paragraph.

You sit by the window and look outside, you see the beautiful sunset, sky colored in warm orange shades. You see people walking through the city, talking to each other, holding hands. 

You get a beer in a shop right next to the hotel, you don't look at anyone besides the vendor which you greet politely. You give her money, go back to the hotel and sit by the window and look outside again while sipping your beer.

And you can't help yourself but wonder: *How did I get here?*

You don't know, maybe you got old and as you know people drift away from each other with age. But you still miss those days when you didn't have to worry about anything, when talking to new people was easy and making connections felt effortless. You sigh, drink a bit and think to yourself you should stop with the pitying. But you just have to think: *Why am I even here? What am I doing?*

Sometimes you wish you could just quit everything and move away. Move to a little mountain city and do what you love.

You wonder if someone else feels this way. Maybe, just maybe you're not alone in your lonelines, for there is someone on the other side of the world, who's thinking about the exact same thing you do.

1228,ShopDrawingModel,1656008592,1,"Does anyone relate to my social struggles?

I’ve been really lost lately trying to figure out what could be the matter with me. I believe there has to be something wrong with me since by social life is greatly affected. Ever since I broke up with my boyfriend in November of 2021, I’ve been on my own. I feel horribly lonely again like I did before I met him (he was truly my only friend for 3 years). I have a very very hard time making new friends and communicating with people, and I attempted to write exactly why that is in detail. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist, she said it’s possible I could be Neurodivergent or autistic, but I feel like this one is a stretch, though it would be great to say that as I would have an excuse to be myself. I’ve also looked into AVPD but yet again I don’t horribly relate to it. And for the longest time I did not identify with social anxiety or phobia, I only believe I had social anxiety around the time I’m symptoms started, about 11 years old, but not anymore. I just don’t relate deeply with anything I read about and I really feel horribly confused, and sometimes I think I may just be making the problem up. One thing I do relate to is alexithymia, the inability to understand your own emotions, which makes diagnosing me VERY hard. I just want to know if anyone relates to my symptoms:

	I believe everything I think and say is either socially unacceptable* or very offensive. On top of this i avoid offending, challenging, debating, or provoking anyone at all costs. Therefore I have no thoughts when talking to people, my mind filters so much that there is nothing I can say**. I cant find a balance between things I actually want to say, and things that can be said. 

	To work with talking to people I have created a false personality. This is the result of my filters where I attempt to communicate with others in the most sensitive, unchallenging, passive, agreeable possible. I attempt to conform myself with whomever I am talking to as to not offend them. Sometimes I attempt to push my true self out of this facade, but It comes out disfigured. I try to reduce my thoughts into easily digestible sentences so I do not provoke anything from anyone. I have big grand thoughts I always recite and talk myself through almost constantly, but when I try to talk to other people about these things it’s horribly spoken. For example, I was talking to someone about consumerism, they admitted to being a consumerist. I said basically this “That’s so funny, I was talking too my parents about the same topic but they tried to say they weren’t consumerist, though they are. They’re just so stupid.” I feel horrible I said that about my parents, they’re good people. But I just had to push something out of my mouth, so I end up sounding stupid, and horribly spoken. 


*I don’t mean to say I’m basically itching to say the n-word at all times, I’m saying what I desire to talk about is not acceptable, mature, or appropriate. My topics differ from the rest

**I was talking to my friend, she blamed me for getting her sick all the time (i have tonsil problems she uses as the scapegoat), in reality she’s sick all the time because of her dogshit hygiene. In my mind I thought this, but it was not even a single option for that to ever be said out loud.

This isn’t the most encompassing description but I just need to stress I have NO CLUE what to say when speaking to people. All this conversation I do is exhausting and straining and when my one friend (I managed to make one friend) invites me anywhere or to do anything I dread it, because I know I’m going to be uncomfortable the entire time.

1242,voughtever,1656000839,1," I’ve been beating myself up all my life. I’ve disqualified myself, I hated myself for being antisocial, I’ve labeled myself as a social outcast.

But recent experiences with people have changed my opinion. People don’t constructively come to conclusion that I’m “introverted”, “odd”, “weird”, “antisocial” or whatever, after a fair evaluation. Instead, people think all these things about me in a split second after seeing me. These people can be someone I’m meeting through acquaintances or they can be complete strangers, who know nothing about me. I can clearly tell from their faces. This is not me projecting my inner thoughts.

They give me this disgusted/creeped out look immediately after seeing me, without my ever putting in an effort to talk/interact with them. This is a major hurdle for me that blocks me from making a good impression with anyone.

How can anyone make any progress socially if they’re outcasted at first sight. And if these people go on to become acquaintances, they always make sure to call me out every chance they get by saying “YoU dOnT tAlK eNoUgH”.

Well, how tf can I do that or why tf would I do that when you give me these disgusted looks in the first place?! And I’m not even half as bad looking as the people they hang out with.

And then they go on social media and preach bullshit that one shouldn’t discriminate based on looks and all that virtue signaling.

It’s not my fault I am antisocial. This is a consequence of how I get treated by everyone. Not the other way around. I should never have blamed myself for any of this.",lonely,Not my fault,2022-06-24 02:13:59

I was always arrogant ngl but till my 11th grade(15) I felt very confident and knew my arrogance could be backed up. I was good at studies, had girls crushing on me evwn though I was 5'4 and brown cause I was confident. Not everybody liked me but people liked me, its a fact that people like everyone who is confident enough no matter how much of a jerk they are. 
Then I moved to another city and there the people showed me my place they didn't know me so had no reason to be scared of me....but you know what they still liked my dgaf personality and like I said I was smart and open. But as time passed by I got concious about my behavior, started giving every single fuck there is to give.I started feeling guilty, and sad and everything bad.....I know it sounds ridiculous but it's true. The GUILT never left me till date. I lost my old personality, now I was an apologizing piece of shit. I started being nice.....tooo nice. And that's when my friend started bullying me. I faced harsh racism like really bad. Unlike USA where racism is serious in india its a joke. I was the joke of the whole damn school. I was never taken seriously. My opinions lost all meaning.... whenever I tried saying something I was brutally bullied. I became depressed stopped playing sports, became ugly as fuck and there started another wave of bullying. 
They didn't even leave my family, they said I looked like a laborer. They said my mom was a shemale. They said my dad must have been an electrician. They said everything to hurt me. But that makes anyone wonder why be so harsh on me. It's because I have the big ol anger problems, I reacted just the way they wanted me to react I tried to give a comeback bur I went south pretty soon. Infact they called dumb and chutiya so many times that I now believe that I am chutiya and now I literally am a dumb person. U talk to me your first impression will be that I am dumb. My words lost all its weight. 
After the Hell 2 yrs I grew so angry and defensive that I  was looking to protect myself from the slightest of the criticisms. 
When I got back to my old city I started mocking my old best friends and started attacking them for slightest of the jokes......and I lost them all 1 by 1.
That's when I realized they destroyed me. The old smart me was gone. I withdrew back from society so as to not offend any more people. I became lonely.
Now I don't have anyone to talk to. It's not like I tried but basically forgot how to talk to people. I just keep thinking what to say so that they don't get offended and I don't open upto them. They leave coz they can't keep up anymore. 
Now everyone can see I am destroyed emotionally so they don't talk to me. 
I am 20 yr old and I am mocked even by kids. I have 0 confidence.
NO CONFIDENCE BUT STILL ARROGANT AND ANGRY MADE ME LONELY.
Everyone make fun of me. I just have so much to write this will not finish.... 
I could write another 300 words in here
Under this column 
 Here are some of my stories how people treat me:
1) At new years party I was the butt of a joke I dont remember about what and everyone was laughing at me and I suppose I took it as a joke as well.

I'm currently going to be a senior in college and about to get my degree very soon which should be great but in reality I feel very isolated. Friends I used to hangout with, play videogames with, talk to and just be cool with have just been nothing but people I know. Sure, I don't have any bad beef against them but I just can't seem to relate to them or have a full conversation with them without feeling like a third wheel in the process. I can't relate to the topics they talk about anymore nor can I just enjoy anything they do. As for other friends, it seems like they disappeared entirely. It's sad to know that once great friends have just disappeared by their own schedules, goals, etc... I'm not mad about it cause it happens, but it just feels like I got forgotten in a way. Although I can text them whenever I want, I just don't anymore cause I kind of lost energy and faith in them responding to me at all. As for my parents, I would never have thought of the day where I would straight up resent my parents and just lose some connection to them compared to earlier years. Now days, they either complain about work or people in said work, or they just can't understand some conversations I have with them. Also it doesn't help that I need to care for the since I'm the only child, meaning I must dk whatever to please them in the end of the day regardless if I like it or not. In a way, I just can't see them the same way like I used to, which makes me want to isolate myself from them. As for people in general. I'm introverted so I'm already pretty low when it comes to social skills, but it seems whenever I try to put in the effort to get to know someone, they either blow me off or just treat me like shit in the end. In that sense, I just deny people everywhere I go. I don't accept their kindness at all cause I feel like it's a trick or just to fuck with my mind. At this point, I only trust myself, which is a bit sucky cause I want to know new people and also maintain the relationships I've already had with friends and family. But it just doesn't work and I just feel lonelier each day. Although I am depressed about it, I don't cry or feel any other emotion cause I sensitized myself to not feel emotions. I just accepted it because it's much easier to move on with my own life lonely then to dwell in the loneliness.

I'm 18 yo and when I look around i see people roaming around in groups, have good friends and great network in general.

Somewhat somewhere I want that too but mostly i don't want friends. Weird i know.

The problem is about 5 months ago I shifted to new city to attend uni and I currently live away from my parents and with 2 roomates. 

My other two roommates are social butterflies and pretty too. I realised that when I wasn't surrounded by people I never cared about not having friends.

But now as I see them having friends, being wanted by many I kinda want that too.

It feels really weird and sad to roam around everywhere alone all by my own, not having anyone to share what happened during the day or anything in general.

I will not lie and say to you I am no longer dealing with depression but I have learned some things in that time. One - look around you . Maybe this won’t apply to EVERYONE (And trust me there was a point in my life I didn’t have anyone in reals life in my day to day to turn to and talk to) but it helped me in my situation. There were people who I was friends with who love to see me and appreciate me who I was ignoring because I hated myself so much I thought everyone else must. I have had lovely experiences once I open up . Two - don’t be afraid to make a big change. I’m moving back to the city I’m from to be closer to family. I long for the day maybe I won’t live alonebut until then I know I’ll be near loved ones and I’m never far from human contact . I’m still dealing with depression and suicidal ideation but I also am making an appointment to maybe even get on some medication and /or talk to someone who can help me. My point is to look towards the future and make whatever small, positive changes you can now . It is hard the past couple days I work nights and on my days off I see myself slipping into sleeping 18 hours , eating bad, crying when I wake up etc but I am wanting to work so hard to do what it takes and I have hope .

I lost my job, lost my ""friends"", I've been dealing with online harassment. I just wanted to escape and try to act like I was worthy of love, so I redownloaded tinder for the first time in several months. It never works out for me- only ever get straight dudes (despite being a gay man), men trying to cheat on their wives, or guys looking for hookups and nothing else. Same goes for every dating site/app I try.

But okay, I redownloaded it. Actually got match within a few hours. Bisexual guy, okay that's great! Not another straight dude. We chat, we're hitting it off. Asks for my number, I'm not really ready to give that up yet (you can find a lot of info with just a phone number). Asks if we can meet, I say okay, as long as it's somewhere really public because I have a history of being assaulted many times and severe PTSD from it.

He suggests a park or a nature center..... that's. Not really public. He suggests walmart. I've been assaulted in a walmart, you're pretty much alone in most of the aisles. He brings it back to a park, says ""well a public park is pretty public"". I point out that most of the time you're walking trails at a park, you can't see other people (pretty much all our local parks cut through woods). Also been assaulted at parks multiple times.

He says ""well I'll tell you something I usually wait to share until after the first date. You can use it as collateral if I try anything and it might make you feel better if I share"". He gives me his last name and tells me to google him.

So I google him.

He's a fucking REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. I tell him sorry, no can do. He says, ""this is why I don't like sharing. I like people to meet me first so they can get to know me and I can tell them my side. I guess this isn't one of those times."" This fucker is an RSO because he raped or molested a 9 year old girl when he was 21. There is no ""your side"" in that situation, especially not when you're talking to a CSA victim/survivor.

I dealt with enough pedos in my teens, and even had a long term relationship with someone who ended up being a pedo and only ever loved me because I was a minor when we started dating (he stopped loving me when I turned 18, by his own admission).

I just wanted to feel attractive. To feel lovable. But instead, the only match I made was a fucking pedophile. Why can't I just feel like someone wants to be with me? It's been years. I miss being told, ""I love you"", even if it's empty. At this point, I'd even take another abusive relationship if it meant not being fucking alone anymore.

I (21F) have a friend(20) who is LGBTQ+. We’ve been friends since high school and I honestly don’t know how because we have literally NOTHING in common. I think it’s because I was the only person who listened to them when they talked because I was too polite not to. The only remote sense of relatability is that I thought I was LGBTQ+ too at the time and I’ve changed since then. The thing is, this person is toxic. Meaning that if I told them that I no longer identify as LGBTQ+ that they’d make fun of me or disown me…etc bc I’m straight. Not only that but they’ve never ever been there for me in any sense. I told them I was going through a tough time and they just replied “F” as if it was a joke and nothing else. I used to have very bad social anxiety which has since gotten way better and I would stumble over my words when trying to talk to strangers. One time we were out ordering food and when I ordered, I stumbled and it got a little awkward and she made fun of me all day about how awkward I was and stuff I thought they were just bugging me but they still mention that til this day and this happened 4 years ago!!! they act like I’m still that way and that I haven’t changed. I have mentioned countless times that I don’t like that, yet they continue because they act like they’re better than you. Everything is always about them and I find myself avoiding their calls and not wanting to hang out with them.

1303,Darryl_0220,1655959246,1,"Around 3 years ago, I became depressed and started using self-harm as a coping mechanism. At the time I was bullied in school and faced some trouble at home from my folks because of behavioral issues at school. When COVID hit, I became very isolated and struggled with speaking about my emotions. I tried to kill myself for the first time, but it was quickly thwarted when my father came in and stopped me. I got a psychologist and was diagnosed with MDD and anxiety, and was prescribed medication which I took for around 9 months before I stopped. At that time, I looked towards weird apps (Yubo, Discord, Wizz) to meet older women that made me feel valid. There was one girl, in particular, I consistently talked to, who would ask me for phone sex, nudes, etc. She would praise me as an amazing guy one day and scream at me over the phone how I wasn't shit the next. It took a big toll on my mental and impacted my mental health at the time. As the world began to re-open, I found myself entering the ninth grade at a new school, and met this person within the first week. We talked for a few days and they seemed cool and told me a lot about their past experiences and trauma. They invited me over to their house to study with them, and when I came over we ended up going for a walk and watching a movie. On the walk, I felt comfortable and opened up about my past experiences of feeling used. They acknowledged this, and told me how sorry they felt and whatnot. Later while watching a movie, they made a move on me and asked me if I wanted to have sex. Being the scared little virgin I was and not wanting to fuck up this moment, I blurted out yes. Afterward, they completely ghosted me, bragged to all their friends about how good it was, and refused to address the fact until many months after. Events like that and many others have made it hard for me to trust others, and it's seriously taken a toll on my mental well-being. I have awful mood swings, I can't stand abandonment, I constantly flip between loving and hating people, and do whatever impulse tells me. These things have put me into dumb situations, such as trying to kill myself during school, having reckless sex, and cutting off all my friends at a moment's notice.

Things are so quiet all the time. No text messages. No phone calls. I initiate everything in the hopes that maybe someone will stick around. It really sucks, seeing as so many people I know get on with their lives and find happiness. 

I don’t know what I need out of life, but the quiet contemplation of it all is really sad. Im so incredibly lonely all the time, even in the company of strangers. Nobody really knows who I am or cares to really ask, and every night I go to bed lonelier than ever.

Please do not bother to say anything if its like ""just eat less"" or anything similar since the time for that is long past. I can almost directly correlate my loneliness with the last 2 factors I stated. When I was a teenager I had lost around 70 pounds and had gotten in good shape and after that had an exponentially easier time with meeting people and having social and romantic relationships, it was a very drastic change in what I had experienced before which I was largely ignored and hardly anyone talked to me. Anyways, over the last 5 years I had slowly gained the weight back and then some where I now weigh 20 pounds more than the heaviest I was as a teenager and now im back to being largely ignored and hardly anyone talks to me. Which all of that has also turned me somewhat bitter since I know the reason for what has happened to me, and I wasted far too much time just trying to power through my BED and just lose some weight which never happened and I just kept gaining.  Basically the point of this is that my obesity and BED has propelled me far into loneliness that was not an issue when I was in better shape and better looking.",lonely,"Loneliness, Obesity and Binge-eating disorder",2022-06-23 14:31:59

They are mostly written by men. Not a bad thing at all. I’m curious to read responses from men and women. Maslows theory suggests that humans have a “hierarchy of needs” which include basic needs such as food water and shelter but it also includes more complex things like love and belonging. My theory is that the only flaw within this system is that the more complex things are toward the top of the pyramid. Less important. The most basic needs occupy the most space.I don’t think that’s always true. Not everyone has the same needs For instance you could have an intense need for love and belonging but your need for food/water is not as urgent as others. You may need respect and recognition. But security isn’t as important. Sex aside, How important is intamacy/ physical touch to you and why or why not.",lonely,Lonely hearts club.,2022-06-23 14:26:09

I think of fire and the color black a lot. Black feels like a filled space, an occupied area. You can’t color over black, or stain it’s hue. It’s always black, because it refuses to be tarnished.

1314,bouncing-boba,1655957989,1,"TW for brief mention of light drugs and alcohol.

I’m going through Zoloft withdrawal and it’s a nightmare. I can’t stop crying. Every day is just a schedule chock full of constant bawling. I’ve started crying at work, while driving. I can’t have productive conversations sometimes, because I get emotional and my throat swells and my nose stings and I can’t speak. 

I feel so so so alone.

I’m also experiencing relationship issues right now, but I don’t want to face them because then they become real. I can’t even make myself specify what it is I’m this post because it don’t want to come to terms with my problems. However I feel about is probably being amplified a hundred fold by my withdrawals though. Or maybe I’m just telling myself that as a way to comfort myself.

My primary coping methods have been posting to different relevant subreddits when it gets really bad. And crying, and crying and crying and crying. I’m not much of a drinker and ever since a disassociation episode I had a few weeks ago I’m afraid to smoke weed, especially alone.",lonely,Can’t stop crying,2022-06-23 14:19:49
1315,QuiverinPumpernickel,1655957634,1,"Have been married for over 5 years now, together for 10.  Things were great or at least I thought so.  Felt like he was there for me although most times I was there for him when it came to normal everyday adult duties which he was never openly thankful for.  I get the groceries, bills, clean, I'll be cleaning up for his D&amp;D group tomorrow as usual since he works before then.  Not sure why it wouldn't occur to him that he could clean the prior day after work.  I'm expected to after I work sometimes for his friends.  He has ADHD so this stops his motivation to help unless asked.  At least that's what I have gathered.

He has a whole group of friends that come over every Friday in our very tiny apartment.  I'm not in this group nor was I invited.  Also, wouldn't feel comfortable with the people in it but they are kind to me when they come over.  I sit in the backroom while they play and most of the time I can't find anything to do so I load up on pills to sleep through it.  This is every Friday.

Whenever I bring up something to him he can't handle it.  Instead of looking at my concern in any way, he turns to self hatred.  Even with the smallest things.  And we barely already talk normally so it's not often that things are brought up.  When they are it's something that we need to discuss before it poisons our relationship because I'm hurting or he's hurting.  His response is usually ""I'm a piece of shit"", ""I should die"" ""Look what I do to us I'm worthless"". Then he sometimes self harms himself with lighters or hits himself. Then I assure him that he's a good person, has friends, he's funny, quirky, I appreciate him and etc.  When I cry from feeling hurt, over half the time I don't get any warmth, I'm left to sit in my sorrows and spiral with my worries.  While he thinks about himself. 

I am left feeling so alone, even more alone than when I lived by myself.  I suppose I had friends then but still it's way more intense.

I have been trying to make friends but it's hard with my social anxiety, PTSD, I don't know when it's time for me to leave someone's house and idk how to entertain anyone at mine.  It also makes me uncomfortable having people here but I want my husband to have people and to be happy with what he loves.   I'm also afraid to drive.  

The friends I do make are usually big triggers to my anxiety and they don't always seem like safe people.  There's a girl that would love to be my friend but she has BPD and has gaslighted me at work a couple times.  Sometimes I'm tempted to bring her into my life just because I feel so alone and she is so weird so she gets me. She's also very involved in some heavy drugs and is a hypersexual.  I'm going to try my best to stand clear for now but she would listen to me more than my husband would.  It's like my husband isn't equipped to deal with large emotions or conflict.

Idk sometimes I think about getting VR chat but I can't afford the equipment and my computer sucks.  We're about to be tight on money too since he got a job that pays less because Amazon was ducking him up mentally.

I also don't have family to go to. My mother is a narcissist and my dad is in fully controlled by her.  She even looks at his phone and answers texts for him.

 I just feel so alone and scared that my stomach knots.  As someone with ASD it's nice to have a safe person.  Right now I feel naked and messed up 
 
The marriage could be doomed but not sure yet.  Just scared that I will be left with nothing.  Right now I haven't talked to him for a good day because I feel like I have nothing positive to say and I don't want to bring up our fight last night.  He came home from work like normal, laughing at YouTube videos while I looked hurt and gagged.  It wasn't until I started crying later when he got angry and slammed shit then grabbed a beer.

Just popping my lorazepam now and sitting in the dark with my phone because it's all the comfort I can think of.",lonely,Lonely Married 36 y/o female with ASD,2022-06-23 14:13:54
1316,josephl1995,1655957394,1,"College senior. Have had my job lined up in my hometown for long enough that its the reason I went to college. Which mind you is an hour away. This is the first summer of my life I've experienced this. 

I've had about 5 friends here since kindergarten. All of them are in different states. Next 5 less close friends. All gone aswell. My siblings, gone. Very close cousins of same age group, gone. It makes no sense. All my friends from ""home"" and family either moved out to work or stayed at school for the summer for the first time. Yet all my friends from school except 1 went home for the summer.. Girlfriend went home and never get to see her because we work so much so far away. 

Holy fucking shit man. I've had some dark depressing years in my life but this tops them all. I have always been very, very social and go out even on weekdays after working 10 hours and knowing I have to be up at 5 am. Used to fish a ton with my buddies after work. Now I just go to the gym when I get home then lay in bed. I know it's temporary pain but Holy crap it's hell. I dont do social media or phones much and I hate texting and calling so ""long distance relationships"" are just essentially no relationship at all. Feel like I've lost my entire social and love world and feel trapped by having a girlfriend I can barely communicate with or see. I really like her but I need some social aspect of my life and a woman I could actually be with right now would be so nice. 

How do yall cope with this? I know I'm strong and I'm fine but I just can't eat due to no appetite and I burn so many calories at work. I am ""fit"" but I have no weight to loose and I've been trying to gain it for years with very very hard earned and minimal success. It's just so depressing and disheartening. 

Not sure if anyone will read this or care but I just needed a quick vent.",lonely,First time truly experiencing loneliness...,2022-06-23 14:09:54

I even looked at selling them. But I’ve decided to go instead. I don’t get invited to things often and I don’t want to not go and risk never being invited again.

I’ve never felt so alone and confused. If they’re such close friends, why don’t they ever talk to me?

1327,Tripwire86,1655954834,1,"TL/DR: Married, but am strongly attracted to a friend. No longer in love with my wife, but don't know what to do.

I'm 35/m, married but separated. We have a 10 mo old, been married for 6 years. At first everything was okay. Shortly after we goot toogether I started to notice her convos with her friends were being hidden from me. Nudes being sent, etc. I even destroyed a laptop i bought for her by putting my fist through the screen. Fast forward a few months, I began to notice she was putting on a mask when we would go to church.

We had a bumpy road a while back. She had a surgery that severely strained our income and ended being evicted. We split across country to start fresh in AZ where my parents live. I soon learned that was a mistake. My parents nearly divorced because of the differences with the wife.

We left on as best terms I could negotiate and ended up in Florida with her folks. Been here for going on 4 years, met some good people and some bad ones. I had a falling out with her family which nearly landed me in jail. I lost my job as a result. We managed to bounce back, but I've had enough if the lies, drama, and lack of humility I was witnessing in my wife. This came to fruition in February. Wife is at her mom's with the baby and is trying her damnedest to turn herself around.

A couple months ago, a mutual friend of ours plead for my help when dealing with a bad divorce. It had been revealed she has had feelings for me since we met, but i never caught on. We'll refer to this friend had T. T and I let our emotions spill that night and we began to talk daily. Her divorce was finalized earlier this month and somethings changed. We had agreed not to act on anything since it was too soon and I'm still married.

I have every intention of being there for my daughter, even if her mom and i split. And wife knows this. T has reverted back to her long hidden rebellious activities of sleeping around and leaving guys she begins ti feel any attachment to to protect herself. We've established it is a phase but there's no telling how long it will last.

T knows the gravity and genuine nature of how I feel about her and is content on not hurting me by acting on those feelings. We still speak daily. She's always known how to read me, even when I don't say anything. Something my wife could never do.

I'm asking you all for advice, not judgement. 

What should I do? I feel a strong bond with T and don't want to spoil anything we currently have as friends.",lonely,Broken and Lost,2022-06-23 13:27:14

1332,Closemyeyesnstillsee,1655952404,1,"Hey! I’m a 21 year old woman and I haven’t been in a serious relationship for about 5 years now. Not that this is a bad thing at all, I really value my time and don’t want to settle for something. Just how I am. 

The last “relationship” I had wasn’t very serious. He couldn’t commit, but at the time I was okay with that because I wasn’t over my ex and I was very vulnerable and needed something to pass the time while I healed. He was fine with that. More than fine with it. That arrangement was started by him anyway. 

As I healed, I had to cut it off because I started wanting more for myself, he knew this because eventually I did tell him I wanted more for myself and I realized down that road that he was okay with stringing me along as long as possible for free sex. I tried talking to him about it civilly, but he just wasn’t very good at communication so I had to cut it off myself. 

Anyway, so I cut it off! I was super proud that I came so far and was actually ready to date again and get back out there with nobody holding me back. Then I realized, two years later, still haven’t found anybody that sparks my interest. Nobody at all. I’ve met attractive men here and there, talked a lot with a bunch of different people. Flirted, got numbers etc. It was fun for the first year and a bit, but in total I’ve been single for 5 years now. 

I took about two years to heal from my ex, and I ended my fwb relationship after another two years. But somehow I’m even looking back on a fwb because that was the best I could get. Pathetic, I know, I know. But a whole two years of  socializing, trying apps, hitting bars, dming new people and nothing?

I don’t know. I guess I’m frustrated that nothing works out and since nothings been working out my past situation starts looking better and better day by day. I’d never go back to it, but I find myself idealizing it. Making it way more than what it was.

Because truthfully even though that was less than the bare minimum, I haven’t found a guy in over two whole years that could provide anything more than that. I’m just frustrated. It’s scary and confusing. I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t hurt from time to time. I’m a very particular person though, so maybe that’s the problem. 

As of now I’m not dating at all. I just have fun/work/do my hobby’s to pass the time. I’m working on my businesses and starting to wrack up clients so I’m pretty happy with my progress. But there are days where this feeling is etched so far into my head. But at the same time I have no energy to go date. Not anymore anyway, I still talk with men but if it goes nowhere I don’t get sad about it or whatnot anymore.

I just don’t care. Because it’s not like they sparked that light up inside of me again. I’m not really losing anything if it doesn’t go anywhere. Nobody excites me anymore and I think I just miss that. Maybe I’ll never find that again and I’ve just gotta be the one to continue to excite myself. I don’t know, sorry for the rant. Hopefully some of this is making sense. 

It’s very weird because I can catch myself exactly when I’m idealizing things and it makes me wonder if I even were to find somebody right for me if I could even realistically handle it? I’ve been single so long I really don’t even know if I could. It’s been so long that part of me can’t even see myself being a real girlfriend again. It sucks because it seems living in my head is almost better than reality could ever be, even if I do get what I want someday. It’s just been that seemingly long for me. 

But anyway, this was a weird jumble of thoughts I just wanted to throw into the void. I’ll be okay regardless, that much I know. I just wish I had some answers I guess.",lonely,Why does nobody excite me anymore?,2022-06-23 12:46:44

I know life is all about living and learning from mistakes and well everything especially with people and people will come and go in our lives no matter what but even so I still feel very sad, depressed and anxious about it.

1347,lotusflower40,1655947096,1,"I am married, have 2 kids. One is 16 and not at all a troubled teenager. One is 4, hence, the never alone part. I am not depressed right now, although, I was depressed for many years. When those dark clouds where above me, I was disposed of by so many “friends “ and even by my husband. When I was no longer a fun time, it was lights out… end of the party… end of the road for these relationships…
I am soon to be 40, and it has taken a lot of self love, some therapy and self healing to be where I am today. I have a good sense of who I am as a person. I am comfortable with being alone, as a matter of fact, I enjoy being alone sometimes, but rarely get the break I need to have that. 
My husband is a good person, although in the past, he has cheated on me in the most humiliating kind of way. I chose to forgive, and I gave us a chance to rebuild our relationship. As I rediscovered myself, so did he. He re discovered me, we have never been better as a couple. But forgiving doesn’t mean you no longer have triggers. It doesn’t mean that certain situations make you uncomfortable and bring you back to what has happened. I have worked hard on not going back to the past on our arguments, I have never brought his infidelity into an argument. For all I know, he does regret his actions and is taking steps to being a better person. Or rather, to act in more skillful ways. 
However, I can’t open up to him, I can’t feel sad around him, especially if my sadness is related to a trigger that reminds me of the past. He immediately takes a defensive stance and it’s no longer about me and how I’m feeling, it becomes about him … so, I can’t be vulnerable, I can’t open up… I have to constantly wear this mask… because at the first sign of sadness, he immediately goes back to the time I was depressed and he absolutely hates, loathes that “me”. 
I have no friends, today I decided to cut from my life the last “friend” left . She like many others, became a toxic presence. Someone who is always ready to take, who is never open to meeting me halfway. Getting together has to always be at her house, in the last year and a half, she came to my house 2x. Both times for a party… I, on the other hand, have been to her house countless times… Today she texted me saying she was going to a concert, 20 min away from my house, and when I asked her why she didn’t let me know about , since she knows I would have loved to go, she says: “ I forgot about you”. So, farewell my old friend. I wish you well, but can no longer have you in my life.

Whenever we meet up its only to go out drinking and when ever that happens its me who has to make the inital contact to see who is around. (We only go drinking because my friends have no other hobbies and its honestly my only outing)  Last weekend really annoyed me because i asked on the saturday morning was anyone around and no one relpied untill one of my friends replied around 7 that night to say he wasnt and then right after he replied the rest of them did with the same answer, meanwhile all of these friends have no issue responding to messages about stupid things like love Island or other trival matters to my other friends in the chat.  One example of how why i am so annoyed recently is a friend of mine who dissapered for 2 years with a girl he was seeing, (ie spending all his time with her) broke up with this girl and one of my close friends has been messaging him and being all buddy buddy with him yet i have been there the whole time and he just ignores my plans i try to make.

I feel like I have wasted years with these frineds who do nothing, for instance im into photography, cars and gaming, and i have no frinds to share these hobbies with. Everything I do i do on my own and for years I though it was because me being soicialy awkward but I feel its because I have no connection to any of my friends. What makes matters worse is Im getting older (28) and Im afraid that if i drop these frinds and try find new ones and fail i will have no social life and in turn not find someone to date, marry have kids with and ill live alone forever.

He then tells me how a very close friend of his (female who is like his sister) is constantly trying to set him up with girls and how he’s always getting girls interested in him but they’re just not his type and he’s not really looking for a relationship and whatnot. He’s around the same age as me but he’s in good shape and stuff too but when he said that it just made me feel even more self conscious than I already have been.

Socializing is no issue, for me the issue is continuing the relationship, making it something more than ""just seeing and chattin"".

We were long distance, but had met many times and plans to move in together were talked about. She started out wonderful. However, she started to slowly change. I still dont Know why she did, but It started subtle with her becoming toxic in video games. Then it started bleeding out into real life and in the end she became a monster. But I loved her enough to at least try to stay even if she hurt me. 

I am a passionate man, and I try my absolute hardest to make my partners feel loved. I would bend over backwards if it makes whoever I love smile. And having been miserable alone, I realize how big a part my partners happiness is of me.

Making my partner feel loved drove me to be better. I made sure to wake up earlier to make sure I could write good morning to her. I would make sure to write goodnight and that loved her when she usually went to sleep and so on. 

And now, I have noone. I have noone to tell that I love them, noone to cuddle, noone to love. And I miss it desperately. I dream of mundane lovers stuff like going for walks or just cuddling on the couch.

However, the point of this post; I miss her in Some Say. Even though she ended up horrible, even thiugh She hurt me I am so miserably lonely that i have caught myself wishing I didnt cut myself loose from her, and that hurts me because I know its wrong. I try to keep it out of my head but when I wake up alone in my empty silent apartment it is hard to drown out.

She took my self worth, and I hate myself too much to allow myself the hope of someone loving me again. I want it desperatly but I dont know how when I cant stand myself.

Unfortunately, all I am so far is lost, lonely, and prone to end up with situations such as people expecting too much from me, or abusing my kindness and since i dont feed on attention so im not the type to have people text me out of the blue.

I could end the loneliness by finding a gf (and im apparently seen as an attractive guy) but everytime i try i just feel nothing, no attraction, nothing even when the girl has made it obvious to me and she's good looking and nice. It hurts me to see how numb I have become in that sense.

I guess I should be more grateful for the things I do have but it doesn't stop me from feeling like I have no one to turn to.  


I have tried making friends but lately that has been tough.  After my loss it was hard to trust guys and it has always been easier to be friends with women.  I guess it is because of the trauma and for some reason I have it in my head a male friend would let me down.  My wife knows I am better friends with women and understands but even with that it is tough to make friends these days. It gets rather lonely having no one to share with.  I mean I have my wife but you know somethings you just don't talk about.  Does anyone know what I can do just to feel normal?

I don’t have any close friends and don’t have any females my age who I talk to much at all anymore, despite my efforts. I just need friends, a mix of gender would be ideal but I feel like I need at least one close female friend. 

I’ve found it near impossible to meet new people ever since I graduated last year. I’m now in a construction job, there’s very few people my age, and the ones who are live 45ish mins away from me.

The girl I’ve been head over heels for for the last 6 years doesn’t like me back and we’ve gone from being close friends to not seeing each other in eight months because we’re busy. 

There’s no one who’s my age at my church. Almost everyone is older, like mid 20s at the youngest, and the only younger ones are kids. 

I don’t even know where to go to meet new people, other than the bar, which for me (as a devout Christian) is not a good setting. 

I’m also not a fan of online dating sites such as Christian Mingle because I don’t want to jump right into dating, I want to grow our relationship slowly first. 

Disclaimer: I’m not exactly an attractive person.

I have been wound up in hookup culture for years, and refuse to blink an eye at a relationship. I tell myself I don’t want that commitment so young but god I miss being in love. 

I am so scared I will get hurt again though. I hate waiting for replies, or arguing or anything stupid relationships suffer. That’s what I want to
avoid. But I miss having someone who genuinely loves me. Not just wanting me for a while then playing me.

I just want proper real love so bad but I have no faith that I will find it without being hurt and heartbroken 50 times first. I can’t handle rejection or being hurt, it’s too overwhelming and my emotions are always too strong. So I avoid that by having one night stands but it never really feels whole does it.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured i would just continue writing, the rant somehow helps and i got a few reactions and i don’t know. Thought today id write a bit more about my childhood and growing up quite isolated. 

&amp;#x200B;

**God.**

As a Jehova’s witness all i would hear growing up was “the end is neigh” repeated over and over again, i was not to be ”part of the world” friendships with people that aren’t witnesses is and was actively discouraged, i didnt go on school trips, birthday’s, christmas celebrations or anything else for that matter. And as a single child this meant that i grew up completely isolated, though still going to school but as you are thought to isolate yourself even when surrounded by people it didn’t do me much good. God was to be put on the first place always, something bad happened ? Your fault, something good happened ? Blessing from god.   


**Misguided.**

I was made (I didn’t know this was possible) to hate people other then our “brothers and sisters in christ” some of these misguided things :   


* Homosexuality = bad
* Sex = very bad
* Education = uneccasary
* Other religions = misguided
* Other views of the world = inspired by satan
* The world - About to burn 

&amp;#x200B;

**Abuse.**

As a young one, I couldn’t disagree or not go to gatherings or church meetings so you will. But as a child sitting there for two hours in silence just wasn’t going to work, so i would make noise, I couldn’t pay attention to 2 hours of drilling on about how bad the world was and how happy we should be.   


So i would draw, write, make noise, you know, kids stuff. As we would always sit front line in the meetings i would then subsequently to my behaviour get dragged to a smaller room in the back, dragged along on average 200/300 people. In the back my dad would Spank me, i would obviously scream louder, and then i would stop and we would go back and all is well that ends well.. in their opinion, and since everyone seemed to be fine with it, what was i going to do about it ?   


This went on for years, my dad was a very aggressive man, lots of fighting and shouting. Until I physically became to big to be bullied around. My mother was complacent and just went along with it. Not out of fear but out of a misguided sense of “this is good”.   


**Moving.**

After moving halfway around the globe with my parents (this was their choice, i was a minor so no chance for me to get away) i went and worked and lived with my aunt. This was after failing school in an unspecified south american country. My aunt was a very sweet woman and i was finally awarded some freedom, as soon as i turned 19 i moved back to the country i came from And left my parents behind. They would soon follow back but i no longer had to live with them and went to my grandmothers.   


**In the next episode :**   
From here on i would go on to be part of “the world” and society. A lot of school, drinking, depression, a child, attempted larceny and more ensued.   


p.s As i write this, i notice that this writing down and sending it into the void that is the internet I find place for reflection, it helps. Again i thank whomever find and took the time to read to this point, and please do leave a reaction, ask questions or whatever you so please.

1458,genuinefriendship,1655885262,1,"I feel like I just can't find my place in life. I'm settled, but unsettled. I'm married, have kids, a paid off house, paid off vehicles, self-employed and have talents in the arts. I'm not rich by any means, but I've always been a frugal person, lived within my means and used my money relatively wisely to achieve the things I have. I guess many people would be happy to be in my shoes, but I'm not happy. For one, I don't have any lifelong close friends. I love my wife and family, but I've evolved in several ways and I'm not the same person she married. Not in a bad way, but I just don't feel our personalities mesh as well. It's nobody's fault or anything. We still get along, but I just feel like I've never really had any really close friends that 'get me' and 'understand me' in such a way where I don't feel like I'm being judged, categorized or just an awkward and unrelatable person. I'm aware that my view of life and the world does not always line up with the social norms of mainstream society, but I don't feel my views and desires are bad. They just aren't the views of the majority. And I just feel like I'm in the wrong location around the wrong people and in the wrong environment to be great and thrive. Sometimes I feel like a displaced valuable asset that got thrown in the trash where no one can see my worth. I'm somewhat of a Renaissance man or Jack of many trades in the arts. I just feel the right person, people or company hasn't found me. And I don't know how to get their attention. So I feel stuck and stagnant. Even though I feel I have a lot to bring to the table in creativity, business and friendship, I feel myself losing motivation, drive and passion. I just need something giving me life. I feel life is being taken out of me everyday, but I'm not getting the charge I need daily to stay full. Admittedly, I'm an introvert, somewhat sensitive, an empath and can get drained by certain types of people or environments. I think this is a big reason I feel depressed. I've just learned how to cope with it. I just feel empty and lonely inside most of the time. Many days I feel the urge to cry, but nothing comes out. The numbness is not a great feeling at all. It's like I'm hoping to find someone that can embrace who I am where I am all while giving me the life I need to succeed in life. I feel this bond needs to be with a woman. Not that I don't want close male friendship as well, but I just feel I need womanly nurturing. I'm also not opposed to a romantic connection, but given my place in life and circumstances, it would have to be something in ENM. I've had one polyamorous relationship with my wife where we invited another woman into our relationship. Lasted for about a year and then we just decided to be friends. We just never found another compatible person after that. But that door is still open. It doesn't even have to be sexual. A close emotionally available commitment is just as valuable if the chemistry is there. This is one of the areas where I feel society hasn't fully accepted yet. Non traditional relationships work better for some people, but aren't always respected. The same basis of honesty, good communication, respect and trust apply just like in traditional relationships. And the key is building upon friendship first. But I understand it's not for everyone. I'm pretty sure at this point in my message, you either get me or you don't. For as complex as I feel I am, I really just want simplicity. Having a few close exclusive friends to enjoy life with. Whether it be binging on Netflix shows, having game nights, dining out, road trips to the beach or even traveling and exploring different cultures. My hope is to one day be financially free with close friends I can enjoy life with. It just feels like it's never going to happen. The very last part of this lonely equation is that I'm black American and atheist. It almost seems like people assume you are religious if you're black in America...as if they are synonymous. I used to be religious,  but not anymore. I'm also not a militant atheist and don't like debating. I'm about peace. Sometimes I don't fully feel I fit within atheism due to my background, but I know I'm not religious anymore. Like I said in the title, I just feel like I don't fit in anywhere.

I don’t know how to shake these feelings of depression when it comes to this aspect of life, I feel so inadequate as a person to even be able to date/be in a relationship with someone because I’m just an average dude working to better my life everyday but no matter how much I try I wouldn’t be enough for someone. I hate that I have these feelings because I know its unattractive and nobody wants to be with someone who has these feeling of themselves but I can’t help it I’ve been on the road of self improvement ever since high school and while I’ve definitely improved a great deal and I’m proud of how I’ve grown I still can’t shake the feeling of being inadequate for relationship no matter how much I improve.",lonely,My Struggles!,2022-06-22 16:32:32
1466,throwaway0183701,1655879511,1,"All I can imagine that’s worth this stupid fucking life is having an SO. The religion I was in propped that up as the second or *maybe* third most important part of someone’s life, and now even just secular society seems to laud it as the absolute highest. Anyone on tv or movies when asked “what matters most” to them is expected to say family, and if they don’t then they’re seen as shallow. Love and companionship is seen as the one thing somebody needs to get by.

Well I can’t fuckin have that. I guess I won’t rule it out for all time, but for now at least I’m utterly disqualified from romance. Shit luck when I started dipping my toes in the water and the corrosion to my self esteem that brought has left me completely hating myself. Nobody — no fucking body — wants to be with someone who hates themselves like I do. I’m fucked up in other ways and must be horribly ugly to boot, but the self esteem shit alone is enough to take me out. So yeah, I could find somebody, technically. It would just take a miracle; either a miraculous rejuvenation of my mind back to at least a semi-operable state, or a miraculously stupid person to find some worth in me and decide to stick with the fucked up fixer upper I am instead of getting a ready-to-go model.

So yeah, what am I supposed to find so enjoyable about life that I just can’t fucking wait to open my eyes? I enjoy things, sure. I like Pokémon and music and playing guitar and watching YouTube. But none of that is enough to make me wanna slog through all the fucking bullshit like school and medical appointments and finding an apartment and making sure I have insurance and cooking and not getting too fat and having to watch my hair fall out and my body start to degrade while my mind is trapped inside it. I can’t fucking stand it here, I’m not built for this, and no amount of distractionary pleasures is gonna make that change. In all honesty, I’m not even sure something “deep” or “profound” like having an SO would help me like society tells me it will. But it’s the only fucking thing I haven’t been able to try. Aside from hallucinogenic drugs, I guess


Obviously this is like 90% just a bitchy rant, but if there is some obvious answer out there that I’ve just missed, I’d love to hear it. Cuz I don’t fucking know anymore. My empathy for my family keeps me here for now, as does my primal urge to not die and my cowardice. if it’s actually possible to enjoy being here instead of hating every fucking morning, I’d rather be doing that.

1467,tangerine_dd,1655878401,1,"i moved to another country from the US almost three years ago and ive never felt so alone and nostalgic for when i used to live in the states. i have no friend group here, and only one close friend. i left my friend group behind when i moved, and i never quite fit in anywhere when i came here. i moved when i was around 13, so everyone had been friends in their groups for 2+ years (doesn’t help that the culture here is very cliquey - people are friendly but don’t welcome newcomers into their cliques) and i couldn’t find my way into a group. i still can’t, and now i’m 16. i absolutely hate feeling so isolated. i have friends, but they’re pretty much all acquaintances/school friends and we only “hang out” in class. i float around groups at lunch, because out of the three groups i try to sit with, none seem to really want me there. i resorted to filling my lunch times with club activities, and even then i was unable to find a friend group what with how many clubs i was a part of. all i want is to go back to my old group - i miss them so fucking much it hurts. i haven’t felt like i truly belong anywhere in almost 3 years. even with the one close friend here i do have, i’m never his first choice. everyone i know  either considers me an acquaintance or just a school friend. it’s so lonely never being anyone’s first choice. 

the only good news is that i’m going on a trip back to my old home town in a week. i know i’ll have a blast with my old friends for the time that i’m there, but i’m so afraid of coming back to a country where im completely isolated and have no one there who really gives a shit about me. i hate this so much.",lonely,moving to another country sucks,2022-06-22 16:13:21

1471,sakata_gintoki_96,1655877054,1,"I (26F) fear that I will live the rest of my life alone. I'm average height and a bit overweight- I have never had a romantic experience in my life. I've never been looked at twice and it's honestly depressing. I have two older sisters- both of them are married and have started their own families, and they are both way more attractive than I am. Basically, I got the brains and my sisters got the beauty, charm, and everything else that is desirable. I sometimes go to bars with my sisters in attempt to meet people, but anyone that approaches us will only speak to my sisters- my prescence is never acknowledged.. I'm quite used to this... Since they are married they always respectfully decline and the guy will usually walk away without even looking in my direction. It happens ALL. THE. TIME. This type of thing even happens when my mother is involved. My sisters, my mom, and I are all very close and we sometimes will go out somewhere and men will approach them and speak to my sisters and my mother while I sit right in the middle of the group and will still be overlooked. I'm not asking to be swept off my feet by some strange man I just met, but you can at least acknowledge my existence, right? Apparently not. It's just quite disheartening and discouraging because when I bring this up to my sisters or my mom- they're always annoyed or try to brush off my claim. I believe they think I'm fishing for compliments from them.. which I am not. I feel like they know this happens, but they don't have the heart to tell me the truth. Events from our last outing kind of confirmed my suspicions. Last week, we went out to a restaurant and I was telling my sisters and my mom about an upcoming trip I was taking and they asked me who I was going with and I jokingly said, ""my boyfriend,"" and they just looked at each other and laughed in my face.. like, loudly laughing- like it was the most absurd thing they had ever heard. (I was actually going with a couple friends, but yea..). I already have a complex about the whole ""never had any type of romantic experience"" thing, and them laughing just kind of confirmed what they really think- that I will never have a romantic relationship.

I feel like I'm searching some love that doesn't exist. I broke up with my Filipino because I met a Japanese exchange student when I studied Japanese that flirted the shit out of me. I don't know why she liked me because back then I was a worthless piece of crap. 

Anyway, this Japanese didn't become my gf because I played my cards terribly wrong and it haunted me for at least a year. Then I met some new exchange students the next year. I was still a dumb loser but I had my good moments, and finally I got a new gf. 

But ever since that day to this day I've been questioning my love for her. I've compared her over and over to my previous attempt and another Japanese I met some time before my new gf.

Last year I broke up with her because I was so unsure. Then some months later I ask this woman I met some time before and got a no. 

Then this summer I had an extreme random encounter with my ex. We haven't talked since I broke up. It felt special and I felt like life chose her for me, but I wanted to be honest with her so I also told her that I asked this other girl (which she has been jealous of since we met), and I got a bit fat no no 😂

Still I've tried to keep my cool and we have met again after. Maybe there's hope.

But I'm unsure. I think I truly love the other girl, it just took me several years to realize it.

I miss her smile, her laugh, her positive energy. I miss doing sports with her and studying with her. I still clearly remember the days we were together and how relaxed she made me. She had like an otherworldly ability to make me relax even though how much stress and anxiety I had. 

I've thought about it ever since if this is true love, but idk. 

Yet, it's difficult now and I don't know if I could ever get her. I had my chance back then, but I chose my ex and why did I do that 🤪

I'm alone all day long. I don't know anyone here, mainly because I can't go out much being so close to labor.  He barely kisses me or touches me anymore.

This girl I was into in highschool recently started messaging me out of the blue after almost a year of no contact and I enjoy talking with her and I found out quite quickly that we are basically in the same situation. I stayed on in school till my senior year while she left but ever since the end of of my senior year I've lost all contact with friends and have been isolated for the past 2 months.

 I found out through her social media posts that she frequently posts asking people to hang out with her and then a few hours later posts again in a sad way saying no one responded. I have not done this because I am not that desperate yet but I still relate. She talks to me in a very flirtatious way, she's not the most subtle person in the world since she sent me porn one time and then when I responded negatively she tried to play it off as a joke. We have also gotten into heated hypothetical sex scenarios not about eachother though and those were mostly jokes. 

The part I'm having trouble with when deciding whether to try for a relationship is whether or not I really like her or that she likes me or were just 2 lonely people. I do not want to end up rushing into a relationship with her only to realise that I hate her or for her to realise she hates me. We are both pretty inexperienced she's had a boyfriend before but has told me that she hasn't even kissed anyone before. I also have had one girlfriend who I didn't kiss. So we are at the same experience level but that may also be a problem since we are both very shy and maybe no one will make the first move. Or she'll get disappointed that I don't make the first move since I'm a guy and that's the social standard. 

I'm also kind of cautious since if she had a normal support network and friends she may not be this desperate and I don't want to take advantage of that just to get a relationship with her because that is creepy.",lonely,should I pursue a relationship with someone just because we are both lonely,2022-06-22 09:51:21

Recently I've convinced myself that I would literally do anything just for a lil' hug, from anyone. But the more i think about it, the more it's scaring me.

Well...surprise...now I'm an adult who has trouble socializing with other adults. I'm having so many problems at work because of how bluntly honest I am with people, so I decided to just keep to myself and stay quiet. Of course, I just get ignored and become invisible. 

I've been in one serious relationship with a girl, who years later admitted to me out of anger that she was actually talking to other people during our relationship. I've never felt so low in my life. 

I write dumb stories about love and romance, and now I'm realizing that it's just to fill the void in me. 

I've never had anyone interested in me who wasn't just out for s*x. Yet, around me, every person I meet is married or dating and I just feel so strange. I wonder how they did it, how they found someone who cares about them (even if only a little). 

I have lost all my friends, people at work hate me, and I've never been in love (the ones I did like never requited). I feel pretty low. It's becoming a real struggle to stay happy. The only positive thing I have in my life is my mother. She keeps telling me everything will get better. But when?

I found out that girl I was dating married someone and is living a happy life. She, like the rest of the world has moved forward. Years later, I'm still in the same place. 

I'm so invisible. I've tried to come out of my shell and speak to people but I'm still ignored. At work, I'm never invited to any gatherings outside of work, but sure, my coworkers will come to me if they need something. 

Any conversations I have with people never go anywhere, even when I really try to get to know someone.

I don't even know how to start or begin something like this. I'm a single dad of a two year old and a 5 month old.  The mental toll of things are mentally and both physically exhausting thats its driving me to unimaginable depression. 

I am both currently both negative in both gas and electric. I currently have no freezer/fridge left and bave barely minimum to feed my daughter. I'm on the last couple tubs of formula. I'm almost of nappies. I'm falling behind on bills dramatically and I'm having zero space to breathe. Which I'm more than happy to provide evidence either by video call, screen shot. 

I'm still waiting on assistance from the health visitor. I'm to far out from any soup kitchen since I do not drive.  I am in the complete dark and feel utterly lost within life and myself. I want to be the best possible father to my children but feel as if I'm failing them considerably and feel as if someone would do a much better job than I.

Please if anyone can assist, I'd be happy to give my address or even a home visit within reason of trusting you. I feel backed into a corner, unable to breathe.

1613,blonde_gets_healthy,1655811946,1,"Should I try therapy? I know I battle depression, and some days are better than others... but I struggle a lot with loneliness, and don't feel like I should. I am blessed more than I deserve, and feel like garbage about it to be honest...

My first marriage was such a traumatic experience in so many ways, that I feel like I shut people out, just to protect myself...I lost my entire community when I separated from my husband...and that whole experience I know is something that has kind of damaged me more than I'd like to admit to....

My fiancé is one of the only people that I've let close to me...and he's amazing, he works so hard, and is so selfless...the fact that someone so wonderful loves me...it's overwhelming...I don't deserve it...I don't know why in the world he would love me...take me and my daughter under his wing and protect us...he saved my life on multiple occasions...

After my daughter's father (my exhusband) overdosed in December, we moved to another state to start fresh. Her dad was such a huge part of the community, with all the complicated dynamics going on because of his secret addiction, and the broken relationships...we thought taking a new job opportunity in a new state, was going to be the best for my daughter over her life (I question my decisions constantly, bc i don't trust any of my own judgements anymore after everything I've experienced over the years with my previous marriage and past relationships.)

I know relationships are important to beat loneliness...but most of the people I thought were friends of mine, that I trusted and respected, were from my church, that my first husband was a worship leader at...and after we separated...all he did was bash me to literally anyone that would listen...and I know now that he used that to manipulate people to feel bad for him, to help enable his secret life as an addict, so he could survive... but at the time, it broke me...anyone I was close to, stopped talking to me...he family that I was close to, hated me... my brother was his best friend and new pastor at what was our church...and my brother wanted nothing to do with me anymore, and excommunicated me from the church because of my sin... but let my ex spouse lead worship (which seemed so hypocritical, given I knew that the life he was living, was no better than the way I was)...I mean, its goes a lot deeper, but I'm trying to keep this short...it was hard.. my community was gone...I had to come to the realization that I didn't really have any true friends...

My daughter is my life, and I do everything possible to protect her, I just want her to be okay and have the best life possible. But I know I'm struggling from depression, and I know there's a lot of things that I repress from a lot of things in my marriage, separation and divorce that I'm annoyed I can't keep them repressed...I don't have the mental energy to deal with those emotions, and be there for my daughter...i want to be present for her mentally... but I struggle a lot...

My daughter is amazing, she's only 4... my fiancé is wonderful... but I've gone through realizing that most of my life was full of fake friendships, and that you can't trust most people...i struggle with thinking how maybe I could have saved my ex husband if I would have just stayed longer, to maybe somehow keep him off the harder drugs...I feel like I am distant with my fiancé a lot of days because or the mental chaos I go through on a daily basis, trying to process my failed marriage, and the loss of my ex-husband, that I watched slowly die for about a decade...which slowly ate me away and broke my heart more than I knew possible... I'm lonely because I can't let anyone close... anytime I've let anyone close, they've destroyed me...maybe that's partly why I keep subconsciously pushing my fiancé away at times, and catch it and have to correct myself? I feel like such a disaster most days...on the outside, I coat my face with makeup, and do my hair, to try to camouflage what's going on in the inside...bc I don't want to be vulnerable to anyone...I don't want anyone to be close...I can't deal with being destroyed again...I don't think I can take much more pain...but... it's incredibly lonely living like this...I need to change something...should I try therapy?

If I begin describing my symptoms in detail she gets restless. If I ask her questions she goes on long-winded explanations which aren't relevant to me.

My brother will rant at me about some thoughts or feelings he has, and seeks no interest in my thoughts or feelings about what he's saying. He gets upset if my opinions differ from his.

Was supposed to be one of those moments. But she got ill. And I'm very worried about her. But I've been totally in pieces over this, and it's made me realize how alone I really am. 

I have two friends, they're not very social. I lost all my gaming buddies when I quit World of Warcraft, and later my new Overwatch buddies when I transitioned (I'm a trans woman). I lost my disc golf buddies soon after my transition as well. I lost a loose community when I stopped writing my blog, among few others. And the pandemic made end of even the support group I occasionally went to. Restrictions have been lifted but the group is still off. My remaining friends and I used to have a group chat with two more people. One of those two we kicked out as it became obvious she didn't share common values, and exhibited some predatory behavior towards much younger women in vulnerable position. The second one dropped out after she got paranoid about everything, global conspiracies and all that. 

And I'm realizing that group is what I miss the most. It was a small community and support group in one. Now I have none of that. Where the hell would I even start to get something like that back? The friends I have left are a couple and they dropped all their own friends and now I'm their only friend, but even still they're not very social. We talk and meet rarely. So it's not something to start building a new group on top of... I miss having a place to vent about life and having real support, and giving that back as well. I miss the giving at least equally if not more so, as I enjoy helping others immensely.

The loneliness is driving me insane to the point that I cannot function properly. Whenever I see people happy and chatting in a group or a couple I am flooded with many emotions and negative thoughts. I have contemplated committing suicide many times. My life has been riddled with hurdles and downfalls to the point I want to just give up and die. No one to talk about it openly and no one to look forward to meeting to. I seem to have a recurring pattern of befriending shit people who end up using me and throwing me away when done. I never asked for any of this. Of course, I am no saint or an 'all good' person too but I have seen worse. I never had a genuine friend(s) yet I am surrounded by a lot of people. 

Having a relationship now seems too far of a stretch. I just long for someone to hug me one day and reassure me that the pain will go away now, that sleepless nights filled with tears are long gone and it's all okay now. Seeing my socials and people around me hooking up and having relationships gives me physical pain now. I guess I am a loner now. I tried to live the 'loner' life but it worsened my condition. The only people that I am happy and genuine with are my family but I wonder how long that will it last. Due to my current situation, I have to live away from them.

I have never been in relationship with a woman before and I hate how I look. It's something I could improve on but I'm overweight for my age. Not obese but I'm super super insecure about myself. (it's mostly the fat stomach) that's it. But it looks so bad. I've been a chubby kid forever. Been fat shamed multiple times and I'm an introvert mostly. I didn't have any luck in secondary school (high school basically). Got friendzoned twice and I guess I think I can can be easily attached to people. 

Seeing people around me having better luck than me is something I hate to feel. I know I need to patient but I can't stop thinking about it. When you see how relationships are like nowadays. The cheating being normalised. People not committing to relationships is scary. On one hand I am scared to being in a relationship but at the same time I want one. 

Its not even about sex or anything. I don't think I get appreciated the way anyone would want and deserve and I feel like i won't have any luck with a woman. I feel like nowadays looks is valued a lot more than personality. At least with people my age and people I am around. 

Im scared to think that what if someone downright reject me purely because of looks. The thing is personality I'm not too worried about it. I'm basically that ""nice guy"" (at least I hope I am) that isn't really physically attractive or anything that gets sidelined most of the time. I tend to be very awkward and quiet if I basically don't know you or I am not too close with you. 

I am going to be going university this year and I hope I get some luck. A girl that I know loves me for who I am. Obviously not going to university JUST to get a girl but it's usually where you will find someone. 

I just want to be more confident and have a stable intimate relationship with a girl that would make me happy to live. 

In a world of hookups I just want a simple old school love that I feel like it's too much to ask with how things are going rn. I mean I believe in marriage and all and I would definitely see myself being in that position when I'm older. It's just that you need a woman with you for that to happen 😂

Even though i live with my family i feel extremely lonely. I'm so messed up that even if someone asks about me i always say I'm fine even though sometimes i just on the verge of falling apart. I thought maybe if i stopped using social media it would make me feel less bad. Seeing people having cool life made me feel inadequate. Watching people my age or even younger than me bragging about being in relationships or having many friends always made me question myself. Why am I not good enough for any of these? What have i done to deserve this loneliness? I can't even go to watch a movie or restaurant. Because everytime i look at someone like that all i want to do is just kill myself. Worse i don't even have enough courage to actually kill myself. I've tried that like 5 times in a month. I am a fucking coward.

Everyone is just so fucking stupid and I'm not trying to sound like I'm saying to myself that im a genius but everytime when i talk to someone it seems like they're talking a lot without saying anything. 

Other than making a decent friend group i can't even make a girlfriend, sometimes i think that it's because of my height, I'm 5'4, but i don't look ugly at all I've been called chad by some people on discord and i have a really good sense of humor, I'm smart and all that I'm not even a mean person and not a simp either i know the balance, i also look a bit muscular and shredded but still it makes no difference in my dating life. Around february 2022- march2022 i tried to get out my comfort zone and try to ask girls out(from my gym, facebook, instagram, irl, cold approaching) and i got rejected around 15 times, i really didn't understand what i did wrong because i acted like a human being, after that since i was really sensible to rejections i felt really bad for some reason i felt like no one likes me (i still do but i don't feel that worse anymore) i quit going to the gym since i couldn't make myself lift anything anymore, i lost about 5kg in a month (i don't know what i lost because i barely had any fat) i couldn't eat, sometimes i would go 3 days without eating or showering (usually i shower once a day every day) i felt hopeless. No one cares about anyone. That's how this world is. The chances of me finding a girlfriend with the same interests as me that doesn't feel like a NPC and that gives normal hugs are close to 0.

1629,burnedoutinlove,1655796844,1,"The title says it all. The rest of my life is going well. I have a decent career, a home, supportive extended family, and good friends. I stay healthy and fit, no real mental or emotional issues. Yet I just can't seem to find someone who's willing to make me a priority of sharing a life with.

The last guy (E) I was with was emotionally unavailable so even while dating he never made feel like I was his choice. I stayed with E for such a long time because he was better to me than the previous guy  (M) who started charming and ended up being a narcissist. Come to think of it E also started off being really charming, and because he was a nice guy I just kept trying to make it work. I wouldn't accept it when he got hot and cold. I thought if I could keep giving, eventually he'll come around. Well that never happened so it ended after nearly 10 years.

After that I was just so worn out from giving up so much of myself that I didn't care for relationships anymore. I thought it was too late to meet anyone that would be worth my time. I spent that energy finding myself again, finding ways to be happy alone, and then I met a new guy (J).

J taught me how to set healthy boundaries, encouraged me to be myself, showed me his vulnerable side, and we helped each other build confidence, set goals. It was absolutely amazing and I could actually see a future. Not only that, I thought he was worth it. What I wasn't willing to do for others, I was willing to do for him. It felt like I finally found what I was looking for...until he suddenly left me.

See, while being able to have this wonderful relationship, J had some unresolved issues from before he met me that got triggered when things were going too well. Ultimately he got spooked, went into shut down mode, no longer wanted anything to do with me. The last I heard, he went back to his ex with whom he had a less healthy relationship.

I'm just so tired of not being anybody's ""the one."" Half of my life's over and I have yet met anyone who values me enough or is in the right state of mind to commit to me. Despite me being totally ok with being single and no longer being willing to settle for a partner who's not right for me, it still hurts to see all my friends who have found love and are happy in their relationships.

I've been struggling a bit more lately after finding out that J was willing to abandon the great relationship we had for one that's unhealthy. Also, a few people I met while they were single have all found SO's in the recent past and even planning to get married now. Although I'm happy for them, they're exiting my life as well and it continues to emphasize the fact that they've found someone seemingly easily while I'm still here searching.

You understand that the reason the phrase “I’m sorry” sticks out to you so much is because of how much you’ve been used, neglected, and taken advantage of to a point where you start to blame yourself. 

“I’m sorry” is our way of saying that we’re lost, that our chains have been pulled back and fourth until we no longer have our hope and confidence. 
Nicotine crawls beneath my skin as I write to a subreddit at 2:31am, head dried out, with a heart as fragile as glass. 

The reason we feel so alone when we genuinely aren’t is because no one will genuinely understand you. No one will genuinely know the real you. The way you see things, the way you see yourself. It’s good to remind yourself that none of that matters, but you can’t help but overthink at times. Demons now control the mind that was once so pure, and is now a dark, cold, and lonely mind. There might be light somewhere, but it burns you when you reach for it, reminding you that you don’t belong. 
This feeling will numb you into feeling like you no longer hold worth in this world.

Im 31. Immigrant to the US. Came here to live as a teenager and eventually enlisted in the military. Left my extended family behind and moved across the country.

I’m tired.

Well to get started i have to tell you about me and why it’s such a big deal for me. When people are born you don’t really remember much but the first thing i remember was walking with my sister but idk but also did know who she was and then images start flashing thru my head, it was like i was dreaming but i age pretty fast in my head. I was pretty confused on what i was doing most why me and then i just went with it you know.

Then boom i wake up and wonder where was everyone at like it’s the morning my mom was no where to be found and my sister wasn’t in the room. I went to check the kitchen and my sister was standing there with a knife at her neck. i was mostly confused but i saw her crying. I can remember even now her sayings to me “nobody loves me” i just stood there wonder why and what i did wrong was i not good enough. I begged her to stop and i love her took sometime but she finally decided to stop. But i hated that she even thought about do it and sad. But I didn’t tell anyone. 

Then i started school but 1st grade don’t remember much, 2nd neither. 3rd grade is when everything change i was bullied a lot I don’t know why i guess i was weird but i never cared cause i was used to getting hurt from my mother. Honestly compare to my mom it was easy, my mother would slap me, hit me with the belt. Obviously I would cry but every time i would cry she would keep hitting until i stopped . Saying stuff like “ be man, men don’t cry” “I’ll give you a reason to cry.” My sister would even step in and take the beating for me sometimes. I would cry and hit myself until I wouldn’t cry so that I wouldn’t have to get hit so much. So when my bully tripped me or say something mean i won’t care.

But when one of the girl in my class told my sister i was confused like I didn’t think too much about it. But everyone was serious about this even my mom which confused me the most like she didn’t do that to me. So I decided to give them the son they wanted change myself. I would talk less, play less, cry less. But i bottle up my anger to them to the point where i feel like a different person was born. It was fine i was doing well.

Until 8th grade i had friends, good grade accept to private school for high school. Then my mom wanted to move again for the 5th time when i finally thought i was going to enjoy my life they just have to ruin it. I told her I didn’t want to move but “ you go where i go” all cause her husband cheated on her like, why move state tho. Before you say anything i was not shock about this like there was a lot of red flag before the marriage but she ignored them and said she’ll change him. Yeah totally instead she fuck up my future plan and i got depressed i went to another school for 4 months until I randomly move to back where we were cause them got together.

That was fun, I don’t go to the high school i wanted and lost most of my friends and for nothing. That when i just stop caring, I skipped school and stay home looking at nothing. And i started getting a voice in my head pretty annoying, my mom found out and i got hit for it. But i just stood took the beating say something like “are we done?”
And walked away. I would just stay home and listen to the shit in my head sometime i would cry or sleep. I obviously got therapy but i just wouldn’t care. I drop out and just do nothing I’ll probably just end it if you get what I’m say. Most cause I’m tired or so i can get some peace and quiet for once. Or just cause im bored. But the only thing thats keeping me here is my sister. Honestly why put my here if you’re just going to fuck me over this much over and over again. I haven’t even gone to detail on how fuck my life is. It only gets worse the more i go thru it.

I do have one friend. I’ve known him since we were in the first grade, and for all of elementary and middle school we only had each other. But he got into the advanced courses when we started high school and I didn’t. We could only really see each other on weekends and rarely at that. He has a life so he’s busy. Anyway we’ve remained really good friends and have at least texted on a regular basis.

I started this class today. I was pretty excited as I hadn’t met anyone new since I dropped out of school, and I was eager to have some good experiences as a student too. I’m the only guy in the class and everyone else is staying in the dorms, so they already know each other pretty well. I ended up eating lunch alone and sitting in the corner away from everyone else laughing and having a good time. I just got all of the same feelings I got at school. The deep, crushing loneliness, and the anxiety stopping me from trying to talk to people. I just couldn’t do it. 

But at least I could text my friend. He’s always there to support me and I needed it. But he had just asked out a girl for the first time and was ecstatic that she had accepted. Of course I’m happy for him, so I didn’t want to ruin it by making him deal with my issues. I feel like I’ve been left behind. My closest friend is in a happy relationship and I just left my bed for the first time in months and I couldn’t even effectively introduce myself to anyone. I feel pathetic.

- after I stopped giving them free lunches my “friends” ignored me and I stopped being friends with them 
- these same “friends” would be jerks and not in a joking way
- started talking to a girl a lot and we made a short film together. A few days later she randomly ghosted me and her mom basically friend zoned me for her in an email saying we had became “good friends”
- started talking to a girl who would lead me on and then treat me horribly for either attention or entertainment. Then she turned everyone at my school against me when I told my fake friends I thought she might have been leading me on  
- tried to ask a girl out who I’d been friends with previously for a long time. She had seemed to show some interest, specifically when she asked if I’d be homecoming king if she was homecoming queen and then asked for a selfie with just the 2 of us. No dice, she treats me like a loser now just like everyone else
- snapped another girl who had some stuff in common but then she randomly unadded me (I genuinely didn’t do anything)

So yeah, I’m kind of done with everything. I can’t seem to get a girl to like me back, I’m socially awkward even though I’ve tried really hard to fit in, and my few remaining friends have other people they prefer to hang out with.

My roommate had birthday yesterday. She's an beautiful extrovert so no doubt her birthday was a day of grand celebration. Me and my other roommate also celebrated her birthday. But the whole day went making me look and feel like a looser. 
I didn't want to join the party but she called me and asked me to come. So I didn't manage to deny and went to the party. Just to realise that I'll never have circle of friends like her and will remain a loner for rest of my life.

Outside of her, i really do not have anyone to share things with. I have one friend but he just got a kid and is getting married, so hes busy and i just do not want to bother him.

I just want to be in the same room as my younger self and give myself a hug and tell him to expect to be lonely and not take life too seriously and to let him know to not worry about feeling lonely bc, well, I’m lonely too. I’ve been depressed for like 4 years, recently finished high school. I have friends but they’re not that local and I find it hard to make friends locally. I moved into a quiet area 2 years ago. The problem is that I feel lonely, no matter who I’m with. It’s the feeling that no one will stay forever, which sounds selfish and egotistical but I want to share experiences with one person for an extended period of time. I just guess everyone has their own life. Everyone seems to have someone they’ve known for 5 years plus/bestfriend who do everything together. I was just unlucky and wasn’t able to establish that. I’m not unattractive, I take care of myself. In social situations I tend to be reserved but I’m not shy and I’m comfortable with breaking the ice. I spend my time working, listening to a lot of music, learning to play piano, hitting gym, and doing substances by myself. I meet my friends every month or two. Sometimes I go clubbing with them too. Recently, when I’m alone at night I’m feeling very lonely and negative. Which is what made me write here. I also feel very nostalgic and sad about myself when I was younger. So I listen to old music. I have a massive pessimistic view on the world and I’m not religious.

Edit: I have two good friends, and I tend to cut a lot of people off because I can’t stand certain people. These two friends are kept separate to me because they’re not that into the same stuff and I just haven’t gotten around to introducing them since I only see them once a month or so/ their lack of interest in meeting the other friend. I’ve also lost two of my best friends in the past over petty shit. I tend to always third wheel and my best friends don’t consider me their best friend.

I harm myself sometimes but not ever in a life threatening way. No one ever notices and I don’t want them to. Does it matter then if I have suicidal thoughts? Is it only a problem when you’re hanging off the side of a building? I want to tell someone but I don’t think they want to know. It’s not serious enough but I worry about it. Is this how everyone is? Am I just a weak person who’s too sensitive and can’t take living? It feels wrong and that’s why I want to tell someone. It feels like everyone around me also has something going on with them mentally, so I don’t want to burden them with my issues. The people I trust tell me I’m just overthinking when I try to reach out to them. I haven’t told them the extent of the thoughts I’m having, only that they are troubling to me. I usually get that same ‘everyone has problems’ line and they are probably correct and I believe them. It just doesn’t help me feel any better, although I shouldn’t expect them to do that for me. I think they’re right and the problem is me. I think I have the problem that I never let anyone in on how I’m feeling. I guess I’ve built walls around my feelings and am outwardly blank most of the time. This is a new thing for me, but when someone gets close to me, the wall breaks and I just dump what feels like every feeling I’ve ever had on them. It turns off some people, but some are supportive. They’re always surprised though. I haven’t told anyone about the thoughts though. It feels dirty in an odd way. Like if I told someone they would think I’m craving attention. They’re real to me, but I don’t think anyone will believe me if I told them. I feel really alone and since I’ve never truly let someone in, no one will care if I actually do it. The only person who I think would care is my mom. I’m not sure what my dad would do. She always comes to me with her problems and I always comfort her. I give her advice. I am still on her health insurance so recently I’ve been asking her if we could try going to therapy. Not together. That way she could be more secure on her own and I could tell someone about the problem I’ve been having. She’s always been against me going to see someone. She doesn’t trust people. Especially doctors, I had to basically force her to be vaccinated. I’ve always struggled with my mental health and I’ve brought it up to the both of them several times. I’ve self harmed since I was young. Never very severely though and always in places where I can hide the evidence. It isn’t my only concern. I think my father also self harmed but not directly. Like he prides himself for being in physical pain all the time. He never takes painkillers if he’s injured and does minor medical procedures on himself. Like once he heated up a knife on the stove and cut open his arm to get a splinter out. He has a history of abuse from his childhood that I can see now has affected him his whole life. It gave him a twisted view of the world. My mom adopted a lot of his tendencies because she married him very shortly after both of her parents died. Now she has recently lost her brother and her relationship with the rest of her family is strained. I can feel the distance between my father and me. I guess I have both daddy and mommy issues. When people tell you that, it’s usually their way of telling you to shut up about your problems.  I feel guilty having these problems I’m having because they have done their best to provide for me. They are supportive of my career goals. I have hidden my romantic life from them. My dad is homophobic and I can tell it makes him uncomfortable when he is around any queer person. I am queer. I call myself bisexual. My mother is accepting of gay cis men but no other queer people. I have a lot of shame associated to my attraction to women which I feel limits my relationships. My mom always said that lesbians were women who gave up on men and they were ugly and fat. I have a cousin that is a trans man and that’s how she views him. He is in his 40s and happily married and she still won’t respect him. I have this anxiety that grips me all the time and around every aspect of my life. Sometimes people can see it and I’m embarrassed that I haven’t done anything to fix it. It makes me feel like I’m stuck in one place and I will always be there. When I have a bad mental health day it feels like I am stuck in one spot and cannot physically move. I think all of my problems are very normal and everyone has them but I am too weak to overcome them and function normally. I am a big baby who just cries all the time. I’m honestly not sure what I’m asking for. I just want to be able to feel good and be happy. I don’t think I know what that feels like. If I have, I’ve forgotten it. I was going to write something about how forgetful I am but I think this post has enough aimless rambling. My mom asked me what I would get out of a diagnosis and I honestly don’t know. I don’t know what the fuck’s wrong with me but I keep fantasizing about telling someone. This isn’t everything but it’s everything that is vague enough to put on the internet.

I'm in my 20s and I can honestly say that I have maybe one close friend? Even that friendship is a little strained as of late. Obviously though, quality over quantity. But I guess I would just like to have more people in my life. I'd love to have more close friends; to just have more people to care for and open up to. 

It doesn't help that when talking to people (especially online), I struggle a bit. I feel like I always open up way too fast. I worry that I'm being off-putting by being so excited. I always end up bringing everything to the table all at once, but then towards the end it just kind of fizzles out? 

I think I can come across kind of overwhelming at times too? I think my high energy can be a bit jarring at times for others. Which I understand, it just gets so lonely. 

The thing is, I think my biggest problem is maintaining friendships. I just become so anxious so quickly. I can be slow with responses sometimes, which I know is something I have to work on. I just worry that I'm annoying others a lot of the time. So instead of talking about these insecurities, I go quiet. 

I keep telling myself that I'll find my people one day; people that enjoy my company. I just want to be somebody's go-to person; I want to have that level of closeness in a friendship. And yeah, I might one day! But I know that in order to do that, I have to work on a lot of things first. 

So it got me wondering; is there anything I can do to change this? Are there other people out there dealing with this very same problem? If so! Hi hi! Maybe we can all work through it together like one big team?

Im a pretty good lookin guy (solid 7 depending). I have a great job. I make plenty of money and have my head on straight. I support myself, don’t take life too seriously, and love my hobbies. Female friends have given me constructive criticism and I’ve made changes. But somehow, I either end up with the wrong one or no one at all. I love having a woman in my life. It helps me be better in so many ways. Just wish they were as enthusiastic about having me in their lives.",lonely,I keep trying but it just doesn’t work.,2022-06-21 06:55:21

Im lonely and melancholic but i kinda like it, looking at the stars, listening to chill music and feeling like nothing really matters. It gets me thinking a lot about who i am and just the fact figuring that i try my best to be a good person soothes the solitude into a bitter sweet feeling.

Pouring tears as I write this. The easiest reason is the fact that my brain’s chemistry isn’t right. Feeling hurt and alone. Crying on the top bunk bed while everyone else enjoys their time. As they should, and I do not hold it against them. Part of me fantasises with the possibility of someone opening the door and check in on me, ask if I’m ok. Expect my genuine answer as opposed to simply checking a moral box. Somebody to ask me to come down the bed and give me a hug. Let me cry in their shoulders. Make me feel loved and cared for. Yet that door remains closed with the occasional person coming in to get their coats. That moment where your heart sinks because you hoped someone would see behind your fake smile. Your jokes being nothing more than facades to try to scape who you are. That moment the door closes and all you do is cry. You’re not important, nobody crosses the door.",lonely,Nobody crosses the door,2022-06-21 06:35:14

1765,ccrexer,1655750767,1,"Yesterday was Father’s Day and I have two adult sons. 

One of my sons is in university for environmental science and had to go on a research trip to Baja California for a few weeks that had him gone for Fathers Day.  We went out the weekend prior and had a well meaning, but awful dinner, due to the local college having graduation ceremonies the same evening. Everywhere was booked solid, so we had to compromise and the spot we could get in was terrible. 
We did have a nice conversation, and we enjoy each other’s company, so it wasn’t a total bust, just a terrible dining experience. 

My other son, however, didn’t even care enough to send a text yesterday, let alone a phone call, and god forbid, a small gift. 

He is in his early thirties, is well established in his career and I would classify him as being very successful in his career as a firefighter engineer. 

His birthday is later this month and I have already had two birthday gifts delivered to him and followed up with phone calls after I received delivery notices. His girl is throwing him a birthday party next week and two weeks ago he sent me a text with the birthday party invite so I can RSVP. 

All I received yesterday was a short ‘ Happy fathers day’ text from their mother, whom I’ve been divorced from for close to 30 years. 

When I discuss my disappointment with my peers, I’m told that holidays are for children, and I shouldn’t be upset, but the one day honoring Father’s, and I get snubbed. 

I don’t mean to sound like an ungrateful father, but due to financial situations, I’ve had to move 3.5 hours away, and have been alone in a new city for the entire time, it’s been very difficult meeting anyone, and I’m very lonely.

1781,rohanryda,1655744330,1,"27M, not like it should matter tho.  My situation is probably fairly close to yours, in at least one way or another.  So here goes.
- NPCs aren't a meme.  Embrace it.  Go out and pretend you're the only real human.
- You are ABOVE everyone else.  Social people need to blab their mouths about BS to each other because they're empty and have nothing else.
- Don't be nice, courteous, wtvr.  If you meet adversion, be FIRM.  Don't ever think that being super friendly will win you a friend.  If someone pushes, PUSH BACK.  Most people who start confrontation don't expect 'the rattlesnake to lash back out.'. They'll back down when they find you don't budge so easily.
- Other people have to PROVE themselves to you.
- Fall in love with your interests and hobbies.  BE THAT GUY.  Get so fuckin absorbed.  What YOU like is MORE IMPORTANT than people.
- The average person isn't very interesting.  I mean even if we get into the social groups that we all want, what do they talk about anyway?  Work?  High school/college?  Boring ass ""adult"" stuff like hopeless politics?  Fuck that!  Who are they to decide what's interesting and valuable.
- Keep your fingers crossed for a one person.  It could be the perfect fantasy GF/BF you always wanted.  It could be a friend.  But never let your guard down - always have a way to protect yourself from getting screwed over.  Be cautious.  Be skeptical.  Do please be respectful, but DON'T EVER SUCK UP TO ANYONE.  Nobody deserves that much adoration from a special and rare lonewolf like you.  Understand how to give-and-take.  As an ASD or wtvr tf the word is now, someone not handed his social skills on a platter of formative experiences this is something I've made a priority to practice with others.
- Don't drown yourself in codependent despair-cults.  Fellas, stay away from incels.  All they'll do is fill your head with nonsense to make you even angrier and lonlier.  I've been through that ringer.  It's not a fun trip.  They'll try to speak your language to make you show your soft underbelly, then radicalize you.  I'd hate to see this subreddit suffer the same fate.
- If you're creative or have a special skillset like me, HONE YOUR SKILL.  Art, music, writing/fiction, filmmaking, tradework, whatever it is that you can do better than most.  THAT IS YOU.  THAT IS YOUR IDENTITY.  I make almost all of my (very few) friends through music because I'm good at it. They keep me around because I'm not someone they can afford to lose.  BE A VALUABLE ASSET AND OWN IT!  (Pilot your Eva and people will praise you.  Please someone understand this reference.)

When a person is put in a position like us, we have two choices - despair that we'll never have the extroverted social groups, the perfect partner, etc?  And wallow away either wageslaving for the good of anyone but you?  Or NEET yourself into oblivion?

OR do you take the risk and make your own way?  Make your own business, focus on your craft.  Take the big leap into a unconventional lifestyle.  Break free from the restraints of societal expectations.  Those are for boring people with boring lives, boring houses, boring wives/husbands, and they die boring deaths.
If you fail and and up broke...well, we all here wanna die anyway, right?  May as well go down fighting.  Our reality is in on our own heads.  There's no heaven or hell - you go wherever you want to go.

And if you succeed and build the life you want without other people helping you, it will make you stronger and 

Endure the hurt.  Seriously.  Don't like look at it as a cliche, but a challenge.  We feel awful when we're useless, inactive, and weak.  If you must serve some purpose, let that purpose be yourself.  Pain can be a strength.  PUT UP THOSE WALLS.  Make it so that only the people who make the effort to break em get to see the real you.  It sounds awful and like bad advice, but when has the fluffy stuff like 'just be happy' worked?  It's ok to be a lonely and angry person.  Remember that YOU ARE BETTER THAN EVERYONE!

I want you all to realize that once you free your mind of the mentality that other people mold your reality, you realize that being imperfect, trashy, lonely, ugly, dark, different, freakish, and weird is an amazing gift and gives us so much potential to be more than the bigoted, brainwahsed, idiot computer-brains waking the earth that are nothing more than physical obstacles in your way.

I hope that this might help someone to see that there is a way to channel pain into productivity.  And maybe someone might see something wrong with my new belief system and offer an edit.

1787,HeisenbergDKK,1655741990,1,"Hello and welcome to my lonely world! Yes, even when I feel lonely I still have humor… I suppose thats a good thing, right?

How do you people cope with being lonely? I often try to entertain myself via my own dark humor, or watching videos of whatever on YouTube, playing videogames or listening to music. I know it doesn’t last forever and that I can get lonely again in just a matter of days, to the point where Im outright depressed.

Am I wrong for wanting a girlfriend and then just, like, barricade myself with her in our apartment/house and then just do … nothing? Not sitting staring into the wall, but by nothing I mean just me and her, enjoying games, videos, boardgames, books… and the presence of eachother. I feel like im some oddball wanting this…

I must admit that I am also one that appreciates being alone, doing my own hobbies, going on my own trips and such. I do have Autism so often I can get overwhelmed, but I would also say that I have learnt to overcome that aka the afforementioned thing where I play games or whatever (mentioned earlier). I often despise having surprise guests too.

I know that it sounds weird, but even though I like being alone in many parts of life, I still struggle with loneliness. Its one thing being with people in a massive overcrowded place, than being with one person (like a girlfriend) for the same amount of time, if that makes sense. I have good friends too, but they all live outside of my town and although I can confide in them, I don’t ever feel like that I can unload all of my frustrations on them (in a good way!!!) after a day that just sucks donkeyballzzzz…

1800,baobab_the_fruit,1655723617,1,"To tell you the truth, im not entirely sure why im typing this. I do not expect noir think anyone will particularly care about what i have to type. But i suppose that its only human to want to be heard, and this is as good a place as any to share a life’s story i guess.   


It will have to be a multiple posts story, so i‘ll wait for the reaction on this bit of the story and then i might add the rest if people want to hear it. First of all, my life hasn’t been special in any way shape or form. That bothers me sometimes, i feel like im drifting through life without aim or any real goals. Don’t get me wrong my life certainly hasn’t been the worst, bit it most definitely hasn’t been the best. Having said that, here we go.   


**Youth.**  


I dont remember a great deal of my really younger years, i have an issue with memory and most of my childhood has passed into oblivion. But there are shards of it, but to do it justice id have to start around high school. Until then i was a rather normal kid, played my nintendo, came from a rather poor family, and was raised in the cult that are the jehova’s witnesses. I had no friends, no money, and just generally no particular motivation to join society.   


But as it is the law here i had to go to school, which for me turned out later to probably be a good things vs being homeschooled by people who think the end is neigh and that your sole purpose should be to spread the word. Highschool was rather uneventful, i was bullied for my appearance (my hair was always sort of short and my clothes cheep which kids love to pick at). I do remember the turning point of that quite vividly, i am not proud of it but i think its a good place to start.   


**Bullied, no more.**  


I was sitting in class 3th year, another guy who was bullied for years started to pick on me, suppose it was his way of trying to climb the social ladder. After enduring his remarks for about half an hour he started the good ol racist spewing Of words. At this point mind you i had been bullied for  2 and a half years and reached my boiling point. After the class i waited for him to come through the classroom door and i slammed it right into him. He got beat up by two more or less Krab and Goyle types, but i didn’t care I finally stood up for myself. (Or so i thought at the time, I realise now it just turned me into a jerk like the people that picked on me).   


the remaining two years at that school where uneventfuL.  


**At Home**

I was regularly beaten for stupid things like talking in gatherings (read church), not that anyone who was there ever cared. This kept happening until i was old enough and to big for my dad to keep that up, he is a rather mean man and a real piece of \*\*\* when it comes to animal abuse. (Killed my cat, twice. And beheaded a bird who came to fish in his pond amongst others). My mom rather passive when it comes to his behaviour you know, the whole “obey they husband” thing. I did have some solace, i read books, lots and lots of books. Between being forced to go to these church meetings and get their propoganda pushed down my throat and being bulied or bored at the worst school in my country (officially titled as such back then) i got to read many many books.   


Alright guys,   
I know that so far this story has been rather boring. I’m 35 now, a dad raising his child not together with her mother. And i have a partner overseas. So there is more to the story, a lot more. And i would happily answer questions about anything. If there is enough interest or comments i will add more to the story. But i dont want to type this out and bore everyone to death.

1808,akstwo,1655720277,1,"I'm a lonely, single 30something female, currently grappling with the loss of hope around ever finding a partner (I'm on the ace spectrum, a cultural misfit, it's a whole thing). Having cycled through periods like this for over a decade, I've learnt a few things, that I thought I'd share:

1) It takes courage to connect. I have some friends from my uni days and various workplaces. Some are not good to reach out to, they're not in a good place themselves. Some are more reliable. The thing is, there's no way of know who is in what category until you reach out and say something vulnerable. I have found two to four good people on any given day. 

2) Sometimes your brain says nothing will help, this is a lie. Your brain is lying to you. It does this all the time. Maybe it just doesn't know what will help. Maybe it thinks the only thing that will help is actually unhealthy and unhelpful and perpetuates your loneliness cycle. Mine kept saying that no one would ever be able to fully meet my emotional needs, this is the emotional deprivation schema at play and it is a bitch.

3) Touch starvation is real. Take a hot shower, put on your fluffiest bathrobe, make a hot cup of tea or hot chocolate, get a weighted blanket. Or go out with a free hugs sign. Arrange to see a good friend or family member, warn them you will want a good hug. They'll come through (see part 1). Some of my best hug memories are from when I explicitly asked trusted people for them.

4) It can all be a self fulfilling prophecy. You may not even be aware of your body language, eye contact, tone, what you are saying (open or closed questions?). If you believe you'll be forever lonely, you risk writing yourself off. Been there, I've been learning to be aware of myself (and continue to learn).

5) You can't predict the future. Sorry. You just can't. You don't know if you'll be lonely next month, you can guess and assume but there's a broad margin for error. You could go out tomorrow and have a movie moment and suddenly make a friend for life. Or you could wake up tomorrow and suddenly decide to do something brave that puts you in the way of people who will become friends over time. 

6) Don't aim for happiness. It's such a broad umbrella. Aim for contentedness and acceptance. Accept joy, accept grief, accept it all. It reminds you you're human, and sometimes it's shit to be human. Seek out joy. I'm straight up taking myself out on dates, consciously choosing to go alone to the symphony. It's okay to be alone. It's okay. You'll be okay.

7) Reflect on why you're here. Don't just blame it on others and society, how did you get here. What was your upbringing like? What were your parents like? What did you learn as a kid? What do you have to unlearn as an adult? I've had two great therapists who taught to me reflect non-judgementally. I am an exercise in curiosity. Be curious.

I stay at the dorms and attend classes online because I was exempted from attending classes physically. The only reason I came is because I wanted to escape from my abusive birth giver. 

While my peers were slowly getting used to socializing and going to classes physically, I hole myself up in my dorm room, thinking everything is comfortable the way it is. But then people start talking about how I’m not attending classes even though I live in the dorms and is only a few minutes away from the faculty.

Then I find out that a close friend of mine is chummy with the people who talked behind me. A doubt starts blooming inside my chest, I wonder if she ever tries to defend my name or at least tell them what she preached to me about how exempted students have the right to not attend physical classes. 

But then that same friend is acting distant and treating me like I’m some stranger.

Another friend called me unsafe and said she’d need space from me which I’m so relieved of because to be frank, her existence affects me negatively. She speaks negatively of her experience and her abuser which is I think is how she copes but I can’t be that place she vents to because I don’t want to be reminded of how I was abused by my birth giver and her bringing up the topic most definitely reminds me of my abuse very vividly. We’re at different stages of life — she’s still vengeful and I’m just struggling to find peace. And in my search for peace, I’d cut her off when she was expressing her anger when in reality, I had my own issues with people raising their voices when they’re angry and I’m at a point in life where I can’t handle this yet.

I don’t know why I’m feeling the way I’m feeling but it feels like nothing is going well and I’m struggling to keep it together but it feels like I’m just some insignificant spec of dust in this universe and I’m so scared of ending up alone — I’m scared that this is a new permanence in life; having no friends and not even having a place to call home. And I feel like I’m losing myself and whatever stability I’d known and I’m just so lost but I know the future is something I’m hopeful of so I’m holding onto that.

I have lived for 23 years going 24 this November but it seems I won’t be celebrating my 24th year of existence. I feel bad about my mother, father and brothers that I will leave them this soon but I’m also sorry that I can not be strong to hold on. 

Before I go, I will sleep for 5-6 hours then I hope someone here will be kind enough to share some story they would like me to read before I go. It could be anything just drop it here.

3. Excrise and stretch for and hour. Stretch 30 mins excrise 30 mins. Streching is enough most days and a very impotant one on the list.

4. 30 of outside time. You need to change up where you go outside. Sometime you just need to change the form of transportation.

5. Read. Im not sure what i dont read. But i do bet it should be here.

6. Getting sunlight is important

1875,PsalmoftheSad,1655692310,1,"I met this girl through work a week or two ago and decided to meet up for a range date on Thursday. Lots of fun -- it was even her idea to get dessert afterwards. For someone that has never been on a date before, this **REALLY** threw me for a loop. This last week or so of talking to her has been the most sporadic emotional rollercoaster I've been on in a long ass time. I laughed. I cried. The story became a part of me


Jokes aside though, I've been alone my whole life. I'm sure a lot of people here know what that's like and this girl gave me hope that maybe I'd finally get a chance to climb out of this hole of loneliness and abject misery. Nope. As per usual it was a red herring


I meet girls all the time, so I guess I'm being misleading. The interactions I have with them in person don't go further than a greeting, make her laugh a few times, she says what she needs (I meet them all through work because I can't find a social place to meet women without it coming off as creepy) and then leaves. Sometimes, in very rare cases, I'll give her my number and business card because she's just that gorgeous that I'll tempt fate, definitely punching above my own weight ... And it was this same girl that, two weeks ago, I did that to. She has been the only one in four years to actually text me.


Here's the catch though : she's shipping off for the army in less than a month. She signed up for a **five feckin year contract** and I won't see her till it's all over. To be honest? I'm not even sure society will still exist in five years. Who's to say she won't meet a guy in the service? That shit happens all the time.


There's **ALWAYS** a catch with the girls that I meet in person that seem at least a little interested in me. Either the ""relationship"" (and I use that term loosely) lasts less than a week, the timing is off or a combination of both. The girls I talk to online **don't** want to meet. Or they're fuckin nuts. Or both. It's like God himself wants me to be alone but will sometimes throw me a bone just to break up the monotony of being numb... Yet it somehow feels more cruel to be given such a gift knowing it won't last. What's worse? 



I hate having this timer on knowing this girl. She's awesome -- we're two very different people but have just enough in common to make things work. I know nothing will come out of... All this... But I guess the fact that I care at all in the first place shows I'm already emotionally invested. Maybe it's desperation? 


I could feckin ramble on for **hours** about how life's not fair and boohoo but it'd just be preaching to the choir. My **TL;DR** is :

1888,Voice-Strange,1655688993,1,"I () have been battling depression and a binge ED since around 7th grade so about 6 years now. I have ups and downs obviously, but I realize that my depression gets really bad when my ED does. When I turn to food for help, to fill a void. I for a while was doing really well. I was healthy, I was training for a bodybuilding competition, in a really healthy relationship, in love, I had lots of friends, and even though the “lots of friends” part  didn’t matter I had a very very close small circle of best friends, happy with myself for once, and wasn’t depressed or stuffing my face every night to feel happy. I can say that for the first time in my life I was genuinely happy. Well I fucked it all up. I made the mistake of getting on birth control thinking that I would be the one case that was different, who wouldn’t gain any weight, and convinced myself that I’d be a part of the 2% of people who lose weight on it. Go figure, I was incorrect. in fact I gained close to 60 pounds. It’s not that I was necessarily unhealthy but I was definitely unhappy. I was probably pushing an unhealthy weight. I don’t know but what I do know is that I refused to get on the scale, and when I went to the gynecologist a year later and finally saw what it had done to me I broke down and decided that that would be the last time I ever took birth control, and that I would suffer through agonizing cramps and endometriosis pain if it meant that I could finally be fucking happy with myself again. Why is this important you ask? My whole point is that my life was finally on track I felt like a real human being for that small period of time that I busted my ass to be the person I wanted to be. My birth control sent my depression to a nose dive. My senior year was absolutely awful I did almost nothing, and was barely involved in school like I normally am. I barely went out because I was so ashamed of how I looked and what I had done to myself that I just couldn’t bring myself to get out of bed because I was so unhappy. My friends stopped talking to me. That has more to do with the fact that they don’t like certain views that I have and I’m not as political in their favor as they originally thought. It actually really fucking hurt when they cut me off even though it was gradual. But I’ve now realized that I don’t really have any friends at all. My relationship hasn’t changed and I still love him deeply, but he’s literally all I have. No one ever checks in on me, nobody ever asks me to go out, nobody ever wants to hear about my life. I have to do all of that by myself. I have to invite people out. Most of the time they all seem too busy to make time for me. I put on a front that I don’t really give a fuck about anything but the truth is that I’m hurting so badly inside. It is so painful to try so hard to be likable and still feel like you’re never enough for anybody. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Even my two younger sisters I feel like they fucking hate me. I’m the oldest of three. My sisters are 16 and 15. They hang out all the time and despite my best efforts to be nice to them and invite them to do things it’s just like they want nothing to do with me. I just graduated high school and I feel like I should be so happy about that because I had such a hard time keeping up with my grades, but the truth is that I’m terrified because I know that I can’t really fake having friends anymore. Or at least in someway convince myself that there are people who like and care about me. I just want to know what’s wrong with me? Why does nobody care about me the way that I care about them? I have friends at work and stuff but they all have closer friends and none of them check up on me or invite me to things it’s almost like I have to invite myself.  I’m not even a first thought in their mind and then they’ll talk about the plans around me and be like “oh I guess you can go too”. I’m the friend that gets pushed to the side on the grass when there’s three of us walking on the sidewalk. I’m the friend that gets invited last. I’m The friend that gets ignored during group conversations and cut off. I’m the friend that puts their heart and soul into the friendships that I have and get absolutely nothing back. It just really hurts. I’m so lonely and empty inside. I really am trying so hard but life just feels absolutely impossible right now. I’m already in therapy for other things, so that’s out of the question. But I don’t feel like therapy can fix the fact that I’m just such an unlikable person. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I’m at that point of life where I don’t really care what people think of me as I don’t really care for myself. Trying to make friends is a waste of time. The people I consider friends don’t talk to me often. There is a line where I consider people to be friends or not. At this current moment, I don’t talk to others, other than my parents. I sympathize with people that post here just to share their feelings and not getting people to talk to them. I don’t personally start conversations with anybody since they only talk for one conversation. I guess I’m part of the problem then. I wasn’t always like this. Starting from 2020, I became isolated from others. My dislike for humanity grew. I got better at acting. I got better at not being me. I have become borderline-sociopathic, but I’m not mad at that. I don’t mind if my friends abandon me again. It’s not the first or the second time. There is one thing I have learned that I will hold onto until I die.

On the day that I first received her services, she made me feel SEEN, HEARD, and UNDERSTOOD. The message I sent is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

""Good day. Is there an initiative/program in place for members of the community with suicidal ideation? My life has plummeted since my diagnosis and other subsequent events. And I see no end in sight. Initially, I was able to evade the thoughts of self-harm. However, with each passing day, I find myself entertaining them, more and more. I, quite literally, have no one. And the thought of turning to you was met with great hesitancy, because I am no one to you. Additionally, you have your own personal concerns. Even though I have this persistent notion that letting you know what is going on is futile, I've chosen to reach out, because I am immensely afraid of what I will do to myself""

&amp;#x200B;

Upon reading the message, she phoned me. She said she was concerned. And she wanted to know why I was thinking of removing myself from this plane of existence. I told her; I held nothing back. When I told her that I was experiencing severe memory loss — which, for me, was a source of confusion, because my ability to recall things is typically astonishing — she said that my diagnosis, coupled with the series of unpleasant things that came after, was negatively impacting my cognitive faculties. She used the word 'trauma'.

&amp;#x200B;

She said she was going to get me help. She said she knew I didn't want anyone knowing about my situation, but that it was important for me to join a support group consisting of persons who were able to relate to me, so that my despair could be replaced by hope. She said she was glad that I had decided to turn to her. I started feeling LESS SCARED and LESS ALONE, because of the promises she made—promises that she did not deliver on.

&amp;#x200B;

THAT'S ALL I WANTED, YOU KNOW. All I wanted was for someone to see me and actively show me that I mattered. Because I didn't think I mattered. I still don't. All I wanted was for someone to care enough to lift me up and guide me while I stumbled to find my way to the end of the tunnel that is devoid of light. During the call, she made me feel a flicker of hope. She said the fact that we both entered the world on the same day made was significant to her somehow. Yet, on the 11th of June, despite her not making good on any of the promises, I waited for her to call or send an instant message to say happy birthday. That would have meant a lot to me, because it would have made me feel like I was being thought of and remembered fondly. But I got no call. I got no instant message.",lonely,LONELINESS.

So if you wanna just go to go, preferably looking for someone who is in the north east US, tell me a little about yourself, your favorite music if you have preference, include your age &amp; please be chill I'm trying to have a good summer and if things go really well we can talk about keeping things going,  I just wanna make a friend in general. And of course everything is on me for tickets, travel and what have yea.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick lil summary on me,

I am 26M lived in NY all my life, moved to MA three years ago. Funny, down to earth, sincere, can keep a conversation going...just start one, 5'10-5'11, italian+greek, can have a smart mouth at times all in good humor/intentions/vibes, when I'm home I like to play on PC with some friends, enjoy most shows on hbomax/apple tv, enjoy re-watching some so if you haven't seen something you wanna watch together I'm all for it. My fridge is always stacked with red bull....not that I don't like a good coffee here and there. Have a thing about the number 22, you'll find out soon enough, the color green always catches my eye. I am patient, hard working, and always will see through to something that I start.

&amp;#x200B;

If this summer you have nothing going on, and you wanna take a chance at having some good times and meet someone like myself, I wanna meet you. So lets try this out, with a smile.",lonely,Bit forward of a flex -26M-,2022-06-20 09:31:02

1905,lalalalallalalaal,1655681305,1,"So this happened a couple years ago when I was 15 years old. I had just met this new girl in my class and I thought now is probably a good time to start looking for a relationship, so I started talking to her and surprisingly we had a lot in common, we both liked politics and the first few weeks were just us discussing a bunch of cultural issues and we didn't disagree on much.

I was becoming very attracted to her and asked her out on a date to which she said yes. It was just walking around our hometown and since I've never been on a date before I kinda just talked to her like I had previously been doing. She seemed kind of upset at the end of the date when I didn't make any moves or anything but she planned a second date with me.

we went on a few more and I still hadn't initiated any physical contact I couldn't even hold her hand once and I still don't know why. At the end of the final date she was visibly pissed off when I told her goodbye. She acted very annoyed with me, so I broke up with her right there since I didn't feel attracted to her anymore. She responded by calling me a fucking psycho, which kind of hurt me because I didn't know what I was doing during any of this, it was a complete shot in the dark for me and I even clarified that I had never been in a relationship before this so I don't understand why she didn't just break up with me first if she was so annoyed by my inexperience.

It's been around 2 years since then and I just keep hearing those words she said to me in my head over and over whenever I think about trying to look for another relationship. I get completely put off the whole thing because what if my stupidity ends up just hurting someone else.

I have become a very isolated person and I can tell it's not good for my mental health. I've become much more brooding and just feel like I'm in an overall lower mood. I need people to be around and talk to, I like the challenge of conversation and without it I just feel kind of worthless.

I really want a significant other but feel guilty about this since I worry she would feel burdened or repulsed by me if she found out how depressed and broken I am inside.

When I play a game I will either quit playing out of boredom or out of frustration because it doesn't bring any entertainment. In the last couple of weeks I barely played any games at all. The only time I did was if I got bored scrolling through youtube I would play GTA 5 until I got bored of that. Yesterday I've reached my low point and deleted all of my games and save data from my PS4 and basically turned my PS4 account private. Today I've been sitting behind my laptop all day not knowing what to do. I'm bored of youtube, I have no idea what to watch anymore. I have no idea what to do in general anymore. I want to do something that is quick, easy to pick up and it needs to be something I can drop down at any moment. I like painting, but that requires time and I need to gather stuff when I want to paint. And if I have to do something else or if I have to go somewhere I can't just quit. I have to clean up and put away everything. I have no friends so there is no reason for me to go outside. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with my life.

They all keep hating, bullying, harassing, making fun of me, and basically fucking my whole life up.

This all peaked today when 3 of them decided to play a prank on me, by fucking up the whole Minecraft server. It is not the prank I am mad about, but the coordination these people were able to achieve, a few of them who I thought didn’t hate me much.

As a male, I just feel like girls are friendlier and less cold. Their insults don’t seem ill-intentioned, they seem like teasing. Also, in my country, due to raging homophobia, boys can’t even HUG or *TOUCH* eachother because they’ll be bullied for “being gay”.

When I’m with other boys I have to worry about EVERY WORD I SAY as they’ll use ANYTHING against me. When I’m with girls I do not have to worry about this. They seem more forgiving.

Unfriending these people (most of which are males) will probably lead to me not hanging out with anyone since the people that are ok to me are either girls and I’d look weird and probably they’ll probably not gonna let me hang out with them, or they hang out with people that are not ok to me.

I’ve been searching for a long time now. 4 years of trying dating apps to as many matches as I can count on one hand. I don’t like using them because it really hurts my self esteem. Makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me or that I’m just unattractive. I think I’m a pretty good looking guy but I’m never given a chance or ever shown any interest by anyone. 

I’ve tried long distance searching this year and have been met with even more disappointments. From catfishing to constant ghosting. And whenever I would meet someone who seemingly is a good fit things go extremely south in ways you couldn’t possibly imagine. It’s been very cruel and emotionally exhausting.

Right now I feel like giving up. Now I just have this never ending feeling of overwhelming sadness. Honestly I just wanted to vent this somewhere cause I feel like it helps me feel a bit better.

1990,ef0529,1655655969,1,"As a child, I used to be the nicest kid — even then I had no friends. I would attempt to help other kids with stuff I understood etc. Kids did not like me I was a “nerd” a “teacher pet” I was a stupid kid who would have got called that regardless even if I was it or not I was not even a nerd a struggled in school when I was younger. Neither of those has changed and I'm 17. (All that's changed is Kids being even more judgemental I couldn't give a fuck about helping out one of these assholes anymore)

I switched schools two periods into being in the school I went to the guidance office as I “heard” kids talking very negatively about me. The same reason I transferred. Turns out it was not happening at all. I went to the hospital as the school sent me to get checked out. Warning.


I lied about having thoughts of killing myself to the psych doctor. I got released from the little area they had me in — went home and the next day I drank bleach. Turns out it does not kill you. Also I left my house when I did it as I did not want my dead body to be found at home or by one of my parents. Someone gave me milk it's likely why I did not have my stomach cut open so they can save my intestines and all. When/if I do think of doing it again I think of this experience.

This resulted in me being sent into the psych ward for a month. It was an interesting and much-needed journey. I was actually very social with the people in there as it could have been worse — i became close with 3 people one being my roommate. The other two being girls one closer than the other. My roommate and I saw eye to eye with many things we enjoyed talking about similar topics — you’d find something as that's all you were able to do there aside from sleep or read a book. It was like prison you were allowed to leave your room when you ate, had group therapy, individual therapy, or for “game time” which is when a lot of stuff occurred. This one kid was in there for attempting to stab a police officer yup they put somebody like that in the same facility as sucidal teens. Also kids in there for other violent sort of things — I believe there should be two type of psych wards 1. For depressed people etc 2. For people who are a threat to others. That's aside from the point though. 

He's a short little 14-year-old who ran his mouth and I swear to God I wanted to beat the shit out of him so badly. I needed to take a step back though and realize this reflected on him and his insecurities though and being a stupid 14-year-old. We were all there. He was hindering my and others process in there I believe. He kept calling me gay as well when I'm straight as well which came with a insult to injury as I have always been called gay for no reason. Even the second girl the last time I talked to her (like 2 months ago.) said “you give off this gay vibe” and was attempting to make it easier for me to come out or something. Like what the fuck. Anyway that's it was actually not horrible being in there but yeah.

The first girl who I was closer with who had attempted like 3 times before sadly (it's even worse she's very smart and attractive. And I'm not exaggerating) we talked over messages a bit after we released not a crazy amount but it was fine. Let me stop writing an entire story. There's a program where you go once you’re discharged — you can only go once. So she was not there. Instead she was sent straight back to school with a lot of pressure after an attempt as well. The discharge program is in the same building as the psych ward. I saw her back in the psych ward again. My program ended back in April have not talked or heard from her since. Wrote her a message asking what happened and saying corny shit about how life is great when I don't even believe that so she’d see it when she got out and she still has not responded months later. I deleted it and resent a simpler message asking what happened as I'm writing this. She should be able to see it if she is not in some sort of program etc for her safety (she was talking about them sending her to one of them when I was in there.) Don’t know if i’ll ever hear from her again. 

That sucks considering she was the only person I was really close with from there. I went back to school again sat alone and had no body. One day a girl sat by me for no reason. I said why are you sitting here and she fuckin said “is anyone sitting here” in a sassy voice all I could say is no. We had a brief convoy never saw her again. I didn't say or do anything wrong in the convo in fact I know I did well just I skipped school almost everyday &amp; stuff. Apparently she remembered me from elementary school as well I did not remember her.

I wake up daily to nothing. no notifications. no one checking up on me irl or online. i could drop dead and id be dust before anyone took notice.

 Nobody gives a shit. its the same story again and again. medical professionals gave up on me. Medication does not work, it actually makes it worse. 

trying for years. im drained. I'm worn out. its insanity.

I had a poor effort with my last volume. To which I want to be making excuses. I wrote it, published it, &amp; showed it to people. Being an amateur is no fun but it’s free because there is no responsibility to it, which allows for something fun. Which is the result of freedom &amp; having internet access. Do &amp; publish. Which is in a public fashion &amp; manner. Though underlying, I do hope it helps someone, somewhere, or my high dream is that it sparks someone's mind &amp; contributes more to individual philosophy. 

2 - 

Again, I might try to use each chapter on one single theme. With random thoughts attached to it. I don't think I’ll ever be fully coherent. But hope expressed in any other way besides realism can be held as fantasy. I think these words are some subconscious way to achieve my own immortality. But a failure to understand oneself, the external, &amp; so on, any point or form of criticism is interrupted as a personal criticism, if it’s in relation to one’s distraction, that the one being criticized will be attacked for puncturing that illusion that functions like a drug, either verbally or physically, sometimes both. When economics isn’t achievable rather than taking it up as a social issue, political, or even simply as economically, the mainstream &amp; to an extent, subcultures too, receive it as a personal attack. When there is a lack of understanding. Which is the potential risk when ending at least some sort of formal education or a personal undertaking in the continued learning. It’s when the celebrity sage comes into play or some figurehead that comes out of the fog. The illusion upheld beres nothing like the reality lived underneath. The people demand someone new. At the beginning of 2021, when a changing of American presidents happened, there hasn’t been a political fuck up in years, often the victims aren’t in understanding, so they protest. Entertainment is a great pacifier. In freedom, hedonism has taken place, why? Because it’s free. It’s well documented that the sex industry, main prostitution, is the world's longest trade or business. Consumerism has affected everything we do. Including religion &amp; spirituality. That tension is real. I don’t know what I offer, I am a loner, not many people in my life whom I can call at any time, even the ones whom I do converse with regularly, they complain about the wall I put up. Which is not a pleasant feeling to feel or a bit of wisdom that I know. I don’t think I’ve written anything that can be offered in a practical sense. Other than some words to motivate people to think for themselves, to write down a personal philosophy, or maybe just something to think about in their own world &amp; mind. In the altruistic vibe inside, I want any of my mystics whose testamentary writings go unnoticed, soldiers of the century. Though I didn’t stray away too far from my original idea of just writing in stream consciousness. And I’m going to miss everyone when I go fully, monk. 

3 - 

During the attempting writing of the last volume, it was not like I found God, but witnessed a warmth when interacting with a person I know. Which has thrown out, well not entirely of my sense of self. I began looking into orthodox Christianity. Like most in the west, it’s either Christianity or catholicism. My focus on thinking has changed because of it. Or at least a sense of self has changed. By luck, I have found the woman’s version, grow. Where prior, it has only been feminism &amp; some writings in criticism towards men's rights movements. Which, wgtow is an area I am most looking forward to exploring. So far, it’s not as far-ranging as the mgtow counterpart is, &amp; because of that, not as in-depth. The instrumental reason of interest in those groups, because at least the ideals of it, is doing life alone, but as a functioning adult who’s aiming for a healthy mind &amp; life. Like other similar subgroups, they have so many undertones of toxic traits to them. Of course, being a loner has something else largely to do with it. Various differing reasons, but I am joining, not fully advocating the above-mentioned groups. Well, not at least now. But in terms of wgtow, I have found countless online vlogging channels of women choosing to be childfree, marriage free, which is an area of exploration. Of course, I’m more likely going to find more men's groups, mainly due to being a male. Prior to writing this. Finding God or at least thinking of God now may be aligning to my No Fap or semen retention journey, which in other words, cut out the objectification of sex &amp; beauty in my single life. Well, that is my reason for doing so. Personally had come to a sense of no sex outside a committed relationship. In the meantime, porn, more healthy thoughts when it comes to lust, beauty, etc. For which FYI, the days between the viewing of porn have increased largely, there’s been times when in old habits, remembering NoFap, I would stop watching the video. Don’t leave the condom on the staircase in the apartment block. 

4 - 
One thing I had issues with, not leaving enough time from when the last volume was written to write a new one. Though I did have the intent to think it through before writing, with some sort of structure for the whole thing. Which I pretty much gave up. I did try to read over articles before each chapter before writing, jotting down notes, thinking it through, whatever. To which I gave up early on as well. Of course now, just writing it, researching is something that I really need to work on. On that note, letting other people read is another good blessing. In today’s modern technology, anyone, well, the everyday common person can now publish their thoughts instantly, either as a blog or vlog, to some platform, to some amount of people. Which for cultural history, social history, &amp; anthropology history which is so important. I think now this year, it is more common for people should personally share what they shouldn’t. For this reason, I want others to read it, to see if it makes sense, maybe give me a different pov directly, &amp; let me know if any idea isn’t well developed, let alone if it’s on the right track or not. That kind of feedback is so important. I’ve properly repeated myself so many times. The only real control I have ever had is in the development of my character. 

5 - 
The freedom of speech argument will always be undergoing, regardless of the period of humanity, with that, since people are still alive, the interpretation of history &amp; the access to it isn’t parallel to the notion of free speech which is lacking in my view, will both issue for humanity. People can be deeply misguided. It’s a little-known fact outside certain learning circles that the nazi party made sure every German home had a free radio. Let alone the continued failed understanding of money &amp; the economic market. Compassionate capitalism allows for empathy &amp; emotions to be put in place. It took how long to implement the idea of matured apprenticeships, which most countries don’t have. I recognize that broad statement without forgetting cultural differences. Without access to information, I wouldn’t have been exposed to thinkers, such as Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges, &amp; Karl Popper. Let alone not have access to countless hours of Milton Friedman. For such broad introductions to the world, Niall Ferguson is a good start. But this is what happens in life. This is not necessarily an inherent immoral action, it can be argued as a sense of growth in relation to the individual. In the ability to be aware of growth, new information, different ways of action, the ability to think through the day, self-care, using the time to read, watch lectures &amp; interviews. I am regretting my early adulthood. Where I had worked entry-level jobs between sessions of active addiction, in the rare moments when I wasn’t doing either, I was passed out or gave into sloth &amp; gluttony. Freedom itself has given me room to change. That in itself has come at a price. The awareness of time that I had of never leaving my memory, attaching care to the wrong areas, issued emotions &amp; time spent to what I was thinking, which I can personally vouch for that it was more sinful to the actions as a free agent I performed. I guess the point that I’m trying to make, the second volume of ‘liftings’ had poor English, which due to my ignorance did not double-check prior to publishing &amp; became insecure about showing it to anyone I know in my daily life, which is still out in publication. The third one is just plain laziness &amp; inexperience. Reasons to mention it, reasons to keep it in public publication as the way it is, to keep the awareness of human flaws &amp; to hope to highlight others, which are worth pondering on their thoughts. For that, I’m suggesting anything be left undone, not finished, half done, lazy, whatever, I think too much for the love of lowbrow art has taken hold too much inside. Where avant-garde or direct cinema is something that I’m happy in doing. I am hoping to help out with anything critical of what I produce. Without criticism, everything is on a slower trajectory. I dare say, with less quality too. But, what the avant-garde has done for art, the least I can do is to help the variations of performing actions. 

6 - 

Not until I started writing it, that I actually wanted to write a philosophy for loners. Which is quite ignorant. A loner is more on the high side for individuals. Writing a collective philosophy is much easier. Knowing human boundaries is not fun. The underlying critiques of freedom, regardless of which state or areas of that state are always questions of morality. Depending on whom you ask, it’s not only a matter of moral behavior but issues with ignorance. Writing philosophy has never been an easy task. Each younger generation that comes into some sort of independent thinking, as they should, begin to challenge the immediate generation above them, it's easy to pass it over as idealism, ideas should never be shy, neither looking at them either. To possibly account for so many people, which I do not know, not even a small fraction of people. In itself to attempt to write for such people is a fallacy. The cult of self is some form of adultery. But I guess it’s one loner throwing out ideas, concepts, whatever I said, would hopefully give other people a sense of being a loner healthily. 

7 - 

Like the other three, I don’t know what this piece will entail. I had the strong thought of talking or writing my thoughts about God. How that has played its part in my previous individual philosophy, which did originally get inspired by Anton Lavey’s, ‘The Satanic Bible’. Though I am sure those strong themes will remain somehow. With any sort of life, one would know that it changes, reality in itself has its own mind. I hope I can at least conjure up ways to express in the written word how the individual can develop their own identity in a healthy way, without forgetting the wide community, family, peers, dating life, basic life experiences, culture, &amp; art &amp; politics. Most of all, somehow improve. In the last volume, I have sent it out to some people I know, I hope I can work up the nerve to ask for some feedback. I think the whole piece was only around 30 pages or so. After all, we spend more time with ourselves than we do with anyone else. Hopefully, expand on updates in my personal life. I don’t really, maybe this is all some random obscure moral quest, like most of my past publications, it won’t be any sort of major marketing, links to my YouTube films, sometimes a tweet or a post elsewhere, that's it. See what happens. Which philosophy should never be subjected to any sort of law or the cultural norm? There isn’t really any comfort in knowing that learning comes to an end. 

8 - 

My hesitant temperament to join any church is perhaps giving up anything that's good or had worked for me. Or a wanting change initiated from the outside. Maybe the worry of letting people in. Maybe the fear of discovering something that doesn’t sit well, like how many motivational speakers or wellness people have you encountered that are selling something? Maybe I should turn to art to help find the articulation of my concerns. Explaining my personal history with addiction, that indirectly takes up admission that I’ve done something wrong. Of course, the lack of self-care is a part of the seven deadly sins. The petty crime. Burning of drugs. Using my money at the pub. Never paying rent. The lying. Using other people. Regardless of the past, I wasn’t born into it all, so I had lived some sort of life. I’ve fornicated too. It’s not necessarily the acts that bother me. Just the overall feel, intent, the avoidance of wanting to be a good person. I spent several years in this comfort &amp; knowing. Even now, habits act, &amp; things I’m still familiar with, that I do not think will go astray disappear. Looking back, I think it was the safety net of being young &amp; never bearing responsibility. Being in fear of both political &amp; social rights, in a crowd of people that want some sort of direction towards Heaven, that have a chant of protests that differ from mine. Maybe the growth, the path, the journey, whatever you call it, doing Fatiha on another person's pace, not of my own. Let alone the fear of rejection I have. I don’t know what will truly heal me, I honestly don’t think any good that I do now will separate me from where I’ve been. I still think that the betterment of humanity still rests on the shoulders of the individual. Backward ache. 

TWO 

1 - 

Almost everything that has come to light, something discovered, new or renewed, a new product for the consumer, a locally developed landscape, building, or business has an allure of promising life-changing substance to it. This includes branches of philosophy. With effective altruism, some of the writings, well a lot of it, fail to include a person's selfishness, greed, &amp; insecurity. Where so often people conflict selfishness with self-care, personal truth as moral truth. The complexity of the world should never be understated. As a result, what is introduced into the wider community is presented with the results of being a born-again person. More specifically from the 80 the business culture or more pacific, wall street has gained the first place on the forefront of the figurehead for the working life. Where so many blue-collar people began to dress as Gordon Gecko. Where some fail to notice, a human invention, an industry no longer relying on the earth, but from solely human structure or purely human values in human ideas. 

2 - 

Over the last few weeks, I looked beyond the face of Simone Weil, yeah I began looking into her work, but hearing a podcast about her, &amp; watching a documentary about it, it’s not the fact that she’s a modern philosopher, but for the first time where her biography is more famous than her philosophical works. Where previous, well, it’s still in play that the biography is looked at after, in order to better understand the person, understanding the person means understanding the philosophical works better to continue only or have the dominant theme of philosophy only. For the second time, I saw philosophy connected to action, outside some nuggets in the world of effective altruism. Her life wasn’t underdeveloped, despite dying at thirty-four, but her substance in philosophical papers was. There is a lesson to be learned in that. Her religious life has had a lasting impact on her. An area I’m wanting to explore in her life.  

3 - 
There are plenty of concerns about organized religion. When writing on anything, I’ll admit it, it is hard to remain objective. I won’t be comparing my problems with the wider community or to any individual. It’s not moral for me to do it. In my essence, being conformed to any expression is a worry. Considering living in relation to God, life, or higher ideals. 
 
4 - 

Rudolf Steiner, which part of his philosophy, is a philosophy for the individual. But looking at his work, he writes broadly across all areas, with writings on mysticism, kooky areas, &amp; who knows what. Writing for the individual philosophy theory incurs writing across multiple areas of life. 

5 - 

I’ve been listening to Alan Watts on &amp; off for years. But it was for therapy reasons &amp; nothing for philosophical reasons. 

6 - 

Following patterns, ways, traditions, &amp; the format, is a part of the day. Everything that religion has a way to it, a format, a tradition, rules, commandments, &amp; so on. Differences between all, sure. At the moment, I still stand by that people are corrupted. Everything else, anything built from them, around them, for them, depending on them. It requires an emotional willingness to want to learn. Because to fall under a minimum lifestyle across the board, something is incredibly wrong. The humility which is so hard to grasp, to put it all into action takes out so much of life that too often the person has reached an age where there is enough life to look back on. Though no one fully knows what it takes to gain salvation &amp; that's freedom. When one does not understand completely, one utterly fails oneself. Thought that I’ll more on the thought of God. at the moment, it's an underlying vibe or feeling that I just want to be more grounded. Or seek out some sort of remedy, finding a way to search for forgiveness, both from the outside &amp; for myself. The first step to understanding the world is to understand thyself. And no, I don’t want to die. I am not one who commands ideas through words clearly. Through a disguised illusion, a personalized fantasy I’ve created over time, allowing myself to distract, justify, avoid. I’ve talked about before, in regards to my past addictions, which I did turn out to be a complete junkie, imagine a drug addict's behavior. I’ve lied, I’ve been self-centered, difficult, couldn’t say no, quick to anger, quick to judge, jealous, a self of entitlement, should I go on? I’m sure I’ve left out traits &amp; of course the details. I don’t know who’ll be reading this, if they know me, I’m sure they can think of things to say. There’s nothing I can do now that can change the past. Nothing. Not at least the memory. Sure it’s cliche to say to let it go, it is what it is, that was yesterday, &amp; so on. But when it comes to one, I’m sure that it applies to everyone else, when immersed in private affairs, it can't just shift, at least for me. Maybe this is all just a matter of my emotions. I’ve gone through passages of time when I do not take the time to self-reflect or attempt to practice anything in virtue or growth. I have spent time developing self-knowledge. I think I’m a slave to my own emotions, which is very human, &amp; a slave to my ignorance too. That both can be summed up as very human. In previous volumes, I’ve mentioned my weight issues. Sloth. If I dig into the individuality, the ‘i’ are collected from various facets that aren’t compatible. Hence my confliction, for that very weight gain was during a duration of thawing out. 

7 - 

There is no artist, no thinker, no politician, celebrity, no one on earth, in this reality, no family member, peer or close friend, even the lover, worth devoting one’s life to emulating. It has struck me how unethical the void of life has led so many people away. Maybe it’s on account of feeling time passing towards death, it’s a relentless endless moment for the time being. In the enlightenment period, secular ethics finally had reached the mainstream, then spread out 7 became normal. Where arguments about morality are in discussion. Where the local priest, pastor, or minister, let alone what title that person has, is now no longer the entire go-to person. I think that what raises some people, is the connection of current skill, the void between, &amp; the ideal. Which is the inarticulate mind turns to heroes or idols. I mean like, you do know they all have the same desires, flaws, shortcomings, insecurity, at least on the very human level, made the same mistakes. I’m sure there’s plenty of literature discussing the disconnect between the effort &amp; the reward. When another scandal reaches the front page of tabloids, we scream, we protest over moral renewal, change, something new when the puncture of illusion has been breached. Good writing isn’t what stirs the mind to think, but engages the reader to make an effort in action. Still, it’s easier to be in the collective than the individual. Think about Obama’s campaign slogan, ‘yes we can’. Well yeah. The area that I strangely respect him in, is smoking. Life is harsh, smoking ether like a rolled weed, abused in finding identity, hug me, don’t reject other ugly, it was written that God doesn't like ugly. Perhaps turning to these idols is a way of passing the time, the excuse not to think of ourselves. In the awareness of it all. It’s bleak in the knowledge of death. There is no cure for getting people to think. The act of tearing something apart or the unwillingness or the avoidance of it loses its meaning. The value of looking at other people in the way they live their life is to work out the right &amp; wrong, any actions that can presently apply in a practical way. Simone Weil proposed that attention itself is the rarest gift. We all judge. Myth has never died. That it’s easy to look at people &amp; have it all worked out. What they do in private, is all very human. It's a safe way to discover what we might love. Finding qualities. Finding knowledge. We can even live through that person's life. Kerouac does a great job of romanticizing more of the modern world. Without knowing them, it's easy to surpass any wrongdoing. Like a toxic relationship. An individual remains, learns what they can, &amp; continues. I’m always curious to witness the breakdowns of a person. We idolize them, but the conspiracy boils up to the top. Regardless if you think Satan lives or not, to turn away from vice, character flaws &amp; evil, then your indirect enabling can be used as a reason in the why. 

8 - 

The matrix of morals, the matrix of the mind of all. It's demanding, exhausting, &amp; often never finding the language, which could explain the lack of action in the ethical actions, well at least a large portion of vice. It becomes a fairytale or myth when one ‘doesn’t want to think about it. Actions are the cultural depth of the humanities. Critical thinking provides the oxygen to the lungs of culture. The Devil is written as once was the most beautiful Angel before the exile. In the birth of wrong, it is from not wanting to think about it. Why I support individual philosophy, I don’t write passages of poetics in the hope. I’m very well aware of the lack &amp; knowing full well of those better, how many celebrities can you name off the top of your head. When I write Daniel Tammett, how long did the google search take? Perhaps not all theory needs it, moral philosophy along with its broad range of it often lacks writing that provides the needed large volumes of variances in practical ways in putting into practice. I’m in the right to want a critical response to anything that I write, but wrong to expect it. Not all of us can be Audrey Hepburn, where we’re born into innocence &amp; grace. There’s spirituality for sale. The modern wave of it started with the hippies. Hendrix himself is or was the mainstream of his day. The bible had the award of being both the most bought book &amp; stolen one, at the same time, for so long. Language itself is important, it’s in our art too, though the inarticulate ways, most of us never go out trying to express our belief system to what it’s not. Hence the search for attaching to a collective group. Being a recluse from society, you’ll need to utterly rely on the earth. Clean water, the soil, whatever it is, an escape from reliance is never there, which will never be fully articulated anywhere. We want what we want. So often we fail, in inarticulate ways, we’ve committed to guilt, shame &amp; regret in the familiar way that's already in existence. But nothing can dictate anything that lays out conditions over any terrain that leads to independent thinking. The way its structure sets up a large portion of devotion. Countless years. An optical illusion. Though it’s in our value system. I’m not going to argue to extend the number of years of compulsory education. Education is practical philosophy. Proposing to normalize adults to write out &amp; publish their regrets. To have those regrets out in the open. Learning but the environment. No one likes a grown child. The problems of alienating anything, particularly in a free society, it’s going to be found. It's a political thing too, we all pay tax, our work generates the service or the item, critical thinking first, labor second, that labor generates, pulls together closer that tension between the individual &amp; the wider community. It’s a well-known fact that fast food is cheaper &amp; extremely unhealthy for us, though most people in the world can recognize those golden arches. So often people reach middle age than a sweeping wave of thoughts when it happens, that isn’t a good day. Something that I urge people who work in hospitals, nursing homes, &amp; private nurses to start talking more about, is the vast amount of people who die alone. I mean, it’s just not the lack of physical presence, but the actual thinking-awareness &amp; the emotions of loneliness.",lonely,tried to write loner philosopher,2022-06-19 21:59:51
2023,slowsundaythoughts,1655639712,1,"I've written a lot in the past 24 hours. I wrote more than I ever did in weeks, I think. I journaled for a couple of hours before our breakup and then after. I wrote a lot to my closest friends and composed random Reddit posts. It's how I process my emotions, especially as someone who takes a long time to understand the gravity of a situation. Journaling is how I get my emotional release.

Journaling prepared me for the breakup. And it helped me see the whole situation calmly and clearly. It made me realize that we truly were meant to part ways, and it couldn't have gone any other way.

I'm holding up better than I thought I ever would. It's my first breakup, after all. And he was my first love.

I guess it's because I have no regrets. I loved him with all my heart and gave it my all. I tried until the very end, and I stuck with my values. And I don't regret a second with him. He was worth it.

2034,nacho_and_fox,1655633723,1,"So, the a couple months ago I began to feel as if I am not content with what I have done in my life so far, and I was thinking back on the rules that my parents have enforced on me, and began to think if it was all ok, 

Let me introduce myself first, I'm 15, in grade 10, and I started school a year early, I'm in an all boys school and I've been in one my entire life, my parents have always restricted who I talk to and what I do, i have never had a conversation with a female other than my mother In my entire life, and have never spoken to a female before(the only time I have was perhaps in a hospital with a female nurse to check my vitals  and at restaurants with female waitress otherwise I have never spoke to another female I'm my whole life), sure maybe that's normal and it's not s big deal , but I'm also not allowed to have any freinds over or go to freinds houses, and so it means it's difficult for me to make freinds, I've also got family link on my phone and I my parents check all my social media and who I talk to on my messages, except for reddit, because I have found a way to factory reset one of my old phones that my parents have forgotten about and use reddit there, the phone is hidden and is dead when I'm not using it and my parents do not know the password, so now my parents cannot monitor or check anything on my reddit, and there is a different Google account on it so they have no control over it.

I also have to deal with a lot of stress with school because I have to do well and my parents forced me to do 3 extra subjects, and that's brings my total subjects to English, AP math, a second language, AP computer sciences, AP engineering, biology, AP physics and chem  and geography, the only subject I got to choose, and in top of all of this I have to do flight school whilst I'm in school and my parents expect no less than A's in school, I work so hard, but my parents are never satisfied. once I got a 100% average for engineering at the end of the semester/term and the grade average was 64%and I could almost see my parents smile a little, 

I'm also not allowed to watch any sort of tv shows other than scientific documentaries, and I was allowed to watch avengers and transformers, and a couple other movies once, but other than that, I'm not allowed to watch any of the cool series on Netflix or anything like that, 

I even come home exhausted after school at 6pm, after going to school at 6:30 in the morning, and I try to exercise but I literally do not have the energy, especially after studying, 

Oh and to top it all of my parents argue and fight a lot, like a lot, and my dad used to physically and mentally abuse my as a child by telling me how stupid I am and throwing me across the room, 2 years back he hit me so hard that I fractured my hand and didn't go to the hospital for a week until eventually I convinced them that it was sore enough and it was a really bad fracture,

So perhaps I'm just being a bit irrational, but um I just wanted to put this out there.

But if you think this is bad for some reason, by this standard, trust me this it gets way worse.

She also had some traumas with men in the past so even then i felt ashamed as a man for what happened to her.

2043,Budget-Ad6704,1655627524,1,"I joined this group in hopes of gaining some understanding.  I have a 12 year old son who battles loneliness and depression.  He's sweet and kind and funny and just perfect.  Yet, he hasn't formed any real friendships.  He's wicked smart and very mature and his interests and quirks just dont align with kids his age.  

We're pretty different.  I'm outgoing and have a core group of 7 friends I've had since I was a child.  We're all in our late 30s/early 40s now and still as talk daily.  I can't relate to what he's enduring but I desperately want to help.  I've spoken to him, taken him to therapy, taken him to join extracurricular activities he's interested in, reached out to other parents to schedule hangouts for him and classmates, made time daily to spend with him, flown with him to DC and NYC for one on one dad/son vacations to visit museums (which he loves).  Ive encouraged him, told him I love him,  held him at night... just everything I can think of.  

My big brother died in my arms when I was a kid.  Shot himself.  It devastated me.  Not long ago, on the way to school, my son told me he wanted to die and I had to pull over the truck. I just lost it.  Sobbed like a child.  First time Ive cried since 1996.  Begged him to never do that.  I think it shook us both a bit.

I just don't know what to do or say or provide him that will make him feel loved and seen and worthy of living.  I'd take every bit of his pain if I could but I'm just a dumb old country boy from Texas and I don't know how to help him.

Empty streets. 

Just the two of us. 

In broad daylight. 

Its unnerving.

The only time I am seen is when someone is paid or paying to do so. Even then it is hit or miss if I am noticed on anything but a superficial level. I stopped using self-check out at the grocery store for the off chance of eye contact or a conversation about the weather. I shop daily to min/max the chances. Its a numbers game at this point. 

I am, or was, a technician and would go door to door for my job. I have actually had people open the door and show me to their office then forget I was there. I would come out to tell them what I found and have them jump out of their skin at the sight of me. It happened often, 2-3 times a week.  I even had one person tell me she forgot I was there. She had let me in the door not 15 minutes earlier.

I got in the habit of attaching my keys to my tool bag so they would rattle and clank against my kit. So my customers could hear me coming, like you do in the woods so you don't startle the wildlife and get mauled.

I recently switched to an engineering role and work outside the home exclusively. I didn't think how much I would miss those over-the-shoulder customers. The arm chair tech gurus and tool enthusiasts. The single-minded hobbists' who can't help but tell anyone about their obsession.  Widows and widowers. Sometimes you can make a true connection with those people. Sometimes it's obvious they would be telling the same thing to a house plant; they just have to get it out. For their own good. Kind of like this.

The one exception is my son. He sees me all too well. I try to hide my distress from him and do sincerely enjoy the time we have together. He knows though... something has changed with his dad.  I took him to the park this afternoon and he immediately made friends with the others on the playground. You can't help but see him, he is a bright soul.

There was mother nearby, I gave her a smile and nod just to let her know I was there in case of playground disputes. She looked away immediately,  no acknowledgement whatsoever. This I am used to, its expected. Still when my son comes up for his water bottle and asks why my eyes are always watery now its hard to get a smile on my face. ""It's allergies little bud, just allergies."" 

I am profoundly lonely and in this I know I am not alone.

If you reader have made it this far I thank you and ask that once a day you notice someone.

Just learn to have fun on your own, do thing by yourself, I get that some of you have a need for attention and affection from people, it's a human need but instead of complaining about it try to figure out why you don't get those things. Expose yourselves to the public, talk to people, find common interests. You're not the only ones that feel this way about life. Also, if you feel lonely around people it is mostly because of you, stop waiting for people to acknowledge you and if they don't, it's their fault. Go talk to them, ask questions, do something. Most of the people here are lazy and scared, they complain about certain things but don't go out of their comfort zone to do them. How can you say that you're tired and miserable and that you hate this world when all you've done is stay inside. I got to say it, most people are pussies, that's it. If you feel like shit, instead of complaining just do something about it, get over it, I'm tired of humanity nowadays, with each and every generation people become softer and more sensible, creating whole communities based on common insecurities.

When I use dating apps I am the one who ALWAYS makes the first move, and more, I am sometimes the only one responsible for keeping the conversation going.

Rarely when I am messaged first, it's always something vulgar related to some assumption about my body or sexual role, it's never a f*cking cute message, seems like nobody has to gain my trust or intimacy, it's already a public domain subject.

I was talking to a guy the other day, and the conversation was going fine, just sharing jokes and pictures of our drawings, and out of nothing he started to send nudes and talking dirty, and I was like?!?!? Why??!?!?

We're classmates, and our seats are close to each other. We are at the very back of the classroom. His seat was in front of me, and I was at his back. Whenever he didn't have an assignment or I didn't have one, we shared it. On an ordinary day, he asked me, ""What will you do if I tell you I like you?"" I was surprised, and I only signaled to him an ""ok"" sign because I was panicking and don't know what to do, he asked what it meant and I just walked away. After a few days, he also asked my friend, who is a girl and is my close friend too, the same question. At that moment, I realized that the question was only his trick of his and that he just wanted to see our reactions. After that, he asked me the same question, but now I said I would say thank you. *I asked him two times ago when he would accept my friend request and he ignore the question. He accepted most of my classmates but why not me?*

**Our teacher gathered us all seated on the ground (Indian sit) with all of us to have an open forum because the school was ending too and it would be good if we said our emotions out loud. We have a choice; it's either we say thank you to our friend or say sorry. We had a ball on the open forum, and that ball is like a gift to your chosen friend. It's his turn. He said my name and said thank you because whenever he doesn't have an assignment, I am there he also said I am a good friend to him, and he said a lot of nice words that I haven't heard from anyone. After that, I can't remember what he was talking about because I was overwhelmed, and the next thing I knew was that he knelt in front of me and gave me the ball to me. I can't help but blush. I was stunned and my brain waltzed, and I don't know if that feeling is friendly anymore. I hate those kinds of feelings when someone likes me in a friendly or romantic way. I just don't know how to handle it. After the open forum, I did not say anything to him. I am not really good at expressing my emotions with speech, only in writing, so sometimes I write letters to people that I care for, but I will not give those letters away to them. We've been close friends until the classes were suspended I thought the classes would be back anytime and I was happy that there will be no classes anymore but now it all sank in because I miss my friends most likely him. Now, I feel lonely because I envy people that still talk to him while we don't anymore. It's been two years and I still don't have the closure. I can't just message him because I have no courage to do so because I am too shy to say hello to him with no context. That will be awkward. I don't know what he wants to talk about.

They had to make a term for it it's become so common called the ""ick"" literally they just for any dumb reason like chewing weird all of a sudden lose all attraction and feeling towards you. 

As a man you're constantly told you're not good enough and if you want anything in life you're going to have to work your ass off not only to get it but the whole time you have it to keep it. A man to even have a chance at finding a partner has to be the one who initiates, the one who chases, the pursuer, set up the dates, pay for the dates, be entertaining, be funny, be interesting, be muscular, be tall, have a deep voice, have your whole life planned so they know you'll make a lot of money and be able to provide for you. God help you if you're content just enjoying your life the way it is lol. And so so so so much more. 

For a woman to find a man...exist. just exist. Women are told they're perfect how they are and deserve love and a prince charming will come sweep them off their feet. Not to settle for any man even if it's the smallest imperfection because she deserves the best.

I got injured pretty bad (nothing severe enough for the hospital) playing football with my friends. I was indeed suicidal at the time. When I got home after my mom went to work. I laid on the bathroom floor and took a decent amount of pills crying and listening to my favorite band, slipknot. My thought process was to initially stop the pain, but I was angry, depressed. I didn’t care if I died. “Screw it” was my mindset basically. The next morning I woke up in the hospital. Initially I was confused but realization hit me. I was talking to a doctor and was told that somehow someway I had caused a temporary hormonal imbalance, and that it may or may not affect me physically. About a year later I noticed it. None the less, of course it had to be something that would become my biggest insecurity and affect my self esteem more than anything else. Im already not in the beauty standards and this completely made it worse. Even now, everyday I still think about it and what i did to myself. I compare myself to other people. I cry in defeat. I look at myself in utter disgust. Idk what to do. I know it can be fixed with cosmetic surgery. But I’m too young, too broke, and I don’t think I’d like myself much more if any at all.

I imagine if I died, I wouldn't have to think about anything anymore and I could be with Polnareff forever if there is an afterlife and somehow there was a way for me to meet him.

You buy car l, you get your own place thinking these things would lead to some happiness. You realize no amount of money will make you happy.

And you still have no emotional progress. Weekends come and you think “ now I am going to enjoy not being at the work” but you realize that Working actually is not too bad compared to ‘living’ alone and staring at the screen for countless hours. You can only watch so much TV and listen to so much music. Then you are back having conversations in your head about how one day you are gonna live your life that you are making up in your head. Every passing day makes you feel about the missed time that you did nothing. You see ‘Happy’ people and your heart sinks in that bit much and you get ready for the impending doom.

I laugh when someone suggests being gay is a willful choice. It feels like a *curse*. I genuinely hate everything about it.

There's the obvious— the looks, the sneers, the slurs, the ever present fear of being hate-crimed. There's the way having to bury the truth in the closet for your own *safety* eats you up, tearing you from the inside out. There's the unrelenting fear that who you are will cost you friends, family, and opportunities. 

It's exhausting. But, to be honest, at this point I've experienced it all and I'm almost entirely numb to it all. I come from a highly conservative, Christian family in a highly conservative region of the Midwest. As they say, there's no hate quite like Christian love. Any perceived deviation from the radically conservative, evangelical, white, cis-gender, heterosexual ideal quite literally left me bleeding. I lived in  constant fear, and learned to swallow it and carry on.

Popular media has at this point exposed enough people to this side of being queer that many have at least some understanding and empathy for what it feels like to be a gay person in a straight world. But there's another side most people *don't* see.

I can't begin to express how deeply disappointed and let down I am by the incredibly toxic gay community. Talking to gay people has made me realize I'm not enough, and I can never be enough. 

I've been to the bars, I've tried all the apps, I've joined all the clubs. And it's been nothing but rejection across the board. 

I've been told that I'm not feminine enough. That I'm not masculine enough. That I'm not thin enough. That I'm too thin. That I'm too hairy. That I'm too smooth. 

Dating apps are complete meat markets. You find yourself spending hours on Grindr, or Tinder, or one of the hundreds of other apps trying to meet people or date as a gay man, and you're left looking at the 10 people in your area that are going to ask to see your body and dick, tell you you're gross for one of any of the above reasons, and block you. Try to have a conversation beyond that, and half the time you're met with someone too closeted to talk because they fear being outed, hate-crimed, killed or worse.

Clubs, support groups and the like aren't any better. I've been told I'm not welcome because I'm white, or because I'm a gay man, and therefore I'm a member of a ""privileged"" group within the queer community.

Naïve me had this image of leaving my small, conservative Midwest town for this idyllic, progressive world where I could finally meet and express myself to people like me. Where I would finally have the opportunity to have the experiences my straight peers get to have by default... my first date, first kiss, first partner.

But instead I'm here in college, still being called slurs and worse, and having no one to ""come home to"". No one to talk to. I'm not queer enough to be friends with, and not attractive enough to love.

It hurts. It's exhausting. I'm tired of being told I'm not enough.

I am frustrated because I felt like I was making progress during our most recent conversation. He thinks it's all fodder and that I need to do something more productive like updating my resume. I have had 0 motivation to do anything the past few weeks let alone apply for jobs. I couldn't care less about working or living for that matter. Now on top of that, I have to feel ashamed about talking or venting my frustrations to anyone (him, ex, and/or hotline). 

Even writing this post I feel ashamed because I'm confirming my ""Addiction to Talking."" I don't know how the hell to process everything I'm going through (which is ALOT and way too much for any one person to listen to). I don't know how to get myself out of this trench. So what good is it for me to think about it all day, and not voice it to someone who could help?

Can add talkaholic to my list of diagnoses. Should just nip this addiction in the bud and just never talk to anyone ever again 🤐",lonely,Isolated Talkaholic,2022-06-19 09:14:52

1- socializing and having new friends to hang out

2- find peace in solitude

the first one is pretty much impossible due to severe social anxiety (seriously, these days I had to ask someone to lend me a eraser and I think I got really close to having a heart attack just by thinking of talking to a person that I don't know), and the second one - and here is where the problem begins - makes me feel like an absolute loser

seriously, whenever I catch myself playing video games alone and having fun despite the lack of friends to play with I feel so pathetic. I know I shouldn't. I know that solitude can be amazing and make my life much better. But my brain always interpret solitude as a cheap way of me coping with my own misery rather than me actually doing something good and improving my life.

2164,Specialist_Ad_6278,1655575477,1,"I’m a 23F and I’ve never had a bf/gf. 

I used to be fine with it up until about a year ago when it really started to bother me much more frequently. 

I’m not trying to make myself out to be a saint or anything, but I have so much love and care to give that’s just sitting in my chest. But I’m constantly rejected or overlooked causing me actual physical aches and I’ve noticed it’s leaving a void behind my eyes as well. 

Not to mention my own friends don’t even wanna tell me things sometimes because apparently I care too much and they “don’t wanna disappoint me”. I try to tone it down, but then I’m seen as stand-off ish or non-caring. So even in friendships I’m still left with aches and voids. 

I’ve tried to get to know people as potential partners, but even though I desperately want a relationship, I still have standards and most people I’ve met don’t meet them! Those that have met them are way out of my league and/or are usually taken. 

The only times I’ve been pursued have been for sex which just makes me feel even worse about myself. 

I’ve been talking to a guy since November last year who is nice and caring and we’re very sexually compatible and have a lot in common, but from the get-go he made it clear that he doesn’t want a relationship and I respect his boundaries on that so we are just fwb.

At some point while talking to him though, I did develop feelings. I never told him and I never will because he’s the closest thing I have to any kind of relationship atm. I still kind of have feelings, but they’ve died down significantly as I’m constantly reminded that nothing will ever come of our “arrangement” (that’s what I call it now to detach myself). 
He is the only person out of all of the people I’ve met and talked to that I would want to pursue, but again, he is not an option. 

So, again, I’m still left with nothing and no one. Only aches and voids. 

I hate that it’s gone this far, but I’m even jealous of my roommate and their relationship. Seeing them happy would normally make me happy. Instead I just silently seethe with a fat lump in my throat. 

I can’t talk to people about it because everyone else around me has been in relationships and couldn’t possibly understand how isolating and alienating it feels to have never loved or been loved EVER.

And please don’t tell me that I’m not missing out on much or that my time will come or that relationships won’t solve my problems. I know what I want and I want to reap the benefits of a healthy relationship and I want to mutually prioritize, deeply love, and genuinely care for someone intimately.

At this point in my life, it just doesn’t even feel possible for me anymore. 

I find myself wondering what I did so wrong or what I could have done differently. I consider settling for people who don’t meet my standards, but then I’d just end up miserable and feeling like an idiot, wasting my time. 

I don’t really want advice, I just want consolation and validation.

- I'm in the worst shape I've ever been in physically
- due to trauma all my emotions come out sort of muted, I don't display extremes till I'm manic and I'm on a mood stabilizer so everything is just neutral to me
- nothing really excites me, the most excitement I get now is going to the movies or working on a hobby like simple graphic design for friends and family's business endeavors.
- I have like $100 in my bank account
- I owe way more to student loans and credit card debt than I can afford
- I can't drive because I haven't had enough practice and it still makes me nervous
- every experience with a new or new-ish person I have to talk to brings me so much anxiety
- I like drugs but can't afford them and even if I did I'd be doing them alone mostly in my house, just so I'm not so bored.
- I don't have a steady jobs, basically only my boyfriend employs me with work when he needs my help running cameras
- I'm about to lose another contract job, this time through no fault of my own

Bit of back story, I used to do shift work in a local shop with hot food counter before I was let go in peak covid time. I had to move back to my parents because I couldn't afford rent and when that happened I lost touch with everyone I would have considered a friend.

Eight months ago I started working at a company that takes inbound calls for a popular Internet service provider in the area. I didn't think I was very good at my job but I still put as much of myself into it as I could during working hours.

Yesterday I got promoted, beating out more experienced people. I've never been more proud of myself, something I did must have been good enough to promote me in under a year of working there. 

I also feel an incredible sadness because I have nobody to share this good news with. Anyone I'd have considered to be my friend has moved on.

Now, every day I sit in my room and play games and watch YouTube all day long, so the next day I can play games and watch YouTube all day long. Before summer it wasn’t much better, at school I had acquaintances, sure, we made jokes and worked on school stuff, showed each other memes. But have we ever done anything outside of school? Ever had some sort of meaningful conversation past some stupid stuff I saw in a YouTube video that I thought might make him laugh? Of course fucking not. 

I have a decent relationship with the family I live with, I just got a new puppy, I’m not depressed, on paper my life is fine, but humans need long term friendships, so not being able to think of a single person that I would call a friend, is really taxing. I see Snapchats and such of my acquaintances from school at bonfires, parties, sleepovers, with girlfriends and boyfriends and real friendships.

Everyone was so happy man, so many people saying it’s “great to see you,” “I missed you,” “I was thrilled when I heard you were coming back,” ect. Honestly it’s a good thing I was wearing sunglasses because I was tearing up a little. I had no idea they actually liked me. 

Now I’m going on week 3 of this year. Obviously no one’s saying that anymore, it would be weird if they were.  This made me realize that I need literal constant affection to feel good about myself. Genuinely I don’t even know how to fix this.

The thing is tho, I keep being reminded of that Bojack quote “one day you realize everybody loves you but nobody likes you.” Being well into the shorter side of things (5”4’) and full of personality I always feel like a circus animal. I feel like a party trick that people bring out for attention. Maybe I’m someone’s favorite person to work with, but I’m not someone’s favorite coworker. I know that’s a tad confusing but it’s late.

I mean everyone could have reached out if they liked me so much, they all had my number. I could have to but I swear I was confused by the reaction I got.

I know everyone complains about girls on this sub, but fuck dude I’m sick of being single and stuck in this body. It’s not exact like I can grow a foot.

Someone who would slow down and try to match my pace while walking when they notice i'm falling behind.

Someone who holds my hand when they can see it in my eyes that i'm afraid of something.

Someone who, although may bicker with me a lot, cares for me under the surface and even more so than any other friend I have.

Someone who drags me to a fast food restaurant at three in the morning just to eat chicken nuggets for the fun of it. 

Someone who waltzes up to my desk just to cling to me and be an annoying (endearing) little shit while I try to finish my work. 

Someone who calls me on a rainy afternoon just to tell me that it reminded them of me. 

Someone who calls me on a sunny day just to complain to me how hot it is as if i'd be able to make the sun go away. 

Someone who just calls me at any time of the day because they can and because they want to. 

Someone who bombards me with idiotic messages while waiting for me to arrive. 

Someone who runs to me the moment they see me across the hall. 

Someone who hears me when nobody else does. 

Someone who looks after me without me realising it. 

Someone who just wants me. 

Someone who loves me. 

I can only dream of such love, and it hurts. 

This person of my dreams who doesn't exist. 

I wish they did. 

It's love like this that I dream of having. 

Not the kind of love that's covered in gold and paper bills or sexual favours. 

But the kind of love that neither of those things can ever live up to. 

The kind of love that is full of subtlety, but full of sincerity. 

The kind of love I wish I had. 

The kind of love that not even you might have. 

It's lonely here within my heart. 

And the spring flowers that bloom in my dreams don't bloom where my heart resides. 

I've done so much for others. 

What has the world given me except for more space within the abyssal plain of my heart. 

I care and care and care. 

But just who in this world will care for me? 

I don't know. 

I'm sinking further into the depths of my loneliness and only the world of fiction can keep my mind at bay.

People use me to help them with school, to write their essays, apply at jobs, legal crap essentially to help them with whatever their own brain can’t. They call me when they’re sad or need to vent. I’m educated and they know that and I’m definitely not pretentious about it I’m humble and a pushover which is probably why I’ve reached these circumstances. Family only uses me for money, rides and to watch their kids. I see them do stuff for other people they don’t do for me and my own kids, when I go above and beyond for my nieces and nephews. Friends only talk to me when they need help with someone, but I would see them go out with other people yet not invite me. When I became depressed and needed someone to talk to no one answered my messages or left me on seen. So once I stopped being a “yes,” girl and started saying no I’ve ended up alone.

20-something fuckin years of being alone and it took this one change to freak me the hell out. I'd love to get close to this girl like I have to people before in the past but there's a twist: She ships out for the army in just over a month for training.

I (26M) thought I was done with them. I hang out with friends, I exercise, I treat my body how it deserves to be treated and I love taking time out to draw/hike/camp alone. I've been trying to build a better relationship with myself for years now, and I thought I was succeeding.

Unfortunately, I'm starting to get those stupid stabs of loneliness and jealousy again, particularly when I see my friends in healthy partnerships that have lasted years now. It seems that so many people my age have someone in their life they can rely on and be a rock for in turn.

I find myself cursing the boy I used to be. I wish I could reclaim lost years and drag my past self out of the malaise of envy, insecurity and self hatred that held me back from achieving the same kind of love I now see in my mates. The irony is that those emotions that restrained me are surfacing once again.

I know that envy is a truly useless and self destructive emotion, and that it's impossible to retread the path you've already walked. I am also aware that people can smell desperation, and often the desire to not be alone is the source of many a bad relationship. However, at the end of the day, I'm not getting younger, my head isn't getting any less bald, and my peers are pulling far ahead of me in this aspect of life, just like they always have.

I have a Hinge profile that accurately represents and sells me, and I'm trying to be as active on that as possible, to no avail. There's a girl in my group of friends who I fancy, but I'm fairly certain she doesn't feel the same way. These circumstances, alongside others, feel scarily familiar. I'm terrified that life is conspiring to crush me with that old friend loneliness and undo all the hard work I've been putting into myself

Does anyone have a remedy for this? I don't want to feel like this again. I want to be comfortable in myself, and finally accept that I'm probably not going to achieve my dreams of one day having a family and kids. I want to be feel happiness for the lives my friends/siblings/cousins are all building with their partners. If anyone has been in a similar situation and has managed to claw their way out, please let me know.

Additionally, I am busy with lots of clubs, extracurriculars, and homework so I wouldn't even have time for a gf.

In college I doubt that I would have the time for a gf, because, as of now, my plans for college are to double major, participate in marching band, and to work. And all those things combined would barely leave me with any time for myself, let alone a gf. 

After college I feel like I won't be able to successfully date. I won't have had any experience in dating from high school or from college. And since I'm pretty introverted and not very outgoing I wouldn't really be hitting up clubs and such once I get out of college. On top of that I don't really have any hobbies. As of now the only three hobbies I have are math, xylophone, and gaming (I've been losing enjoyment for gaming a lot recently though). And it's not like I can pick up a girl by telling her math facts. I've tried experimenting with different hobbies: drawing, writing, coding but I've hated all of them. I'm still sticking with learning to code because I will need it for a career in the future but I derive no pleasure from it at all. 

Overall I feel like I won't be able to get a girlfriend while I'm young. And my lack of experience combined with my lack of interests and being introverted will keep me from getting a girlfriend when I am older.",lonely,I'm only 16 but worried I will never have a girlfriend.,2022-06-18 09:46:53

To a lot of people that’s normal, but to me that moment in time just felt special. Nobody ever texts me so I was surprised that it went on for that long.

She started comparing talking to me to being part of her itinerary and something she didn’t want to be forced to do, so of course i did everything she wanted and while i was tearing up inside waiting for an answer to any call or text I just got the cold shoulder. A couple months latter she just called me to let me know she found somebody else and that was the point that fully broke me, she is back from her trip and texted me to return her stuff (witch i had none of because she never kept anything at my place while she took a lot of my stuff to her trip) and i just told her that i was not interested and politely asked her to leave me alone. 
All of this while my abusive father wants to regain the relationship forcing me to spend time with him, and i honestly hate him with everything i have because all the pain he has caused me over the years. And finally the rest of my family continue to be a bunch of a holes always ignoring me and telling me to shut up every time i even open my mouth in any conversation.

do u ever get it when u fail a test at school or u do something wrong and u are really disappointed and your parents are mad at you for failing? well i just had my driving test today and i failed on the last manoeuvre. if i told you that i was calm in that moment i would be lying. i genuinely wanted to headbutt the dashboard and punch a tree until my hand breaks and cut my wrists open until the blood drains; basically, every time i fail, i feel like the entire world is crumbling down at my feet.

this post won’t get traction because nobody would want to listen to my sob story, but i felt like I needed an outlet for my anger and frustration because the more I build it up inside of me, the angrier I’m going to get and the more I want to die.

This post will be complete garbled, but I just feel I have to say something, anything, into the ether to have some kind of connection to this world I guess.  
I've lived on my own for about 5 years, since University. Uni had problems of its own, I wish I could redo it sometimes. I've tried so many things, but I've been alone since. I miss having other humans  I cared about and lived with. If I was stressed or sad, I could knock on someones door, smoke a little weed and watch a silly documentary about trains. People were only a message away and they really, truly cared. I still have friendships with some of these people. Their lives have changed since uni, and they don't have the time to be available for random meetups and our messages are more like long email exchanges rather than instant messaging if that makes sense.  


Basically, I'm struggling to see the point of all this. I've got a good job. About to start a part-time masters at Oxford. I have savings and stability. A cat (the only thing to make it alright sometimes) But it just doesn't matter if I get up at 6, interact with colleagues (we get on, but things never seem to get past acquaintance at work) get home at 6, sit alone with my cat, maybe try a hobby that isn't that fruitful and go back to sleep. It really feels that my best years are behind me. I'm really trying to fix it. I'm trying so hard to meet new people but I just don't feel I'll ever really have a close group of friends again or experience the exciting, intense emotions again of having a place in a g group of people. I don't remember the last time I went on a night out, got drunk and danced. I love dancing.

so, what to do with my friends ? i honestly kind of despise them for not caring enough, i even told them i was feeling kind of worthless when around them, and they blamed me... now idek if i'm the asshole here for holding them accountable for how i feel or if they really are toxic towards me. i've been numb in school for months, i can't talk normally to anybody while the rest of the class just seems to continue on like nothing

so, now back to my crush. yes, it's very unhealthy that i'm clinging so much towards her, but really what else am i supposed to do ? i tried to speak to her too and tell her that i feel kinda worthless around her, and she was actually the only one changing some things around me, but it just wasn't enough... and after speaking to her about it again and again she slowly but surely is distancing away from me aswell.

All my friends are great but we’ve only ever been school friends. I’ve recently deleted most social medias and therefore I now have a lot more free time now. I don’t have many/any hobbies and I’m worried this will be another long summer.

I'd rather discuss more specifics in messages/comments because I could write for a while.

In the past she would always share secrets and things about her personal stuffs (mostly fun stuffs, nothing too serious) and now she just keeps quiet about it which is odd.

I really dk whats wrong. And u might think that its not a big deal but to me, it is. She's my ONLY friend rn and I always have a hard time making friends and maintaining friendships due to my severe anxiety and possible autism and she's the only one who somehow stayed with me.

And it would be devastating for me if she left cus i would have absolutely no one and be alone. Maybe she's dealing with some embarassing stuffs rn, and thats why she's keeping away from me, but normally she would tell me those stuffs too cus she said she trusted me the most so idk now.

That’s it, no “hey how’ve you been” no “what’ve you been up to lately” all she needed was information. No one cares about me and it’s clear to see. Is it me? Should I reach out to people more?

2333,Moby__Octopad,1655483769,1,"It's probably summer fatigue, because the summers around here are really exahusting, but having no one to hang out or talk in a personal level becomes tiring. My 20s were fine, as I had some friends and relationships, but I don't think I was anyone's first choice or that I was ever really loved. It's been more than two years that I don't have any friends and the ones I had are living abroad and I find it difficult to even have a date.

I have a nice job and I'm really good at it and being very career-driven as a person, and I have a cool relation with my close colleagues, although it never goes beyond the professional level. I'm at the point that everyone is waiting for Friday to arrive and I'm anxious about weekends because I'll be doing nothing and waiting for Monday, as to have a reason again. 

It's not that I don't have interest or that I don't have humor or that I can't hold a conversation, but it doesn't matter; whatever I do no one wants to have anything with me and somehow some people end up hating me. I know I'm not an attractive person, as I'd say I'm around 5/10 in terms of physical appearance; not ugly but surely not pretty. The only times I find it easier to connect with people is when I'm doing solo travels abroad. I live in the Balkans and when I travel in other Western countries I meet people and having nice dates and I engage in rich and intellectual conversations in a way I have never done in my country. I have even built relations with people from these travels and chatting with them even though we went out once or twice. 

And what I'm asking is why have I failed so big in life? Is it that I'm not attractive? Is it that I live n a wrong country? Is it that I'm just not able to form any human interaction? I'm 33 now and the chances of turning this around is almost closed.

2355,cockrobotcock,1655476884,1,"This is definitely a dick thing to say, but I can’t stress this enough: every time I see people happy, I want to grab the nearest person and sauté their balls. It just makes me so frustrated seeing these people having fun laughing and dancing with their friends while here I am, alone. Why is it always me that has to be left on the sidelines? What am I doing wrong?

No matter how much I try to connect with my peers, I just can't, and when I do, I can never get past the point of just being an acquaintance or the second option. They're all having such a good time together, but I just sit in the corner and soak in my own misery, too anxious to join them and too awkward to become a part of it even if I did. I just can't do anything right because I know it's on me. If everyone else can do it, why can't I? I sit here and ponder these questions but still make no effort to change because I know I'm too fucked up to be like them or be better at all, and it angers me beyond belief. 

I want to be like them so badly; I want to live life as carefree and joyously as they do, but I can't and never will. I don't relate to *anyone* my age; I feel like I was just slapped onto their world with no way to incorporate myself into it. I'm so screwed up on a fundamental level that no matter what, I'm going to be left out-casted, but they don't have to go through that, and I'm sick of seeing them so happy while I'm alone and miserable. 

Why can't that be me up there? I keep trying my best to impress people and be the best person I can be for them, but no matter what I do, they hate me.

I feel disconnected from my friends and family and it hurts my heart everytime I recall that moment and all I could think of is “ this is so fucking traumatising “.

2361,_Ziggy_Zaggy_,1655472035,1,"the last time I had a friend was a year/two years ago and she ended up being not great but at the time I was the happiest I'd been in a long time just because I wasn't alone anymore after so many years but now I have no friends again.


My social skills are horrendous which is a huge reason for this. I absolutely can not cope with speaking to people in groups and most people in social situations are already in groups so it's hard. I don't know how to speak like a normal person, my parents have tried to teach me a couple of social skills but I don't understand how to use them in any situations that I encounter. I can't even answer someone without making a long drawn out ""uhhhhhhh"" sound before every single sentence and it's humiliating. Some of these issues are probably due to autism and some due to social anxiety but I really don't know how fix them. I know the best advice is to just try and talk to people anyway but I feel like I can't. Anytime I have had a discussion with people, it just leaves me feeling worse because like I said I can't have a ""normal"" conversation and it makes me feel so incompetent and its so obvious that people feel awkward talking to me so i feel bad for putting them through that. I've mostly given up on talking to people in school now and I only go in for exams anymore and am on a reduced timetable where I leave right after the exam. They're all so loud and bold and I'm just nothing like that and I can't cope with it.


I tried therapy once but it did nothing. It was only like a 6 session free thing so I don't know if it just wasn't the right type of therapy or what but it was useless. The therapist asked me why I'm anxious to socialise and why I struggle but she didn't really help at all, she sent me links for help with covid anxiety when i hadnt mentioned that once and most advice in it was not applicable to anything other than health anxiety and in fact the sessions actually made me more anxious because I had to talk to her over the phone where my whole family was downstairs and they always ask what I talked about after. So therapy didnt work but I don't know how I'm gonna fix it on my own either because I've been this way my whole life and in the past year or so it's gotten way worse.



I'm worried I'm never going to find friends or a relationship because of my incompetence and it makes me very depressed sometimes. I try to distract myself but it's been nearly unbearable the past few days. I have even been considering joining more online communities and trying to make friends there but any time I've tried that in the past, it didn't work so I'm still not too sure if I wanna attempt that again but I probably will at some point in the near future.




It also depresses me a lot when I hear everyone my age talk about their relationships and I know that I've basically made that impossible for myself. I always tell the family in my life that ask that I have no interest in relationships cause I feel ashamed of wanting that since I feel I have no right to even think about it when I am the way that I am. But I do think about it a lot and it upsets me. I try to not focus on it but sometimes I go through phases where I just can't not focus on it. 



This has happened before and I know I'll be ok soon but I'm just tired of the cycle of feeling ok and then being completely focused on the loneliness all the time for weeks or months at a time tbh lol

 I know it's useful for a lot of people, but come on!

I just talked about anxiety attacks with a psychologist, and she's already talking about medication to calm me down when that happen, but I don't care about the anxiety attack, I don't want to stop having them just to ignore my problems, I've been ignoring them for more than a decade, so it's enough!

During my younger year's I went to a primary school which was Catholic, majority of the student's family were middle class and was raised affluently which allows their Children to some what behave in a normalised way, with religion being factored in as well people were taught to treat others how you want to be treated. Being ignorant to the world when your younger is blissful. 

After primary school I went to a different high school apart from my peers from primary school. The high school I went to was one of the worst school's in my home town. Majority of the Kids there were from families who are drug dealers, red-neck, racist, unemployed, family domestic violence, single parents and plenty of prejudice. Me being the different one was severally bullied due to the colour of my skin and race. Who the fuck bullies another person because of their skin colour ? During those 7+ year's it was extreme hell. 

The people I know from high school have been in jail, drug addictions, been to court, unemployed and sold drugs, used drugs, single parent and don't really have high ambitions. 

I had a few close people in my life that I could see their life was struggling and needed support. I fed those who were down, I became their friend, I took them into my home, I treat them life a brother and family. I always shouted them meals by going out. I was alway's there for people any time of the day and was their cushion. When they got back on their feet they no longer needed me and try to find other people who were better than me, who the fuck does that ? 

I have found out over time, loneliness is a feeling. Being a lone is a state. 

I have tried to figure if it's me, but with my conclusion it's having shitty people in my life but simply I was raised in the wrong geographic location and met the wrong people in my life. I don't know if I can trust anyone in my life at the moment due to my past experiences... 

I gave my all to people but in return I received a bag of shit.",lonely,"Loneliness might not be your fault, but more geographical and external factors.",2022-06-17 19:09:08

Most of the time, in order to connect and relate to people, I have to do things/watch shows/listen to music that I don't really care about. I do have some friends that like similar things that I do, but what is so strange to me and makes me feel so lonely and outcast is that even when people like the same things that I do, they like it for different reasons. Like if I gush about my favorite aspects of a show or game, the people I am talking to who also like the game are just kind of weirded out and don't reciprocate my excitement. I sometimes dream that I will meet a person/people who like everything that I do and completely understand why I like it and feel the same way, and we can do things together that we both really love to do.

         33F. I was talking to a friend recently about soulmates. Whether or not we believe in them, etc. I do believe in soulmates. I just don’t believe we always end up with them. If there’s one person in the world that would love me, and I mean really love me, I could walk right by him. I could take the train and miss the spot I was supposed to get off at. I could have let them go not knowing who they would be to me. I’ve had one big love in my life. He’s been married with children since the year I left him. And no one has loved me in that way since. 
         As my mental state and 2nd marriage deteriorate I wonder if I’ve walked by him. Has he wondered about me? Will I ever have a family while I’m still young enough?

Then! Matched with a girl recently and ended up talking on snap, where not even 5 minutes in to talking to her she asked me what my hands looked like and went "" nope. Don't like your hands, sorry won't work out"".
I'm sorry what!!! You have a child and are a stay at home mum and I was willing to try being a farther figure to someone else's kid, but since you don't like the way my hands look it looks like i don't  even need to bother now.

like the week before he did it he was so distant, just blowing me off to go play games he didn't even like. and obviously i get that he has friends he loves and he needs time for that but it happened three nights in a row and i was getting so upset and I didn't know how to tell him he was making me angry and then he fucking texts me in the middle of the night that he wanted to break up. and i really don't mean to be dramatic about this but i can't talk to anyone about him because according to him and them and everyone we're still friends.

we probably are friends. everything's probably fine. i'm just upset and tired and this is the first time i've ever missed anyone like this, like i've dropped a weight and everything feels light and meaningless like nothing even matters because i'm not sitting on his couch right now.

While I'm proud of myself for not playing anymore and I won't go into reasons why I quit as that's a whole another topic, the journey itself to finding ambitious friends is actually difficult. Just not having anyone to spend time with to do activities with has been excruciatingly painful and almost had several relapses because of that. I also want to be clear, I don't look down upon people playing games and it's perfectly healthy to engage in any pastime (video games, sports, tv, etc.) in moderation with friends or by yourself. 

What I'm trying to say is, how I can go about finding someone that wants to do things with their life? You know, as I'm writing this post it feels so awkward as even I don't know what exactly I'm looking for. It all seems super vague to me. Maybe I'm just confused. 

I've done things to help me feel less lonely by moving way closer to family, going on random meetup hikes, and I start going to university again in a couple of months so I'm sure if I just wait another 2 more months I'll find likeminded people there. Just the loneliness I feel now feels so painful and I try my best to cope by having healthy habits by exercising, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, etc. but anything I do won't get rid of this painful feeling. On the meetup hikes, I've met a lot of super interesting people, but maybe due to my closed-mindedness, I didn't think they would be good long-term friends. I'm just extra careful now about the friends I choose because getting dragged down by someone is a different kind of pain. 

I write this vague post to see if there is anyone who relates. I have no problem making friends or socializing with people. I don't have any anxiety. I just find that making the right type of friends is where I'm at in life now. Maybe I'm wrong in my way of thinking and I'm open to any kind of criticism.

But right after my mother dying I ended up in a toxic relationship, (mostly my fault) that lasted for about a year. Ever since then I have been afraid of relationships, and honestly think I don't deserve them.

I don't believe I'm asexual/aromantic. I still crave, and get romantic feelings, but I always have this trigger where I shut it down immediately. I most certainly don't think I'm emotionally or financially able to support a relationship, but I also feel all my years going by. I know that I was a toxic asshole when I was a teenager, but I'm afraid that's haven't addressed what caused that in me, but I also want to move on from it. As for my own personal happiness I think I can get it right for the most part, it's just the loneliness mixed with the guilt of just not feeling good enough, it creeps up and I can't stop it.

But I don't even know if getting into a relationship is good for me, or if I'm doing mental gymnastics to self sabotage my love life. Plus to also state, I don't want this to be anyone else's problem. And I also believe that I am just not ready at all for it, I guess I more so hope that I'm not alone in this?

i made a really close friend this fall/winter i was so happy about it and the second they went away to work a summer job they stopped talking to me and i was crushed. when ppl have no one else they use me but they always meet more fun interesting people. i can't blame them but it just hurts i just want people to care about and ppl to care for me. i want a friend group i can do fun things with like i used to i miss it so bad. at my age how the heck am i supposed to make friends it's so hard.

i always end up alone and always will. i'm sorry to anyone who relates i wish we could all be friends, we all deserve good friends :/",lonely,always the last choice and will always end up alone,2022-06-17 13:27:24

I don’t watch anime, not for any particular reason other than it’s not really my cup of tea.
I don’t play video games much anymore, lost my motivation for such things quite some time ago.
I don’t read inordinate amounts of literature/books, again, motivations.
I listen to a lot of older music, LedZeppelin, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, to name just a few.
The things described there in is why I find it hard to vibe with people these days, I don’t like what most people like, I like old music, playing pool, hanging out at the bar when I can, vibing to what ever is on the jukebox.

Rant vent and settlement
Ive been single for half a decade now. Idk where tf i went wrong in my life. Either way, im lovely, im jealous of all the guys pulling cute girls, meanwhile i sit at home alone. I just want somebody to love me, someone that needs me and i need them and love them. I miss getting hugs, cuddling, kissing, heck even holding hands. One evening i dm a girl, we change to talk on insta. Her acc is 100% legit so i send a selfie of me as she wanted. She calls me cute and that makes my day. Shes quite good looking to. Some more pretty dry chatting and she gets more flirty, saying shed want to cuddle and shit. At this point i got it: the feeling of bein wanted and appreciated. A feeling i havent had in 5 years (and as iz seems now, not again very quickly). My day is absolutely made. I stay up extra late as you wanted to to talk. I go to bed feeling great after some hard days. First thing i do in thr morning is text u. However you don't reply till later, totally fine. Our convo is dry, i have to carry it. None of the appreciation and wantedness visible. Only later at eveninc it all picks up again, im feelin good. After her doing all the bold moves, i tried my own, start subtle... i say ""pls never ghost me, youre awesome"" to wich she asked: ""do you like me"" ofc i say yes, how could i not after she said all this? I ask her if she liked me and she said ""i dont know you that well"" followed by ""i just like flirting"". I apologize for being creepy (note i wasnt, it just felt odd to flirt w someone who doesn feel anything). That very moment i crash down from my all time high in months, like a stalled plane... 

  
I just went back to some smalltalk and went to bed...

I cried, none of this was real, the feeling just a small taste of what could be, not even that was real, it throws me back into the miserable feeling of loveliness and not being wanted. Why does she play my feelings like that ? why me?
This morning i decide to tell you how it made me feel, and youre online (i can see you ignore me) but you don't respond to my ""morning"", like you did before with other messages... youre testing my patience and im abt to snap, but i dont wanna be rude.
I just want to be loved TRULY AND LEGITIMATELY, not played...

If you read to all of this,  thanks, youre a hero.  btw. To give this whole thing some perspective. If you have any advice please lmk.

2458,pini4urthots,1655418668,1,"Recently I noticed there are many toxic patterns in my life or maybe this is normal and my mental health has declined to where I think no one cares at all. 
I realized that all of my friendships do not have mutual support, a majority of them are people trauma dumping. Outside of that, no one is interested in me.  And the people that are, only keep me around as a friend until they find a romantic partner. Then the worst, where people I interact with in person, actually won't talk to me outside of getting views on social media. They don't want my friendship, they need me as a fan. 
I've tried to reach out to people, tried to make friends, but they're not interested or too busy to reply.
I don't know why it's like a knife to the chest when I'm left on read or people watch my story and don't reply to my messages. I know that no one owes me a response, I know that everyone goes through times where they don't feel like talking to anyone and I know that it shouldn't matter to me. I feel like I'm screaming at the top of my lungs for attention and no one even bothers to acknowledge that there is any noise. I only bothered to be online because that's where everyone was, and that's now how people seem to stay in touch. Now, it's just me trying to revive friendships that have been long dead.
In person, the only communities in town are church. That isn't my scene and I can't be myself in those spaces. I just feel really alone.

2460,LordDurand,1655418165,1,"Hi again, it's me. I used to post here a lot back when this was my only way to vent. My last post was 2 or 3 years ago. People still message me about my posts from years back, asking if I'm doing okay, or just telling me they could relate. I try to reply to people usually, and I used to be able to say that I'm doing better for the most part. There were of course times I felt depressed or anxious or lonely, but they were never as bad as they used to be.

I'm in college now. I'm majoring in English because my passion is in writing. That's been going good so far, my professors tell me they like my writing, I had one submit an essay I wrote for a scholarship award, I had another strongly urge me to publish a short creative nonfiction piece I wrote. I do work for my college's newspaper, my bosses and co-workers always tell me how much they like my articles and what a good writer I am. I've made a decent number of friends, some who slowly warmed up to me, some who decided that I seemed cool and they really wanted to talk to me and then made the effort to do exactly that. Usually, if I really want to hang out with someone, there's someone there for me. I have a good social life, I'm doing well in school and work, I should be happy and fulfilled.

But I'm not. There are always pangs of pain. All my missed opportunities and failures and regrets and rejections still haunt me. They're always there, like a ghost clinging to my back and whispering to my ear. I am in constant fear that everything will fall apart. When I'm out with friends and having fun and getting along with everyone, I do not feel like myself. I feel like I'm renting someone else's existence, that I must be putting on some kind of act unconsciously because why would anyone want to hang out with someone like me? These feelings have never, ever stopped. I doubt and worry over every single thing I do, living in fear of the moment that everyone will figure out what a boring, inept, terrible person I am. These feelings have always been there, they've never stopped. But last night was the worst night I've had in a long time. For the first time, I thought seriously of suicide again.

I don't want to get into specifics. But my heart sank late into the night, I felt a great disgust at myself. I wanted to rip my body apart. I wanted to cut off every limb, every useless piece of me. I wanted to erase myself from the world. I was 17 when I looked down from the roof of a hospital's parking tower and thought about jumping and ending it all right there. I was 19 when I held a gun in my hands and knew if I really had the guts I could turn it on myself and wipe out every regret and every disappointment. I was 20 when I returned to my childhood home after three years and thought to take my dad's handgun, go out into the backyard, stand in the daylight, and shoot myself and be swallowed by the sun and soil.

I'm 23 now. I've worked so hard. I've learned to socialize and talk to people, I've worked out and become just okay enough with my body to be able to go out in public without wanting to head back inside immediately, I've started going to therapy to try to work through years of unresolved trauma. I have things to keep me occupied. I have friends. I have a partner. And I'm still miserable, and I still feel like I don't have anyone in my life I could tell everything to without them running away and taking everyone else with them.

Everything and everyone I have in my life is exactly what the younger me thought I needed. I hate that I was wrong. I'm scared I'll never really be happy. Maybe that just isn't meant for me in this life. I often feel like too much damage was done to me early in life and that there just isn't any way for me to possibly recover from it.

Last night I laid awake in bed, hyperventilating and thrashing around and whispering ""stop, stop, stop, stop, please stop I need it to stop please stop"" to the intrusive thoughts worming their way into my brain. In that moment, I felt like nobody else could ever understand. The pain was indescribable, even if I went deep into the details of it all, even if I knew just the right words to say and how to string them together, I don't think I'd ever be able to paint the perfect picture.

I felt completely alone.

I felt like meat long past its expiration date.

I should have died when I was 17, before I knew what Hell really looked like.

Because this is Hell. To always want more, to not be satisfied despite your best efforts, to watch some things slip away from you and worry that everything else will follow with it. Hell is having a taste of happiness so brief you think it might've been just a dream. Hell is having the smallest shred of hope, just enough to keep you from having the courage to cut your losses and cut your throat.

Hell is feeling like shit and not even having that good of a reason anymore.

Last night, at around half past 6, when the birds outside began to sing, I finally fell asleep. My last thought before my eyes shut was about how I felt like I was suffocating, and how I wished I wouldn't wake up.

Four hours later, I opened my eyes and laid there for awhile, my throat sore and dry. Light peeked through my blinds and I could see my hands and I felt disgusted at my body.

Then, I got up, and had to keep on living.",lonely,I felt it again for the first time in years,2022-06-17 08:22:45

The only good thing is that since I knew I was in public, my system had an emergency shutdown to not cause a scene. I stared ahead for a half hour. I was freaking out in my head punishing myself for what I had seen. The only thing that broke it was the girl telling me they were closing and I had to go. She said, you were spaced out eh and I said, yeah, spaced out. Why do I have to be myself? I had just gotten the news that there were no other therapists for me and I had to either use the one I have who hates me or none. I'm losing it and I am becoming worse as there is nothing to catch my fall of mental stability.

I can’t prove my theory, but it makes sense, if you see yourself as a loser, _your brain will imitate features that you attribute to losers._ I hate being lonely as much the next guy, but I challenge you all to give it a try. Write down positive affirmations, meditate, talk to yourself with the same respect that you’d give to someone who is “superior” to you. Talk to people outside, compliment people’s clothes, sign up for clubs. I know it’s uncomfortable at first but you have to start somewhere.  I will also take part in the challenge and later on we can see if it had any significant outcomes. It is a simple process _but not easy._ It will be uncomfortable at times, and you may want to quit altogether. But I beg you to please continue. Quitting will only lead to you continuing the behaviors that are keeping you lonely. I genuinely want the best for anyone who is lonely because I know what it feels like to have no one, and I wouldn’t wish that feeling on my worst enemy.

In my new school the first year was horrible. i didnt really anyone in my class as they were really different from me and we had different interests. so i made friends with books at that time. i had 0 friends then. then the year after i switched sections and was determined to make new friends and ended up meeting my till now bsf. that was when i was 13. made another very good friend in school then we git estranged because we changed schools again and she was in a different college.y now bsf aslo changed schools ..we were estranged for 2 years. those 2 years were miserable. i could not make new friends. both my bsf and other friend were on different schools and we didnt talk much. i suffered from depression. i was really lonely. plus i have dysfunctional family so that made it hard as well. My bsf and I got into same college and rekindled our friendship. other than i tried to be really social during the first. months of my college years but it was draining and the friendships made then were super fake and non lasting. other than that i had a classmate kn my college with whom i was close in my college years. but after graduating we too have drifted apart and hardly speak anymore. other than that i haf many childhood friends but dont really speak to them anymore because they were basically picked by my mother for me to socialise as as child. Until recently my Bsf and i were on really good terms even after graduating. we talked regularly and met often. so that was nice. she is kind of my only friend. but she has other friends than me. i kind of feel jealous of that...but meh good for her she can make friends. We recently had a falling out..because i bailed on her with my BF after graduation ceremony. we both had invited our bfs after graduation, she wanted to drink and we were going to have dinner with her. but she started inviting people too..whose name even i didnt know. probably because she wanted someone else to drink with. so i felt uncomfortable with that..plus my bf was also there and it would have been too awkward to be with strangers. also i just wanted some quality time with her and her bf along with mine. i would nit have minded it so much if she had only invited people i knew..or mutual friends. so was upset that i left that day. after that we havent really spoken to each other that much. i am busy with my post grad and she with her own job. i get that it wad a good opportunity to make new friends that night because rn i am complaining about not having friends. but i wasnt really looking to be social and make new friends that day...in my postgrad university also i am failing to make new friends. i am familiar with everyone there but not really friends...sigh. i wish i did more friends. i feel so lonely and these days i only talk to my bf",lonely,i wish i had (more) friends,2022-06-17 04:54:59

They are always late 15,20 always close to the 30 minutes but not quiet and they always make a joke about me being early in a mocking way but i always let it slide since I dont see them for so long.
At first i was first told to come at 4:30 by another friend who was making the plan, I asked again today and she said about 5. I arrived there are 5:05 and she told me she was on her way and she was going to call my childhood friends (i dont have their number since they are always out the country) to come. I wait until 5:27 and at this point I was loosing it, it was hot and humid af i was sitting outside the cafe we were meant to meet at but i didnt wanna go inside to look like an idiot alone then i walked to the beach to come down even dip my feet in the water and cleaned my feet and after all this i was legit about to go home and they call laughing like i was not outside in the fucking heat waiting for them they say oh were are coming dw and more laughs.

And I am still processing it. I am strangely calm today and went out to run errands. But tonight I teared up. I didn't bawl or cry. But I am lonely. I realised in the last few months as I struggle and witness my partner go in and out of his depressive episodes, I haven't had a proper healthy conversation or banter with him for a long while. It is always so heavy around him like he sucks the life out of you. I used to think he is a good listener or a best friend to me. But now it has all sinked in that he hasn't been that for me. I recall even a few days ago, I shared with him about my friend and while he listened, he asked me to touch his dick. I don't know if he sees me as a person anymore. I asked him last night ""What are we even right now?"" and all he did was break down. So yeah I really think this might be it.

I looked through my phone tonight and wondered who could I talk to about things. I became sad because I realised I had no one to talk to. But then a person came to my mind and I called. I said ""I am down but I don't want to talk about it. But is it okay if we talk about random things and you listen?"" Yeah, so we talked about life, work, friends, ourselves etc. Then I said ""Alright I feel better now. Thanks for taking up this call."" And that was it. I just needed someone to be attentive to me for at least an hour or so. That is all I needed. That I matter.

The only problem is that I was so focused on my academic studies and trying to get good grades that I did not make any friends. The people whom tried to befriend me I have pushed away. Idk why I do the things I do but I just do and sometimes I overreact and get angry. After some time alone I realized that I may die alone and I may never find love.

The main reason I believe so is because I live in a very Conservative catholic country. In order for me to find love I need to escape my country since I do not find anyone in my area attractive at all. In order to leave I must finished college first and I did the math and I will be 21 when I graduate college. Which is fine but I also realized that I will need to work hard and earn money to get out of here so by that time I would have already turned 30 years old. Which means I would probably be old and ugly by that time so my chance are slowly dwindling. I feel as tho it is hopeless and I may die alone.

I guess this is my fate and I wish someone would tell me that everything is gonna be fine and reassure me everything is gonna be okay but I know for a fact it won’t. No one understands me and I don’t understand anyone. I have come to accept the fact that I will be alone and I have accepted that since I cannot change it. It is how it is I guess.

I try to focus on studying to pass the time, but its burning me out and not having anything else to do is killing my mood.

I work as a waiter at a pop up restaurant which will move to several cities over the summer. At first they were very positive and nice to me because I made a very good first impression because I work hard and picked up everything very fast. But that didn't last very long because my social skills suck and I'm awkward. So now they must think I'm fucking weirdo. I still do my job well and they ask me to do the most important things because they know I'll do a good job, but that's it, other than that they don't notice me.

Except for this one guy who is very social and easy to talk to. We seemed to get along well and we have the same interest in music. There's a music festival in a couple of weeks that I really would love to go to. He also mentioned that he would be interested to go, so I asked him if we could go together for just one day. He wasn't very sure because he has important stuff shortly after. I wanted to go on Saturday, because then the line up is best. Which at first he was enthusiastic about, but then decided not to because he needs to prepare that weekend for all the things he has to do after. But he said there's a big chance the Friday would work for him.

The restaurant is moving to another city right now, so I'm on a 2 week break from it. The guy who was interested in going to festival isn't coming with us to the other city and he told me he was going to message me on Monday regarding the music festival. He didn't. I messaged him yesterday asking about it and he left me on read. 

I really don't understand why he would do this? Leaving someone on read is such an arrogant and rude thing to do imo. Is it that hard to just reply and say ""sorry, I can't go""? Does he want to make it clear to me that he just isn't interested in hanging out with me at all but couldn't do that in person?

Sometimes I get in the lobby with people, gift them skins in games, buy them stuff hoping they would include me in their friend group or see me as someone they can hangout, talk but never happens. I know you can't buy a friendship but, I just wanted to show gesture and be nice to them and make them happy but they rather talk with a wall. When you have been lonely for years, you also become quite picky about who you want to talk with. I won't answer to random ""heyyy"" texts because usually 1) i know how the friendship or convo will end 2) i don't have mental capacity to go thru another broken up relationship. 

I live in Azerbaijan and I'm gay &amp; live in a abusive household so life is already hard and finding people who i get along in real life in Azerbaijan is pretty hard.

2552,FollowerOfApocalypse,1655363225,1,"All my life I haven't had and still not have a social life, mostly due to overprotection of parents, bullying from middle school and changing to different high schools in the past. My 20s just came and went with college and struggling finding work; now I have all of that.

But these triumphs don't feel like victories at all, all I do is wake up, drive, go to work, sleep, rinse and repeat. It's beyond rare of me going out, I don't have friends to hang out with let alone a girlfriend. Mostly people at their late 20s have already settled and have families. Me on the other hand *I haven't lived at all*.

I have been dealing with depression, sadness and frustration knowing that my youth has been wasted, I never had fun like a normal person would, I never had a girlfriend that I loved and enjoyed being with. At family gatherings people tell me why I'm always quiet, truth is I have nothing to share about myself. If my life was a book, there wouldn't be many pages to fill about my life experiences.

Today my mother and I had a conversation about my problems stated above, one thing she mentioned that bummed me out and also annoyed me is when she asked me at what age I plan to get married, reason is because she worries that I don't have much time to go out and have fun as I'm approaching my 30s; and if I plan to have kids. I answered saying that I don't plan (if ever) to marry anytime soon, and I don't ever plan to have kids (I'm very pessimistic about the state of the world and the future, it would be brutal for future children.) My parents still have that mindset that people in their 30s should already been married and have families, if you don't have that then they think there's something deeply wrong with you.

Now I'm just asking in sadness and dread if I'm considered young or old to salvage and enjoy whatever is left of my youth, if I still have enough time to have fun like happy, carefree youngsters in their early 20s, or if I'm already condemned to a sad, lonely, depressing life of adulthood from now on.",lonely,Is it too late to finally start enjoying life being at 29 years old?,2022-06-16 17:07:05

i did get close to sex once, two years ago at 21, and that was the only time ive been even close to intimate, it was off an app and it happened so fast i was too anxious to go through with it... it was kinda awkward and the whole thing put me off from anything sex related for a bit but luckily she was cool and had good things to say about me (sweet, funny etc) but it didnt go anywhere from there for various reasons. however, even without much happening, just having her attracted to me and complimenting me definitely did boost my confidence a bit for the time being and made me feel like more of a ""man""... and i can only imagine how much better i'd feel if we went further and i did a good job at it. maybe some of this is due to societal pressures, but i think its also natural to feel good when u get this type of validation, whether purely sexual, or flirtatious, or deeper. and you'd think since this one girl was interested it'd happen again... but i havent had any luck on apps since then since any matches i manage to get either dont respond or disappear after a few messages, online i might seem to ""hit it off"" with a girl or get some compliments but they dont stick around, and irl i dont feel i have the opportunities or means. it could be possible ive come across girls who ""desire""/are attracted to me but i wouldnt even know, and there probably hasnt been many since im a particular type... and at the end of the day they can all probably find a better off, better looking long haired lanky depressed looking guy and im just left in the dust due to my problems. 

to get to the point, i dont think i'll have that opportunity again and it makes me feel miserable to know that. to have a taste of it, but not the real thing... to know some of these girls might be out there who would like me, want to cuddle with me, compliment me, play with my hair and do ""cute"" things with me etc etc but i feel i wont come across them, i just lucked out one time and theres a good chance i'll stay a virgin. i cant even imagine what its like to have so many people who desire you, who want YOU specifically... and i get after a while you may become numb to it and take it for granted, and if its surface level attraction its not all that meaningful but damn would i feel better in that position, like in a different world. but really i'd just need one girls approval (who i approve of too ofc) and i feel i could go from feeling like trash to human. it doesnt take a million things to change someones whole life and outlook, could just be one good person/relationship... but im afraid i wont find it. o well",lonely,the desire to be desired (pointless journal entry #563),2022-06-16 14:47:10
2566,HondaCivicRemastered,1655354784,1,"There are people willing to listen and love you. No matter where you are or the life you live, love can be found anywhere. You don’t need someone in your life romantically to experience this. You don’t need someone to hug you or kiss you to feel love. Because love comes in many forms. Maybe a friend asking to hang out or saying how much they appreciate you. Maybe a dog wags its tail at you, or a cat jumps onto your lap. Hell, maybe even some random person giving you a compliment, or smiling at you. My point being, love is something that doesn’t have to be romantic. Love can be kindness, excitement, courtesy and more.

I’m half writing this for myself and half writing for people who may need to hear something like this. For the last couple months I’ve felt extremely isolated and detached from reality. I can’t say I haven’t been loved, because I have. I was simply too jaded and focused on myself and feeling trapped to notice. A couple of minutes ago I watched something that reminded me of a video I watched years ago. It was a short video that at the time I hadn’t really given much thought to it but now it snapped my ass back to reality.  Of course this video was about experiencing love in many way other than romantically. I feel like a lot of the time people tend to forget that love isn’t strictly something romantic and everyone and everything can show it. As small as it may seem, small displays of love still is love.

I’m tired of the pussyfooting around that’s done trying to get to know someone on a visceral level - the whole ‘tell me about yourself? Omg do you have siblings?’ Fck that. 

We are two strangers online that unless the stars align are probably never going to meet - be real with me. What are you into? What are your fears? What turns you on or off? What is the side of yourself your embarrassed to show? 

Let’s have a real conversation - whether it be fun, serious or upsetting. Let’s chat aliens, let’s chat filth to each other, let’s let our guard down and talk about things that actually matter to us personally? Not just things we feel obliged to ask because we have to break the ice first. 

I want real, I want unfiltered and unapologetic conversations and if I can’t find that here? Where will it be?

2599,Mysterious-Day1034,1655341665,1,"Hey all. Just want to let it all out here on exactly what im feeling right now and what i have been feeling for years. Sorry the post is a bit stretchy so I'll cut to the chase at the NOT BACKGROUND part. i tried to make my story kind of interesting and readable i think:/

A little background: I was very outgoing and happy in primary school. My mother even used to call me Mr. Social bc I constantly organised play dates and took part in all sports at my school. I think it was mostly bc of the boredom from being an only child at home:/. Just before my freshman year at high school, we moved out of the city to a more rural town where i spent my high school years. I guess i wasnt hard enough for the kids there. It was a HUGE culture shock. I struggled to make friends there as my classmates started giving me a nickname that i didnt like and that escalated in me distancing myself from them and sometimes getting into fights. 

I eventually fell into a friend group. We were that awkward gamer group of guys. I never really fit in well with them either but at least they were a group of guys to hang out with during break time.

As years gone by, i never developed proper social skills and became more and more isolated and socially anxious. I never had experience of going to prom or any experience with girls as my highschool was a boys school. I really wanted to find love and romanticized the idea of having a family of my own one day and just having a place to call home in a sentimental sense. This really motivated me to improve and get out of that town. 

I got into a top university with many different student from over the country and even some international students so i decided to be brave and take on this new life and conquer my anxiety.

RECENT BACKGROUND: So my freshman year in university went pretty decent considering the fact that i was an idiot when it comes to anything social. I made a group of nice friends during the welcoming week and also met a girl who loved at the girls side of my dorm, whom i ate breakfast with evey morning and kind of fell on love with at the time. 

I took some L's, which in retrospect was really just the start of what wouldve been a period of learning and character development. This girl got a boyfriend and i was really sad about that so that kind of mad eit hard for me to talk to her so i think that friendship would've kind of dissappeared but that is where i learned to really appreciate my guy friends i made there. I told my friend(who is the only one i still have) about her and he comforted me and it really felt good to have some brotherly support and that kind of ""comradery"" i suppose. 

In short, i really think i got out of my comfort zone well(even though i didnt realise how well i did at the time) and often even forced myself to try and talk to random people next to me in lectures despite continuous awkwardness and failure.

Then covid came and me, my cousin and one of my friends started playing warzone non stop for an entire year as we did our studies online. This just put me back in my comfort zone for 2 years(in second year i was back on campus but everything was empty and classes were still online) and i became even more socially awkward, spending an entire year by myself at home as i didnt have any more friends in my ""hometown"". 

NOT BACKGROUND: I am 3rd year in uni now and 20 uears old and i only have one friend on this whole campus and literally cant make anymore. He started hanging out with the frat type who i didnt really get along with much. He is basically the only person i ever talk to and all he talks about is his sex life and, if im lucky, we talk about sport or video games. My mind is so numb and demoralized by this point, that i dont have the energy to talk to anyone but i literally feel socially deprived. There was also this girl i met on a friends app. We both fell in love and talked daily. We talked for more than a year and a half but we kind of just started disconnecting, probably bc we ran out if things to say bc she never wanted to video call and we only texted.

Now im here with no late night texts, my friend is away for a few weeks and im done with exams and i feel like im going nowhere in life and that im going to regret all those high school years wasted and never developing any social skills to talk to new people. I walk around on campus and sit alone between people greeting and studying with their friends and i just feel so sad that i cant have that kind of life. I just want to feel love and affection and enjoy time with others. Instead i spend my days making up chores, going to the gym and lying on my bed watching netflix for hours just to distract myself from this void.

Its just super sad to me that i used to be this friendly and sensitive outgoing kid who turned out to become this numb, socially awkward loner. Today, i had my first ever suicide thoughts. Not super serious but i fantasized just hanging on a rope as the pain dissapears from me. 

Next comes adult life and my young years will always be behind me.

I'm a girl that's been friends with this girl for over a year (we're both lesbian). I don't have any other friends and she's the most important  person in my life atm, she's the reason I'm alive rn. She seems to care a  lot about me and she's helped me deal with a lot of mental health issues, but she's a really nice person and she'd probably help out anyone. I'm really scared of losing my only friend so I don't tell her  how I feel, but I hate seeing other people close to her (I know I  shouldn't).

I feel like I'm not that important to her, even though I know she cares about me. We've talked loads about personal stuff, but I know I'm just another one of her friends. I'm also terrible at talking to people so she's often the one helping me and I haven't really ever helped her with anything.  
She's  got loads of friends that I'm jealous of. I want to be as important to  her as she is to me.  


Recently I've heard her talking to her other  friends about this girl she likes (unrequited for her too) and it's just made me suicidal again, I feel like I'm going to lose the only reason I have left for living, I'm scared that someday she's just going  to stop talking to me and I'll be alone forever. I'm really really scared of being alone. I've had ""friends"" before, but they've always made fun of me, talked about me behind my back and I couldn't really  ever trust them.  
It's also possible that I just want to be closer with her, not necessarily in a romantic relationship, I'm bad at  understanding myself sometimes

So recently I was on my way to class with 4 of my friends, 2 of them which I usually hang out with after school and on weekends, also the same people that said they planned with each other in private chats (basically they are the closest friends I hang out with off school and I have common friends with them), let’s call them S and C.
So while we were walking, S said “Hey C, did you see my snap from last night in the groupchat?” 
C said he didn’t and S started explaining about it. After S was done explaining I asked “I didn’t see any snaps from you in the gc, do you have one without me?”
And with a rude attitude and no hesitation S answered “Yes”. And that’s just how the conversation ended. I’ve been thinking about it for days and I’m a little hurt since they are probably my closest friends. Yesterday I hanged out with them and they made plans about going to the mall today and just hang out the entire day, and everyone agreed including me. I woke up and saw that everyone was still home, a few hours later i check my snap map and they’re all at the mall without me. I asked S “I thought you were supposed to tell me when to go out?” and he just made up some dumb excuse. Fast forward, they go to C’s place and hang out and then they go home. Now here comes the worst part: They went to S’s place without telling me or inviting me. I’m very sad about this since they were probably my best friends but it turns out they are fake.

So, in a very small attempt to begin overcoming my fears I sat next to the attractive girl. I kept my eyes closed and tried to relax. I know I sound ridiculous but these emotional reactions are intense. But if I want to fix things —if I want to know what a hug feels like —if I want to end this loneliness, then I need to **finally** act upon my needs despite the deep fear. 

A thought occurred though while sitting there. I don't know shit about dating. So will people be kind enough to teach me a little or will it be trial by fire. The unfortunate truth is mist likely trial by fire. Ill need to try and fail and try again. And again. And again. That truth is tough to swallow but change needs to happen.

But I am always forgotten. I am remembered by nobody, have no lasting friendships or relationships, and have no friendships outside of work. I have a tight knit team and just recently learned that a lot of them hang out together outside of work with the exception of myself. Shocking, considering the fact the some of the people that get complained about a lot are invited. 

This lack of social life inspired me to build my own life online. Two years ago I created a twitch account under a fake name and with no face cam. I wouldn’t say I’m a “hit” but I average 20 viewers a stream, hold about 18 monthly subs, and have a very active community on Reddit and discord. I don’t change anything about myself or who I am (I talk about work, hobbies, real life situations, etc). 

I’m struggling to figure out what it is about me that makes me so forgettable in real life. Nobody complains about my work or has any beef with me, but nobody’s praising my work or crediting me for the effort i put in for others. It’s like this weird limbo where I’m liked to my face but the second I’m gone it’s like I was never there. Contrast that with online and it’s night and day. I can hold peoples attention and have made great friends with people I’ve met here, had real conversations and just feel like this is what I’ve missed out on my entire life.

I’m essentially a voice in the void online. No real connections or backgrounds, just a voice online playing games or talking. In real life I have no meaningful friendships or connections. If I died people would be sad, but nobody’s asking to see me or be in my life.

I’m afraid that if I were to ever connect my two lives, or get close to my online friends, that whatever is wrong with me that people in real life will transfer to online and I’ll be forgotten. It’s weird and stupid to be worried about but it’s scary to differ in popularity so vastly. 

What do you think? I’m not really trying to make a huge change, I’m just confused as to who I am or what this even means. I’m happy with who I am so if something is wrong with me that would be news, I just don’t know why the people I call friends don’t care about me, but complete strangers are hyper invested.

Here, the only person that I can consider myself close to is my roommate and recently she's not been the best of friends. She's not been there when I needed someone.

It sucks to say, but I've done the research of what it would take to kill myself. Either $50 at a grocery store for some pills or a 30min drive and $40 to rent a gun.

I just don't feel like I have anyone around to back me up or look out for me.

My roommate is making friends with our coworkers but then when they hang out as a group I'm not invited. I understand that's I can't just tag along with her whenever she goes out, but it hurts that our coworkers are reaching out to her but not me.

Right now, the only reason I'm leaving our apartment is work. The past few week's I've been on the café side of the business by myself with no one to even small talk to.

I told my counsellor the same thing and she was like ""great so your last session is next week"" as if there's nothing more to talk about. There's just some things I can't be open about. I have to put on this cringe ass emotionless persona and I occasionally lie just because I feel like she'd think I was a terrible person if I didn't. I'm angry all the time, I just keep it hidden well and she doesn't know that. She thinks I feel nothing. I know this is my fault for not being honest but it's difficult. I just don't really trust her.


I tried reconnecting with an old online friend. I asked if they would like to play some games again and they seemed quite happy to. They even exchanged some art they had been working on and catching me up on how the whole group was doing. It was nice but now that I've responded more with my own art and little life updates (I haven't vented or anything to them. I haven't even spoke about my feelings at all) they responded in short sentences and now it's been days since they responded at all. It hurts a little but some people just drift apart I guess. That's ok. I can't help but wonder if I was annoying but I don't think I was. 

My sister asked me if I wanted to go for a run today. I've never went for a run before and although nervous, I was sort of looking forward to it. She told me I needed to have music on me, or I wouldn't enjoy it but my headphones refused to work and I didn't have anywhere to put my phone so I told her I'd just go without. 
For some reason she saw that as some sort of crime and proceeded to tell me I really needed some music. I sat down, waited for her to get ready but she didn't. She just sat there in silence and it was really awkward. 
I went upstairs, feeling quite annoyed and then she called to me- telling me she would go for a run later when sue goes back to her place. 

It's made me feel quite crap. I don't know what it was. Did she not want to run with me? 
Whatever it is, she could have just been honest.

Looking for someone to talk to long-term, ideally leading to meeting in real life, so I would prefer people from the USA, though it is not a requirement. I'm in the Southern USA right now but likely going to move elsewhere because I don't like this area and people are pretty xenophobic here (I'm an immigrant).

Video games, anime and classical music are one of the things I still enjoy, though not as much as I used to. My mental health isn't well and I find it difficult to enjoy anything, let alone be fully immersed into it or care about it. I've also been able to learn more about life and figure out why we like certain things, what makes us do something and since then it hasn't been easy to just enjoy something.

I'm looking for someone who isn't going to jump the ship if I say a wrong word; someone who won't expect me to change my bad sides overnight and someone who understands that any change takes time. With that said, I am flexible and don't like to treat people like disposable pixels on my screen, and I expect the same in return.

Right now I'm playing Dark Souls 1 after having finished Elden Ring, Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne in the last few months.

I'll elaborate on what I mean by saying I'm ""all kinds of broken and mentally ill"".

Broken - I have ruined fiction for myself by looking up too much obscene fan-made content. In a way this opened up my eyes on a lot of things but it also ruined whatever ""power fantasy"" / ""inspiration"" (pick the word) I used to feel from these things. To the point where I can't look at the fictional characters without cringing. That's fiction. Real life is also pretty bad and I don't think I can trust anyone. Long story..

Mentally ill - suspecting autism, though it might be something lighter. Bipolar seems to match my experience a lot.

He was after a breakup so he had plenty of time, and we used to chat a lot. A few weeks ago, he found someone, he's in a relationship with that person, and since that he hangs out with that person all the time. I understand that. I'm happy for him, cause he's happy being in a relationship. But what makes me kinda sad is that he barely has time for me. He replies to my messages after a few hours with a short message or two and sends next reply in another couple of hours. I know that he likes me and I like him back. We both know that we like each other. I'm really happy that he found someone to love, cause he deserves that a lot. It's just the fact, that this comes at a price. I recently don't know how to talk with him. 

I recently feel intimidated cause somtimes he talks about him and his significant other and then here I am, sitting all lonely, not even one person to talk to that would care.

No emotions, no nothing... I wouldn't mind if someone hit me in the street or shot me. I even let everyone laugh at me. Which doesn't happen but you can see in eye contact the way they evaluate me.

What if he died? Who was at my funeral?

No one knows me. What would people from my past say? ""That piece of shit killed himself! Idiot"" ""The family will be upset because of that useless shit""

 Even ""friends"" of the past would not waste time going.  

It's all wrong with me. 

I took with many jokes, with many criticisms, with myself ... They said, ""There was not going to be anybody in life."" And what exactly is happening? Is it necessary for me to become multimillionaire to clean up the image a little? What i'm supposed to do that I don't already know!

2671,Few_Task240,1655312656,1,"Greetings lonely world!!

My path of lonerism started in 2018 and with the pandemic and finally moving away from my suffocating family, Ive become a full on recluse. 
The only adult I have conversations with are my sister and my teenage kid (reluctantly).

I’ve been fine with being alone since I’ve grown up with an enmeshed family and deep rooted co-dependency issues along with having a dismissive-avoidant attachment style. I knooooow Such a hot mess 😩😂😂😂
Being able to free myself from my toxic family and friends is like a spaceship going into space and losing whatever it needs to lose to have a successful trip.
I’m the spaceship.

Now that I’m in the infinite space, I have no idea how to navigate social interactions— let alone meet someone new. I never had issues attracting someone pre-pandemic, but now I have no idea what to do. This is the longest I’ve been without a partner or lover and I feel both defeated and helpless.

It makes me wonder if there’s something wrong with me— especially since I feel I’ve done the work to become a better version of myself and feel really good about it, but can’t seem to bring anyone new into my orbit. I like to think I look approachable but I’m a bit timid. People have said I’m pretty funny with a warm personality, so 🤷🏽‍♀️ I have no idea what I’m doing wrong.

I’ve been going to concerts on my own (since no one around me shared the same taste in music) at least once a month since last September and have struck up conversations with people but still haven’t run into anyone that would be a potential friend or even partner.

I’m tired of being on my own and not having anyone to share my life with either platonically or romantically. It blows and I’ve been crying about it more and more lately. Anyone else in a similar boat?",lonely,I’m at my wit’s end.,2022-06-16 03:04:16

I don’t even know the exact reason why I’m feeling this way, but it just is. How do you cope with that? I look at myself in mirror and just fee sad. Sad how I have reached to this point. Sad that if I had to party, people would be lined up, but when I need them. Why can’t people sense that you are not fine? Why can’t they see the sadness behind your smile? 

Some of my very close friends, when they were single, would catch on these thing-they would know something isn’t right. But that changes when start dating. It’s like I only exist for them when they are lonely or have nothing to do. It’s sad really. 

It’s feels like this is how life is going to be. Doesn’t matter how many real friends you have, unless you go to them, they are just happily clueless.

The only problem is that I was so focused on my academic studies and trying to get good grades that I did not make any friends. The people whom tried to befriend me I have pushed away. Idk why I do the things I do but I just do and sometimes I overreact and get angry. After some time alone I realized that I may die alone and I may never find love.

The main reason I believe so is because I live in a very Conservative catholic country. In order for me to find love I need to escape my country since I do not find anyone in my area attractive at all.

Am not religous but am spiritually inclined- again what you believe in doesn't sway or change my opinion on anything.  I like to hear different views. 

My favorite color is purple. And I'm left handed. 

I have a dog-- can you guess what kind?

Age isn't of issue to me- all I ask is that you are 19 or older. 

I would greatly appreciate to not receive unsolicited pictures of your dick or otherwise. Don't let your intro be an ""I'm horny"" message. Just go ahead and spare both of us. Yes? Cool. I am not interested in meaningless gratification.  

Expectations are low, which works on your behalf. Just looking to see if our energies mesh. 

Am not opposed to showing my face at some point if we decide to continue communication. 

I am an aquarius- not sure how much that matters but I know it does to some so there ya go. 

Humor can be a bit on the dark and also dry side of things so don't take me to heart on that. 

I'm usually late to the party on most things in entertainment, for example: I just started stranger things a couple months ago. Haven't watched any of the new season. 

I don't game much and I'm not into anime- which in reddit world is grounds of being burned at the stake from what I have gathered. 

I enjoy music greatly many different genres- very diverse. Am always up to hear something new. So feel free to send something you find groovy.

2754,throneawry,1655257513,1,"I feel like dog shit right now and I'm just going to dive into a full on rant about myself, ok?

I haven't been normal since middle school (we don't call it that here in the UK but I think it's the equivalent), I was bullied and this led to me developing peculiar mannerisms and social habits (in order not to fall into a bully's traps, I would often answer their questions nonsensically so that they did not know what to say; however, I wound up reacting like that to questions from everyone else) that no doubt led to my current inability to socialise. I have to say that I'm a decently charismatic person when I'm comfortable, but I often get uncomfortable when dealing with more than one person and can be incredibly awkward and timid. I might have been bullied as a kid, but in general my life has never been  materially difficult. My parents were divorced but I was born too late to witness their conflict (they divorced when I was like 1.5). I was brought up mainly by my mother, who struggled especially with an emotionally straining job, and she wasn't that wealthy but I cannot recall ever suffering for it. My dad is wealthier and I spent a few days a week with him. Now I stay with them both equally, I'm 18 rn btw. They have never enforced chores or really any responsibility onto me. However, I have managed to turn this privilege in on myself, and I only feel anger toward myself that I am doing so poorly in spite of my decent opportunities. I have always done the bare minimum in school and did decently well in my GCSEs *because* that was a year when exams were cancelled due to COVID and we got our predicted grades.

I've just finished the equivalent of high school in the UK and I know I didn't do very well (I didn't really revise, I have never been able to get myself to revise for anything and the few hours I did this year was probably more than I ever had done combined before) but I don't care that much. I've only ever cared because I know my parents will be disappointed when I get my results, but that's a few months away and for now I just feel meh about it. I am pretty damn sure I have social anxiety disorder and so I only engage in any communication with people if it is necessary. So most of my life is spent in my room playing games or watching YouTube videos, and occasionally I'll walk. When I started walking like two or three years ago I remember that it lifted my spirits, but like everything else it's just a miserable slog to me now. As far as friends go I have purely zero and only ever communicate with family. I try to get online friends but they have always been fleeting. I use dating apps and up until a few months ago I had a gf from there who I actually met IRL and, ya know, did the thing with. I guess I'm happy that I did it because I remember how insecure I was about being 18 and still not having sex yet, but I mean I didn't actually cum (she did in fairness). But I really miss those times because I actually had someone, all I want in my life is someone to love who actually gives a shit about me. She pushed me out of my comfort zone and my self-esteem skyrocketed. She was a bit of a loose cannon tho, so I wound up having to end. Btw, I'm not one of those incel loonies who resents women for not dating me. Still, it sucks how I get no attention on dating apps. I'd like to think I'm a decent-looking fella and I feel like I should expect a bit more attention, but that's an aside, I know it's not the heart of my issues.

I know completely that I should go to therapy. I know it doesn't work for everyone but if anybody should give it a go it's me. I want to change, I want to be able  to hang out with people, and I wanna meet IRL women, on whom I can flex my sense of humour and deep voice to make up for my ok looks. I'm tired of this hell I've created for myself, this total void wherein all of the needs of the human mind are expected to be sustained. I know how my life could be, and I'm not expecting to be wealthy or famous. To me, a few good friends and the ability to date women seems like heaven. I know this social fixation is probably a shallow reading of all of my issues, but if I am to get better that would be my motivator. Also, I imagine some people will recommend me attending clubs for my hobbies or other social events, but understand, a), that my town is pretty small and dead and, b), that I just don't have the courage to do that. I'll probably have to get a shitty job soon and that mine honestly help. Right now the main thing, I believe, is forcing myself into therapy. Whenever I'm at my lowest I always tell myself that enough is enough, and I must now get a psychologist/psychiatrist, but then things get a bit less worse and I lose the stomach for it.

I'm sorry that my writing is sometimes pretentious but I honestly have a bit of fun writing like that, and I'm sorry that it's so disorganised, but I really just felt like and had to vent somewhere, so here it be. I definitely feel better now. Bless you and have a great whatever time it is there.",lonely,"Angry, lonely, directionless",2022-06-15 11:45:13

And I skipped every other event (prom, senior class trip, etc.) anyways. So I stayed. Next time I’ll be at school is graduation rehearsal and graduation, and hopefully those will be relatively painless.

That aside, I’m glad to be leaving this place. I leave here with no friends, no memories (good or bad), and no real sense of ever belonging. I’m going to a great college and this summer is shaping up to be productive (license+job, finally! I think I’ll even start going to the gym). Whole life ahead of me, I think I can really start fresh as my own person. I might as well have slept through these four—no, thirteen—past years.

And yet, I’m still somehow sad. Not for the reality of what it all was. The reality was simply bleak: I had no life. I was simply not equal with my peers in a way that (socially) mattered. All interactions were as through a convex mirror, usually laced with “charitable”/pity-filled undertones, or an understanding that I was only a stand-in until someone they actually cared about showed up. But mostly I was just by myself. So I’m not sad over leaving all that behind. So what then?

Well, *what could’ve been*. I’m sad on screwing myself out of actually having friends, on not getting involved in extracurricular life, on not once even once casually hanging out with people, on missing every single fun event because I didn’t have anyone to go with—I wish it all went so different. I’m nostalgic for a past that *might have existed*. And now it never will because high school is over. There is no chance to try again—the door has closed with a resounding thud. A complete waste of time, and how much time do I really have left? How far behind am I from everyone else? How long will it take me to become well-adjusted? Will I ever be well-adjusted? I have new opportunities now but how do I know I won’t ruin them like I did high school? Have I ever *really* learned from my mistakes?

These are the questions I have. I can’t answer them. 

I’m glad as all Hell to leave this place behind but I’m sick to my stomach with regret and anticipation.

Im not here for romance or flirts at any of that nonsense. Basically I'm trying to be the person now that I could have used at various low points in my life. I don't have a lot to give back but I have a little time and I feel like that's all most people really need.

A bit bout myself without getting too personal. I'm a dad. I work hard. I work a lot of hours, but I've been cutting back for my own mental health.I've been doing quite a few things to work on myself the last few years and this is where I'm at.

I know what it's like to be marginalized by majorities. I know what it is like to be rejected by your family and peers. I know what it is like to lose people. I've known a lot of betrayal and toxic relationships.  I have struggled with depression and drank way too much for way too long. I've come a peach fuzz hair away from shutting my lights off one last time. But I've overcome.

I'm far from where I want to be, but part of that journey is being a light for others.  There are a lot of folks out there who are a lot better at this than me, but I want to do my part.  A lot of times in my life I simply could have simply used a father figure who was proud of me and I cannot imagine my children having to struggle through anything without knowing that Ive got their backs no matter what.

Now that I've made it through life long enough to sit here with silver hairs overtaking my head, but a feeling of peace finally setting in... whatever you're going through in this moment, know this.

I am an empath, recently learning this vital fact has changed my perspective on why I feel these strong emotions… Still I understand everything that has ever happened was 100% of my own doing… 
I am brave against my suffering though, because there isn’t anyone else who I could allow to ever feel this way, &amp; there is no way I could devastate my family even though they’re A reason why I don’t want to be alive… 

I love everyone, even the people who hate my guts, and all I ever have wanted was to love, but everywhere I go all I feel is hatred, something which I have never asked to perceive.
 
I don’t know why but I felt like sharing even though I dislike expressing how I feel. No one I’ve met loves or cares like I do. (Which is fine) More importantly, everyone is going through their own issue’s. I am alone &amp; that is okay.

No one has A clue of the deepest darkest abyss that resides within my soul. A cracked teapot that leaks, then stains my heart with the agony of never being loved. 

- I need to continue to be brave &amp; keep pushing because that’s the only option I have. I should see a therapist but I also believe I can overcome these thoughts because I’ve wanted to die ever since I was born ~ Ever since I realized that no one will ever care about me the same way I care. Even the ones who scorn me, they’re the ones who need the most love in my eye’s.

 I apologize for existing &amp; if I could start again… a million miles away, I would keep myself, I would find a way.",lonely,Hello :),2022-06-15 06:32:44
2793,Feeling_Atmosphere_5,1655238200,1,"24M by the way, and throughout those years on Earth... I still manage to not really have a genuine friendship/relationship with other people. Although I do work a part time job (not saying where I work sorry), I don't really talk to any of my co workers. But whenever I do so, it's just very briefly. Not so much a full on conversation. Another thing too as well that I tend to have pretty bad social anxiety, as well as being an autistic since I was a year old child. So it makes a bit harder for me to start, or even hold a proper conversation with other's. I know that a lot people tell me to just ""focus on myself"" and ""love yourself and no other's"".

***Importnat:This is not my experience, I came across this on Twitter and it clicked.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My friend did something and didn’t invite me. I felt bad and asked her what happened and she reminded me some of those days she invited me and I didn’t make it because “I don’t like going out”  
&gt;  
&gt;That communication made me realize it’s me who made her feel she wasn’t important.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I had allowed anger in and didn’t communicate, I would have been angry not knowing it’s my fault.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sometimes, the reason why people stop seeing you as important is your fault not theirs.  
&gt;  
&gt;At that point, it clicked and really not going out isn’t an excuse being absent because if you don’t go for peoples event, no one will come for yours.  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand liking your own space but always make sure to be there for people that matter and not leave them questioning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their importance. I didn’t miss those event on purpose or because I’m not happy for them but again not going out isn’t an excuse and that conversation with her made me click that this is why most times no one invites me because “she won’t come”  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m someone who’s genuinely happy for people. I always say that to people in my corner and they know and my action has probably never matched my words because I’m not always there so here I am now making conscious effort to make sure I never miss any important day or event.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know I’ve hurt some people with this part of me and it wasn’t intentional but henceforth for every love and respect I have for a friend, there’s going to be a matching energy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let people know how much they matter

I, myself am an extrovert, even then I have to make effort to know people, attend things which are important to them, doesn't matter how colossal waste of time that is in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, sometimes I still feel lonely, but with age, I have realised that it's because of a lack of an intimate partner, not because of lack of people in my life.  


I would say, repair those burnt bridges, I know for some it's too late, but some can still be salvaged. I do understand, it might require some significant effort, but that I still less energy invested than when that feeling of lonliness creeps in.  


Hopefully, this does not come off as patronizing. I have a dear friend whom I have been known for ages and it takes significant effort on my part to have communication channels open for them and making sure that they don't end up feeling lonely again.

There's not a single day that i don't cry myself to sleep everyday. I feel so lonely. I want to be seen , loved and most importantly, held.
Even if it's just a casual thing, i want someone to hold me and tell me they care.i want someone to show me kindness. 
Recently i vised a friend who i like romantically too, but he could not or did not saw me as a romantic interest anymore. I respected his space and his lack of interest. So , i didn't not make any attempts to connect with him deeply or made any moves. He respects my friendship and he deserves a friend who doesn't use him for her needs. 
While i was at his place, most of the time he was in his world and i was forced to be in mine and it was terrible. That's what I try to Espace by hanging out with people. But, alas! So, not feeling the same energy from someone i like always reminds me of how lonely i am. I cried myself to sleep at his place too. I got a separate room 😔. I guess he didn't feel the chemistry anymore or just wasn't interested.
God know how much i resisted the urge to hold his hand or touch his hair or express my love in some way. But ik , we're not compatible, he is his own person and my needs are not compatible with someone who likes to be on their own most of the time.so, it's for the best anyway. Idk. It would have felt good to be held by him though. Ik, I'm just screaming into the void here shouting That i want to be held but it's all i can do now. People on dating sites don't just want to hold you. People who want to hold you are not capable of doing that anymore.I wish I had someone to talk to everyday atleast.

If it weren't for my cat I probably would not have spoken a single word in that time.

I have talked to friends through social media, but it was nothing deeper than sending memes. On top of that, texting feels more removed somehow. It's still ""talking"", but doesn't really feel like it, you know?

I don't mean to shit on my friends, they are amazing people and they have finals right now, last year of college, so I completely understand why it's been so quiet lately. It's just that it doesn't make it easier to handle.

In the last year my social life has drastically died down, mostly because I started working and didn't have much free time anymore, but I've usually never been this lonely for this long.

I really have to thank my cat though, he's the only reason I'm still hanging on. I love the furry fucker, he makes me feel loved when the rest of my life is looking really gray right now.

I usually try to explain it before the first date but it feels so odd to talk about with someone I haven’t even met. I can’t imagine a guy being ok waiting months. I’d be fine with him fucking other women, I just think that might make it take even longer to feel connected and safe. Part of me wants just lay there and take it until I get used to it, but I feel like most guys wouldn’t be ok with that. I’ve kinda resigned to just never date at this point. I do try to go on first dates cuz maybe I’m not wasting that much if his time, but I still feel bad for him.",lonely,I wish I [23f] could have sex more easily.,2022-06-14 14:55:10

But the loneliness I have is partially because of my own mind. Everyone I know has been very busy these days and I don't really want to bother them. But slowly I've been isolating myself because I keep feeling like I'm not someone worth to be cared for. I keep pushing friends away that wants to get closer to me because it scares me to open up to someone again. I've been talking to myself a lot more and the loneliness is getting worse. But I can't do anything because the only person I really love talking to has a lot to do and I keep failing to start a good conversation in the little time we have.

I have a family that doesn’t get along with each other and because I am ""different and weird"", I am ignored and not listened to or understood. It has always been like this and it always will be.

I can’t keep a friend for anything in the world. I just lost my last two good friends to high school, I guess we just grew apart from each other. It seems like that is always what happens, so what’s the point of even trying to make new friends?

written approx Nov 01/21 


I found a guy on reddit. His previous posts painted a picture of a man who had ""never had a friend or girlfriend,"" describing how his family doesn't like him, how he's ""a lonely single loser with no life experiences."" I knew right away that he was someone I could relate to, someone I would get along with, someone who would understand me. I messaged him. I learned that we liked a lot of the same things and wanted the same things out of life. We started a relationship pretty quickly, getting lovey and affectionate and also sexual. We moved to Whatsapp and we moved to having actual phone calls, every single night for at least two hours, then moving to sleeping together on the phone every night and watching movies together during the day, sharing music, video calling, eventually spending all our time together. I went to Oklahoma twice to visit him. We spent every waking hour and every sleeping hour together during the times we were physically apart. Seven weeks ago, he came to Canada. Other than my mental illnesses fucking with me during that time, it was pure bliss. I was so goddamn happy. So secure in his love for me. So in love with him. More positive emotions than I've ever felt in my entire life. He comforted me, counselled me, was always there to talk and to listen. He said the most sweet, romantic, sentimental things I could ever hope to be said to me. For twelve months. We shared an anniversary together on October 13th. I was looking forward to spending Halloween night with him watching a Silent Hill 2 playthrough on YouTube as we had that same night last year. We had a place -- a special location that was ours. We had a song -- Neon Moon. We sang to eachother. We went so many places together and shared so so so many experiences, both on the phone and in real life. We were going to get married, he said. I had an account with my bank titled ""Immigration Application"" and I was saving money for that, despite struggling with rent and car insurance. We always told eachother how precious &amp; perfect we were to one another. We never did an unkind thing to the other, not once. When I was doing poorly with my mental health or my trust issues, he'd shake me and look me in the eyes with the most sincere expression on his face and say ""I'd never lie to you. I love you. You are the one I want to spend my life with."" He told me he'd never abuse my trust or hurt me. There were some things I was mildly suspicious about for a moment -- how he'd hide his phone when I came near him, how some of the things he told me would contradict earlier things he'd said. Though I'd never accuse him of lying, I'd ask him a question and he'd hold me by the shoulders and look into my eyes and say those comforting words, and I'd feel better. I trusted him one hundred percent. How could I not? He was perfect. I knew he was my soulmate, my other half. He said the same about me. We had a unique relationship -- something very special, something that would be considered weird by all the normies out there. [edited to remove personal/intimate details]

Then shit hit the fan. Basically, I found out about one thing he had lied about, and then more and more came out. Things he lied about from the beginning. Things he had made up even before we had started talking. See, he fished for someone like me. Everything on his reddit account? All fabricated bullshit designed to endear &amp; entrap a lonely girl like me. He feeds off sympathy and attention, I guess. Always has -- he ended up telling me he'd been doing it for most of his life. He lied about everything about himself. Everything, small and large. I never knew him. I don't even think he knows himself. I was DEVASTATED and still am. Guess I'm just another victim of the catfish scam. But he never wanted money. Sure, he wanted certain material goods and foods, but he never badgered me into it -- he was more about pathetic manipulation. Emotional gratification. Basically anything anyone could ever possibly say to make their life seem sad, he said it. This all feels so surreal to me.

I've come to the conclusion that he was never attracted to me (I'm not a physically attractive person, and there were issues with his ""performance"" that I'm now sure were due to the way I look, though he always told me that he viewed beauty differently than most people do.) I believe he was very attached to me and wanted to be the person he presented to be. I believe he would have actually married me. Why? To get to Canada. To be taken care of and loved. To have his future set up for him. Or maybe because he doesn't really care what happens to him or anybody else. He never intended on coming clean about the lies. He never intended to let me really get to know him. He would have been perfectly fine living a lie forever and taking those secrets to his grave. 

Now I'm left here on this godforsaken planet alone, to deal with the knowledge of this: I am not worthy of attraction or any kind of meaningful relationship. I'm not worthy to be loved or wanted. I wouldn't even be able to deal with the thought of that ever happening for me. I don't know how I'll ever trust another person again. 

I know he's sick. Pathological liar: It's just another facet to his mental illness. I can't really fault him, can I? But at the same time, I do fault him, because he's an intelligent person who was aware of what he was doing all along. Is it rational to mourn the loss of a person who never even really existed? He wasn't real. Why should I be so heartbroken? 

I'll never find a person like him again, because people like him don't exist. He'd always tell me ""I know I seem too good to be true, but I'm the real deal."" But of course, he was too good to be true.

I've been sitting in my car chainsmoking for three days. My throat hurts. My eyes hurt. I haven't eaten or slept much. I can't bring myself to go to the bathroom because that's one of the places where we bonded. Anywhere I could drive around here is somewhere we've been together. To say it hurts would be the understatement of a lifetime. 

God, I miss him. I miss his face. I miss the way he looked at me. I miss kissing him. I miss holding his dick. I miss touching his hair. I miss his smell. I miss him. 

Where am I to go from here? I have no clue. I'm a lost puppie.

My name is August! I'm an  living in the west coast, and I'm offering comfort through ASMR, sleep-aid, and late night voice calls for anyone who needs it.

To give some background: I'm a reserved student by day, and an empathetic listener by night. I enjoy connecting with people, and exercising my judgement to help guide those who need it. While I understand that I'm fairly young, I like to believe that I have gained enough wisdom to steer people in the right direction.

I want to mention that I'm a fairly busy person. I always have a next assignment to do, so I can only arrange calls during night hours. Because of the hectic order of my life, I am a bad texter. Don't expect a lot of responsiveness on my side (sorry!), I prefer voice-chatting all the way.

If you're going through some hard times - relationship, career, or mental issues - and need someone to vent to, I can be your person. Even if it's something as small as self esteem, I can listen to you and give you some comments that tell you you are doing well.

This can get a little vulnerable, but please make sure to stay within the no-nsfw zone. If you've made it this far, and you want to reach out, please ***PM me your name, age, and location.*** ***Also tell me about what you're going through,*** and we can work something out!

I'm currently doing work and sending these offers sporadically through out the day, so don't feel discourage if you don't get a quick response! Looking forward to talking soon!

Yes, I know it sucks not to have anyone irl wish you or to have fun with.. but I kinda actually also feel the opposite way sometimes. I miss being able to wish other people on their birthdays. I miss being able to celebrate the existence of people in my life. I miss being able to sometimes bring a smile on their faces, and to share their joyous moments with them. 

I know I can't ever have friends again, so I'll never have that opportunity to genuinely wish someone again irl. I know I'm awful and hurtful to others, and it's best that I avoid the good people of this world in real life. That's why just being able to write ""Happy Birthday mate!"" from behind a screen to the good people out here just puts my heart at a little bit of ease. Even if by a little bit, it makes me feel genuinely good and glad to have that opportunity despite being a total stranger. I never miss wishing the OP on any of the birthday posts that I do see on my feed, and I hope I don't miss any in the future as well.

So to all of you, thank you so much for sharing your special day with us. It means a lot, at least to me.

ever since i was young i’ve always struggled with making &amp; keeping friends, and as a teen had several experiences with extremely toxic and borderline abusive friends. Today I only have 2 friends (from high school) that I’m close enough with to like casually text my thoughts and joke around and send random tiktoks/memes/screenshots to (like actual friends, not just awkward catching up “how was your weekend” &amp; ect. small talk) but they live on the opposite side of the country (I see them IRL maybe once a year) and both have super busy and important lives and I literally HATE myself for texting them non stop whenever I have something to say or find something to share because they’re clearly busy and not interested in talking to me as much anymore unless it’s something important, they haven’t said anything about it (to me at least) but it’s obvious through their responses and lack there of. 

Meeting people in college didn’t really work out for me as I started at a community college during the beginning of the pandemic and transferred to an online university program. I’ve been using Bumble BFF for about 2 years, met up with dozens of girls around my age with similar interests/hobbies but I never found an actual friend on there. I feel so awkward and shy and like an outsider meeting new people I want to cry on the inside the entire time, i feel like this anxiety is ruining my chances of making friends no matter how much we have in common. I’ve also started to feel this way even with my 2 close friends on the few occasions I actually see them in real life when they’re back here for the holidays or whatever.

My parents have always said I seem rude when i’m meeting people but I’m truly not trying to be, I just feel so guarded and shy. I’ve always had this feeling that some people are “Like” me and other people aren’t, I can’t really explain it. I do NOT think i’m better than or too good for people, it’s more the opposite I feel like I don’t fit in most with other people. No matter how hard I try to force a friendship I can never truly connect with new people and every friend I try to make never leaves the awkward small talk, adding eachother on social media &amp; uncomfortable coffee shop meet up phases. It never turns into an actual friendship. 

I’ve never had a best friend or friend group, and I just want some friends, hell I just want ONE friend, my mental health has been rapidly deteriorating this year from a lack of social interaction and I’m tired of crying every time I see my phone because I never get a single text or call from anyone or when I want to talk about or share something and I realize i have no one I can text about it, and when i run out of new people to swipe on BFF without finding any potential new friends yet again. 

and also I’m not looking for one right now, but It’s really hard to try to be in any romantic relationships because I have no friends and seem like a total loser and my mental illness &amp; attachment issues that’s rooted in my lifelong loneliness, Which I feel like friends would help with so It seems like these go hand in hand when and if i’m ever looking for a relationship again. 

How do I make actual friendships and connect with people ? How do I turn basic small talk into actual conversations/ discussions about similar interests ? How can I feel comfortable and close enough with a stranger to be able to open up and joke around with them? How can I feel more comfortable with new people and not so awkward? How do I turn “meeting up with someone from bumble BFF” to “hanging out with a friend”?",lonely,22F struggling to make friends/bumble bff,2022-06-14 03:10:07

I feel like stuck in a difficult situation:

- I live alone and abroad. My situation is a little bit complicated. I was born in a certain country. I moved to another. Then ultimately was forced - my marriage turning fucked up and I was jobless (in the second country), to move where I'm now. Problem is that I did a lot of attemps to socialize...unsuccessfully.

- I work from home as an IT contractor...The job atmosphere turnt chaotic and messy, this is a limited contract and the consulting company I work for, you know, start to hassle me with ""Yes but..."". Ultimately, I will be forced to dismiss or I will be fired...Basically, I live and work from the same place. I feel...oppressed more and more.

- I had this weekend a bold Whatsapp argument with my ex - who is technically still my wife...I never see my kids. And she's behaving hysterical...Accusing of this and that, not aknowledging that being a father remotely oversea ain't exactly the easiest task.

- I had for long sleep issues...Now I try to quit mix of sleep medications. It's in very good way. But I feel tired.

- I go to the gym 3 hours a day...but it's mechanical, like some duty.

- Going out ? Yeah I go to see movies, go to the super maeket...But there is not so much to do. Boring.

- Tried to date...A lot of non-sense and failures. Found a divorced woman but I feel she craveq for sex in a manner that can never be humanly satisfied...And one night a week does not really fill emotional gap. And she lives in universe's asshole, 2 hours drive.

- All my situation feels hassling and more and more tiring. Financially, the edge is not so far.

Am I sick or anyone would find all this suffocating ?

I've replaced pretty much all my social activity with drinking. I try to find more positive activities to do that don't involve myself just exercising or reading because at the end of the day I'm still usually alone myself.

Long rant sorry I'm done.

I went through a lot of bullying in grade school and middle school due to being more sensitive than most kids so I was prone to it and adults around me often dismissed and invalidated my feelings. I also went through sexual harassment by a male peer and went through bad emotional abuse by a guidance counselor in middle school for over year. As a result from these experiences, I have PTSD and have struggled with social anxiety. I also have an intense fear of rejection and needing constant validation from others in order to feel good about myself.

I also didn't have the best experience in high school. I was involved in a religious youth organization and it felt very cult-like. They all acted like they accepted me for who I was but they didn't and they treated me unfairly. I felt more free in my life when I left and I entered college. I went to therapy for these traumatic experiences but I'm not in therapy right now.

For my 21st birthday last month, my twin and I threw a party in late April and she had a much different childhood background than me. I invited close to 30 but only around 7 showed up. I took that very personally due to my past and felt like no one liked me. My twin invited more people than me so more people showed up. It was during finals week at my college and people reassured me that it was because of finals but I just felt like no one even cared about me and like I was a kid again.

The next day was my actual birthday and I was crying for the whole day and was considering suicide. I felt like my self esteem was destroyed. Many people reassured me that day that those not coming had nothing to do with me and that people are just busy.

I had a few celebrations for my birthday that were a little better than my party. However, the kids group that is the part of that religious organization that traumatized me during high school sent me a happy birthday card and saying how grateful they were that I helped out with the kids. I got that letter yesterday and felt immediately triggered. My parents still attend there and told them it was my birthday so they sent a letter. But I don't want contact from any of them so I threw the letter away. I haven't even been there in 3 years and there's a fucking reason for that. I don't want to fucking hear from them!

Overall, I was experiencing a lot of loneliness on my birthday and having all these triggers on my birthday didn't help. And I feel upset since 21st bdays are supposed to be a big deal and to be very fun and I honestly had way better birthdays than this. I just feel really depressed right now and don't know how to make things better. Any advice would be appreciated.

TLDR: Didn't have the best birthday as I threw a party for a lot of people to not come and receiving a lot of PTSD triggers. Need some support and advice as I'm upset.",lonely,Didn't have the best 21st bday and feeling very upset. Need advice.,2022-06-14 00:03:49

I have seen many articles and posts that they are lonely once they're moving abroad, but for me, it has been lonely even when I have been living here all my life.         

Currently I feel more and more lonely physically as people around me and my so-called friends are busy, they aren't always available to hang out from time to time, and I just couldn't stand doing things alone all the time anymore. No matter how many times I asked them if we wanna hang out somewhere, they just said no, or they would only reply to me few days later (again, with a no).        

It makes me realized also that although people in my country are friendly (I'm from Malaysia btw), they aren't really invested in meeting up with new people like me and prefer to be with their existing circles. So it only makes me feel more lonely :/

sometimes I'd get really sick to the point I'd pass out if I stood up for too long. but even then I didn't really show how I felt, I'm pretty good at making a blank facial expression.

I’m a fairly introverted person who enjoys time on my own because it’s easier, and I tend to see the worst in allot of people which is made worse by my job as a first responder. Most of the time I’m fairly lonely, I’ll often crave a relationship or even just the relaxation of physical intimacy, or at the very least a deep conversation.

I’ve never had an actual relationship, just a dozenish hookups over the last few years. Sometimes I feel like I’d want a relationship. I mean I think I can get one, I’d say I’m like a 6 or a 7. But then I remember that I suck at flirting or talking to women outside of a work context. I’ve got some belly fat/love handles, so I’m not clinically obese, yet I feel self critical of my appearance, and that no one actually finds me attractive. My two friends try and encourage me to go to go on a dating app but I’m convinced that I don’t deserve a relationship. To add onto it I’m a closeted bi guy, so half the people I’m interested in I can’t pursue anyways.

To help distract myself from this I’ll work 25-30 days a month at multiple jobs. One as a paramedic, second as a military reservist. I truly love my jobs, but I work so much to always be busy and forget that I’m alone, also to punish myself because I kind of hate myself for various reasons. I’m fairly convinced I was put on this earth so I could take the mental burden of helping with other people’s problems while neglecting my own.

Overall I’m a pretty lonely and sometimes sad person.  A tad depressed half of the time, but overall I’ve had a blessed life. I’m definitely not suicidal, and honestly don’t think I’d ever attempt it especially after seeing it go horrifically wrong at work. That being said, I wouldn’t care if I was killed in an accident tomorrow, or take someone’s place in a risky deployment so they could be safe with their family and I could just be done with everything and forgotten. Sometimes I actually wish for it. But until that day comes I’m just gonna keep existing. Maybe I can even get past this one day.

It’s like I’m wired for high extroversion but I have no friends at all, it’s driving me insane. It’s been like this for the 12 years of my 17 year old self.

And the 5 years that I thought I had friends, I was met with manipulative people that only used me for their own benefits.

I hope college is better, but I don’t wanna put so much hope on it and then get let down once again. 

Who cares how a random person on the internet feels anyways, it’ll all fade away tommorow. 

Life gets super lonely, when you’re wasting summer nights, coding and playing video games to fill the void of a lacking social life.

Just the other day I paid for $3 blackbear/mgk/Iann Dior tickets just for my mom to step in and blames Covid saying I could’ve died from it. Even though she works with sick people everyday. The sad thing is that I still haven’t gotten my money back

So I go back to coding, and playing video games maybe add in some pleasure like jerking off and drinking and boom you have my ideal day.

3087,SpiralSour,1655091314,1,"Hello r/lonely, this is really just an impromptu vent that I trust I won't be judged for because, well, this is r/lonely.

When I was ten years old, I was pulled out of school due to a girl falsely accusing me of threatening to rape her. I was subject to years of manipulation and emotional abuse/neglect at the hands of my mother and to a lesser extent, stepfather.

I developed janked as fuck, and still lack maturity in some places my similarly aged peers have already mastered, as well as having maturity in places they do not. 

I'm sixteen currently, and last year in June, after having effectively no friends or prolonged human interaction, I found my tribe. It was a homeschool recovery group for fellas such as myself that had been subject to intense isolation and suffered the repercussions that has on a human, especially when it occurs at a young age. I fell in love, a girl and a boy, at the same time.

They fell in love with each other and me. We had a truly beautiful relationship and I considered them my family for life. It was all virtual, but through video calls, and texting sessions that spanned several, several hours, it was every bit as magical as a first love should be.

It lasted roughly five months, but the cracks started forming after three. Due to a difference of moralistic opinions, my girlfriend ghosted me in early December, citing a loss of passion. Not that I ever heard her say that, the other boy in this relationship was told that by her, and while she felt bad, she didn't feel bad enough to respond to me.

Shortly after that, the boy, who had a complicated relationship with me, but who I dubbed ""my brother"", came to a somewhat mutual agreement with me that we were corroding each other. We were detrimental to each other's development and it was time for us to take a break, for how long was unclear, but our love had been so marvelous at it's peak, it would inevitably, one day, resume.

I almost immediately got closer with two others from the homeschool recovery group, I had talked with them before, but never at great length. It wasn't as instant as my love for the previous two, but it did eventually develop into a love of sorts. They were my best friends.

I was still reeling from losing my brother and the girl I wanted to marry, I trusted them and I confided in them, they were like a chair you sit on at the end of a long day. You don't expect the chair to break. The thought doesn't even cross your mind. The day was so exhausting, and took such a toll on you, surely it would be karmically cruel for this chair to fail you, to collapse and confirm what this hellacious day has been trying to teach you. 

The universe does not fucking like you.

An argument. I don't even know how it began. It started as a small disagreement, and over the course of an hour and a half of failed de-escalations, crescendoed into the anticlimactic implosion of the first of my two friendships.

The one remaining friend. I loved her, truly, and more than that, I trusted her. I asked her if me and her had any lingering issues that needed to be qualmed. She said no. She said we were fine.

A phone call. Late April, me and her hadn't been talking as often since me and our mutual friend disconnected. We talked for hours. About her being an aunt to my prospective son. I went to sleep with a best friend. I woke up without one.

A string of paragraphs describing how fed up she had become with me, how she appreciated all I've done for her, but that it was time to cut contact. A hypocritical display of heart-wrenching abandonment. She said we were fine.

I had since come to learn my brother had actually convinced her to stop talking to me, despite having a front row view to and condemning what our girlfriend did to me. 

A girlfriend, a brother, two best friends. I truly thought, consistently, in one way or another, from June 2021 - April 2022, that I would never be alone again. I was wrong. It feels so alien, having nobody to talk to about the things I struggle with, my anxieties, my fears, my success. I got so comfortable and entrenched in the joy of having company that I had forgotten how ill I am without it. 

There's not a soul in the world that I can truly say I love, and arguably, not one that loves me either.

I tried so hard to make it work, to ensure I wouldn't end up here again, to show my love for my tribe, but despite my very best efforts, I must admit, once again, **I am lonely.**",lonely,I thought I had gotten out,2022-06-13 13:35:14

When they came back, I tried to continue on, but anyone that I went to talk about it, well they blew me off and didn’t let me talk about it and then distant themselves from me, just like what happened when I was 7. 

I ended up posting a lot of my spirals on FB, I actually lost a job from one of my spirals because in a post I mentioned the company and in previous posts I talked about my attacks from my childhood, they said what I wrote over my attacks was ‘disturbing.’ I stopped using a majority of social media because a lot of people were saying that I was just wanting attention or that I was crazy. All I want is just some support.

A few years later, when I was working for a restaurant, people that I considered friends or something would come in, I would be excited about seeing them and they would just treat me like I was some weirdo and then never come back.

My fiancé suggested that I talked to his friend about what happened to me because he is an ordained minister and worked with one of my attackers. I told him via messenger about what happened and we all were supposed to meet in person to talk about it, and it’s been years since we talked. Anytime my fiancé would try to message him to meet up, he would always be busy or would just leave him on read. If we would see him at his work, he would only say ‘hi’ and then leave for the back when previously he used to chat with my fiancé. My guy wanted this man to be involved in our wedding party, but I feel that after I tried telling him what happened, that he has distanced himself from us and it hurts him so much.

3135,MarieDifr,1655076999,1,"I married someone who is aggressive and mean. He constantly likes to point out my flaws and make me feel little. Like i get it, im ugly and fat, or as he likes to tell me, ""you're not completely hopeless and could be attractive if you lost some weight, but will never look like you did at 18 when we met"". He's 10 years older than me as well.

People are quick to just tell me to leave, but I can't. I'm disabled, rely on him to take care of me, my parents are super poor and my dad is going through chemo currently, so I would only be a burden to them that they couldn't afford. I don't have any friends. I'm great at pushing people away because I can be quite the negative Nancy, because life fucking sucks. Also, I've had some mental health problems and been inpaitent 40+ times over the course of 8 years. I made some shitty mistakes last time I tried to leave him and ended up in a hole in someone's basement for 6 months, no joke. Being abducted has everything to do with my mental health problems and why I was so unconcerned about being fat for a while.  I've lost 80 lbs now the last 8 months, or so. 
We have a daughter who is soon to be 9 and if I leave, he will certainly get custody. My mental health record, including suicide attempts, make sure of that. When I was 14 I fell 60' off a cliff while put with ROTC, it messed me up pretty badly, buy I recovered for the most part. I graduated early and got a bachelor's in organic chemistry, commissioned into the Navy, got a dishonorable discharge(long story), but managed to get shot in the abdomen during my service. I survived and got better and then got my master's in Chemical Engineering. Then got pregnant with my daughter and was so sick with her that I spent 4 months in the hospital and she came at 7 months. She was in a bad way for a little while, but she's just a normal kid now. Truly the thing I am most thankful for. If I left and he got custody of her I could never forgive myself. I'm trying to hold out until she's 18 and I no longer have to worry about whose custody she'll end up in. I needed a shunt placed 2 years ago and have it placed 4 times total. If you're unsure what that is, it's a catheter that runs to the ventricles of my brain and has a tube coming out the back of my skull(still under my skin) that feeds down through my neck and drains all the spinal fluid that shouldn't be building up into my brain into my abdomen so my body can reabsorb it. I have hydrocephalus, for which I take medication that's main side effect is weight gain. Then on top of that I had a brain tumor removed last October, a stroke in April and an aneurysm in May, both of this year. It's been a rough year. Ha. 

Anyway, I've rambled on enough about my existence. All I really want is to feel loved and wanted by someone romantically. Maybe there's someone in the same kind of shitty situation, but I hope not, for their sake. In the off chance there is maybe someone will message me. I'm not holding my breath. I'm used to being alone. I've grown accustomed to a damp pillow every night as I wish that God, or whatever cosmic power, would just end my suffering. 

I live in Texas, if that's important to the picture at all. 

I'm not so depressed all the time. I like to paint and draw and craft in general. I love music, movies and reading. 

My favorite music is Elliott Smith, Bright Eyes/Conor Oberst, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Belle and Sebastian, basically stuff like that. I also love jazz, mid 2000's emo, and a lot of random other stuff.

My favorites movies are Punch-Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, Ghost World, Magnolia, A Clockwork Orange, Goodwill Hunting, Mad Max, Aliens, Trading Places, American Psycho... you probably get the gist of it...

Books can probably be broken down by author, my favorite author is JG Ballard, although my favorite book is probably Infinite Jest. I also love reading Bret Easton Ellis, Don DeLillo, Cormac McCarthy, William S Burroughs. Thomas Pynchon, etc... 
I used to be really into comics and have a large collection. 150+ long boxes of them. The current state of super heros and comics in pop culture really put a bitter taste in my mouth about them and caused some disdain. Everything has to have an agenda these days it seems and with the MCU being so popular it started bleeding over into most comics.

3142,sax2Bond,1655074694,1,"Dear fellow lonely hearts,  
As I walked into my 40s I feel like I walked into the winter of my life. Friends who once were have become strangers or just phantoms from the past.  My parents died a few years ago and I had no idea how that changed everything for me.  How much they shielded me all my life from feeling the cruelty of a lonely world for those who are ... less than a social butterfly.  I never thought of myself as alone. I always thought I had friends but it turns out...not really.  I had colleagues, old schoolmates, and distant family members.  It has been years since I really had a friend to rely on. Sad, but I think it's kind of normal in America. I wish I had known this beforehand and I might have been a little more serious about settling down and not being so picky or waiting for that perfect spouse. Especially, when I consider I'm no great catch.  I also might have given more thought to my health and finances and not to a frivolous pursuit of turning a hobby into a successful business.  Only follow your heart if it profits you.  All this realization is like waking from a good dream to find out life is something of a nightmare. Not the short and terrifying kind but the long and dreadful kind.  My only saving grace is my faith in Christ. All these years I never took too much thought about reading the Bible but now I do find peace when I read it and I do feel as if God does talk to us through His word.  Full disclosure: I hate to read the small print so I find it much easier listening to an audio Bible. This is not to preach but to share. Life is a gift but it also seems like a marathon and  I now truly understand the levity of life, death, loneliness, and faith.  I hope and pray life will get better for all of us with lonely hearts and I appreciate it if you would do the same for me. Take care, don't lose heart, and may God bless you.",lonely,Ever so lonely but not without hope.,2022-06-13 08:58:14

3144,throwaway48674,1655074526,1,"So I (22M) have been trying make friends all my life and it would always end up the same. Throughout elementary/middle school, I only had “school” friends. Friends that were only my friends during the school year, then next year, I wouldn’t be friends with them, mostly because we didn’t share any classes. Then come high school, I had a friend group from freshmen to senior year. A lot of friends would leave because the “leader” of the friend group would push them away. Me being naive didn’t believe that I’d be pushed away. Come my senior year, Id leave that group because the leader turned out to be fake (go figure). Ever since graduating, I’d make friends but it’d only really last about a year before my “shine” wears off on them. It’d be good and dandy at first but as time goes on. I see that they invite me less and generally aren’t as excited to be hanging with me or making an effort to hang as they use to. I’m a very considerate person and I enjoy making people happy and laugh, as making other people happy is what makes me the happiest. I try and be there for my friends and trust them, but I’m not sure they can be there for me. With my job, I tend to leave town and I’m not physically there to hang with my friends for several weeks to months at a time and during this time, I might as well not exist to them.

3151,impressivepenguin9,1655071410,1,"At the end of April, I had to undergo back surgery for the second time in three years. When I woke up, almost my entire right leg was numb. I was in the hospital for almost three weeks. At that point, I was only seeing friends for just a little bit as they helped me do things like laundry and groceries. 

I currently use a walker to get around. I'm usually either stuck at home or at physical therapy. Of course, I'm grateful for the support I've gotten and resources I was able to access. It's just been physically and mentally taxing. 

I have tried doing social things, only to feel like a burden because I walk slowly and require certain accommodations so I stay within my restrictions. Sitting on hard surfaces like benches really hurts and walking on uneven ground or grass is taxing. It kind of feels like my friends don't understand that it's hard for me to feel included when they walk ahead faster. And people walking on the sidewalk...they don't even make room for me. It's frustrating that I get tired more easily even though I want to continue being social. 

Now, I'm finding that my friends are frequently hanging out together without me and even going out of their way to tell me what they did. It feels shitty because they know I'm not able to get around (I don't drive). It just makes me question my friendships because I fear that they'll just leave me out of things because I need more assistance. I don't want to feel this way, but it hurts to not feel included.

I just needed somewhere to vent. Please be gentle. This is all new for me (the first surgery went better than this time around). I have a lot of grief and financial hardships going on all at the same time. :/",lonely,feeling far away from friends,2022-06-13 08:03:30

I swear to god I’m cursed like that professor in Harry Potter. I can speak the plainest fucking English and somehow never be understood. Yeah, I’m an adult woman in America, maybe I’m just blind to how little we’ve progressed, but that seems like a cop-out.

There’s many examples, here’s another one from work. My boss tells me he will email me what I’m supposed to do for the day.

Really fucking stuck here. I do my best, unfortunately my therapist seemed to think I do communicate effectively, so I made no progress there. If I didn’t care for my brother, I’d stop going to events orchestrated by my mom. If I didn’t need to live, I’d stop working.

I said I can’t reciprocate his feelings. He tried to kiss me, said he wanted to stay over in my bed, then told me I misinterpreted everything and I should be willing to rebuff him constantly when we continue to hang out. Besides it was just a joke.

I asked how I can be clearer. The answer was that I’m not clear.

Last week, at 1 am, it was dark outside. My mom told me it was 11am. I had to get the Bible, look up Genesis Ch 1 vs 5. God called the light, day, and the darkness, night. Only then did she agree it was nighttime.

I told my friend I’m fucking paralyzed and can’t move and stare at the wall for hours imagining hitting my head. He said one day I’ll laugh at experiencing this paralysis. By the way, if we lived in the same country, he’d date me.

Two weeks ago I called a mental health retreat and said I needed to stay where someone would take me seriously. They did, until the end of the week, when another guest kept touching my leg and hugging me. “I know him from way back when,” one of the staff members told me. “That’s just how he is.” Another one said, when I asked for supervision, “we aren’t responsible for what happens between guests.”

I messaged my dog park group chat “I’m trying to figure out my work, class, and study schedule. Can I have (friend a’s) work schedule so I can plan dog park time too?” Friend b answered and said she did not like this idea. Conversation escalated to Friend B telling me I’m privileged, my problems aren’t real, I don’t have depression, I never improve. 

I blocked them. Yesterday they both showed up in my driveway to scream at me until I apologized for starting the fight. I did not apologize because I did not start a fight. I asked for Friend A’s work schedule. Even though they determined I do not have depression and all my problems are fake, they still thought I was dead somehow. Why would I be dead if I don’t have depression? Why would I be dead if I don’t have problems?

Today my mom told me I haven’t tried hard enough to find “my people”. I told her I’m paralyzed again, all I can do is lay here and stare at the wall. “Can you schedule yourself a counselor?” No. I cannot do anything. “Can you look up this facility near you?” No. I cannot do anything. “What do you want to do?” I cannot do anything.

4am in NYC

This city smells,

like defeat,

if this is the land of prosperity,

why are there so many homeless in the streets?

After a show about saving the world,

on the rooftop of The Empire State Building,

I decided to take a walk alone,

with no one but my feelings,

I started on the Lower East Side,

Houston St to be specific,

then headed north on Broadway,

night walks to me are intrinsic,

I reached Times Square,

and realized that New York is a ghetto,

yes that might offend some people,

so what both hate and love are my petrol,

look,

soiled gum stain the sidewalks,

like soiled dreams stain the soul,

and I’d continue but I’m tired,

my hopes are young but my soul is old,

not all that glitters is gold,

especially not these sequin dresses,

I see a lot of people with a lot of money,

still they don’t seem to know what blessed is,

caught in a vicious cycle,

earn spend repeat again,

just enough to get through,

casual sex casual friends,

nothing too serious,

don’t want to make waves,

just want to float here,

no longer need chains to be slaves,

see the American Dream,

has become somewhat of a nightmare,

and I know I could beat these demons,

if only they’d just fight fair,

wish I could fly away,

but I already spent my flight fare,

so now I’m blacking out in the white spotlight,

look ma look that’s me right there,

spotted at 4am,

posted up at Times Square,

sipping’ on some pomegranate,

coming up with more rhymes I’m a Rhymeaire,

have to find some way,

to make sense of this mess,

so I write away the entire day,

then sleep off whatever is left,

which in this case,

is just remnants,

of broken dreams and other things,

that we find when we exhale breath,

I inhale,

and smell the stench,

of rotting food,

feces and decaying flesh,

whole outside smell like,

piss poor morals and fermented fish,

New York is old news,

everything’s stale attitude’s the only thing fresh,

this city smells,

like defeat,

if this is the land of prosperity,

why are there so many homeless in the streets?

Lately I'm more tired mentally then usually and it feels like I either can't talk about how I feel with the people I know, or just that it would be an unnecessary burden on them cause they have their own issues. 

I'm 23(F) and still till now, even though I'm trying to focus finally on myself, instead I'm still helping my parents and two siblings. And this help is with things that they are fully capable of doing themselves it's only more comfortable for them when I do it for them. Like for example today my sister was supposed to come back from her weekend work and my parents were the once to suggest to her that they they would drive her back after what they were both drinking. She couldn't use her phone at work and so couldn't find another transport back so I had to go with them, sitting in the car next to my drunk father... Later when it was getting late and I'm getting frustrated because I need to get ready for work tomorrow my father doesn't understand the issue and my mother's only response is that that she also has work and has to get up even earlier then me. But that was not my choice to come to the city but theirs. 

Yesterday aftern cleaning half the house at 2 am I found my father sleeping on the floor after he has fallen because he was drinking earlier, I had to woke him up cause I was worried if he was alright. I barely slept the night because of it. And it the morning my mom was only concerned about the fact that according to her i didn't clean enough and should do more, even though I told her that I was tired because of what happened during the night.
Sometimes it feels like for them I'm everyone but a daughter...

I'm just tired by it all, for so many years taking care of everyone but myself. It all makes me more and more lonely cause I never even had much time to really connect with other people because I had to worry about my family and do what they wanted. I just wish I had someone that would support me with it all, someone that would just spend time with me away from it all, would hug me and make me feel good just for a little.

Just really needed to vent about it all.",lonely,Just lonely and tired...,2022-06-13 06:11:48

I (21 M) currently have a great group of friends but in a week, as school will end, we probably won't ever see each other again.

Each  time a ""school period"" (highschool years for example) ended I  eventually lost contact with everyone I knew there, and ngl that hurts  me.

Now my only friends are people  I didn't know a year ago, and I really want to keep being friend with  some of them as they are really good people. But I sadly have no idea  how to keep a long-distance friendship alive (It is quite unlikely that  we'll be in the same city next year).

Moreover,  there is one girl with whom I absolutely wanna stay friends with, as I  genuinely think she is the best human being I ever met. Problem is that I  don't know how to talk to her about this without being akward (I had  feelings for her 4months ago, she nicely rejected, now there is only  friendship between us).

3188,mooneyes77,1655063108,1,"So I've been through 7 levels of hell but somehow have come out of a very prolonged crisis. I went through it mostly alone so I think unconsciously I used the internet to remain ""connected"" to humans. It has become my default way of functioning though. I wake up and instantly turn on the computer and check FB and a few other sites, mostly from mindless habit. I hardly know anyone on FB in real life, just folks I used to know but I guess it gives me some superficial sense of connection. Now I'm out of crisis, but that habit remains, and with it the isolation/loneliness. I get that it is hard and takes time/effort to make new friends but it's near impossible if I spend most of my time here, staring at a screen. Hence the catch-22. 

Does anyone else relate?

For me I have experienced lots of trauma from people so there is an unconscious drive to avoid them, so this feels safer, but it's not truly satisfying. It's like a false positive. From a loneliness standpoint, at this point, it is almost self fulfilling. I know better than to think a computer could satisfy my human connection needs, but here I am, still. Habits are hard to break. Covid didn't help either.

One solution would be to get rid of my internet. Close one door, and others will open? Honestly I can't imagine that except when I was younger I got a long just fine without it. Even talked on the phone. Do people still do that? One thing. There is a public library only 10 minute walk from my house. I could still get my daily internet ""fix"" but at least I would have to leave the house, and there would be a reasonable time limit.

Even without the social component I used to be so active and productive, which felt more satisfying than sitting in front of a screen 4 plus hours a day. Honestly I haven't even read a book in ages. I used to read a lot. The more I think about it the more it seems like it could be better not having home internet. In the long run I would feel less lonely, and much more mindful.

I've never felt that acceptance and love that comes from being in a family. Everything was heavily conditional. This always made me more needy and affectionate than most people while at the same time being terrified of intimacy. I'm 25 and I've never so much as kissed a girl yet. The few times I have completely opened up to people I felt close with they've decided they don't want to deal with it. I don't blame them and I don't expect them to.

I feel defective and alone in this world. I don't feel understood or accepted. I feel like I'm faking this confident, put-together persona to the friends I currently have and if I start telling people how I truly feel they will drop me like I've been in the past.

I have realized and accepted that no one can love me the way I always wanted because thats not how normal love works. The only place I feel like I can let it all out is posting anonymously on reddit, as depressing as that sounds.

Tigress was the one I talked to the most, I'd say 3 hours on avg, daily. Now we aren't friends anymore, and what caused it was the fact that they made me feel super depressed. Just seeing a joke(which didn't sound like one in any way, was what caused me to take action) from Tigress made me super depressed as it reminded me of some past events that caused me trauma. This happened not once but twice and that was when I knew that I must do something. Only way it works for me -and by that I mean leaving people for good, so that I never ever think about them or have any chance of talking to them ever again - is blocking them and deleting their numbers. I did talk about this with them first and told them that , ""This is goodbye."" Now I've lost 2 friends I made at the start of this month and I feel so sad and lonely-ish.

3204,TalkingAboutMyissues,1655056498,1,"Hi, I'm posting here cause I feel kinda lonely right now and this is practically an essay.

When I was 4 my mum took me for ADHD diagnosis and it took 3 years and i was given a diagnosis of ADHD and torettes but the doctor took I'll and then retired, this was when the scottish NHS primarily used paper files (2012) and they couldn't contact my doctor to get the notes back so they never gave me a formal diagnosis but there was 3 doctors that tested me and all three said I had ADHD and torettes but this 1 doctor was the person with the notes. I'm 17 now and the ADHD is a problem as it's developed as I've aged and with exams and social life it feels horrible, I want to get mediated but it's a 4 year waiting list and a 3 year testing period so I can get a rediagnosis for something I already know I have. To make things worse the doctor told my primary school at the time so I went through primary school with support for ADHD but not in high school.

This leads me to now, due to covid I didn't get final exams last year for my N5 qualification but this year I did get exams for my higher qualification and when we did our first mid term exam my brain couldn't handle it and I basically collapsed mentally.

My exams ended a few weeks ago and I think I managed to do well somehow. 

However I spoke to my mum about wanting to get medication and rediagnosis as I'm struggling but my mum just diminished it saying that ""while my mind does 10 to a dozen it's not like you're struggling in school because your grades are fine and you're a functional member of society and you're not bouncing up and down the class like you did in primary school""

I still want to run about the class but I force myself not to and I do struggle in school but the subjects I do good in are the ones where I'm interested about everything and everyother grade that I need for university but I'm not interested in is just a fail.

However he worst part is socially, I've got a friend group of 13 people and only 1-3 of them are close but I'm starting to lose a grip on my ADHD and they just make things worse right now.

I've tried explaining ADHD and what it's like but they just don't care to listen about any of it.

They make jokes (at my expense) and talk me down about things I can't control (like my struggle to study) but again when I try telling them why its hard they either refuse to listen to why its difficult or they tell me that I'm just refusing their solutions (solutions like ""have you tried just doing the questions from previous years over and over).

They complain about my impulsiveness (both from ADHD and torettes) but if I get annoyed by someone else making random comments (deliberately to antagonise me and they do it all the time as a dig) they call me hypocritical. If I make impulsive decisions they say that I don't think things through and then call me an idiot 

When I struggle with the emotional dysregulation the call me soft or a snowflake or they say that I can make jokes but can't take them I say a single thing and then they make jokes about me for the next hour and I try to laugh it off cause I know they're jokes but when I can't take it anymore they just talk about me.
They then say I can't control my emotions and call me cold-hearted or say I've got a bad temper.

They make fun of my intelligence because I can't do good in classes I don't find interesting but they can do good in everything plus because they can study easily they say stuff like *""yea, you're so intelligent that you got that A for physics didn't you?""* ( I failed physics and math) they say similar things about maths.

There's a lot of other things but I don't want to type them all out.

My friends refuse to let me explain the ADHD but when I mention ADHD is why I do this thing the way I do they just say I'm using it as an excuse and that I just do it all the time but they won't let me tell them how that's the reason and then they say "" I don't care"" or ""Did I ask!"".

That actually happened an hour ago which js why I'm writing this.

My friends listed of some of the things I use ADHD/torettes as an excuse for but I left before they finished listing things cause I couldn't handle it:
 Not doing well in physics/math
 Saying/doing random things (making a weird noise etc.)
 Being okay with a joke 1 minute and then angry the next
 Not being confident/having high self esteem 
 Being anxious/overthinking


Am I overreacting, am I just making excuses and I know no one reading this will have the answer but I just need to vent.
 
I just feel so lonely like no one understands and worse no one even cares enough to attempt to understand, I wish I could talk to other people but I'm at a small school and everyone either thinks I'm weird or don't like me, anyone I could be friends with I am friends with.


What truly hurts about his though is I got really depressed a while ago and tried to fix things and managed to get myself into a routine (it took a month to actually start doing the things I wanted to) and when I had gotten his routine I *ATTEMPTED* to explain everything to my friends but they kept saying things like ""you're really going to do this, there's no point going to bed at 10PM"" or things like ""you're just going to stop having caffeine, you're saying you've got an addiction but by saying that doesn't that mean you're addicted to breathing or you're addicted to going to bed at 10"".   I was having so much caffeine I was shaking and having cold sweats, I'd be drink 3 coffees, 2 monster energy drinks, 2 pepsi's and 8 or more cups of tea.


I just feel so lonely and disliked, I can't get help because even though covid has past the hospitals still won't do anything non-critical so therapy or medication/rediagnosis is out of the question, I don't have any family to talk to and I don't have any friends I can talk to.

Sometimes I just want to curl up and cry myself to death, I can't talk to people cause I get to anxious and over think whatever I say, everyone thinks I'm weird and no one around me will even let me talk to them about my problems.

Thanks for reading this if you got down this far. I don't even know if this makes sense. I've got no clue what to do.

3229,PerformanceScared575,1655041211,1,"A lot of people talk about SAD (seasonal affective disorder) in the colder months. But I experience it in the summer. But I guess its more emotion led as apposed to feeling low because of lack of sunlight, grey skies, shorter days etc. Summer makes me more aware of how alone I am and how few plans I have. 

My social life is my work. All the people I know and chat to are from all the jobs I’ve had. I work in places with big teams and thousands of visitors (hospitality) and what’s mad is that I’m incredibly sociable, people tell me daily that I’m hilarious and fun and cool and stylish and gorgeous… and they all think my life must be full and satisfying… but I’m very open about my loneliness.  But that part seems to fall of deaf ears. 

Heck I didn’t even get any invites to any ironic Platinum Jubilee parties over the bank holiday weekend. I’m not a royalist but I was free like everyone else but had nowhere to go. 

I’ve made plans to volunteer at music festivals this year and I’m actually excited about that :) Ordinarily music festival season pains me because I don’t have people to go with. I can’t rally up anyone I know… it’s like herding cats when I’ve tried. 

While everyone is getting giddy about all the fun in the sun they can now have… it just reminds me of how lonely I am and how single I am. Chronically single. I could do things with friends / people I know but, at 38 years old I’m so bored of that. So I just pull my blinds down and stay inside. 

Last year I was sat in a park with some work friends (they’re wonderful) and just looking around I felt hyper aware of how young everyone was. And there I am schlepping around still, no real progress in my love life. I imagined what I’d rather be doing and that was just being with my person. Not necessarily alone with my person, but having a blended friend group, blended family or something. But I’m sat there in this park full of gen x and gen z, watching them sipping on tinnies (canned beers). I just wanted to cry. So I left and went back to my home and pulled the blinds down.  

I’ve also noticed a pattern that I meet someone around April/May… I get rejected / dumped / ghosted by June and that’s it… that’s me even more devastated as summer rolls in. 

I just just have to sweat it out (literally) and get secretly giddy for colder days where I don’t feel guilty about staying inside, lighting candles, ordering food in and watching tv everyday.  By myself.",lonely,S.A.D in the summer,2022-06-12 23:40:11

3234,TonysTomatoes,1655034994,1,"I often see people online say ""Learn to love yourself before loving others"", it's hard for me to describe why this phrase rubs me the wrong way, perhaps it is because people who say this are unable to recognise that different people have different needs, and different preferences when it comes to what makes them feel happy, what makes them feel a life is worth living, what makes them feel fulfilled.

I know for me, I feel the most happy when I feel wanted by my peers, when I'm valued, and when I'm loved and cherished by those who I hold dear. But unfortunately, I haven't felt that way for years, I don't have any real friends, and on average, I would describe myself as abandoned, unwanted, and despised. I became miserable, bitter, and resentful, and I envy people who are inherently comfortable with themselves, with no need for approval from others. I am jealous of those who have friends they love, who loves them back.

I know I'm a naturally romantic and affectionate person, platonically speaking, I used to buy a lot of gifts for people I used to hold dear, I used to really want to spend time with them, I used to have a lot of affection to give, lot of smile and laughter, and a lot of optimism for people to treat me right. But with betrayal, heartache, and loneliness, I find myself withholding all the love I could give, unwilling to love someone else more than it is necessary.

Recently, I find myself feeling very lonely, I think about all the beautiful lovely strangers I met at work, their smile and kind words, I feel a touch of sadness knowing that I'll never be part of their lives, because I have so much to give, all the love, smile, laugh, hugs I could've gave, I am invisible and empty, why am I even here?

First my car broke down and I ended up needing to get a new one, then I was having to hunt for a new flat and when I did find one, realised I couldn't afford it. Now I'm lodging at a flat just outside London.

I haven't settled over here yet and I feel more and more unhappy the longer this goes on.

I want this move to work out and I want to start a career in my field (not enough work going on back home in that department), but it's been so slow and agonising that it just feels like it's not worth it.

I've also got no friends out here either. I go to the LondonSocialClub meetups every once in a while when I have the time or money, but haven't been going regularly enough to make any friends or anything. I'll just spend my days in my room on my laptop, or else drive out to places like Brighton and take some pictures, but now I'm not even sure about doing that since fuel prices are getting more and more expensive (I've literally paid £1.90 per litre of petrol). Yesterday my dad rang and when I said I drove down to Brighton he asked if I was lonely, and I lied and said no. Truthfully I did feel lonely and being in Brighton would've helped me clear my head, but I didn't want to admit that to him because it's both sad and would only make him worry.

Writing here is a small step that i demanded myself to write to start changing.

Talking about these help me get to the point, without taking the initiative, maintaining relationships is hard, even making new friendships is a distant thought. And there is the problem, I ended in my comfort zone watching Netflix or reading, hoping for a new day to begin for me to change but months passed by and when i looked back, the word ""friends"" turned into empty words. 

Going back, I was always enthusiastic and outgoing, sports, studies, friendships, back then i found almost everything exciting, but maybe the excess of enthusiasm made those experiences short by that time, as nothing lasted more than 2 years. The cheerful me ended more reserved, trying to reign that enthusiasm by limiting the times i leaved my house. Later i don't know but i think i developed a fickle heart, I loathed the mistakes i made that make difficult for me to forget especially when they became jokes between friends, making me cautious in how i interact with people. Then honesty became an issue too where i lost trust in those friends, maybe most of you experienced when those friends hid things from you like when they go out or the obvious lies they tell you in the face just to avoid making the environment uncomfortable :(example, I tried to call you to invite you but you didn't answer) things like that). It became harder from that moment to make new friends, especially when you try hard by starting conversations and not receiving the expected results.

I don't know what changed but this mentality of cautiousness and trust issues even affected my professional life. I stopped studying, dropping out of the university and now unemployed, without friends to talk or someone to lean on. I tried to accept this loneliness but i just can't keep going. I am reaching a breaking point, especially every familiar birthdays where your family ask you what are you doing with your life and i don't know what to answer, i really hate to lie and it became harder to avoid those embarrassing questions.

The reason for the title is that i love dreaming, love the new ideas but when those dreams crashed down i got scared of continuing dreaming. I am currently 22, i made this post in HOPING to get some answers, in better words, get some help. What can i do with my life?, i don't like psychiatrics.

3252,ozweego25,1655025788,1,"Last year I found out my gf cheated on me and shortly after I was the reason all my friends left me. My dad was trying to come back into my life, I crashed my car, and I was going through loneliness being bedridden in my house for a month and a half after getting ACL surgery. Instead of being a normal human and balancing these emotions I took my anger out on them over a gift they had bought me for my birthday by saying shitty things about it and saying I didn’t like it. It’s one of the biggest regrets of my life because they didn’t deserve that and I really loved the gift. I can’t even put into words how important they were and how much they meant to me, but I guess they don’t see it that way. 
I always see them still hanging out and having a great time on social media and find myself looking back at old videos and pictures of us just messing around and having the time of our lives. Two of them still talk to me but it feels like it’s out of pity sometimes and that they just see me to smoke weed. I feel like I have to force us to meet up or it doesn’t happen, but I’m grateful they’re still around at least.

It’s about to be the one year mark of it all and I’m about to spend my birthday alone for the first time in forever it feels like. I think I’m at the lowest point of my life for real this time. I somehow always manage to ruin my best friendships and hate myself for it. I have bad social anxiety and suck at making new friends and often don’t like looking for new ones either. I know I have to be open to making new friends or finding a new hobby and all that, but I really don’t know what to do. I wish I could just redo my life from the start.

3254,Kindly_End_5871,1655023581,1,"Oh, what is so precious to us more than human connection? That feeling of someone sharing this special experience with you. That is indeed something to be cherished. But are we all so fortunate to experience something so important? Something way more than a need, it is a fundamental part of our human nature. We desperately try to cling on, we try to be seen and heard and validated every moment of our lives. But what if there is no one to see, hear, or feel what you are feeling? What if you are all alone? No, that would be a nightmare too few people would accept living in. After all, what is the point of life if your existence isn't even acknowledged? But the bitter pill to swallow is loneliness, the fact that we are not accepted for whatever reason, experiencing life unnoticed by the rest, only living for ourselves, never ceasing to be a source of misery to one's self. But of course, as time goes by, the hole within your heart starts growing larger, you can't keep hiding from it forever. You can try and temporarily fix it with all kinds of things, but the truth is once the hole is opened, there is nothing you can do to fix it. The only medication you need is to find a human connection. So you become a desperate man, searching for something that will make you whole again. And what is that thing specifically? That is another imperfect human being just like you, who you can share your life with. By sharing each other you merge into one entity, which is the most beautiful intimacy of all. The reason that got you to seek loneliness is the rejection of your true self by others. So you change to fit in a new narrative, to fit in with the same people who left you in the dirt before. But it doesn't matter, to you, all that matters is getting rid of the unbearable pain you were feeling before. Oh, all the things that loneliness makes us do, we try so desperately to get noticed by others, for our power, our intellect, our flawless talents, yet no one shows up to the party. If only you could, I only there was a way. But no, that is too good to be true, you are not accepted for reasons outside of your control, therefore it is fate that you will be this way until you die. The terrible blow to your fragile ego is when you learn that you are not desired, accepted, loved, or praised by others. Oh what a grave mistake my life must have been, for I am a failure in all regards if my existence doesn't mean a thing to other people living beside me. If I can't bring any value, joy, and happiness, then what good am I for? Nothing! I am but a lonely and empty shell of a human being. A soul who has been destroyed from the inside and who can no longer bear the pain that reality has given. My desires were unfulfilled, my dreams crumbled to pieces, and my future was reduced to ashes. There is nothing left for me to do, I will wander this earth lost and hopeless for eternity. The only thing that awaits is the inevitable demise of my constructed self.",lonely,Shared loneliness,2022-06-12 18:46:21

I've tried a few different areas of meeting someone online, I've always thought about the idea of meeting someone with similar issues to me so therefore everything feels understood already and they know the struggles and growing together would be amazing to do with someone you love and just taking life at our own pace but even the women I have spoken to with similar issues aren't at all interest in me once they find out my current situation and that I have no job, no stability, living at home with parents still etc and I'm having such difficulty dealing with rejection it makes me feel really worthless that all my flaws, inexperience and ongoing issues are such red flags to people and destroys the little confidence I have and chances of meeting someone.

I am the problem that's the thing everyone of my classmates talks to him but i don't.

i don't know what to do anymore, i don't know what to feel, i want to love her but she loves another of my classmates i never talk to her so it's very difficult that she comes and talk to me (that's what i want). 

The only time that we talk she seemd interested on talking i sad that we could talk more another day, we never talked, and i feel like she dosn't care about me because if someone is interested on you or if you say to someone hey lets talk this tuesday if you don't go talk with them that day they will come to talk to you but the girl did it once and i had to throw up so we didn't talk.

A little bit of context: 

Recently I have been reflecting on my past friends and conversations when I came upon a common theme. The theme is that I usually like to reach out to others in order to be social. However, in the conversation I guess the best way to describe it is that I am either a chain or a leech. I tend to either feed off of others happiness and cause them to feel worse so I feel better or I tend to drag them down. 

My question about this I guess is that should I stop being selfish and reaching out to others?

My niece and nephew and my little cousins love me. I'm a decent home cook and don't mind cooking. I don't mind getting my hands dirty and working hard. I've worked labor jobs since I was 22. I'm 31 now. So I've picked up DIY skills over the years and can take care of most maintenence issues around the house. I'm also pretty tech savvy and good with computers and technology in general. I'm a clean person. I clean my place and car once a week. I recently left my job to be home more for my elderly grandpa as he gets older he needs more and more of my attention and help with things. I live on his property in his guest house so I'm close by when he needs me. My little house isn't anything special, but it's clean and comfortable. I have a back patio that overlooks the river. Over the past couple of years I've slowly began to modernize it with new stuff. I'm pretty fortunate to be able to live here. It's beautiful water front property. I have a river in my backyard. I do everything around the house. All the yard work. I do most of the cleaning for my grandpa. I do his laundry. I cook him dinner every night. I run all his errands and take him to his doctor's appointments since he can't drive anymore. Honestly taking care of him is a lot of work and can be pretty stressful. He is in better shape than most 88 yr olds, but still, I have to help or do virtually everything for him.

3295,-Awesomesauce-15101,1655002710,1,"So I wrote a poem expressing my loneliness. Cause I know someone needs to hear this.

Just A Feeling

I am in a house full of people 

But yet I still feel lonely 

Does anyone notice you 

See I scream and scream 

Oh you didn't see 

Well if you would have noticed me maybe you could have known 

If you look into my eyes 

Do you see life inside 

Cause I don't 

Still feel like I am only moving to survive 

Like living paycheck to paycheck

Just trying to survive 

Not like someone going to rescue me 

How are you mentioning Jesus dying right now 

What will that do 

I still feel pain inside 

I still feel numb inside 

Oh that was God showing his love 

But will that do if I still feel lonely 

Doesn't your Hod says he won't abandon you 

Does he still talk to you

Well yes but 

Do you still feel lonely 

Yeah I still do 

I feel like breaking someone's neck 

I feel like punching someone in the face 

Don't you have friends 

Well yeah 

Do they check on you 

Only when I see them in person 

Well they can't read your mind 

Yes that is true

But they would know I am lonely 

How will they know 

Do you think people can read your thoughts 

And your soul cause if so we all be in jail right now 

But I still feel lonely 

Just a feeling I get 

It will go away 

But I am lying to myself 

Who can you call then 

Who can you text then 

I got no one

No one of my family members causes they died 

Sorry you can talk to us 

You have a community 

Yeah but it's not the same 

I can't hug them 

I can't cry on their shoulder 

I get it, man 

Though I have people 

I am surrounded by people who don't care 

There are just not enough caring people

If I was a penguin feeling cold 

I would have a community to warm me up 

Always sticking together 

Yeah but still feel lonely 

Don't you get it 

That is just a feeling 

Isn't that rude to say 

No cause 

Though feeling lonely weighs you down 

Feeling lonely shows you something 

You see there is still someone there 

Someone to  cheer you up 

If no in-person you got God to talk to 

He understands how you feel 

Don't  you see 

I write what I feel 

God in spirit the holy spirit guide me 

Lonely is what he gave me 

He allowed this feeling to happen 

Cause he had you in mind 

Why would a loving God allow this 

Don't you see he is calling you

Someone to  cheer you up 

If no in-person you got God to talk to 

He understands how you feel 

Don't  you see 

I write what I feel 

God in spirit the holy spirit guide me 

Lonely is what he gave me 

He allowed this feeling to happen 

Cause he had you in mind 

Why would a loving God allow this 

Don't you see he is calling you

He is helping you see 

Jesus is the loneliest person in the world 

But that feeling didn't control 

The father guided him through that loneliness 

Even on the day when he could have run away 

But Jesus run past that loneliness 

He conquers that feeling 

Still feel lonely 

I know but you have to see the truth 

Till you do I am just a chat away



Hope you like it you are not alone. Being lonely is the immense pain of feeling abandoned. Even if you have people around. But if you can talk to someone like a friend please do. If not dm me I am just a chat away.",lonely,We All Feel Lonely,2022-06-12 12:58:30

Its not true but  females have way more chance getting a boy than a boy getting a girl. As a boy I like any good looking girl or any girl that even talk to m a little bit. My loneliness created something so bad. I just dont understand how a boy is supposed to get a girlfriend with nowadays standards. Girls always wants something of a guy and its either Money, Nice inside or Nice outside. Even if I work on any of these things are my chance getting higher even? If I ask 100 girls if they want a relationship without knowing them I probably wont. If I get my hair done, get some muscles, care about my appearence, I probably still wont have chance because I have to know them. With the inside you can't really change much but with social anxiety its just so hard talking to a girl and how are you even supposed to know her better. Its like any girl just ghosts you if you dont get her intrest because she is not gonna get any intrest for you out of nowhere. Its actually even so hard to add a girl on some platform. How long do you even have to know a girl to ask her out and not possibly ruining your friendship with her because you had a crush on her. A girlfriend doesnt fall out the sky unless she randomly gets a crush at school but that wont ever happen. Even trying dating apps and daily adding people wont do much I think, maybe if ur lucky.

now every june i feel sad seeing younger people graduate and see how happy they are because it just reminds me of that miserable day i went through. i feel jealous wish i could just go back in time and change things.",lonely,i hate graduation time,2022-06-12 11:23:52

This situation is rather complicated but I’m going to try to keep as simple as a I can. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. 

So, a few months ago, I met this guy online. We immediately had chemistry. And I fell for him. Quickly, and super hard. (I’m a very lonely person, so whoever gives me even the smallest amount of attention, I get feelings for) 

It was basically everything that I had ever asked for in a partner. (Supportive, happy environment, etc) Let’s just say that he was really good for me. He made me happy and I felt really nice when talking to him. 

But suddenly, about a month ago, I had to end things. I had found out he was lying to me about his age and I ended things right then and there. He claimed that he was 18 and I found out that he was barley 16. 

Before you ask, yes, I had gotten pictures of from him and he looked like the age he claimed. So I was completely fooled. 

There had already been a few sexual exchanges, and when I found out he wasn’t the age I thought he was, I ended things. 

It was the first time I was ever in a romantic situation, so I’m having a hard time moving on. And it makes me feel so disgusting that I could still have feelings for someone who wasn’t the age I thought he was. 

I know I cannot go back to chatting with him, due to the age gap. (And the law obvi) It is also clear that he has already moved on. 

I know it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t know his real age throughout the whole relationship. If I knew his real age, I would’ve NEVER even started talking to him in the first place. But there’s a part of me that just can’t let go. 

Any tips on moving on and letting go? And how to feel less guilty about the whole thing?

Thank you for taking time to read this ig. Even the smallest bit of feedback would mean the world to me. I cant talk about this with anyone I know. 

Thanks again.",lonely,How Do I Move On From This? (18F),2022-06-12 11:23:49

3348,-Nubivagant-,1654986868,1,"So little backstory first. I was school bullied for 12 years. It started in first grade and ended when I graduated from high school. I never had many friend and the few I had, broke the friendship off because of the bullying. Only one friend stayed. The bullying experience left me traumatized, really insecure and for years I struggled with social anxiety.

Last year I got accepted into university and had to move to different city, leaving my only friend behind. At first I was exited because I had the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. And at the beginning it was great. I met new people and I was hanging out with them. I was so certain that I had made friends.

But as time went on I started to question if I really had any friends at all. I would see their posts on social media where they had amazing time together and I hadn't been invited. When I went to the uni parties I was sometimes left outside of their circles. They had their inside jokes and funny memories together that I wasn't part of. No one never texts me but i'm sure they all are texting each other daily.

But it hasn't been like that every single time I've hanged out with these people. Sometimes I feel like I'm part of the group and that they really do see me as a friend. We talk and laugh and have fun time together. So I feel guilty and ashamed for feeling lonely and for thinking that they don't see me as a friend.

I also have a boyfriend who I met in uni and sometimes he is the only person I see in weeks. He is the only one that invites me to hang out. He is the sweetest guy and I love him a lot. He probably thinks that I have friends and that I'm close to them when the reality is really the opposite.  I feel ashamed about not having friends and that I never hang out with anyone so I try to hide it from him with excuses like ""they are out of town"" or ""they are busy with school"". Same thing with my family. I just lie to them and say that I got so many new friends and everything is going great. And I just can't tell them the truth because they so badly wanted me to make friends in uni and I just can't let them down.

And I let myself down too because the only thing I really wanted when I started uni was to make friends and to really have those close friendships with people and it just didn't happen. I feel awful about it. I failed the one thing I wanted. And I feel like I tried so hard and still failed.

And the worst part is that I don't know if it is even real. What if all these people actually view me as a friend and everything is good between us. That I am just making everything up in my traumatized brain. Because like I said earlier sometimes when I hang out with these people I feel like that truly are my friends. What if I'm just imagining all the bad stuff. So I really shouldn't feel lonely  and I still do feel lonely and then I feel ashamed that I do.

But yeah I just wanted to vent I guess. I've been feeling kinda down lately and just wanted to let everything out. I also want to note that English is not my first language so I apologize for all mistakes.",lonely,I feel ashamed to feel lonely,2022-06-12 08:34:28

Moved for husbands military service and I’ve never been so painfully lonely in my life.

My job has me working in a very sociable environment, where I interact with hundreds in the local business community weekly (which has historically been one of my favorite things, I love connecting with people), but I’m noticing I’m being cast out from the people here. 

Everybody knows everybody in this town, so they point out that I’m an outsider right away. I’ve been told to my face by several people that I see regularly that they don’t like me, that I don’t fit in, and that if I “keep up what I’m doing I’m never going to fit in”. I’m harassed about the way I dress because I’m in my somewhat western inspired clothes and not my geriatric beach goer get up. I feel just terribly lonely. The general population is at LEAST 20-30 years older than me on average and I’m having a horrible time connecting with anyone here. I feel so out of place and I miss the culture of Las Vegas. The ‘holier than thou’ atmosphere is heavy here, and it’s tough to survive interacting with people on a daily basis that will make fun of you and judge you right to your face. 

It’s put me in a position where I just don’t want to show up to my job anymore, it tears my self-esteem down and makes me feel like a complete outcast. I’ve tried to find classes or some kind of community activities to try and find a group that similar to me, but other than going to the beach there’s not much else going on here. I am a very fair skinned redhead, so beach going isn’t something I can do all the time unless I want to turn into a lobster.

Whenever i get close to someone as a friend they end up just dissappearing. My school friends all began losing touch after i told them about my first child (i was 18 when i was expecting) my uni friends just all went seperate ways after uni and shortly after i made the best group of friends ever and i honestly would have done anything for them. Over the years they have all ended up falling out with one another and going seperate ways but i always tried to keep in touch as best i could without picking sides. 

All this seemed okay because i always had T.J (my best friend) he was my best man and we always joked how we would live next door to each other and our kids would get married one day. He never had much luck with the ladies (very insecure) one day i met a girl on a game and she was cool and i told him to just talk to her and they hit it off and i was over the moon for him and then he just started talking to me less and less we was best friends for like 7 years and now weve spoke twice in the last 12 months.

I feel so alone because i just want a friend someone to game and talk anime with and hes gone. 

I feel guilty for wanting a friend when i already have the perfect wife who is obvs my best friend but we have different hobbies she watches some abime and plays games occassionally but i like the fact we have our own hobbies

For context, my sister [30] has had depression, severe ocd and eating disorders since she was 13 and I was 7. 

My life has revolved around hers. I became an underweight 7 year old to overweight within a year because my sister wanted me to be fat. She would scream because I was a slow eater at dinner and wouldn’t finish my meal, so my mom stands with a cane next to me to force me to finish it. I remember crying sometimes and feeling the pain in my throat and tummy as I slept at night. She stopped me from exercising too. I haven’t dared to do it for a long time.

My mom never took me to the doctor after I was 8 to 18 except maybe twice, all the while funding my sister’s expensive therapy and endless hospital stays. She asked me to eat over the counter medicine from the pharmacy, but she only remembers to buy it half the time. I remember once she forgot to get it but came home with five broccolis for my sister lol.

I remember my mom telling me the whole world hates me since I was 7, and that my sister wrote in her diary I was the cause of her depression because my father bought toys for me and smiles at me (a 9 year old) and my sister wanted me to die. I felt like my mom wanted me to feel guilt.

I remember my mom not wanting me to go to university to save money but funding my sis expensive private O levels that costs way more. 

I remember my mom purposefully denying me of certain wants or needs at the store in front of my sis to compensate for my sis feeling my dad gives me more.

I remember that when my sister threw our cat out while I was at school, my mom vehemently prevented me from finding and bringing him home and lied to me about it. I didn’t want to talk to my sister after that, but my mom texted me on the same day to ask how long I was gonna stop talking to her bc it would hurt her feelings. 

When I told my mom I was recently suspected to have depression and anxiety and want to move out to be by myself, my mother asked then how was I going to give her money. My father asked what if that made my sister feel guilty.

I remember whenever my mother got frustrated at my sister’s antics, she would beat my brother and me. She has used poles, fists, belts, umbrellas, hangers etc. chased us with hockeysticks and a chopper. We are just punching bags.

I remember my mom berating me about wanting to buy a mac laptop with my OWN money, but my dad saw I wanted it and got it for me. Later I realised they got my sister an imac and DSLR. One/two years later my mom broke my laptop screen. I don’t know if she did it on purpose.

Every day, I obey my sister’s insane ocd rules. No taking water, cooking and stepping into the living room from 9am to 4pm. If i wanted to ever leave and enter my house, inform her first. 

I feel so lonely, I feel like I don’t have family who thinks of me as a person with needs. I feel this crushing sense of despair and I just want to not feel this alone. I’m finally moving out soon having landed my first job. I’m looking for a place now finally.

I'm .

I'd like to think that I'm pretty attractive and interesting person. I have been receiving some compliments about my look for the last several years. When I asked today my friend to rate my appearance from 0 to 10, she gave me 10/10. I specifically asked her to answer honestly and promised that I would not be offended by her if her answer was low. We've also known each other for a long time, and she knows that I prefer bitter truth instead of sweet lies. What's more, I suprisingly knew in middle school that in primary one pretty much half of girls in the class were into me. In the middle school one girl was crushed in me so much that she stalked my socials for two years and once donated a pretty big sum of money on one of my very unregular streams.

People around me have always considered me clever. I have some amazing friends, and it's really interesting to talk with them. They like to spend time with me as well. In addition, I have a small blog where I post my thoughts on different topics, and my subscribers are also fine with that I write. Of course I'm not the smartest person on the planet, but it seems like not stupid either.

I have never had any problems with making friends. I have a few, as I said earlier, they are wonderful people, and I could have more if I wanted to, but I'm fine with my current social circle.

I definitely have some social skills. I feel pretty comfortable in most companies, confident when I talk to people, and I even don't have problems with public speeches, debates, jokes or other forms of social interaction that involve drawing people's attention to myself.

The problem, though, is that I fail absolutely miserably when it comes to romantic relationships. I had one two years ago online, they lasted for half a year, she was a magnificent lady, they were spectacular relationships, but unfortunately we couldn't even meet IRL because of covid. We parted later, because it turned out we were too different. Since then I haven't had any relationships for 2 years.

Recently I have seen some of my previous classmates got relationships. When I was at school, they were widely considered to be less ""shining"" people than I was.

He refused to compromise any or see how he was doing things was hurtful to me, especially considering I had talked extensively about my abandonment issues, physical disability, bad family life, severe depression, etc. It didn’t seem like anything was considered at all.

Unfortunately, he was my main social support. It has hurt a lot. I don’t see how someone can be around so long and then suddenly not care. I mean, it was long distance, but we were still very close and did trips over the years to see each other (mostly at my expense).

3419,HattySan,1654958181,1,"Hi everyone, I'm a 22M. Firstly, sorry for my bad English. Since I was a child, I have serious relationship problems. I usually spend my life alone, just have couple of friends for talk and go out sometimes. I also had a toxic relationship for couple of months with a classmate during high school that sharpen my problems. 

In December I joined, totally randomly, a Discord chat and met a 23M. Immediately, he started to chat with me, hours and hours per day. I was so confused and a bit scared because in my life I've never had such experiences; a person who wants to talk with me. After two weeks of continuing chatting, I started to know him better and he has revealed a person with tons of interest and life experiences in common with me. We were spending 4-5 hours per day to chat, It was like knowing your twins and I was really happy. At that time, he was the only person who said to me good words, who makes me feel important for someone. I started to feel for the first time in my life what is meaning being cared by another people. 

But suddenly, everything starts to change. 

He started to being worried about me having a gay crush on him, and slowly stops being so active with me like first months. We were continuing to chat couple of hours per day but I was feeling the change. I realized that I really fall in love with his soul... I've never had sexual fantasies with him, I just wanna have him next to me. He became the most important part of my life, I tried to saying this at him but in his answer I'm feeling like I'm just someone to spend some free time with, nothing more.

I hate this situation, I don't want lose him. I'm not ready... just thinking about this possibility makes me cry. But now my days and my happiness depends on him. When he'a searching me, when he wants to chat with me I'm feeling good. When this doesn't occurs, I started to feel useless again. 

All this situation is because I'm so egocentric and I cannot have an healthy relationship with someone. When someone shows me a bit of love... I always become so oppressive. I really hate myself. I just want to read again those kind and beautiful words...

You know like-- they see you in a crowded hallway and they reach for you kind of thing? Yeah I wish I had that sort of thing. 

Someone who goes to you first when they've got something to share, be it a stupid little thing they just did or something funny they saw at some point in their day.

Like 'oh that's so fucking funny i HAVE to tell azura about this.' 

kind of thing.

You know what I mean?

I just want to mean something to someone.

I want someone to think of me when they see something ever so meaningless, yet because it reminds them of me, it has the slightest bit of significance.

I'm always the one who does all of this and it's always such a bummer when i'm met with a lack of response or just pure disregard.

I mean yeah, telling you about how much I love stationary shops for some inexplicable odd reason may seem pointless and boring but humour me a little, won't you? I love hearing stuff like this you know? Someone going on and on about something they love over and over again, showing very clearly how deep their love for it is.

It's always a one-sided thing for me and it's just so--lonely.

Like hey, you, why do you care more about when i'm going to be comfortable enough to engage in suggestive texting with you than shit that's actually enjoyable?

Hell it took me a good amount of time to realise that i'm just on the asexual spectrum and people who just want my fucking body after i've given them my unconditional support and love are FUCKING ANNOYING.

It's not like I spite people who have sexual desires, like yeah, good for you, I really don't care and it's your life but lord-- some people make it out to be like sexual intercourse is the only thing that matters in the end and I hate it. Like--no-- i'm still 3 years away from reaching 20 and that goes against my religion, yes i'm waiting for marriage, we've been over this, what's the deal? Can't accept that? Why the fuck did you ask me to be with you then? Lord have mercy. 

Do you feel my exhaustion here? 

All I want is something meaningful, to BE meaningful to someone. 

I don't want to be told that i'm cute or pretty or whatever the fuck kind of shit that I wouldn't even believe nor care about, I want someone to acknowledge my passion for writing, my love for reading shit that's depressing as hell because I love how much angst hurts my heart, for stupid little stationary stores because I have an odd obsession with buying notebooks that are pretty and more. 

I want someone to read my writings and tell me i've got one hell of a funky mind because wow!!!!!!+*! £?*? '?!' 

I just want someone to CARE about who I am. 

To care about me.

Every time people describe me, it's always 'the quiet one' 'the one who likes food' 'cute' 'yadayayayayay'

And if you're going to tell me it's my fault, fuck off! 

I put my heart into talking and some people don't even bother to listen and continue to label me as some quiet person once I stop bothering. 

I gave you a chance to listen, literally to just listen, and you fucked that up. 

I'm not asking for a luxury life with a rich guy who gifts me expensive shit and says a ton of romantic s e x y words (which, by the way, disgusts me a little) 

Hell we could go to places like mcdonalds at three in the morning for the idiotic sake of it and talk all night about random shit and i'd be happy. (even mcdonalds is pretty pricy but hey even a nice stall by the street that sells some hella banger burgers would be nice too!) 

Meaningful, you know? 

It doesn't have to be grand or anything, I just want it to mean something. 

Seriously, what's the use of saying I love you to someone if you don't mean it, or if it doesn't mean anything to you? 

Its because of shit like this that made me feel lonely in my past relationships.

The way someone just wanted me because they thought I was cute and liked me when I was wholesome and all that, but when I got into things I liked and how I felt, that shit was completely disregarded. Before dating, they'd show interest and be all supportive but once they get you? Zero fucks about what you're saying. 

I don't mind someone lowering their guard and being a lot more laid back after dating me bc they're comfortable and don't need to go overboard but,, what i'm upset about is when they just stop showing interest in you as a whole. 

Then next thing you know, they're asking about the suggestive stuff and your feelings are long gone. 

You don't have to show me much, but gods, if you completely disregard everything I say when i'm expected to show you nothing but support in return, what's the use of it all?

I don't want shit like sex, hell, it's the most pointless thing to me and I could genuinely live an entire life without ever experiencing it.

I just want someone that cares.

I just want to mean something to someone, to be the one they go to for random things, to be the one they call out of the blue just to ask how i'm doing or what coloured shirt they should pick or while they're cooking and bragging about how great of a cook they are before doing something idiotic. 

I want the lovely little moments that mean so very much.

I don't want to be told 'I love you' a thousand times.

I want a thousand little moments that show what love is. 

Maybe i'm expecting too much from real life, maybe i'm just spouting at this point.

Before this comes off as narcissism, please let me explain.

In my social sphere, I am usually the link between new and current friends. When I meet a new friend, I invite them to hang out with my usual friend group. This friendship often flourishes between the people I introduce to each other (sometimes romantically) and it becomes a really great thing, better then what I have with them. There grows a bond between them that I simply cannot achieve. This is partial jealousy but i can’t help but feel it being fucking cruel to see people flourish and for me to sit back and realise the same is never going to happen to me. Don’t get me wrong, I am happy for these people and consider them my friends still, but to say that this hasn’t been bugging me for a long time is an understatement. When I see these connections as a result of what I did I feel frustrated that the same won’t ever happen to me (I guess it’s just unrealistic expectations). It makes me feel so alone seeing the happiness I am responsible for and not being able to feel the same.",lonely,I’m responsible for good things happening in other peoples lives but it’s not the same for me.,2022-06-11 23:01:16

3444,olbliaypple,1654946069,1,"Trigger Warning: Mentions of suicide, some sexual assault, depression, some vulgar language not a lot tho

Sorry if theres some typos, its a lot of stuff

I (), have lost pretty much everyone ive talked to in the last 2-3 years. See, those 2-3 years are very important to me, that was my peak happiness so far. During covid and all, especially 2020, I was living it up. Those may have been the worst years for a lot of people but those were the best for me. I made new friends and fell in love for the first time. I came into high school and by the end of the year, all of that was gone. I no longer talk to my first love (3 years). Now, my best friend of 3 years just cut me off this Tuesday. Maybe it's just my karma for having such a good year when I shouldn't have? 

Now i can say that it sure as hell hurt like a bitch to lose my first love but when i lost my best friend, it hurt worse. And what pisses me off the most is how she did it.

Ive always had some mental health issues that couldnt really be seen to the public eye in the beginning. I go to school, put on a smile, drink some caffeine to seem lively, but i get home and am a completely different person. Ive also always had the thought of suicide in the back of my head but it never really came to thought that often. Nothing was ever too severe to think something was wrong with me so ive always brushed it off as i was just tired. Recently,  that changed. About at the middle to end of last year i started not having motivation anymore. Which could be a normal thing but it has persisted every. single. day. The thought of suicide came up more often. I struggled with things like keeping up with school, stress of an athlete, feeling included with friends, and relationship stuff. That might sound like normal struggles but everyday is just a new problem and i cant take it anymore. The sport i play, im supposed to love, but cant. The school work is supposed to stress me, but not like this. My friends are supposed to not make me feel this way. You get what im saying?

Everything fell apart this March. I had already become comfortable with the suicidal thoughts and knew they would linger. I never told anyone about them because my parents arent big on mental health, wouldnt tell my teachers because theyd tell my parents, didnt tell my friends because i felt like they didnt care.

I would sometimes talk to my ""best friend"" about my struggles (not the suicide thing) because you know, ""you can talk to me whenever you need"" lmfao. But after a while she just started to ignore me. I did notice this. When I lost my first love, even though my best friend had been ignoring me, she was the only person i had to go to. I talked with her and she let me know that everything was going to be okay.

At this point, i became really sensitive to losing other people so i tried super hard to keep my friends close. I soon learned that everyone was going to move away by graduation. Im not mad at them, its not their choice to move. But i did express my sensitivity to them moving. I guess they just thought i was mad at them or something because after that, everyone started ignoring me in a more obvious way. This threw me into even more of a bad spot and i had decided i was done and it was time for me to go. Look, i wanted help. I made it obvious, i didnt talk some days, stopped showing up to school some weeks, didnt put effort into what i wore, crying when i just couldn't hold it in, posted a shit ton about how mental health is important and to look out for your strong friends because one day one of them might just kill themselves. I never wanted to make the first move and still dont because i dont want to have to ask. Someone like my closest friend should care to ask me if im alright. Not even my parents cared enough, all they did was get mad at me for being ""tired"" all the time.

I ended up writing ""the note"" and wedging a belt in the top of the door way. I stood on my chair and put my head through the loop. When i rolled my chair away, i fell instantly to the ground because the door isnt strong enough to hold the weight of a human. I cried and moved on. The next few days i didnt talk. At some point my teacher talked to us about his depression and a cried. I felt i couldnt tell my friends not even my best friend about what had just happened to me because it was like they didnt care, ignored my words. I thought about OD on pills but i didnt want to go through liver failure from acetaminophen.

When i was ready, i spoke again and picked up my own pieces. I told myself that if no one is going to help me, i will. I told myself that even though i cant find the will to do anything, im going to do it and im going to win. It took so much time and so much effort but it was worth it. I cleaned my room and my bathroom. I went back to playing basketball. I caught up with my school work and pulled my grades up. And just at the beginning of this week on Sunday, i found my passion for soccer again. Monday went by but when it came to Tuesday all my progress disappeared. I just can never win can i? Just as i got back up something has to knock me down again right? Just as i thought id never look back.

My 2 closest friends left the group chat without context.  When i asked what was wrong they both said they just wanted space. My best friend said she would tell me later and to ""not let it ruin my day."" It sure as hell ruined my day. In third period (band) i couldnt hold it in anymore and ended up crying in the guitar closet for the whole period. I couldnt go to lunch like that so i just stayed with my teacher and talked to him till the end. When school ended, my best friend messaged me and i obviously was pissed. She knows im sensitive but still went off to pull a stunt like that. I asked her why the fuck she put me in that position. Not knowing why they had left, worrying about if theyre alright, and leaving me to think about it for 7 hours, the least she could have done was talk to me about this in person. At that point i decided to tell her about the suicide thing when she told me about her thing. I told her ""i have something to say too"" and told her that i would tell her on call. But she didnt want to call because she didnt want her mom to hear what she was gonna say?! So then i just sent it after she asked.  I added my trigger warning then said ""I tried to kill myself."" i told her i was sorry for not telling her but i really never felt like i could. I told her the story and why im so sensitive now about losing people especially after i tried to unalive. I told her why i didnt tell her and she kinda just dismissed it. Then she questioned more on why i hadnt told her about this then she cut me off. She told my that there was a ""turning point"" where i just annoyed her. She said she felt like she couldnt really ""empatize"" with me anymore or even talk to me at this point. Which is funny because i just watched her empatize with a guy who SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SOMEONE????

The next day i asked my other friend if she felt the same way like if she was cutting me off. She said yes and it took like 2 hours to get her reasoning out of her. When her reasoning came by, one of them specifically was how i ignored everyone after the ""moving away"" shpeel happened. At this point i just fucking give up. I didnt care to even tell her the real reason why i ignored everyone.

Im so tired. I can never fucking win. Just as i found happiness it was wrecked. Im so fucking done. Ive lost everyone. I dont feel safe at school, at home, no where. Here i am again, wanting to kill myself. Ive thought of ways to do it but im trying not to go through. Everything is so fucking empty. I know i need to get myself checked out but cant because itd have to go through my parents. After all this i just need a hug.

3449,LosingMeMindHelp,1654942090,1,"Feeling a combination of hurt and confused.

I befriend this coworker for about a month. I think it started because I was new and we were the only ones there under 40. The other people are nice, but she was cool, funny and would come to me to talk about anything: her day, similar interests, etc.

I've always been pessimistic; lacking in confidence. I would confide in friends and usually things went better than expected: I got her a leaving gift and I thought she would hate it, but she loved it so much that I got invited to her leaving party on the spot and she bought me a snack for lunch.

On her last day, I asked if we could stay in touch. She suggested Facebook but didn't elaborate further. It was a little eyebrow raising, but I chalked it up to her having other things on the mind. Found her account, sent her a request and...nothing.

Now, there's a million reasons and I of course focus on the worst one. She has a lot on her mind and admitted to not being very active on it. Maybe there's still hope? But as every day and every hour ticks by, it feels less and less likely.

Just don't understand: I can only ever recall enjoying each other's company...What reason does she have to not like me? Did she just pretend to like me?

3456,Dudeneedshelp2,1654937233,1,"After an awful week I woke up this morning and decided to write down a summary of where I am now in life with the hopes that in the future I’ll look back on this and laugh. I thought I may as well post it on Reddit anonymously to see what advice people have for me to help me move forward.

I’ve just turned 32 years old, still live at home with my parents and have only just found a permanent job after spending my entire adult life doing temp work. I only have 2 real friends and probably should admit that I rely heavily on my colleagues for human interaction, which isn’t easy because we now work mostly from home.

Here’s the bit that’s really messed me up…

Speaking of colleagues, the love of my life is a colleague in a previous team within my company, but she is married to someone else and is now pregnant. There is no doubt she loves me and there once was a chance that we would end up together. She never wanted kids (even now she doesn’t know what to think of it, I don’t believe they planned it/i don’t want to know!) And she also previously confessed that she stumbled into her marriage and just went along with it. Ultimately she wanted to leave him for me but never could get the strength to follow through with it. We had been like that for 5 years when the pandemic hit, and halfway through lockdown it all just fizzled out as we never saw each other. 

To be honest, as I’ve said, I live at home, I wasn’t offering much on my end apart from unconditional love, but that obviously wasn’t enough for her to take the gamble - she would always say her money was in her half of the house, she had to get it before she could leave. She had a lot to lose, I guess.

Unfortunately all this has heartbreak has amounted to 7 years of my life and on my end at least, is still ongoing, I know it’s pathetic.

I heard about the pregnancy this week and even though during lockdown it was pretty much clear that things would never happen between us, this news has obviously upset me. There is a finality to all this now, I have to step away for good.

I am not stupid enough to think there is a chance still and neither is she, she will have the baby and try and be happy. There is no future in us and I accept that, but now with no hope for that relationship I have lost hope in other aspects of life and need to somehow pick myself up and start again.

I am not confident in going out and looking for another girl, in my life so far I have just accepted I would be alone and if a girl came to me I took a chance on them because I thought it would be one of few chances for me - see above, it clearly wasn’t a good idea and I will never do it again, but that shows you how desperate I was, she had to convince me how much she was falling In love with me for me to even consider it.

To be honest, this whole thing with this girl has destroyed me so much I want to avoid this pain going forward so will return to not seeking a relationship, but I don’t think I can handle the loneliness.

Other aspects of my life are also grim (!) My insides feel like they are always in a knot - this has been with me since my teenage years when I was incredibly shy. My teeth are wonky and need sorting, hair loss is starting to happen and I am underweight (i am amazed that girl fell so in love with me!)

Now for some positives - amazingly there are some, from remaining at home and working I have a decent amount of money and now that I have a permanent job I can start the process of moving out (but I will be living alone obviously). I plan to get my teeth fixed and have accepted the hair loss but will take steps to keep it as long as I can. I have bad days where I’m lazy but I am working out consistently and have upped my weight. 

I have some hobbies that if I can move past the heartbreak I should be able to focus on. But because of all the relationship nonsense and being lonely, I’m circling the pit of despair more than I’d like.

What advice if any does anyone have, I know I must work on myself and stay busy. Does anyone have any wisdom they can share with me?

I thought we’d be back to some form of normalcy by then… but even this spring semester was so different.

I've never considered myself a very social person for much of my life, and I'm not the type to immediately put my trust in new people, even if we've known each other for a while. However, this has caused me to feel bouts of loneliness as well and I recognize the importance of having people to talk to whenever, so I've tried to branch out and forge new relationships.

Even though I like talking to new people and I consider myself pretty personable, I also find that talking to several people is tiring, and I usually need a few days to myself if I talk to too many people in a short time. This manifests itself into several days without checking text messages or not wanting to go out. I know I don't like to be left in the dark when I'm talking to a friend, and it's caused me some level of guilt and stress from thoughts of me being a ""bad friend"". I want long-term friendships and people to trust, but I don't see a way for this to happen without casting a wide net to see if there's a valuable relationship.

In denial I ask ""What?"" amongst the loud music, only for him to repeat what I unfortunately heard. My heart sank deep and I started to feel extremely nervous.

My dad went on to search for women for us to talk to and I was internally panicking. I was thinking to myself ""Shit, I have no game and I've never talked to women in this setting or manner. I'm socially awkward, and I don't want to embarrass myself, especially when it feels like I put myself on a nice pedastal."" I (drunkenly) prayed to God that nothing would happen. My dad came back and said ""I'm working on it"" and I seized the opportunity and told him ""I'm a go with the flow type of guy"". For a bit my dad didn't  move around and I felt relived. That was until a few minutes later he found two women for me and my sister's other brother to speak with. My heart hit the floor and I wanted to die before they sat down.

When the moment of truth came I fucked up big time. I asked the most bland shit and was quiet after 2-4 sentences. I was fiddling with my glasses (which I took off because they were bent and bronekn-[ish]), kept moving my body, and over thinking the situation. I gave up immediately because her body language showed she didn't want to be near me (or at the very very least that's what my insecurities led me to think. Her whole body was turned outside the booth, away from me, while I tried to keep my cool and act like some quiet guy that didn't give a fuck about anyone when deep down I was losing my shit). I was just sitting there thinking to myself "" I want this night to be over"", ""God, kill me"", ""Say something intriguing, ,[me,] ANYTHING!"", but ultimately I failed. The girl I was supposed to talk to and her friend left. 

My sister's other brother talked to me because he saw I was spitting no game (and btw during our separate interactions, he was questioning my motives and shaking his head in disappointment. While he was doing that I started to feel anger at my biologicalb brother for not allowing me to stab or strangle myself in middle school), and I lied to him and said I was in a complicated long-distance relationship, and that I felt like I'd be cheating on her regardless while at the same time consider breaking up with ""her"".

What's worse is that it turned out we were being watched this whole time. Luckily my dad was being a host and didn't pay much attention, but my sister saw (or at least I assumed she was watching me. According to her brother, she was, but it seems like she was watching him more than me). When she spoke to me I lied to her and said ""it wasn't the right vibe"".

After the club closed for the night, we all headed home. It was me, my sister, my dad, and his gf/fiancee in the same car. At one point we started talking about my dad being a wingman, and my drunk ass started spelling ""Red Flag"" in thin air. My sister got curious and asked. I told her Im writing down red flag, and she kept on pushing for the context and I would deny. I felt some serious embarassment deep down, but I had a lie in place, I just didn't want to say it out loud. (The lie was: she's a baby mama and I feel like if I ever get in a relationship with them, I want to be capable of caring for their child a lot. And that's a true thing about me, except I never got to know if that was true about the woman my dad tried hooking me up with so I was basically setting up a lie.)

We got home and all I could think about was how much of an embarrassment I was. I felt so weak and pathetic. I felt like I disgraced myself and my family. I started thinkint about all the times my aunts on my mother side would make fun of me and say ""I got no game"". I started thinking about my younger attempts to talk with females and how that failed. I started thinking about the lack of balls I had. I was thinking about how sorry I was for failing  to develop proper social skills. I just wanted to kill myself or isolate myself. I just wanted to be normal and be capable or at least have the confidence or arrogance to be a normal social human being. I just wanted one of those wishes to come true. All I could hope for is that no one smells the bullshit I've laid. Seriously man, I want to find love by any means, but I don't want to live a lie to myself.... Now Im drunk as hell (did I mention after my L, I started drinking a lot more mildy despite having morning errands and work in less than 8 hours from now?)

TL;,DR: I went to a club and felt extremely embarrassed upon the fact that I am socially awkward, a liar, and can't talk to women...",lonely,I feel like an incapable human being that can't find love like everyone else.,2022-06-11 18:07:04

but last like two months, i realised that i really don't have anyone. i went to some camp i was really excited to go and i was sure i would make many friends and finally stop my loneliness but i just felt really down for a few days and nearly didn't talk to anyone. now i see in our groupchat that i lost many amazing chances and that I'm totally left out. anywhere i go, it's like im not capable to make any friends. no one would like to talk to me when I'm just almost always ruining the mood.

i hate it that i haven't got along with my classmates. i was so excited for high school and now nothing is happening. and even my friendships are fading away, i had one good friend who i didn't really have feeling that i could talk to ab anything, but i just felt less lonely, i just had someone to hang out with and she wasn't a bad person. and now she left me. and my other friend, my best friend actually, just can't listen to me anymore. but she isn't trying at all, i feel like i haven't really vented to her until now and she doesn't even try to reply to texts, just in like 2-3 words. and the last time i talked to her she just said that there is not worth talking to me and i said yeah ig ur right and she just liked the message. i feel awful ruining our friendship because she was the only one i talked to ab many feelings of mine I've never told anyone else.

idk what to do anymore. my coping mecahnism is talking to someone because i just cant feel pressure in my mind anymore. idk will i be capable of happiness and even making some friends, and lovers. and yeah i go to psychiatrist, she is like one of the only persons that really listen to me, but still i dont have many people besides her, not any maybe.",lonely,I have nobody to talk to anymore,2022-06-11 17:56:47

All I've done is focus on academics and occasionally playing video games and now that I've graduated, with a job, and living on my own, I feel so empty and like I have the emotional development of a high schooler. When I hear about them taking drugs or having sex I know they're not lying but it's so far gone from my own life that internally I feel like it's all fake and acted in some way. I wish I knew how to live my life like my friend's.  Even when I go out alone to raves and dance parties I feel so inadequate, lame, and inexperienced.

I’ve reached a new level of loneliness within the past couple months. I’m  and to start of my mother died of MS when i was 16. It was during the quarantine of COVID and out if my two siblings who are older, i especially had a unique relationship with my mom. She hadnt been able to walk for over 8 years due to MS and over years ive had to learn to do things for her daily. Drive without my license to get her meds, helping her up in the middle of the night from her screaming across the house to get my attention because she fell off her scooter from rolling over something. I really miss her. At times we didnt have the best relationship due to her having several ‘holes’ in her brain(her words) and i believe she was heavily bipolar but i knew that no matter how much i disagreed with her at times, i would take time to think about how shes been stuck in a electric scooter for years. Having to sleep straight up, because it would be to much of a hassle to get on top of the bed. Regardless of this she managed and she managed very well. 

My father, stopped living with us but still kept in touch, and one of me or my siblings would go visit him. Although this wasnt any different from before. He has always been gone or working until very late. I didnt understand at the time but i got numb to even seeing him. He’s definitely one of this efathers that shouldnt have kids, and its agreed upon my family, friends, even friends family know. However thats another topic.

One of the feelings i will never forget is the days leading up to her death. Without her meds she could barely complete a sentence. It was very disturbing. Extremely because i just knew she was suffering and i couldnt do anything. Seeing your own mother during arguably the most important stages of your life trying her best to say “Can you get me water” and take her multiple attempts of slurring it out was when reality hit. 

The morning of she screamed throughout the house calling for my name as she was coughing a lot and couldn’t talk I didn’t know what to do and i was extremely tired and i just called my brother up to help because i was extremely tired. If i knew that would be the last time i saw my mom i would’ve stayed. 
I ended up waking up around 11:30 AM and my mother was gone, nobody knew where she went. Couple hours later i was texted by my father who was on travel that she was in the ICU. I didn’t know what to expect nor did anyone know how she got there. Hours later my father got a ticket home to the house to reveal that my mother died.

My theory on how she got their was I believe she had a physical therapist appointment scheduled early in the morning. I’m assuming he called.

I tried numerous times to convince her to go the hospital the past couple weeks, but she insisted over and over to not go. I personally believe she was extremely embarrassed knowing her.

Every since I have compensated her absence with hanging out with friends. Every day. My siblings and I weren’t too close at the time and still aren’t really but I’ve been working on it.

Going to college soon, just honestly wish she saw me graduate school. 
As far as my loneliness, I feel as i have no one to go as normally id go to my mom during tough times. I’m trying though but its definitely a struggle with her just being a memory now.",lonely,Apart of my struggles,2022-06-11 14:23:18

If I ever made friends, the friendship would run its course and I would never maintain them long term.

yeah im young and yeah i heard it all from multiple people, that its still too early and that i haven't seen anything from my life, but from what ive seen from it i dont want to continue, im 19, going into my second year of college, failing most my classes, have no one, talk to no one, and see no one, i either study, work, read or play games, im just tired of it all ngl.

i had to break up with my gf 7 months ago after she cheated on me, but im still deeply in love with her, and still miss her to this day, and i think about her alot, she was the first person to ever care for me on that level, i fell head over heels for her, but she left me in a heart beat, to a guy she herself said, was nothing compared to me, im just sick of it all, i just want to go back in time.

and its difficult for me to make friends, as i have the social skills of a second grader, i stutter alot and i dont know what to say, and i have a resting bitch face that makes people avoid me like the plague add that im tall and well built, so whenever i walk people tend to get out my way, and whenever i try to talk to anyone new they just leave in a hurry saying ""sorry i got class"".

and i dont want to date anymore, cuz in my life i dated 4 girls, that cheated on me, all of them, 4, imagen, having 4 girls, that cheated on you, what am i supposed to do? who can i trust anymore? neither girls or guys.

i used to have a big group of friends, that i later found out wanted me to be around just for my money, i left them after i had a big fight with one of them, now here i am, alone, depressed with suicidal ideation, my therapist said he sees that im getting better, but i dont feel it tbh, i still feel as sad.

one of the exercises that my therapist told me to do, is writing, ngl it helped alot, and worsened it at the same time, cuz i kept writing about my ex who i still love, it makes me think of her alot, but recently ive been able to push the thoughts away, yesterday when i finished studying i went to sleep, and for the first time i was able to push the thoughts away, so i guess thats progress?

writing really helped, but one of the things that gave me peace, is writing my suicide note, i told everyone i know, what i feel and what i wanted to always say, its really calming knowing that if i do end up offing myself, everyone i knew will at least have a letter from me telling them how i feel about them.

&amp;#x200B;

i just, idk, i wanna be happy, but im so used to being depressed that i dont want to change it, i wanna date someone but i cant trust women anymore, i wanna make friends, but how can i trust people after what ive been through? it got to the point where i dont trust my own family, im just tired, cant i just reset my life and start over? i dont wanna do this anymore man :/",lonely,M 19 ngl its too soon to give up but im this close,2022-06-11 13:20:40

This situation is rather complicated but I’m going to try to keep as simple as a I can. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. 

So, a few months ago, I met this guy online. We immediately had chemistry. And I fell for him. Quickly, and super hard. 

It was basically everything that I had ever asked for in a partner. (Supportive, happy environment, etc) Let’s just say that he was really good for me. He made me happy and I felt really nice when talking to him. 

But suddenly, about a month ago, I had to end things. I had found out he was lying to me about his age and I ended things right then and there. 

There had already been a few sexual exchanges, and when I found out he wasn’t the age I thought he was, I ended things. 

It was the first time I was ever in a romantic situation, so I’m having a hard time moving on. And it makes me feel so disgusting that I could still have feelings for someone who wasn’t the age I thought he was. 

I know I cannot go back to chatting with him, due to the age gap. And because it’s clear that he has already moved on. 

I know it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t know his real age throughout the whole relationship. If I knew his real age, I would’ve NEVER even started talking to him in the first place. But there’s a part of me that just can’t let go. 

Any tips on moving on and letting go? And how to feel less guilty about the whole thing?

Thank you for taking time to read this ig. Even the smallest bit of feedback would mean the world to me. I cant talk about this with anyone I know. 

Thanks again.",lonely,How do I move on from this? (18F),2022-06-11 12:46:03

3519,Morrisinthemiddle,1654913508,1,"I am not suicidal. I could never do that, but I understand why sone choose to just end it. 

I hate to make a long post and I’ll try to keep this as simple and short as possible but I have a lot on my mind and I’m desperate for ideas. 

I grew up in a small lumber mill town where most people are alcoholics and/or drug addicts. My parents were drug addicts but more importantly they were drug addicts who loved to remind me I was a stupid little fat bastard who will one day grow up and understand why they do the things they do (drink, drugs, smoke, horrible fights). They ended up divorcing and I was basically abandoned to live with a relative who wasn’t much better. 

I only include that part because my childhood really fucked my head up. I’ve always had horrible self esteem and confidence and spent the majority of my childhood hiding and crying. 

I eventually started doing my own screwing up and staying in trouble and had to leave my hometown and all my old friends. I got really into exercise and self development. I lost 100lbs, became a different person, met a girl, got married, and moved again. Throughout all this time I never made a single new friend. I started a business, the business failed, I’m now in debt over that venture and shortly after this my wife starts acting weird. I confront her and she starts crying and saying we need a divorce. 

So now my only friend in the world has betrayed me. We were together 10 years. She won’t admit it but I’m sure she’s found someone else. My dog that is like my child will end up staying with her because I can’t afford a place on my own that allows pets. 

It’s been a couple months since she informed me we need a divorce and I don’t have anyone to talk to or hang out with. The first month I swore I’d never date again, now I’m dying for female companionship. I didn’t realize how much I needed that. And to complicate things, a store I frequent has hired a new girl that I find insanely cute and I’ve developed a bit of a crush on but I’m in no position to date anyone and my self confidence issues makes me feel like I’d be let down regardless. 

Overall I feel like a failure. I worked very hard to get out of the position I was in when I was younger to just have a life and now it’s falling apart.


I need to find a way to meet people but I have a bit of social anxiety. In my head I feel like I look fat and ugly but sometimes I look in the mirror and I’m surprised that I’m not that ugly. The truth is after I lost weight I had 2 relationships and a few short flings in which the girls perused me, so I feel like my issues with my appearance can’t be as bad as I feel they are but I still don’t think I have a face for online dating. 

Also, I’ve accepted that my wife and I weren’t the best match but it still hurts. I’ve also accepted that I’m partly to blame. The fact is she is kind of the “strong woman” type and I feel like I need a “girly girl” to keep the sexual chemistry alive. 

I know I’m rambling and I left out a lot but I need help. I need to meet people. I downloaded meetup and there’s nothing in my area. I live in a small town but the only people I know are much older and not people I’d want to hang out with anyway. 

If anyone has any info on battling self confidence issues and maybe a little body dysmorphia, I’m all ears.

I wake up alone, everybody else still sleeps, i eat my breakfast and head towards my internship. Haven’t seen anyone today yet.

I’m traveling by train, it’s packed. People are standing everyone but there is still a seat free next to me, nobody wants to sit there. “Am i scary or do i just smell bad while i just showered and put parfum on?”

Afternoon:
Internship, talked to about 3 people about some boring topics from work. I don’t like it here.

Omw to home, the train is again fully packed. But somehow most of the people are in groups and everybody is smiling and having fun times. Meanwhile i am just wondering what i’m doing wrong that nobody wants to talk to me. Maybe it’s because of myself.


Evening:
Came home, family already ate dinner without me, but they have left some leftovers for me! Nobody btw asked to me how my day was, they never do tbh.

I went to the gym, standard daily practice. Here is where i can focus on myself and my goals. I like the gym.

In the evening and night i went to the clubs with my friends, i completely embarrassed myself because i tried to hook up with 3 girls and i failed in all of them. The reason behind this is because my friends made jokes about that i never get girls and i wanted to prove them wrong.

Now i’m back home from defeat, alone again. Siting on the couch, thinking about not being so lonely. I know i need to fix it myself, but i really don’t know how and nobody wants to help me neither. I’m done with this shit…",lonely,Day in the life,2022-06-11 10:31:15

3545,LostZabbit,1654905412,1,"I'm lonely, but I'm not alone.

I'm not specifically looking for a relationship, I know that's against the rules of this thread, but I am still open to one.

I'm married and poly, so I can't post in forever alone dating (which is a shame because I am dating challenged), not to mention I'm also open to platonic relationships and I don't want to disqualify myself from that either.

Another difficulty that doesn't disqualify me anywhere specific but seems to be a hurdle across the board: I'm 37. I connect mostly with people younger than me and I know that's not something to be ashamed of as long as I'm not a creep about it, but it is a limiting factor no matter how harmless I actually am (I wouldn't have trusted/been interested in someone 15 years older than me when I was in my 20s either so I can't blame you).

I'm also weird. I have enough real world experience that I can hide it, but on the internet I just really don't like to. Here's a relevant example of a social weirdness: I like connections that happen fast. I get frustrated and bored with small talk and just finding myself wishing I could fast forward to where we both can open up, be ourselves, and share whatever.

So, sounds like I really like being open and myself right? Well, I do, but I also found out that I enjoy experimenting with my identity through role playing. Gender fluid roleplaying. Particularly with men. I do -not- mean catfishing, I mean consensual, all parties aware at all times, role playing. Pretend.  (Yeah, I know there's a forum for erotic roleplaying too, but it's not really built for the novice I am, and again, that's just one of the many kinds of connections I'm open to). 

I'm a complicated mess of frustrations and desire. 

But enough about me. What about you?

Are you weird? Are you tired of social conventions and want to try connecting to people differently? Have you been told you share TMI? Do you just need someone patient and understanding that won't run away no matter how crazy you are (UNLESS you're thinking of hurting yourself or others. If that's the case you, respectfully, do not need me, you need an  -actual- therapist)? Have you too been told you are clingy? Are you aware of your mental/emotional handicaps and still striving to better yourself? Are you looking to talk to someone to be yourself with? Are you looking for someone you can be someone else with?  Do you have -any- questions no matter how personal?

I had one bf who I was madly in love with and vice versa which ended 4 years ago. I was such a good girlfriend, we were best friends, I’m funny I’m smart I’m kind I’m pretty, I’d bring him food and comfort him and make him laugh and we’d have deep conversations all night, text comstantly, we had an amazing connection and I still wasn’t good enough for him or satisfied his sexual appetite he always preferred porn . we argued over this a lot. 


I molded myself into everything he wanted I already hve a very nice hourglass body but I worked out even more I changed my hair colour I became a stripper and a model I bought lingerie I tried to have sex or give him head constantly, I begged him to tell me what I’m doing wrong or how I could improve and he said nothing or said I’m “beautiful on the outside and inside” or “the whole package” but my looks were always a problem .  he always loved me but he always wanted other women and found them more attractive and beautiful. I fond myself quite pretty so I never could figoure out what was wrong with me or what he didn’t like. I was also only 17/18 at this time and I feel it’s crippled my aelf esteem forever

now I’m over him but I refuse to date because I know it will just be the same.

3572,LordPenDragon07,1654895436,1,"I (31M) met this guy here on Reddit (34M) back at the end of February, after talking online we decided to meet irl back in March and go see Batman, unfortunately my grandmother died in November and my grandfather, who has prostate cancer needed help going through her belongings amongst other things. It was terrible, I didn’t like it but I felt like the right thing to do was to go up and help him deal with everything. I told my so called friend this and that we had to reschedule, at the time he was really understanding and didn’t think twice on it.

Okay so fast forward to yesterday, and yes I’m home from my grandfather’s; we were talking and he brings up the idea of meeting again on the 25th. I agree, there’s no reason not to. Or so I thought. See here’s the thing, after we discussed this I went to my planner to organize everything and I saw two problems. The 1st one being I had made plans with another friend (38M) (friend #2) coming up in the first week of July, which would seem like it’s not a problem at all and it shouldn’t be; however (here’s the second problem), I have a job that pays twice a month and it’s a good income but not a great income.

I would have had to use my upcoming check for both trips (because my next one wouldn’t have come in time for friend #2). Because of this it meant one of two options:

A) pick one of the two friends to hang with and reschedule with the other 

B) see if I can reschedule with friend #1 so I can hang with one on one day and one the very next. (They both will be in the same place and it would save travel expenses)

So I ask friend #1 what he thinks of plan B and he says he can’t, it’s The 4th of July weekend. Okay I understand that, and I don’t fault him.
Because of this I tell him that I’m going with plan A and I’m choosing him. My reason for this is because yes, I would be very sad not being able to hang with friend 2, but me and friend 1 had made those plans back in March before me and friend 2 ever made any plans. Due to my grandfather I wasn’t able to honor those plans with friend 1, the 25th was supposed to make up for that. I explain all this to friend 1 and his immediate response was ‘go and hang out with your other friend’ ‘you’ve known him longer’ ‘it’s going to make you look bad if you do this’. He keeps saying this over and over again. And how he would feel guilty about being the one to interrupt my time with friend 2. 

I’m sorry but this guy knows Jack about my other friend and for him to assume something on his behalf doesn’t sit right with me. Not only that but I thought he would be happy to know I had chosen to hang out with him, especially since we had to cancel our plans already before. He acts like I can never get together with my other friend or something.  Plus this is my decision and mine alone, why is he making it for me?

So then he goes and deletes everything from his calendar, just instantly, we don’t even talk about it anymore and I ask him what would happen if I can barrow the money from someone, which is a possibility not 100% guaranteed. And he says ‘hey if someone else approaches me I’m not going to wait for you’ (paraphrasing but that’s basically what he was saying).  So then I ask him if we can reschedule for when I finally do get another pay day and all he says is ‘we’ll see when it gets here. It’s a ways off’

And then from there he goes on to say ‘I expect people to be respectful of my time’ which I don’t know where the fuck that came from. And then towards the very end, and I swear this felt like a deliberate jab, he goes ‘at least you told me two weeks ahead and not two days before, that’s an improvement’ (which yes last time I had to cancel at the last minute).

And now I feel lower then a dog turd, I tried so hard to make this work and to be a good friend to him but I feel so angry and disgusted that I just want to end this whole thing, permanently.

TLDR: I made plans to see a friend in a couple weeks but I had another date planned with another friend and due to money issues I had to pick one of the two. I tried to choose the first friend but he kept insisting that I shouldn’t bother, he won’t try to work with me and it feels like he’s trying to guilt trip me and blame me for not hanging out with him.",lonely,I think a friend is purposely trying to gaslight me and avoid hanging out with me,2022-06-11 07:10:36

3575,MissKaarii,1654893828,1,"I (21 F) know the title makes me sound like I’m crazy. I very often fantasise and write a story in my head (or on paper) about fictional characters I made up. I’m not part of the story myself. When no one else is in the room I sometimes end up talking to myself and play all the characters and whisper their dialogue. On bad days I do this all day to the point I forget to eat, study and move and it always makes me feel more tired of course. Most of the time I only do this in the morning during breakfast when I’m alone and at night in my bed before I finally fall asleep. Sometimes it’s so bad I don’t get out of my bed till past noon. 

The daydreaming gets in the way of my daily life. I rather write or think about a story in my head than contact my real life friends I see once every few months. They always text me back and I’ve known them since high school.

I think it’s important to add I’ve never been the best looking person. I am pale, have thin brown hair, big nose, wear glasses and they make my eyes look too big. Sometimes I’m told I am pretty without glasses. Even by my own parents but they never called me ugly either. I tried lenses once and couldn’t get them out, now I’m scared to try again

I’m usually too shy to talk to new people or guys I find attractive. I’ve never had a boyfriend before. Guys never flirt with me. I’m constantly comparing myself to other girls looks. Keeping conversation with someone when we’re alone is draining as hell and I always end up saying boring things. I’m too tired to talk to them again the next day. 

I have no hobbies because I never have the energy to actually do them. My grades are okay. I watch anime/series. Read books. I sometimes cry because I wish I had relationships like those characters do or my friends who all but one have a boyfriend.

I suck at life and am afraid I will never have a meaningful connection with someone and die alone

I live in apartments in a city with my parents. I have been lonely and depressed for a long time now. But for the last two months something really good happened I felt loved for the first time and it was amazing. 
So what happened was I usually to sneak out of my apartment late at night for a smoke on the terrace. I saw this small puppy , she came from nowhere wiggling her tail. She was a stray in our colony, and I loved spending any time I could with her. I couldn't keep her because my parents wouldn't allow me to , I loved the part of the day where I would buy her favourite snack and go to the terrace with her at night and I would be at peace. I loved the way she looked at me the way she licked me , the way she was happy and excited whenever she looked at me. I loved her so much. I can't find her since two days now , I asked the guards they told me that they threw her our of the colony because people didn't like a stray dog. She was so sweet , never barked on anyone , was still a puppy. I tried to find her yesterday and today everywhere I could , but I couldn't. I will try tomorrow but I don't think I will find her now. I can't stop crying and feel helpless. Why are humans so ruthless and they call themselves civil , why would someone leave such a sweet soul alone in danger.

I spend most of my time revising for my exams, watching YouTube and listening to music, mainly grunge, Radiohead, BMTH, Indie and alternative Rock, and sometimes some 90s and 80s hits, and when I don't have any exam or important thing to do I play video games while listening to music. I know it may sound pathetic or even weird to some, but I like it to a certain extent, the only main drawback is that I get bored after some time.

I had like 2 friends for the last 2 years, but we weren't that close, they mainly saw me as an acquaintance, and I only talked with them once every couple of weeks, so I distanced myself, stopped using social media and started sitting by myself in college.

At first it was hard but with time I've kind of found solace in solitude, the things that others said/did that used to upset me don't affect me anymore, seeing them having fun in their respective group of friends doesn't even make me jealous anymore. I just don't want to be near people 'cause they just seem so weird to me, and I know that for them I'm the one that looks weird, it's a matter of perspective I think, but anyway I'm just ok with it at this point.

I honestly think that in order to not be hurt, sometimes the best solution is to avoid what can hurt you, and in my case it was people. I hope one day it'll change, but if it stays like this I'm fine with it.",lonely,I'm starting to enjoy being alone.,2022-06-11 02:21:14

Chintu : Hmm so you need friends, or have shitty friends then you have come to the right place, order your new friend now and get 5 years of luck for free. Now my partner mintu will tell about the friend you are gonna get 

Mintu: well so the friend you are gonna get is 17 years old and it's name is Humai. Well he's funny ( maybe not )

He likes to learn languages, well he knows Hindi and Urdu but he wanna start reading novels and it's hard, like really compared to English. He will start off with some short stories and all. He started learning Norwegian, French and Farsi, a Lil bit off dutch too. تم دیوانے ہے اور کچھ نہیں یارو( it's not farsi, it's urdu ) 

You can rant about anything, he can listen to it and give shitty advice 

Well he share lame memes tooo

He likes to talk about religions even though he knows lil about religions. Basically, he knows about abrahamic faiths more compared to other religions

He is preparing for the SAT and might prepare for APs like self study, if you have advice on college, majors and stuff help this poor guy. He's 17 and still has no idea what he wants to be 

He likes to do origami, Sketching he recently started doing both of them. So, he sucks a lot in it. I wanna have some more cool hobbies. Suggest some hobbies for me 

He might learn to cook as well, it's cool tbh, well he wants to move to usa. So, just wanted to be independent I guess but is not independent. Every thing is done by his mum from washing clothes to cooking

He reads novels, he tried reading Hindi and Urdu novels but heck it's hard, I think he might wanna improve it or start off reading something simple before moving on to something complex. He did read some English novels though. He has started a lil time ago. So, he didn't read many. He will be having holidays. So, he will be on a reading spree. You can suggest some 

He likes to listen songs and podcasts, his taste is real stupid, it goes from pop to classic in no time. He listend hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi, hebrew songs a lot 

He likes to watch movies and series. So suggest some, rn i am watching 2 broke girls and American dad ( he even forgot the name)

First off, I hope you all are having a good day! secondly, don't mind my english please. I am tired becuz of my internship (law firm) so I am tired and busy all the time so my grammer is not 100% today. Lastly I am writing this on my break so replies/dms will be after 6/7 hours sorry about that.

Its my first time posting here so I'm kinda excited.

1/2 months ago I starting helping people in r/lonely, r/bpd and r/SuicideWatch with their problems/struggle trying to be their helping friend but at the end of the day those poeple need irl friends, someone who they can depend on. Most people want to do stuff with others, watch movie ect. but since I don't live near to them I can't help them in that aspect. I my self am not lonely, or have no personal struggle/ problem or suicidal thought. I am doing this to help other people.

I live in The Netherlands and most of the reddit users live in America so I'm deciding to try to help people in my country but the problem is. Idk how to look for them or even know who is suicidal or lonely. subreddits like these isn't country based or anthing and when I try to find dutch alternatives, I can't find any. 

question:

Do you guys know how I can find people with BPD/lonely/suicidal in my own country?

I am not going to ignore my friends from other countries nor do I want to neglect the responsibilities what comes with it.

I get that some people will be concerned that I can't handle someone with BPD as a friend or can't deal with the struggles from people who are suicidal but talking to those poeple for 2 months made me realise that I can make a huge and good impact in their life. 

I am going to post this also in subreddit BPD but I don't think I will to that in suicidewatch (reasons I rather don't want to discus so pls don't bring that up in the comments)

I never had someone start the conversation most of the time. I understand that people can be busy though it's just feels like people would spend most of their time with someone else instead of someone like me. I don't often get morning messages and getting calls from people. One time I hang out with a friend, they had someone message and even call them too. I always wonder what it's like to experience having someone wanting to come to you and talk to you. Since I'm mostly the person who goes to someone and wanting to talk to them. When I decided to plan a day to hang out with close friends. It's mostly when I ask a certain friend about hanging out as it's really rare for someone to ask me to hang out with them. I message to some people and there could be moments with one word replies. Days where I don't get a reply, left on read, left on delivered, and no messages. It's like I want to be with others a lot due how I grow up without understanding familial and relationship love. During spring semester, I commute to campus from Monday-Thursday almost every week day. I go to college campus for my in person classes including do assignments and studying. Days with school I spend less time with my hobbies and more on my school stuff. Some days I do a bit of my hobbies. Every day I repeat the same routine and feeling sad also other emotions. Felt like nothing exciting and meaningful is happening in my life compare to others. Around midnight til sunrise, I still have negative thoughts I think to myself. Many thoughts all at once when I spend my own time by myself in my room. Thoughts like do I even deserved to be loved and have friends. I even thought of what if I continue staying as a loner from middle school to college and not have friends. I realized I would be more depressed than I am currently. If the person who didn't reach to me or asking about being friends back in 7th grade, I wouldn't be who I am today. I'm still insecure a bit about myself but I definitely be much more insecure about myself being a loner. I also realized adulting is much more lonely than I was a in high school and middle school. I guess what I'm trying to say is I would definitely be so happy to spend time with at least one person that cares and worries about me. A person's that's truly genuine and wholesome.

3656,clothesoverbros20,1654848867,1,"Dear M, 

It’s been 5yrs and I still think about you all the time. No one not even L broke my heart the way you did, we were supposed to there for each other always but in the end our 10yrs of friendship couldn’t survive. I know that you may have a different perception of how our friendship ended. To me it was as if the 10yrs I had spent going above and beyond for you simply because I loved you meant absolutely nothing. You watched me Spend 7yrs of my life working my way through college to get my dream career and when I did you resented that I wasn’t available to you whenever you wanted to chat. You watched me spend yrs trying to get over L and when I finally did and was starting my family you resented that I had to put myself and my child first. I understand that I had always put you first even over my own family and my studies and jobs and the changes were hard. But you couldn’t understand why I couldn’t stop to answer the phone in the middle of teaching a class and you resented that after working 50+hrs a week while pregnant that I was too tired on a Friday night to go out. I cried for hours after that last phone call we had but I learned a few things from our friendship ending. I learned that our friendship had always been focused on you, you kept me around because I was always there, I made you feel great about yourself, and I supported you and went above and beyond for you. I learned that I could never expect the type of loyalty I gave to people. You know my family was never much for sharing feelings and as much as I love him neither is my husband. I hate that you left me alone when I needed you the most when my life was just beginning. You left me alone When I was going through a pregnancy where I could have lost my son, you left me alone when I was going through postpartum depression and my kid being in n out of the hospital. You left me alone while I was learning to live with a new disability. You left me alone through the surgeries, hospital stays and constant specialist visits. I hate that you’ve never met my child. I hate that you weren’t by my side when I got married. I hate that even after all the hurt I still want nothing but the best for you and get joy from knowing that you’ve made your dreams come true. I hate that I miss you and need you. But most of all I hate that you probably don’t even care. You made me feel disposable like I am of no good to people unless I am doing things for them so I now avoid serious friendships. I don’t want to try to figure out if someone keeps me around because they genuinely enjoy my company or if they just like having someone who always helps them and makes them feel good about themselves.   I often think about reaching out to you but it makes me feel pathetic so I don’t. Besides I don’t think you care how I feel, you said so yourself during that last call.

M, 35, great shape. 185 lbs. Lift, have a great job. Am great in bed. I don’t have a lot of hobbies other than work, masturbate (porn doesn’t do much unless it is the natural girls ie. girl next door look), workout a lot, and I love phone sex and sexting. Phone sex and sexting are the top of my list of fulfilling pleasures.

Now onto the real thing, I need to hear a girl say she loves me, and I need to say it to her as we fuck. She also has to be thinner (dating a girl now with muffin top but I dieted and lost 55 lbs. so it is getting difficult to stay but I love the comfort of her cooking for me, doing grocery shopping, and overall companionship but my attraction isnt there sexually at all so I am literally in an almost married sexless relationship. I want to break up and get the girl of my dreams but I also want to selfishly keep her so we can be there for each other (I also do things for her… landscaping, organizing, take her to dinner, hang pictures, do home improvement projects.)

I don’t drink and haven’t did drugs either so I look much younger and I still have great hair. I would ask is anyone else in this boat? Guy or girl in the same situation?

Look forward to replies. I am only human and I am not applying to be president or pastor here lol. I am simply being honest.

something ive noticed is that friend group will treat people like me (addons), like shit. if you make a small mistake, they'll frame it as something far worse, and make you feel like you're terrible for it.

though will forgive their actual friends for something ACTUALLY far worse, will let them off with a slap on the wrist, and frame it as just a little accident.

3711,SolutionScared8547,1654823426,1,"So I have a friend that I’ve known for a while and she’s helped me through a lot because she has more life experience than me (she’s 32 and I’m 25) and I’ve always appreciate it. But lately I realize all she wants to do is smoke weed and eat and that gets depressing. 

I’ve tried to get her to do things with me but end up having to do them alone because she gets me all anxious and paranoid about it. It’s extremely lonely knowing she lives right down the street and doesn’t want to do everyday things with me like go to the grocery store or for walks. And I don’t even expect this regularly, it’s just part of being neighbours and friends (it’s what we used to do before). She’s all up in her boyfriends business and they freaking live together. I’ve tried to respect her relationship but it’s clear that she doesn’t want to get out of her comfort zone. 

We went out together last week after I called her out on it and she seemed so fucking miserable. She’s the only friend I have but doesn’t want to explore any of my interests and wants to support me only from the sidelines. Is that even friendship?!
 At this point I’m better off accepting complete loneliness and trying to figure out how to fight my anxieties alone…. It’s really sad but I’m just done with being her ‘backup’ when she gets bored. She expects me to drop everything for her and wouldn’t do the same for me. So I just feel used and like an idiot. 

Another thing is that I feel like she actively works against me when I try to find a relationship or to get healthy. And that’s really toxic. Like she’ll pick apart everything about a guy when her relationship isnt perfect. No one’s is. And refuses to even try going to the gym with me making excuses about being tired and busy all the time. Mostly because of all the weed she smokes I guess but it’s really not the lifestyle I want for myself now (no shade because I smoke weed regularly too).

It's hard to relate to my friends, since they can just download a dating app or proactively go out by themselves and find a boy to date and marry. But for me, I have to make sure our families, cultures, casts and entire bloodlines are compatible before I can even talk to the guy. It's just exhausting at this point.

I have 0 friends to share my interests with. Even with the ones I had, I didn't share those interests but at least I could have fun. Honestly sometimes I have such a low self-esteem that I convince myself that all my friends (even the ones that I always had a great relationship with for years) are acting like friends because of pity. I spend half the day alone and while I love my family and they are the best when it comes to socializing, I can't relate to the people of my age. I sometimes feel like it's going to drive me crazy.

I am posting with their consent, but they are a little shy and would prefer if I were the one to ‘reach out’ as it were. She is looking to meet new people (male and female) online at first and then hopefully make a real-world connection.

I have been speaking with her online for the last few months; she is sweet and kind, but she needs a real-world connection, and I'm sadly the other side of the world. She has a form of depression and low self-esteem, so she needs someone who can be patient and caring, but above all is looking for companionship and company. She is into gaming, manga and horror movies / series mainly, likes animals and horticulture.

I appreciate it is perhaps a little strange posting on her behalf, but I guess I'm just trying to help in the only way I can think of. Feel free to either DM or reply below if you would be interested in forming this connection; if you could share a little about yourself and then I can pass on contact details.

3767,spookymemecollector,1654803579,1,"Hey guys, I don’t know where else to post this  and have even one person understand. I was in an incredibly abusive relationship with a girl for 3.5 years. I had never dated before that, so abuse is and was all I had known. That includes threats of leaving for someone else if I don’t provide X Y or Z. I’m talking constantly being told, “if you’re not gonna have sex, pay, drive me, whatever else, then I’m going to go find someone who will!”. As you can imagine this shattered my self confidence and drove me into a place where I was just sleeping with someone new every couple of days after we broke up because I was trying to get revenge or fill a void. I’m not sure which, but I lost myself in that trap of promiscuity for about 8 months before finally finding someone I deeply love. It’s been very uncomfortable for me in this new relationship because I’m lost. I’ve never known a healthy relationship that isn’t always with strings attached. My girlfriend makes me so happy and I love her so much, but those insecurities and fears are tearing me apart. I don’t want to continue sharing my fears with my partner because all it serves in my opinion is making her think I think she’s going to cheat on me or find someone else. She has assured me and made me feel secure non-stop whilst also standing by my adjustments to non-toxicity. She’s truly my best friend and I love her to a painful degree. However, I don’t think I can handle it anymore. The constant fear that she’s either found someone else, or if I ever and I mean EVER don’t provide everything she wants, that she’s going to go cheat on me with someone who will. I’m leaving for a vacation in a couple of days, and the anxiety is crushing me. I can’t eat, sleep, drink, or communicate well with anyone at the moment. I’ve subconsciously accepted that it’s either I rip the bandaid off and break up with her now, or I go on this vacation and she finds someone better than me and decides to be with them behind my back or even to my face. I hate my ex for doing this to me and making me feel completely inadequate, but I feel lesser than any other man who could possibly exist. My girlfriend deserves better than me, and I guarantee she will find better than me while I’m gone. Logically, I know that’s not necessarily true, but with these insecure traumas screaming at me, I can’t shake the intrinsic fear and terror feeling that I’m having. I think I have to break up for my own sanity. I hate that I have been changed this much by my ex and that I’m potentially going to toss away something that makes both me and my girlfriend deeply in love and extremely happy because I don’t trust that there’s not someone better than me that she’ll want. Thank you for listening, this is just scary and I can’t tell anyone because nobody is going to just listen. Seriously, thank you to whomever reads this and either gives advice or just simply listens.

3787,yoohnified,1654794239,1,"after going to a new school, i thought i would be able to meet better friends and maybe even be in a clique! however after 3 weeks of being in my current friend group, i couldnt help but notice the way they have been subtly treating me. we're in a group of 5, so naturally the ""least liked"" person in the group would get left out — which is me. when we're walking together, the other 4 would get into pairs while im the odd one out walking at the front, middle, or back alone. there was even one time where i was the second person to get my food, hence i went back to our table to sit down. but despite being the second person to sit down, the 3 remaining ""friends"" did not want to sit across me and i was left in the middle with no one across me and with the 2 pairs on either side of me. it was a really shitty feeling because im pretty sure people who walk past our table could easily tell that i was the least liked person in the group. 

today i texted the group chat to state their availability because its the holidays now and we planned to hang out. they ignored my text and when i sent a follow up text jokingly asking why they ignored me, one of them (whom i thought i was the closest to) said, ""i thought it was (another friend's name)'s message so i immediately tapped the chat. but it turns out to be from (my name)"". i was genuinely shock and hurt. no words could explain or express how i felt when i read her message. i was truly speechless and i didnt reply.

i really tried hard to avoid social media last night but i gave into my urges and saw so many posts and stories on prom. everyone looked so pretty and looked like they were having fun with the their friends. it really made me upset because this year i had a friend group who i really loved and cherished but they choose to cut contact with me. even though i have 2 other amazing friends i felt let down by them when they told me they couldn’t attend prom or even our senior trip. i know they have their reasons but it really sucks when the friends you rely on let you down. i tried my best to watch a show and read my favorite series of all time but i just couldn’t find joy in those. especially since i’m an introvert i’m so used to being cooped up at home, like i only hang out with 1 friend occasionally.

i know i’ll get over it within time, but it still really hurts. i guess i always dreamed of having a good high school experience with my friends but i didn’t get that. i had a horrible middle school experience and i thought high school would be better but it wasn’t. i don’t know what college will bring but i really hope it’s not bad as this. i just really feel bummed out since this was my first and last ever prom which i had to miss out on due to my loneliness.",lonely,missed out on my prom because i had no friends to go with,2022-06-10 01:48:22

I tried to chat with people on the internet, but it is really hard to find somebody and even then they just ignore me soon when they realize I just do not know how to talk with people.

I present as feminine because it makes me feel better in my own skin. It also means most people don't misgender me as a man when they meet me.

Of course, at work, I can't do this because my company is socially conservative and even being gay isn't normal. Changing jobs wouldn't fix things because from experience, transphobia at work is systemic. 

Before realising I was trans I was only into other guys. So I had a small dating pool. Coming out as trans has made this way smaller.  

I've been trying my luck with apps like Feeld, Bumble and Tinder. On Feeld, most guys are straight men who I obviously can't right swipe. On Bumble and Tinder, I maybe get maybe one like a day, but usually they live far away. When I'm attracted to the person and match, they don't say hi or engage in conversation with me. OKcupid was a total waste of time. 

I've also tried apps like Grindr, specifying that I want to date. But I just get hundreds of messages from trans/sissy hunter men who want to fuck me. They ignore my profile text. When I ask if they'd like to go for a drink they just ignore me and ask if we can fuck. 

I'm so lonely and I don't see my options improving. I already live in a capital city. There's very few spaces I can meet people in real life, there's some gay bars but they generally don't accept trans people. Basically, from my experience, meeting a guy in real life isn't a viable option.

When I got to college I swore things would change. I worked on myself, getting out of my comfort zone and cleaned up my appearance and became more extroverted. I even reconnected with A. (Didn't realize it until after but she was abusive and toxic and used me) The problem was and is, I have only ever been friends with the girls I'm interested in. I've never been on a date. I can still remember the names of every girl I ever talked to and was interested in. A, M, B, M, A, S, M, M, R, J, and 16 others. It would be nice to have a first date at this point because I've been feeling lately like it'll never happen. 
I just graduated college with a great degree but right before getting that piece of paper I lost the girl I love. I had been friends with R since we were 14 and we reconnected over a year ago. She had just moved back to my area. She's beautiful and funny and happy and she's been through a lot but she's somehow better for it. She always knew how to make me smile and when I finally worked up the courage to tell her how I feel I was met with ""we would never work"". Rejection always hurts but this is worse. This is something entirely different. It feels more like betrayal than rejection. Not only did I lose someone I truly love, but I managed to lose my best friend too in the process. She is no longer talking to me and I feel like I'll never meet anyone as nearly half as good as her. I thought things would change after HS, but they never did. 5 years nothing changed. I'm still at square one. I never left.

Everyone that hates me all know each other and was basically one big friend group and I feel it was because of the shit I said to him. I was already known to make dark humor around people and said the n word from a vine that he we liked and I guess he hated it. Idk why this would ruin a bunch of friendships I have. I wish I said sorry about it back then but he just built it up for 2 yeats and decided in the middle of senior year to spit it out at me when ive shared how grateful i am to have him as a friend. They may think I'm a racist pos even tho I love everyone of any kinda and even make tons of jokes making fun of my own life and of the fact that I'm jewish. They all knew it and that pushed the last straw I guess. But even before then I was lonely and I loved this group because they seemed to want to actually call me and talk. I never got that from anyone and even had thoughts of harming myself in my school (I graduated so don't worry I would never do such a thing) and I guarantee nobody would care and walk over me. That's what I was basically to everyone. Even got made fun of for being a poser or being someone that wants attention which I never was. I knew this girl who I was talking about in the beginning since freshman year and we talked so damn much. I had some of the best conversations with her and now will never talk to her or any of them again. I just feel like a pos who thought was funny but realized that I was just a scumbag that had a shit humor preference. Now I've just got to a point where I said fuck it and I dont care about people at all. So I became more of a dick to people at the end of senior year and it felt kinda great. Something I wish I was more often and even got suspended because some people took me seriously about crap I've said (which I obviously wasn't, they were just intrusive thoughts). I'm kinda in a state now of whether I feel liek crap cuz none of my ""current"" friends who are people I've talked to for years before I made high school friends don't even talk to me and now I can't tell if I'm lonely or if I feel I've accomplished something knowing I can easily screw things up. I just can't tell anymore and like I said earlier, I just have dreams of causing harm to myself just to feel a sense of joy knowing that I won't be remembered from people that just didn't like me in general or that never trusted me once I say one bad thing. I'd forgive them if they said something to me even if I hated it but I never just blocked them.

3855,bestieharem,1654755152,1,"Kinda a vent. It’s hard for me to get to know people, much less become friends with them and it might be due to the discrepancy between how I look vs. how I act. I’ve dealt with social anxiety disorder my entire life which has gotten increasingly severe over time. I feel like I’m not an interesting person and have always hated myself for various reasons, a big one being that I’m not funny or charismatic. Because of my lack of control in life (over the disorder), I tried to compensate by improving my appearance. I learned how to do makeup really well, lost weight and got skinny again, cared a ton about my outfits and making sure not a hair was out of place. If you saw me in passing, you’d probably think I have no problem making friends or getting along with people because of “pretty privilege”. 

This worked against me though because people are generally intimidated or won’t approach me (and the fact I have RBF doesn’t help). I’ve been told this many times. Students at my college with a similar “look” have tried to talk to me but get turned off immediately by my awkward responses. I don’t know how to act chill and can’t come up with smooth off-the-cuff responses like a lot of people around me. The kind of people I can make friends with and genuinely relate to don’t try to approach me and I get treated with suspicion when I try to talk to them and make a connection. It sucks because I’d totally go without makeup and never dress “nice” if I didn’t have self-esteem issues and fear of judgment. If I gave up my image, I’d have literally nothing to hold up my self-esteem. Sure, I have a good GPA and a good resume. I have a family that praises my accomplishments and appreciates me as a person. But I always feel super inferior and isolated. I have only a couple friends so I’m never in the loop for what’s going on, and I feel like I’m developmentally behind after missing out on two decades of normal socialization.

This is all due to the damn disorder, I’ve given up the idea of having kids in my head because I’d never want them to inherit my mental issues and go through their lives as painfully alone as I am. I’m an extrovert trapped in a brain that shuts down in front of new people and makes me feel like I’m drowning in public situations. I’ve been scathingly self-critical since childhood and I feel like that bleeds into the way I carry myself to the point others can sense it. I don’t have female friends because I’m scared of being judged by other girls, and guys only try to get to know me because of my appearance. I’ve had a few toxic relationships that further messed up my psyche, and I quickly lost my relationship with the only guy who’s everything I wanted because he saw how bitter and misanthropic I am inside. I would love to love people, but my whole life I’ve been stepped on, rejected, bullied when I made wholehearted bids for connection. At some point this year, I came to the point where I no longer felt lonely turning on my phone to zero notifications. 

Recently I’ve started an internship and also been on Omegle to practice my social skills. Onboarding with the other interns has been isolating— I see these strangers interacting and building rapport so easily. I spoke up frequently in the many meetings we had to attend, forcing myself out of my comfort zone and being super friendly and upbeat, but people treated me differently still. Somehow it’s like there’s a social contract and I’m aware of its existence but can’t seem to figure out its rules. Today we were doing some crafts with the company’s wellness committee and I turned off my webcam in the middle and stopped working on my thing because I was depressed. The activities just felt meaningless to me. I acted upbeat and was very smiley with my parents but I went up to my room after work and have just been on my phone for hours since.

I’ve started feeling lonely again. In the past week on Omegle, I met a few other college students I really got along with. I talked for at least an hour with each of them and I really connected with this one girl in school for art and journalism. She came into the call with this enthusiastic openness and I was able to match her energy. I’m generally really friendly on Omegle to everyone I meet and finally I found someone with the same vibe. We got so comfortable talking with each other, off the bat I felt this feeling I’d been missing for a long time. It was like talking to a close friend. I was so relaxed that I was cracking jokes constantly and making her laugh— the conversation was super organic and we even made a dating profile for her after I told her some of my crazy stories. With her and the other couple of students, I was able to speak without a shred of anxiety like I hadn’t done in such a long time.

I am grateful that I met these people. It reminded me of how it was with the two or three real friends I’ve had over the course of my life. I haven’t had that feeling of genuine happiness and human connection in years. I got their contact info but I know we won’t be in touch. They each have their own lives and actual friends, and I was able to fake being like that for the duration of our calls. I wish desperately that I was able to meet people like them near me. If I’d come across them in real life though, we probably would never have spoken. Feeling these old feelings again has caused me to slip into a depression these past couple days. Now I’m constantly checking my phone for notifications like I haven’t done in months. 

I feel lonely again. I thought I’d gotten past it for good and accepted my lot. But I can’t find much meaning in life without being able to connect with other people. I’ve lost my hobbies over time and now I don’t feel any joy or excitement towards life. There’s just apathy. I feel like I’m just dragging myself through every day. I started staying up late again even though I hate being sleep-deprived because that’s the only time I don’t have to confront reality. The feeling of being accepted was addictive. The rest of this summer is just going to be putting on a persona and faking enthusiasm in this internship when really I feel dread about my future working a 9-5 and the emptiness. I’d kill to have a purpose again. I wish God was real so at least I’d have someone to keep me company.",lonely,I look put-together from the outside but I feel like I have nothing?,2022-06-09 16:12:32

After a lot of traumatic experiences, I couldn’t really function well and that made me have a lot of experiences that others couldn’t relate to. Which made me withdrawn from just everything you could say. 

Probably developed depression and went through extremely dark times where I really had an empty cup, and couldn’t maintain anything or felt like doing anything. 

I wouldn’t really blame myself though, sorta just a life happens type of thing. After being alone for so long, it kinda feels comfortable even though I know it’s unhealthy. 

I know I don’t have the best social skills since it’s something you need to do everyday and being alone doesn’t really improve it, but it also has to come from a genuine desire, can’t force relationships. So if you genuinely don’t want friends don’t force it. 

I think going through a lot of traumatic experiences make you want to stay in your safe comfort zone. And meeting new people and putting yourself out there is obviously a vulnerable and uncomfortable thing to do. So I’m slowly working myself up to do those things.

Internally, I know I want all those great things but realistically my pace is slower and tentative. I also am afraid to invest alot into relationships to not have them work out.",lonely,Why do you think you’re lonely? (If ur comfortable sharing),2022-06-09 16:00:05

To my Dearest Someone,

I may not be perfect. I may have not remembered each moment excatly or what i did, or what i said. Or how things happened. But i always remeber how i felt.

Believing in you. Trusting you. Supporting you. Each and every meal I cooked. Each and every time you got sick and i took care of you. each and every conversation and story you have shared and I listened to. Sleeping with you. Being beside you. Looking in your eyes. Our skins touching. Our hands Holding. Our kiss. Our laughs. Our hopes. Our dreams. I felt everything.

I may not be rich and smart and good loking. I am poor, fat, dumb and stupid. But it always felt like love. Thats what i felt. Love. The kind of love that would last a lifetime. The grow old and die with you kind of love.

You saying it isnt. You saying it wasnt. You 
saying your rationalisations and misconceptions about it. You saying you dont know what love is, was the most painful thing i felt in all of my years of exsistence. Did you really not feel it?

Well i tried. I really really tried. I am still. But when you quit and decided that our world should end Especially when you began having feelings for someone else. Choosing and deciding to act, to find out your truth with that someone, i was left in a loop. In an endless state of preplexity. I still am.

For I am not a vision nor an enigma from some distant future residing in your subconcious/ some mysterious land scape. I am a real person in the present who really really loves you. Who cares for you and is willing to share his life with you till the end. To have and to hold, For richer and for poorer. In sickness and in health. Till death do us 
part. Thats how it was supposed to be. Thats how i thought it would be. But it wasnt.

I dont think I will ever understand and recover from this.

I was whole. I used to have this mental image of who i am and what things are, of who you are and of what our life is and will be. How we would survive, recover and build and do evrything. Now I am so damaged i dont know who i am anymore, what to believe in and what is left to fight for.

This may only last a single page on the current new chapters that your exciting new life is having, but i want you to know what it cost. What was lost. I wish you really do stand to gain for all the martyred dreams, efforts, beliefs, time and person due 
to this event.

I hope its all worth it and I really hope you will make it all count this time. That you will genuinely be happy on whatever self quest you are up to. That you will push and wont quit  anymore. That your own vision of being the best version of you really come to fruition.

3867,xove-e,1654751571,1,"Doesn't everyone sometimes just want to leave everything behind and start somewhere new in hope for a better life... That's what I hoped for when my family decided to move to our home country.

It was in that time period where covid was a really big thing and we figured out it was the best for us to move back to our home country. But the situation was still kinda weird with the place we lived at so we decided that i should go first while the others figure things out.
It was pretty quick I finished school and a few months after I traveled to my aunt where I'd stay. The first weeks were really good but things slowly started to turn. I don't wanna go in detail but basically our families had a lot of disagreements regarding my situation and the end result of all of that was me living in a near city by myself.

It was the first time that I would be living alone, so I was really excited and didn't think that things could end up bad. So first weeks exploring was some of the best time. Getting to know the life as an adult. But due to my age and other things I couldn't work so I just stayed there and waited for my birthday to come in a few months. In that time I was trying a lot of things like playing basketball or going to the gym there, but eventually it slowly turned into me isolating myself.
Big reason for that was probably the fact that I have problems with the language because I didn't grew up there. 
The few only human interaction I had was at the store to the cashier or occasionally playing video games with friends from my hometown.

But there it was when I first felt that loneliness. And this feeling increased every day until I was so depressed that I wouldn't even want to go to buy food or answer calls from my family. I was just waiting for my birthday so I could start working somewhere to have a chance to create something. Time passes and its just constant depression and loneliness. But what was killing me inside was that I couldn't tell anyone, because I hid everything from my friends and build this Fassade that im living my best life together with my family because I didn't want them to worry about my situation. So i began to distance myself from everyone and distracted myself with videogames or anime.
I'd be outside for maximum 20 minutes a day and had no energy at all. But I just have to keep waiting and then I can start that's what I've been telling myself all through out the time.

I was or still am living in a city where i can't speak the language that well, without any friends or any social circle depressed af coming home to no one.

But then the time has come my aunt found a place I could work at construction and tbh that's its not that bad. But it's just the fact that I come home from work to no one, sitting on my bed tired and hungry without any joy.

My fam still can't move here and I'm starting to loose my patience. If this goes on for longer i I don't thing I'll be able to hold it anymore and would just take my stuff and go somewhere else without anyone, because that's basically what it is right now...without anyone.

If somebody can relate or lives in a similar stage like this in your life, just know your not alone there's others who go thru similar things!

But i think wat is really disturbing me the most about the situation is i thought they were actually my friends but in reality i was just another viewer. At that moment i felt like giving up cuz im not doing any good for anyone and neither myself either.

I would always be tricked into getting comfortable or thinking that everything will be okay only for it to not to and they just decided to leave me hanging and leave and at times i feel like i really deserved it. I feel like i do. And i hate it. I feel like nonbody cares about me or cares about my feelings and unless im bleeding im fine but im not. Im truly not. Im struggling so bad and no one is there.

I see couples and best friends on social media and tik tok going to eachother when they are upset and in need of comforter and immediatly after i cry myself to sleep because thats all i have to comfort me. And i have to make up senerios in my head pretending a clown or something is there to comfort me but even those daydreams can make my feelings worse because ik its not real.

I wish the frisnds i thought were my friends didnt leave and forget me

I've already posted here in the past, maybe some of you remember me. Anyway, I'm a bit high, Sorry for any formatting/grammar error.
I'm 5'1-2"", that by itself is more than enough.
Yet, in the last year, things have gotten even worse.
I lost 8-9kgs in under a year due to loneliness-induced stress, so now I'm underweight (not by much but still...).
Not only that, my hair started to fall out, I started balding. It's not THAT bad but it's still far from good: I'm a diffuse thinner. I'm already on minoxidil (which seemed to have slowed down the process) and, hopefully, I'll add finasteride very soon.
So, I'm a very short, skinny and balding dude... that doesn't sound very attractive at all.
I'm planning to fix the skinny part and treat the bald part (IF finasteride works).
Still, I feel so unattractive, I can't even imagine any girl being attracted to and loving me. It feels like such a faraway fantasy.
I mean, even my exes were ashamed of being seen with me and didn't want to have sex with me.
I've been bullied hard for my height especially.

3958,throwingaway4753,1654716607,1,"I want a girlfriend. I’m attracted to men, too, but after my last boyfriend, i want a female lover. I don’t think i’ll ever get one or that i deserve one. But it’s a nice thought. I’m a socially awkward, ugly loser- and also kind of a selfish jerk. so i understand why i’m not appealing to girls, or anyone, really. So i guess i’ll just pass the days imagining only the good parts of a relationship. 


That’s the great thing about your girlfriend being imaginary, you don’t have arguments or have to worry about growing apart or cheating or anything. It’s just me and my pretend girlfriend that doesn’t exist. She’s pretty, but not pretty enough to make me feel self-conscious. She’s nice, but not nice enough to make me feel like i’m indebted to her generosity. She’s smart, but not smart enough to make me feel stupid. She has some different opinions than me so that we can have engaging debate but not emotional fights. Cuz, frankly, if she agreed with me all the time and constantly wanted to do whatever i wanted to do, that would be boring. 


Yeah, all of that is nice in the girlfriend i picture and pretend to have. Of course, in real life, i don’t expect anyone to be perfectly tailored to my tastes like that, but i’m basically mentally writing a fanfiction where the main character is just me so i have as much creative freedom as i want.


At least, in theory, i should. See, i don’t actually care much about any of that stuff. Sure, it would be cool if she was pretty, nice and smart, but i just want someone. I’m so imperfect as it is, so i’m in no position to ask for anyone more than a human trying her best, just like me. I wouldn’t care if she would be a mess, struggling to get out of bed, in a dead end job, confused about what she should do with herself and ready to collapse into someone’s arms and those arms could be mine. Because guess what? I’m a mess, struggling to get out of bed, in a dead end job, confused about what i should do with myself and ready to collapse into someone’s arms but no one is here. As long as she loves me and puts forth the same effort in a relationship that i do, that’s what matters to me.


Most of all i want someone i can just exist with. We don’t need to do or talk. I want to sit with her in my living room and she’s reading a book in a genre i don’t care for and i’m reading another book in a genre she doesn’t care for but we can lean on each other as we read. I wanna go to the grocery store with her and spend way longer than we have to there because we play fight over which food brands are the best and end up buying both anyway. I want to take her to a coffee shop and look into her eyes. I want to go to the park with her and push her on the swing.

Then suddenly in a short span of time I had a falling out with a friend and 2 moved away, my core group got smaller, and the other members of the core group slowly developed extended social groups and started spending more time with them. Some rekindled old friendships, some made new ones, while I was left with the core group which no longer get hangs out with me, and some key members have moved away. I feel stuck, with no real friends around. And this makes you question yourself. Maybe it’s me, maybe I am not a fun person, so I couldn’t make a lot friends. Maybe me being a social for long and introverted and insecure led to me having fewer friends, which is slowly coming down to none in the core group. Maybe It’s too late to get back my social life.I have no boyfriend, I get ghosted after dates, I am reaching a point of desperation where I just want to be in a relationship to at least have a social life. I want from a busy, bustling and fun social life to none in a month. September to December life was good, end December there were falling outs a first week of jan people moved away. And now it’s been 6 Mouni tha and dread weekends. It hurts to see other people have plans, while i get invited to none. I have no plans .

3961,IceLikesReddit,1654715530,1,"I am sorry in advance for boring you with this venting. I’m guessing you’ve seen a lot of posts about teenagers with no friends or just fake friends.

They are all acquaintances. They will use ANYTHING I say for a comeback against me. ANYTHING. There are so many thoughts I do not share to them because of this. This is why I’m so silent not only with them, but with everyone I know.
It is enough for a few to do this, and then for almost no one to stand up for me, to make me feel very lonely. It’s been like this for months/years, but I’ve only come to realise now that this is not normal. I try to cut ties with the worst of these people, but whenever there’s a hangout with my other friends, they also get invited. I won’t be going out with them; it’d rather stay alone at home. I also don’t have any other groups to hang out with since most of them treat me like shit and pretend to have a crush on me. Basically, few people want me.
The fact that I have to write this post on Reddit makes me even lonelier, as I’d say this to a close friend. But I don’t have any close friends. The closest friendships I have are talking a couple of times a week, at school, and sharing some memes. Nothing deep.
I’ll be changing schools and I do not know whether to be happy or frightened. Will it better as I meet a whole new set of people? Will be worse as I won’t be able to make any friends? Will it be just a worse version of this school? Probably the second or third.
School ended, and at least I do not have to see those people everyday for the rest of summer.
On top of this, I feel like I have no skill, but hopefully that will be ameliorated as I’ll start a Youtube channel this summer since I’ve been told I’m good at video editing. I’ll probably just give up after half a year out of lack of motivation and no gain in audience. Absolutely none of my “friends” will care.
I’m stunned about how a Redditor thought my English was impressive when I hadn’t even told him it’s my second langauge.
At this point it doesn’t matter if one of them finds this post and realises it’s me, because they just do not care.

It makes me cry everytime I write one of these posts and everytime someone comments on one of them.

They all like pissing me off.
They all hate me.

I’m sorry. This is too long. I just feel less bad when I know a couple of people read my thoughts.
I’m lonely as fuck.

For  the last 8 years after my LTR ended I dated 50-60 women all met online.  It was most of the time 1 date after which I got the ""we can be  friends"" text. But the current one makes me so confused, I can't fucking think properly now... I was texting this girl for weeks, it was great. We met on sunday for the first time, it was all great, we had fun, we laughed, we had some emotional moments. She kissed me. We held hands. We kissed for goodbye. We were texting since then like a happy young couple. It was all great. All  of a sudden a text ""sorry anon, it's hard but we can only be friends"". I  was never as shocked as I am right now after getting this text. She  says it's not my looks, it's not another guy, it's just what she feels.  Okay but it's literally every single female that feels this way. IMO it may be looks especially my weak beta body, where she isn't disgusted but she also doesn't feel tingles. Or they ""smell"" my depression somehow even though I hide it well.

I met a girl just before Christmas everything was fine then the cracks started to appear pretty sure she was a narcissist and she ruined my confidence and used me, then I met another two girls one was just a gossip the other had alot of issues (she lied about a pregnancy to her partner for months) so I cut those out. I've tried playing on games to connect with people like plato but alot of it is just people don't talk or men being inappropriate with you.

But they never stuck around and they’re about as rare as a yeti riding a unicorn.

I also know girls my age can be total shitheads. But for the most part, most girls are what I look for in a friend. They’re not rude for the sake of being “funny”, they don’t laugh at you when you open up to them, their opinions are much more open imo, the don’t force you into things, you get the point. The only thing that ruins it is when girls are hanging out with their friends they turn into different people to fit in and become just as annoying. Also if their social activities only consist inside a shopping mall, I’m sorry that is incredibly boring. I know from experience by being dragged around like a shi-tzu by my ex girlfriend.

Part of me is so unwilling to change despite the fact I know it would make my life better. Is this why I’m depressed? Or is it depression that’s making me unwilling to change? Or am I not depressed at all, just incredibly dramatic and in need of an excuse? Lots to ponder. 

All I know for sure is I hate my life right now, I spend most of my day living in a fantasy world in my head, it’s comforting when I don’t think about the reality of my life.

I decided to live alone and don't wanna deal with the hustle of the dating. But after this 2 years of lonely time, I realized that Being lonely is as bad as having a heart break + it is permanent. It is extremely draining for my mental health. Whenever I have a chat with someone my negative energy is dominating the air. I try to be as thoughtful and positive but my mind is producing all this negativity. I can't stop this. 

 It is not possible to live like this.

i also feel jealous when i see a group of friends hanging out together or when people have long-term friends. i feel like it’s hard to make new friends or group of friends when adulting as everyone tend to prioritise their career, romantic partner and old friends from school/neighbourhood. i know theres nothing inherently wrong with that or with me personally, but again, it still hurts.

In the picture, I wrote ""I love you ❤ "" in the top middle and there were hearts in the background. She said she liked it a lot. She didn't really say anything about what I put.

4050,NouveauALaVille,1654662135,1,"

M26 never been loved. Don't care for causal encounters (though having a line up of offers would be nice)

Wasn't interested in dating till I was 20 or so. Complex reasons

Had some options in undergrad and law school but due to bad luck they all failed. Either I was not in a position to enter into a relationship, I was pining for someone else, I didn't feel for them back, they didn't meet my standards, or just bad timing none of them worked. Met my dream girl in undergrad, everything I ever wanted, I felt she was the one, the one I was meant to be with. But she didn't feel the same.

Then COVID hit, it all went online making meeting impossible. I then found work in a new city, and am searching but meeting people is super hard when school is over and apps don't work for like 90% of guys. It explains why most coupled people I know met their partner in school and the guys who didn't are screwed and single at 30+.

So I remain a M26 KV.

I have an educational background in accounting and law, and work in the tax industry. I know boring but I genuinely enjoy what I do. I love outdoor activities such as hiking, exploring, and cycling; as well as skiing and skating. I enjoy reading and discussing politics and public affairs. I love to bake and try new recepies and can do basic stitching and crochet. I also have a strong affinity for kids and I am really good with them, having experience as a beloved babysitter. 

Looks wise I would say that I am pretty average. Not particularly attractive, not particularly unattractive either. 

Like everyone, I am looking for a partner I can connect to and who I can have a good vibe with. Someone whom I can be happy being with and someone who impresses me and whom I feel would make an excellent life partner and co-parent.

As to my standards I want someone who is an educated professional herself or a student aspiring to be one, age 20-26 (flexible), and has not slept around.",lonely,Wish to have love,2022-06-08 14:22:15

The title is not really an exaggeration. I don’t see my family due to conflicting work schedules. When I wake up they’re at work and when I come home they’re in bed. I don’t see anybody at work because I work in the one department that’s kind of secluded from the rest of the building. I’m lucky enough to have one good friend, but again there’s bad work schedules, and it takes days usually to get a response from either of us. I generally go weeks without a notification on my phone at all.

I’m 21 and never had a boyfriend (context, if you’re wondering about my username, I’m closeted pre everything ftm) and I don’t know if I’m a virgin or not, because it’s too ambiguous regarding the times I just gave up saying no. Either way I’ve never had intimacy outside of sexual assault or with someone who has assaulted me and it’s really hard. Recently I’ve been desperate enough to reach out to one of those men just for the sake of getting hugs afterwards. I feel really touch starved. Even more embarrassing is I recently went onto one of the CNC groups because I was lonely and that’s the only way I know guys will be interested in me, sadly I was right. It felt good for a minute but then I just felt disgusted afterwards. I can’t believe I let myself get to the point of letting guys threaten me and even reach out to guys who have acted on those threats because I’m that lonely.

I recently reached out to a few old friends to try and meet up. One said she would let me know when she’s available and never got back to me. One said she was isolating to protect her parents from covid but posted pictures of her meeting up with other friends. One I gave my festival ticket to that I could no longer attend (on my 21st birthday no less, which I wanted to celebrate but didn’t have anyone to join me) and I hoped he might want to meet up afterwards but I never heard from him again after I posted the ticket. 

So that’s where I’m at. No interaction with work or family, not even online, no friends and no boyfriend. Im a bit scared to even post this because at this point I’m scared the loneliness is my fault and I’ve done something wrong. But I think I’ve got it out of my system now so I can finally go to sleep.

I still have no friends going on like 10 years. It literally has to be me at this point but I have no idea what I’m doing wrong. I recently started speaking to people like saying hello and stuff to my co workers at work it’s building confidence. I go to college online. I honestly go to work and come home and then I’m home or with my mom the rest of the time. I need to start getting out more but I have no idea where to go to meet other 21 year old girl loners because most girls already have a group of girlfriends they hang out with.

I’m not like weird I’m shy as hell I’ll kinda like play the background until I get the courage to say hello to someone or something but besides that I’m pretty normal. I grew up kinda spoiled I guess so I can def tell when there’s a disconnect with people when they realize that but it’s not an obnoxious thing. I just like what I want at that moment I know it sounds kinda bad but it’s what I’m used to.

I struggle with daydreaming and laying in bed most of the day because I struggle with my energy or find I trail off and start talking out loud to myself. I try to reach out to others when I feel that way instead of talking to myself, but it's so hard. I feel like it just pushes people away. It seems like people ignore me, stop talking to me, or I am the one reaching out if I want anyone to talk to. I try not to be negative or talk about my emotions, but it's been challenging not to. I went through periods of years in my life where I didn't really have anyone to talk to and it feels like this has been building up for a long time. I feel so needy and like people just are put off by it. I have tried to not talk about certain things and not reach out as much and even before that I was dealing with voice problems that would make it hard to talk, so I would sent long texts instead especially since I'm a writer and would have a hard time not doing that. I also have tried to stop talking when I am by myself, but would experience throat tension and pain when I would try to stop the habit. I feel like I've been stuck in this cycle for a long time. I want to get out of it but I don't know how. I want to stop pushing people away, but I also want to break this habit and I don't know how when sometimes I just want someone to talk to, but everyone is busy and it feels like no one else needs anyone. I feel embarassed that I struggle with this because I always feel like the only one that ever reaches out. I try to cope with this by spending time with God and connecting to him because it reminds me when I feel like I have no one or I'm reaching out to people, he's the only one that can really give me what I need. But then I get in a habit of wanting to completely isolate from people. I also exercise when I'm really bored and have anxious energy and really like to sing to fill the silence now that my voice is better than it was and like learning new things and going on Youtube, but I end up laying in bed a lot of the day when I start doing that.

We made plans to hang out and we agreed that I’d be planning the hang out eg where to go, what to eat. But I think I’ve made enough Reddit posts and just know that I want to do this, so I boldly told him that “It’s a date okay” which came off as a question so I corrected myself “I’m not asking, I’m informing you”. And he took it with a stride. When we met, I told him I like him.

He was surprised but told me he likes me too (in the most casual way, I had to double check if he meant it as a friend or romantically). It’s like it’s a given he likes me. 

But I think most of all, my courage stems from my tiredness. I don’t want to be wondering if it was normal for a guy to be texting a girl good nights and good mornings, asking about her day and replying really fast even though he mentioned having work to do.

If it didn’t work out, I was going to ask him to maintain a good friendly distance. But it worked out. I’m less tired these days because I get a boost of serotonin just from texting him. My soul still feels old, but my heart feels full.",lonely,I shoot my shot,2022-06-08 09:50:29

I usually operate under the assumption that girls are getting hit on a lot everyday by a shit ton of really creepy or threatening dudes, so I don’t wanna express my feelings in a dumb way and potentially add myself to that list of creepy dudes. When i talk to girls i treat them like guys (which at this point is basically shorthand for being treated like a normal human), so we can get along fine.

I'm literally the only person in my grade who spends recess alone, to the point that school staff feel bad looking at me and try to talk to me.
I swear I have made only really 1 friendship this year, and on top of that, it's just a guy who really just felt guilty that I had no friends. 
Otherwise, it's not uncommon for me to spend an entire grade without making any friend at all
Like for example, 7th grade.
It's harder to find people who have the same interests as I do, it's hard to find someone who thinks as I do, 
It's hard to talk to people because it's hard to act like an actual normal human when doing interactions like, saying the correct things or doing the correct motions to not appear as boring and unenthusiastic, or over the top
And it's hard to get people to listen to you as when you finally get someone to actually listen, they just want to have you finish talking so they can pass onto the next person as quickly as possible.

4138,Evildominion37,1654630582,1,"I wouldn't say I dont feel any emotions, because at times I'll feel irritated, guilty, amused, embarrassed, I'll have anxiety and sometimes stress, but thats pretty much it. Even these can only last a few seconds before they fade, as I can laugh(exhale through my nose) at something that amuses me. I can feel tense when something irritates me, I feel embarrassed constantly and feel guilty over every minor inconvenience I cause someone. I apologise for everything and genuinely feel guilt. 

Over time, I noticed that I'll have anywhere from a week to a 3 month long period of what I call being neutral, and not overall feeling anything, and then another period of time about the same length of what I call being down. When I'm neutral, I dont overthink, I barely get stressed, and school doesn't really affect my mental health. And then out of nowhere, with zero cause, I'll have a period of time when I'm down. I'll get stressed over the little things, get major anxiety over school, overthink everything, and just not want to exist. I just want to be in bed, asleep, forever. I overthink and wonder, ""do I even have a future ahead of me"", ""I have zero useful skills, what could I even do with my life"" and stuff like that. I'll just want to give up on everything, and then everything is neutral again. No negative thoughts, but nothing positive either.

In my everyday life, I just feel neutral until something happens, and then I react by being excited, irritated or stressed. Nothing else. Not much means anything to me, which sounds vague, but family for example. I dont care about my family, simply because we share the same blood. I only care about my mother, sister, niece and nephews, but I feel indifferent towards everyone else. I sit on the fence about everything, not because I can't make up my mind, but because I dont care about it to contribute. For example, I have nothing against the lgbt community, but I'm not going to put effort into supporting them, neither will I do anything against them. Same with feminism, racism, politics, basic rights, etc. I have no thoughts on anything. 

Everyday I feel like I'm just trying to blend in and act like a human, feeling like an alien wherever I go, not feeling comfortable in my body and lacking any motivation to do anything. I don't like the physical act of talking doesn't matter who or what to, but I don't like it. I feel uncomfortable even telling my dog to sit, and I feel uncomfortable around others. I play playstation online with my mates and  usually force myself to smile to change how I talk. Nobody sees it, and it doesn't affect how I say it, but it does at the same time. I force myself to sound happier as to not ruin the mood or sound like I'm seeking attention. I constantly just feel like an Alien trying to fit in, and thats my best explanation.

I have so many friends yet so few of them actually acknowledge my existence. I can think of only one or two that actually does. I feel like they aren’t real either for some reason. 

I often feel like I’m the only one who’s real, or maybe the opposite and I’m the only one who isn’t real. When I tag along I’m hardly noticed. When I speak up people ignore me. Sometimes they treat me like a kid. My parents are always nice to me because I’m their kid, they always try to sugarcoat stuff. They don’t know how to respond when I insist that I am ignored.

Most of my time is spent in my own head. Things are better in my head. In my head, everything is interesting, more complex, more meaningful. If I didn’t have such a vivid imagination, I’d die.

Trying to talk to people usually gets me ignored. When people do talk to me it makes me happy but when we stop talking I hate that it’s over or am relieved for some reason.

4150,HeatLightning,1654624682,1,"I am lonely. Since you're browsing this sub I suppose you are too.

Somehow my old friends have faded away, and I've been struggling to make new ones.

They say that love is like a fart - if you force it, it's shit.

On one hand it also applies to friendships - you cannot force a connection if one doesn't happen naturally. But on the other hand, friendships also require effort and commitment.

So I decided to introduce myself to this community, and maybe some of you will feel they want to connect with me and see where it leads. So here are some facts about me off the top of my head:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 37 year old male from Europe.

Single, no kids.

From all the arts, music is definitely #1 for me. I like melodic punk rock from 90s/2000s, but also a lot of indie folk, singer-songwriter, ambient, ska and other mellow stuff. 

I value sincerity, kindness and respect.

I studied psychology and wanted to become a psychotherapist but never finished my masters.

I know what anxiety and depression are.

I used to be really into philosophy and spirituality, but in the end questioning the universe too much lead to paradoxes my mind couldn't handle, so I willfully turned away from those topics to spare myself the existential anxiety.

I've traveled most of European countries, US and India.

I will share memes.

I don't believe in any gods, but I believe in life after death.

Lately I've mostly been working in tourism.

I think I have a pretty good sense of humor since I do tend to make people laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

4174,Technos_PotatoMinion,1654612452,1,"I am a 15 year old going through maturity and all that puberty stuff including all the anxiety and I'm developing trust issues

I had this childhood friend that I've known ever since I was in kindergarten all the way up till now so that's a solid 12 to 13 years of growing up with each other and we're really close, but ever since we went to different highschools I've started doubting myself if I really know this friend of mine anymore since I can't even find a topic or activity that we both enjoy anymore, because I'm more of a conservative kind of guy and my friend is more outgoing and likes to hang around people so I'm starting to feel like I don't know this friend of mine anymore cuz I can't really connect to him or enjoy his company anymore and I don't know if it's me or him.

Recently I started getting super anxious because my friend usually leaves me on seen in the group chat whenever I try to chat with him, and the fact that he keeps showing me screenshots of him talking to other people 
e.g screenshots of jokes,him flirting and other stuff that doesn't help with me being anxious about our stale friendship

I barely even talk to him Mano a Mano and we usually only text these days if he even texts back  but everytime we do ever chat I feel like the topics never really change or have gotten deep like they used to, it just seemed like we have nothing in common anymore and I find this frustrating since whenever we go out for an outing with friends I'm always lagging behind the group since it's a group that only consists of people he knows but I dont, and this only makes it harder for me to talk to him since I always lag behind the group all by myself and it started to make me feel singled out, like that one extra friend in the back of every group that only got invited cuz someone knows me.

I don't really have any one I can share this with comfortably so I decided to post it to this group since I believe the people here would sympathize

4175,BroaddaysPlug,1654612050,1,"23/M here. I’m lonely, there’s nothing wrong with that, I just want to not feel so shitty about it. 2018 I used to watch anime all day and time would seem so short in those days. I loved it. I miss it. I didn’t put expectations on myself and I wasn’t consumed in social media as I am now. I don’t have real life friends because i just don’t share the same interests or vibe as the people that were potentials. I’ve spent this year with my ex for the most part and spending time with her is a dopamine rush but I can’t rely on her for happiness or feel a void, she’s getting more serious with work and studies. I am back home from spending months with her and I hate it. I realised that I can’t rely on my own energy to enjoy even 80% of my day alone. 

I’ve given up on the idea of friends. My guidelines aren’t strict but maybe too specific, if I was going to have a friend, I would want someone whose musically diverse, loves video games, respects boundaries, isn’t afraid to share or cry.  Adult life is pretty sad, the more I grow up the more I really no one likes each other and settles for any type of companionship (atleast from my experience). 

Anyway, if by any chance I can go back to enjoying my own company playing mario kart 8, watching anime and smoking weed. I’d trade half my life span for it lol.",lonely,I understand why I’m lonely,2022-06-08 00:27:30
4176,Sea_Ad_9984,1654610747,1,"So basically last year in October I found out he was flirting with women on insta (after a year of feeling sth is off and feeling insecure because of it and trying to speak to him about it); he said he was not being serious about it etc... I actually dumped him then, but he looked sort of remorseful and I was not ready to leave him; I told him though that if we are getting back together after this, it is going to be difficult and will take lots of effort. He was like ""sure, I understand"". However, things still went downhill.

Instead of publishing that he has a gf, he decided to deactivate his insta - activating it on and off after that to watch videos (according to his words) without telling me. He never bothered removing women from following he flirted with cause quoting ""I don't care about them""... but why didn't u do it because I care and it will make me feel at ease?

Basically, after October I was keeping it more or less composed. I sent him a book to read for what usually happens after infidelity (we were in distance at that time), because of course I had triggers, I would ask for more details whenever he would go out to which he would complain about me being controlling... I just wanted him to read a simple thin book, and cooperate with me for some period... Listen to what I need to happen in order to feel at ease and move on quicker from what happened even if many of the things I needed would usually not be in line with his principles (like giving me details of where he went out, what did he do, showing me messages if needed, saying upfront to anybody that he has a gf, topical or not etc). Yes, I went crazy and paranoid, but trust me, he didn't make it easy at all to start trusting him again... At some point I did have to do what I thought I will never do in my life, contact a colleague of his to ask her if he was ever being inappropriate (since he was refusing to tell her he has a gf because he does not like random people knowing his business and was refusing to show me conversations with her). I did apologize to her etc, she told me back then he was being respectful and she was quite understanding.

Regardless though, he kept doing inconsiderate stuff, I kept being emotional; he actually ended up hanging out with this aforementioned woman until 5AM on one night where we were at an event together (she was there as well) and I ended up crying and he left me crying to go party with her.... I get it now, it was all friendly and nothing has taken place, but throughout the night I knew nothing and it was killing me.....

After that though, in the last two weeks, sth snapped at him; he suddenly became more attentive to me, more caring; still quite selfish, but he felt like he was being faithful for real which was very difficult to believe before...

But then I saw a message notification from that woman on his phone (worded sth like 'hahah, it won't be a late one though') and I lost it; I contacted her again to tell her we r still dating in case he was two-timing us... she said to stop harassing her and that nothing is going on. I apologized to her, she was right, that is not supposed to be happening.

I told my boyfriend then about contacting that woman (it was the only thing I hid from him) and told him we can part ways and I left. 2 days later he contacted me, saying he understands why I had done what I had done and that it does not come from a malicious place. He comes over. I, however, am not convinced he is truly faithful. I told him that we r still probably incompatible regardless of anything else, so we r better off not together. He refuses to accept that. He goes home. And then I decide, well if he insists on us being together so much, then I need to know. I asked him what was the woman's message for.. he again starts to get agitated at me for asking, he paraphrased the conversation saying he told her he can party a lot before her flight but the grammar was not matching. So I insisted that he sends me a screenshot (mind you he does not like showing me his conversations). I told him that if he does not, I would assume he is hiding sth and we are over, but we are over with me believing he is a cheater after all and I won't hesitate to tell that to people, and if needed I would mention her name as well, I won't care how it makes them or me sound. If he is being honest, I told him, I am fine with us being over (cause he believed my behavior is unacceptable).

Finally, he sends me the screenshot (saying sth like I am really sad u have to see this and I don't think I can accept any apologies), apparently, the conversation goes like this:

`he: when is your flight?`

`she: saturday afternoon;`

`he: so plenty of time to party on Friday lol`

`she (on next day): hahaha, it won't be a late one though`

`she (in couple of hours): please tell your girlfriend to stop contacting me`

`he (at night when we got into a fight): did she contact you again &lt;her-name&gt;?`

`she (on next day): yes, otherwise why would I tell you so?`

`he: she's out of line, I will take care of her`

`she: she apologised to me, just saw it this morning`

`he: I see`

I guess I feel relieved that he was indeed being faithful. He was hiding stuff from me nonetheless; he never told me she has told him stuff before and he never actually did anything from trying to stop me from contacting her as he has promised her... I said thank you and told him that knowing he didn't cheat even if it means this truly ends, feels better. He didn't reply anything.

Now, I am not sad we have ended things. I have been trying to move on from him for the last 2 months and so, but I am still a bit shaken.

The thing is, I really hate him now. Like if you were being truly faithful why did you act shady?? Why didn't you bother reading the book I send you? Why didn't you listen to what I needed to move on quicker?

I was more or less keeping it calm after October; it was at the end of December when he activated his insta without saying a word (which should have been obvious it would trigger me) that I went crazy;

I know I should have walked away; but it's not that easy... unfortunately : / Especially when someone keeps repeating how much they appreciate you, you want to believe them.... I am also worried that all that stress triggered hormonal disbalance in me.. and I hope it is reversible...

but I hate him; why couldn't he for a couple of weeks right after things happened in October forget about himself for a moment, for what is convenient for him, and focus on me? focus on my needs, not his, just for a bit of time... he kind of tried doing this now, in the last 2 weeks but it's too late! and all this stress has made me lose weight, has made me have wrinkles, has really made me lose so much for what??

I am still glad he was not cheating with this woman; I don't like that he has told her he would take care of it but he didn't do anything, basically leaving her as bait... I am just annoyed he does not get it; he does not get it how what he did and how he handled it drove me to this state.....

but yeah, I hate him; cause I truly asked for very little, very little to help me move on from October quicker... it would have saved me so many tears, and both of us so much stress...

Please, folks, pray for me! I will somehow get over the emotional trauma... but I am really worried about my health and hormonal balance... please, pray for me, that it is all good and that if anything has happened, it is still reversible! I don't mind having lost 2 years of my life with someone who was a bit too selfish; at the end he proved himself, so I am happy about that at least... but so much stress could have been avoided... I don't want my health permanently damaged for some ......",lonely,Finally over but got mixed feelings,2022-06-08 00:05:47

I feel so disconnected, I have people in my life I guess, but my loneliness lies in the fact that the people I ""have"" alot of people who don't truly care. And I know this is probably a common thought amongst us lonelies. I have wrestled with my brain many times with the ""why should they care? They have their own life, and they aren't obligated to show any interest in mine. Very understandable. "" But that's just the thing. I know for a fact all these other people have to have people that will listen to them and show interest in the things they say and want to share about themselves, so where do I personally fall flat? One night I even thought to myself, ""well, actually, it's cool, all I really care to do on this earthly plane is to see all the sights, visit all the places, have all the experiences, and find my personal meaning for being here, that's it"" but when I think this way I get that pit in my heart that remembers. I like to take photos. Like lots of photos, of anything and everything. I would definitely do so on this journey. My phones have always gotten filled up so quickly with gigabytes of memory that I have to find things to part with (which is painful for its own reason). I want to share all these things I'm seeing with my own eyes, things I found meaning in, things that gave me that fleeting sense of joy. I want to give that feeling to somebody else. Nobody I know cares to see these photos. I guess either I'm really shitty at taking photos or the latter, more plausible reason, they just don't care. Once again, broken record, why should they? Long story turned alot shorter than I could make it, does anyone have any suggestion on how a human can stop being a social animal looking for a connection with any other human, Id really like to shut it off so i can just live without feeling so. Lonely. Also, how have you learned to cope with similar feelings, I dig myself so deep into holes just about every night before I sleep and I want to get better.

The last 3 weeks have been the best 3 weeks of my life. I work casually in this massive fruit company (it’s seasonal work). I struggle to talk to anyone because of social anxiety especially girls.

I met this one girl once and we hit it off, I’m not sure what it is, but her vibe is insane. We talked on the job the whole day. I didn’t see her at work for another week but then she came another day and again we talked the whole day. I got her messenger, we struck up a conversation on alcohol. She said to me “you sound really fun to get drunk with, we should get drunk together”. I hesitated cause I’m anxious all the time but I agreed.

That night, we got crossed (drunk and high together) and it was amazing. I rang my mate who drove us just around the town while we blasted music, opened down the window and shouted the lyrics at pedestrians. The next day, we hung out again then a couple days later. We’ve been high and got drunk numerous times over the past 3 weeks.

However, after the last time we hang, I felt she hasn’t felt like talking. Usually our texts go back and forth easily but now she is giving one word responses or leaving me on read. I asked her, when we gonna hang again, she left me on read. This always happens, it must be my fault. Maybe I message too much

Could I have offended her last time I was drunk? Is she sick of me? Am I boring? I’m lying in bed depressed rn and wanna cry.

4199,TheElvenAngelCatboy,1654592133,1,"Turned 25 in January. Idk, man. After graduating high school 7 years ago, I don't know if I've ever been as happy. Was a ""gifted kid"", was going to get my computer science degree, but suddenly I developed depression. Had to drop out after two years. Worked random jobs until 2020. Got put on medical marijuana but it's been a lot of trouble for me recently, but I just can't kick it, it actually made me feel happy...went to rehab already. That didn't work. Went back after a few months. Plus it ruined my relationship with my little brother, he's 18 now and I know he'll be alright, way better off without me, and better off than me. 

Went back to college last year, took 4 classes at once, ended up going semi-crazy again, was suicidal in the hospital. Decided to only take one class last semester, passed with a freaking C, I know it's awful. Tried taking two classes for the summer...the only one I could find that was part of my major was Geography of Drugs. Asking to take a second course a week into the semester. 

Also got a job...but I keep avoiding it. Idk why, it's not bad. It's a cooking position, make basic fried foods, prepare some things, learn how to make sushi eventually. But I keep avoiding work, not replying to my boss until a couple days after, etc. 


I have to get up at 7 am just to catch a ride to make it to a gas station near a bus stop, or walk to the nearest one about a mile away. Haven't driven since 2020, can't use my ebike I begged for as a holiday present cause it's too far a bike ride on major roads to the campus town and I can't even afford a freaking apartment because I'm stuck with credit card debt and ambulance bills and tuition. I'm stuck in my Dad's basement, barely leave the house. Sleep most of the time, eat, play Go (and still suck at it), vape weed, and ""personal time"", if you catch me. 

I live on disability and food stamps. Barely made it through last month, went a few days with $1.44 in my bank account. Got my check for this month, immediately paid bills and then bought weed with it, plus an Uber there and back. I have a little over $100 left for the month and it's not even a third over. I don't know why I don't want to just go to work like everyone else and be happy earning the meaningless paper we ascribe value to. 

I did the math, even working only 3 days a week will give me enough money to take a weeklong vacation at the end of July, go to another state, play Go, learn, meet new people. Why can't I just do that? Why can't I just be happy? Why do I have to do the wrong thing every freaking time?",lonely,"25M, disabled, wasting my life, not working.",2022-06-07 18:55:33

4209,lostone7423,1654586578,1,"I've never been good at relationships. I had a few close friends that drifted away over the years; every romantic relationship I had, I fucked it up in one way or another. When my second marriage collapsed 15 years ago, I moved back to my hometown to help my brother take care of our disabled mother. He became my best friend again, and our shared struggle really brought us together in a way we hadn't been close since we were kids. When my mom died two years ago, we managed to get through it, because we had each other. That's all we had, but it was okay.

My brother died two weeks ago. We'd done everything right avoiding COVID, but an unrelated blood clot killed him. My best friend is gone, my only real friend is gone, and I don't know if I'm going to make it now.

I have relatives; aunts and uncles and cousins, most of whom I haven't seen in a decade and live far away. I have a few old friends left on Facebook, but we've drifted apart to the point where we'd barely comment on each other's memes at this point. I'm middle-aged and I'm by myself. I don't even know how to begin to connect to other people again. And the thought of being completely alone for my remaining years terrifies me. The only bright side is it probably won't be long, I've got a host of health problems myself to deal with. And a huge financial mess hanging over my head that could well leave me homeless before all is said and done.

I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm just utterly lost right now. A month ago things were looking up; I was picking up new work, I was writing the beginnings of a new story, we were looking forward to so much. But it's all gone now.

I don't know what I'm going to do. I just wish I'd been a better person to everyone I drove away.

I often feel like I’m the only one who’s real, or maybe the opposite and I’m the only one who isn’t real. When I tag along I’m hardly noticed. When I speak up people ignore me. Sometimes they treat me like a kid. My parents are always nice to me because I’m their kid, they always try to sugarcoat stuff. They don’t know how to respond when I insist that I am ignored.

Most of my time is spent in my own head. Things are better in my head. In my head, everything is interesting, more complex, more meaningful. If I didn’t have such a vivid imagination, I’d die.

Trying to talk to people usually gets me ignored. When people do talk to me it makes me happy but when we stop talking I hate that it’s over or am relieved for some reason.

For the past month, and especially past few weeks, I have lost all will to live or continue on with anything, but I still don’t want to die. Getting up in the morning is impossible for me, and I don’t even have any reason to do it, seeing as my only source of happiness gives me nothing but melancholic apathy and burning pain. The only friends I had tried reaching out a few times, just checking up on me or possibly being worried (there’s no way that someone can fully care about me), and I would never reply. I would never reply to texts from my parents, friends, strangers, just absolutely nobody no matter what they said. I’d look at it, try to make myself reply, but all I’d do is look at the text, keep looking, and keep staring for up to a few hours before just putting my phone back down again and looking at my ceiling. I struggle to move when I walk, I struggle to chew or swallow, when I try to lift a cup to my mouth to drink I find it incredibly difficult, like the cup weighs more than a car, and my arm is made out of paper mache. But now it’s even worse, and it’s been getting worse. I struggle to talk, I can’t even whisper or make any slight noise despite that I am fully capable of doing so, but I just… can’t, the best I can get is a little squeak if I try to scream. And along with that, I’m struggling to breath. I always feel like I’m suffocating as if I were being choked, but there’s nothing physically wrong with me, it’s just as hard to breath as it is to get out of bed. And replying back is impossible now, I just fucking can’t even type a single letter no matter how hard I try, or how hard I try to try. Every single one of my friends has cut contact with me after getting pissed at me and done with m bullshit, or they just never message me anymore. I want to cry, but I feel absolutely nothing, I don’t remember what it’s like to have facial expressions, or how it felt to feel, I just can’t feel anything but self hatred now.

I'm always just there. No one notices when I leave. I try to be happy every day but when I do or get something I'm proud of I'm met with criticism and disinterest. 

I just want someone to be happy to see me. I need a hug from someone who actually wants to hug me, not because I asked for it. I feel like people like me but I'm just too different to really have a close connection to anyone. It was worth having a relationship for a while but now the loneliness is worse after I felt what it was like to be needed and had that taken away.

4247,zoro_in_black,1654573553,1,"25M. Hey guys. I know this post won’t be for everyone and that’s okay. Really, this post is for a select few that have chosen the same path. 

_____________________________________

Random people on the street were asked what success means to them in one word and I’m sure you could guess what those answers were. Answers like: Happiness, rich, healthy, love, etc. But, ask me and I won’t give an answer you’d expect. My answer? Success means everything…

Years ago I had a taste of the “good life” and have been chasing that high ever since. I realized I wanted more out of my life. I wanted to experience the greater things in life because why not? Why can’t I? Problem is I was arrogant and naive. Life kicked my teeth in, pushed me to the ground and humbled me. 

Now, I stayed on the ground for 5 years. And in those 5 years, instead of getting up, I sulked. I ate my feelings. I blamed outside forces. I didn’t take accountability. I was a big fat loser. 

I was now farther away from my dreams and optimal health than I started, and I started horribly! But, I believe God doesn’t place dreams in your heart &amp; soul for nothing. I was at an extremely toxic dead end job, had shitty acquaintances, overweight, thousands in debt, insecure and struggling in my relationship because of my insecurities. 

But one day, I had enough. I was pissed. I was pissed at myself. How could I have let myself get like this? How could I have allowed myself to become complacent? 

I looked in the mirror and chose to see the things about myself that I didn’t want to accept. I chose to be self aware and chose the responsibility of my situation and what I would have to do in order to get to where I want to be. Who I want to be. I chose the path of personal excellence, but it comes with a heavy price. And not everyone will pay it. 

I was 50 lbs. overweight. None of my clothes fit anymore and the only outfits I could generate were usually comprised of hoodies and sweatpants. I was insecure in my appearance. Thus, I was insecure in my relationship, my professional life, and my mental state. Me being overweight bled into all parts of my life. 

I had to start somewhere, but where? Most of the people in my life were already gone because they didn’t add any value to my life. They only took and didn’t reciprocate. I knew I needed to find new friends but there was a more pressing matter. Something I knew deep down I had to do before I could make new friends and that was be selfish. 

Yup; be selfish. I am a very loving and caring person with a lot of empathy and because of that I have always put other people’s needs before mine. I love helping others, but I realized that if I truly wanted to help them then I had to start by helping myself. If I wasn’t in a position to be able to help I would only hold others back. So, I began working on myself. I became selfish. 

Since then I have gotten all the losers out of my life, moved out of my parents house, am 7 months into my fitness journey and have lost 33 lbs. so far, reading a book per week, and working towards creating a business plan so that I may one day be able to not only become financially free, but use my finances to help others in ways that I cannot do it right now. 

This path I have chosen is very hard and lonely, but I know it’s worth it. I’m happy to day that I have done a complete 180° and am getting my life together. The only part of my life that is left is finding like minded individuals to grow with. 

It doesn’t matter if you’re a guy or girl. Together, with the power of grit, mental fortitude, optimism, and hope, we too can become the best versions of ourselves. That means giving everything we have to get to where we want. It will take everything.  Winning is everything.  

My chats/PMs are always open for those on the same path feeling lonely. You aren’t alone.",lonely,"I’ve been working on chasing my dreams as an entrepreneur and personal excellence, but I’ve lost 99% of the people in my life because of it.",2022-06-07 13:45:53

I found this particularly difficult as I know I am genuine and I know I have very good friends at home.  This is less me, more environment.

Even being around occasional people- I don’t feel apart of them; I’m not a tax-haven international kid, I’m no champagne-Marxist with a W1 apartment sprouting jargon to hide their own privilege. I’m also not a cancel culture student politician.

I’ve got to the point where I cannot live through my friends outside of ldn as it will make me more sad to return to my social environment here, and I really do not want to go back to being so a clinically depressed, pathetic human that can’t get out of bed (as was the run up and aftermath of Christmas.)

Therefore, my only option is that  im going to have to change my mindset: which means I need to stop all this hope to find normal people and just accept being alone (and as an extension lonely) for this next year.

They make sure your life is bad at home and don't allow you to develop naturally, then you see them with friends and in relationships while you don't have any friends? I am talking about myself obviously but I was wondering if not being able to develop properly because your sibling or siblings were hostile made you lonely because the bullying whether it was physical, mental, or both made you have low self-esteem. Obviously low self-esteem is not an attractive trait and it could affect you as you get older. I don't blame my sibling for everything but maybe not doing what they did to me all the time could have made my childhood a little better and maybe I wouldn't be so messed up now that has a side effect of being alone.

Question - the people you surround yourself with, wether it be work, romantic/sexual interests or friends, (if you have any) do you think any of the people in those categories even think about you? I don’t mean, do they care? No, I mean do they even take notice of you? Sure they might at first but once they dive deeper into you and your personality…..done. They had enough already. 

Can you blame them though? I mean really can you? Do you think you’re interesting, do you think you’re mature, do you think you’re attractive, do you think you’ve got your shit together???

I already know the answers for all of you reading this.

You don’t. 

That’s why you’re here, that’s why you’re trapped in this cycle. Just like me. 

It’s because like me, you answered no to some if not all of those questions posed, and that’s all it takes for you to realise how much of an insignificant speck you are on this planet. That’s all it takes for you to know that unless you get lucky soon and the right person or people come along, and you can move forward with your life, you may as well die right now. 

We’re social creatures and all we do day after day night after night is spend our time in solitude.

But why? 

I’ve asked myself this question countless times and I’m still yet to come to a tangible answer, but here’s the closest I’ve gotten for now:

We’re just wired up wrong.

Maybe since our teens, childhood or god forbid birth itself. Whatever it is, we’re all here now, having ourselves a fun old time aren’t we? 

Debating to ourselves about the various ways in which our “lives” if you can call them that, will end. I don’t look forward to it, but I definitely don’t fear it like I should. But what can you expect? 

Living a life having nothing to lose and nothing to gain doesn’t exactly put me in a position of self acceptance and shining positivity. You’re deluded if you think any of this gets better soon I assure you. But what do I know? Don’t listen to me. I’m losing it. 

Listen to yourself, try to think straight, try to pull yourself out of this and get your shit together. If you’re not yet at my pathetic life checkpoint you still have time. Don’t fester in your misery like so many of us, you’ll never get out. That’s all there is to it. 

Don’t lose it like I and so many others have.",lonely,No one thinks about me,2022-06-07 08:53:21

One of the activities was a “scavenger hunt” where the groups race to see who can take a group selfie at all of the various local landmarks near the office. 

As we start, my group is not interested whatsoever. They complain and say they only want to check out 3 landmarks and then grab coffee for the remainder of the challenge. Meanwhile, I am new to the area and want to explore. Rather than trying to convince my group members who grew up in the area, I just abruptly tell them I’m gonna grab a snack and leave. Idk what caused me to leave in this manner, but they got concerned and reported it in the intern group chat.

An hour passes (the activity is expected to take a while) and I’m just exploring the city, not thinking too much about what I did. Once I return, my group members are confused and question what I did. Word gets around and now I am the guy who ditched his group. It sucks having this label so early on, it’s gonna be hard to convince

4301,bxdl,1654552079,1,"I’m 24f and just super down right now and figured telling my story to strangers would make me feel better. My entire life has been lonely. My dad was in prison most my life and when he was out he could only be bothered for alcohol. He never lived with me and never provided for me in anyway. My mother had to work two jobs at a time to keep a roof over our head. I don’t resent her for it, but it caused me to be alone nearly 24/7. Especially at night since her main job was overnights. I had only one friend through school until highschool when mental health took a toll and I began forcing myself into hanging out with the wrong people and got into partying. My mom didn’t really care what I did so I never went to school resulting in dropping out. I immediately went to work and got a ged though. 

Just within two MONTHS I’ve had a series of events happen that have caused me to not leave my house in over a year now. After my dad’s dad died (who was the only adult to ever really care when I was very young) I found out some terrible things about my dads side. I haven’t talked to them in years because of it. None of them spoke to me at the funeral. I miss my innocent cousins who actually looked up to me and I just abandoned them. One of my ex friends tried to steal my business ideas (art has been the only thing I’ve had going for myself my ENTIRE life and I found a following for it). When I called her out she went on a year+ long quest to cyber bully me and post about me constantly since then. My long time cat died from a tumor. My two year controlling toxic relationship ended after much stress, with me paying him $600 to finally leave. Then he broke in with a knife and tried to assault me. He still drives by my house to this day even though he has a baby on the way with someone else. Another good friend began dating my ex and then proceeded to send me photos of them in lingerie in lewd positions. She tried to apologize but I just couldn’t take it anymore and never even responded to her. This is all just the basics of these situations too. Naming every shitty thing these people have done to me would take all day. But all of this happened in a two month span.

All of this together actually BROKE my mind. I stopped going out. I haven’t left my house more than like ten times in the past year since everything’s gone down. I haven’t responded to any of the bullshit and have blocked every single person that’s crossed me.  My two remaining friends barely talk to me anymore because they live full happy busy lives. I’m not close with my mom or her family and never have been. I’m alone all day long while my current boyfriend (who’s an angel) works. He’s the only person I ever see. It’s not fair to him that this is the version of me he gets. Especially considering there was a couple years of my adulthood where I worked two jobs and had side income coming in as well. But my current man has never got to see the happy successful side of me and it kills me. He came into my life right after all the bullshit had gone down. I don’t know how to bring myself back up out of this to work and be a HUMAN again. He deserves so much better.

 I have nobody to talk to. I miss my life that I was building before those few months of trauma robbed me of my motivation and spirit. I miss my family. I miss having friends, but I want genuine ones. I do have a small following online but thats lonely too, None of them know me personally. How can i build myself back up again? I’m so lost. I wish I could escape to a new town and start over but I can’t. I live in fear of my ex stalking me to potentially try to hurt me again. I have called the police but they can’t stop him if he decides to do it one day. I have security cameras everywhere now. I can’t even go to the store without running into one of these people or their families/friends. (I live in a VERY small town.) I’m just simply stuck in this funk and in this house. I’m so very sad.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a neurodivergent American guy in his late twenties that lives in the USA. I decided to give vlogging a solid shot. I have briefly tried vlogging before a long time ago in the past but I sadly quickly gave up on the hobby because life got in the way and plus speaking is very hard for me (i have so many insecurities), but this time around I have been extremely determined to STAY vlogging. To be very blunt, vlogging is a very difficult thing for me because I have a speech impediment and a few disabilities – but – I wanted so badly to get out of my comfort zone! Right now im out of my comfort zone and im absolutely loving pushing my 'limits' in a productive/healthy way!

&amp;#x200B;

I was and still am too stubborn to fully give up on my dream of vlogging, lol. Im happy I started vlogging again.

&amp;#x200B;

I was mainly just a huge lurker on the internet but I decided to actually show my face because I’m so tired of not really doing anything productive in life because of all my insecurities/fears! Having disabilities is very hard for me and I’m still fully coming to terms with my situation even tho I’m in my late twenties, – my childhood was full of special ed classes and doctor visits. I am determined also to stay positive. I have very loving parents/family that I live with and I’m super thankful that I have such a awesome family – but – my family literally does most of everything for me, I have become totally codependent because its way easier for me to let my loving family do all the difficult things for me even tho theres actually a lot of things that I’m way capable of doing but I’ve become lazy (also mostly I fear of failing. There are so many things that are extremely difficult for me because of my disabilities. I know that I shouldn’t spend my whole life in fear of the unknown/failing, I got to start fully trying things that are out of my comfort zone.)

&amp;#x200B;

My loving brother is going to move out soon because he’s getting married soon. Im not going to be able to spend as much time with him anymore. I love my brother and I think his future wife is very nice, but I’m going to miss him living with me! My brother is one of my best friends haha my other best friend is my Service Dog. I don’t have much friends – my friends are mainly just my family members. I have a wonderful family but sometimes I felt VERY ALONE.  Vlogging is just ONE of the things that I’m doing to to get me out of my comfort zone. I believe vlogging is a very healthy way to get me out of my comfort zone. My parents/family are encouraging my vlogging journey haha they think its a fantastic way to get me out of my comfort zone in a super healthy way.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a guy that has never been on a date before and I am also a guy that still lives with his parents even tho he’s a adult. But thats totally okay. Im starting to finally fully learn: I don’t have to compare my life to others. Also theres a few toxic people in the world that dislike people like me because they don’t like disabled people, but who cares what the toxic haters think.

&amp;#x200B;

A few of my hobbies/interests are: anime, casual gaming, hiking, camping, cooking, poetry, road trips, baking, violin, cosplaying, reading fantasy novels, skateboarding, and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am very proud of my channel! Theres a lot of positive comments and I focus on those. I take constructive advice tho if the advice isn’t mean spirited. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I only want you to subscribe if your actually interested in subscribing to me. Maybe you can relate to me in some way? I am very excited for this channel! I am doing daily uploads (one upload each day. I started the channel a few days ago and I have a few videos uploaded.) and be speaking about many different topics in the channel! This channel is a virtual diary of my life. Some of the topics that I’m speaking about on the channel are: mental health, living life with disabilities, Marine Biology because I dream about being a Marine Biologist someday haha even tho I would need to go to ‘scary’ college for that, gardening, chats about music in general because I’m totally obsessed with music, travel vlogs, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont have a drivers license but I also want to learn how to drive. Im going to take driving lessons soon! I have so many dreams and goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading my post if you read it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate it. You reading my post makes me feel less invisible. I know im a human but sometimes I feel like a alien because im so 'weird'. I have a tough time connecting with strangers because a lot of people have a hard time understanding what I say because of my speech disorder.

To get started so people know a bit about me is that I’m into all types of creativity whether it be from architecture to gaming to drawing or coding.

Films and Tv Show, I have just finished watching all the latest episodes of stranger things last weekend and can’t wait for the new Jurassic world film that’s coming out this month. I do love marvel films, in general though I do watch anything really from thought provoking films to ones that you can just turn your brain off too.

Love space and technology and what the future will hold from travelling to other planets and how AI will transform our world. 

I play games on PlayStation, Switch and PC but not as much as I used too. I also love playing Board games from family based ones to strategy style ones. 

Theme Parks I enjoy especially Universal and Disney.

I’m 27 since last month and seeing young people here, at very young ages giving up that easily hurts me deeply. We’re all struggling because our lives didn’t treat us better. At my early 20s i struggled with mental issues and eventually got diagnosed one day. I’ve been using a lot of heavy meds that make you numb in every way. I use only one low dose med now for one year, but i feel like i’m relapsing...

I was always a lonely, shy kid. I never had lots of friends. I couldn’t fit the stereotypes the society had. I found happiness in my own solitude. Even in uni, people would look at me weirdly and ask “why don’t you talk? why are you so silent?” which would cause me to get anxiety attacks. I’d feel so bad i’d go to home early. Then i started not showing up in the classes, idek how i graduated. And i graduated uni with zero friends. I didn’t attend the graduation ceremony bc there was no point standing there looking at those strangers being happy together while inside i was rotting.

I have no irl friends for years. At this point idek when the last time i had one. It didn’t bug me for years bc i had my games but then i started playing online games too and saw people playing together. It started to make me feel desperate for connections. Last 3 years i tried friendship subs, i tried long distance with guys, i’ve met a lot of people that sometimes i recognize their usernames. I feel pathetic. Whatever i do is never enough, i’m easily replaced, i mean nothing to anyone that everybody leaves me. For awhile i didn’t self reflect and blamed people and would be sometimes cruel back at them too. But then i got mature, even if i was already mature at young ages, i showed empathy, compassion i was patient and tried my best to be there for the people i thought were close to me, without wanting anything back. It cost me a lot. I started overthinking, being obsessed, and paranoid because deep down i knew i was being too much. I cared too much, i loved too much, i overflew my flowers. People made me resent myself for my feelings, for how i am while i accepted them as how they were. It wasn’t fair to me. 

I still tried, i tried many times. Posting i’m looking for friends, messaging to people who post. Everything died out at the end. People called me names, belittled me, ghosted me out of nowhere, i got cheated on and my ex blamed his depression WHILE i was battling with it. God, what a fool i was. Why? Why do i put too much faith and trust in people still? After all those shitty things happened to me? And what hurts more that, even though you open up to those guys about what you went through and try to be vulnerable, telling them if their intentions are ill they should leave me alone, they still do the same hurtful shit. Then i’m back to square one. Hating everyone and myself. Going back to depression hole, isolating myself for months.

I experienced nothing. I never dated irl, i never held hands, no first kiss, no intimacy and now i don’t consider those past long distance “relationships” real ones, because i regret all of them. I want to feel loved, cared, not just wanted. I want someone to put effort into things same as i would. Why am i not getting anything back from my loved ones? All i want should be bare minimum right? 

I’m empty. I have no reason to keep going. My life will always be boring, some monotone shit. I wanted to change things but i see no point in trying anymore. I will always be the one who gets to perceive, never experience.",lonely,Thoughts From My Bell Jar,2022-06-07 04:16:11

But beyond that time 31 years ago nothing not a single touch romantily I am not ugly not  overweight nor shy just have a 100% failure rate for 31 years running.  I honestly gave up at several points. But this pirsistant pain that I still  dont quite understand eats away me.  Its litterly a lonely ache/ pain it's physical not mental but is mentally triggered. Its something a kin to being suddenly scared like something jumping out at you or if you're afraid of highs being hung ove a building.  The physical feeling in the mid chest  but totally without the fear part. That mixed with and acheing draining feeling like a black hole is in the middle of my chest.  

It used to only spike around couples.  Then seeing couples in movies and tv shows then hearing about couples in stories.  Then porn became unwatchable for me . I learned to live with it as a basic level but the spikes and triggers are nothing but crippling I only made it through 3 friends wedding because I got drunk as hell but even with that I was in so much pain I wanted to end myself.

That help slightly very slightly they stop me from getting extreme with my efforts to end the pain but I need it gone it's a fate worse than death to be so so lonely then saying ok I'll just be single then to have this pain.

written approx Nov 01/21 


I found a guy on reddit. His previous posts painted a picture of a man who had ""never had a friend or girlfriend,"" describing how his family doesn't like him, how he's ""a lonely single loser with no life experiences."" I knew right away that he was someone I could relate to, someone I would get along with, someone who would understand me. I messaged him. I learned that we liked a lot of the same things and wanted the same things out of life. We started a relationship pretty quickly, getting lovey and affectionate and also sexual. We moved to Whatsapp and we moved to having actual phone calls, every single night for at least two hours, then moving to sleeping together on the phone every night and watching movies together during the day, sharing music, video calling, eventually spending all our time together. I went to Oklahoma twice to visit him. We spent every waking hour and every sleeping hour together during the times we were physically apart. Seven weeks ago, he came to Canada. Other than my mental illnesses fucking with me during that time, it was pure bliss. I was so goddamn happy. So secure in his love for me. So in love with him. More positive emotions than I've ever felt in my entire life. He comforted me, counselled me, was always there to talk and to listen. He said the most sweet, romantic, sentimental things I could ever hope to be said to me. For twelve months. We shared an anniversary together on October 13th. I was looking forward to spending Halloween night with him watching a Silent Hill 2 playthrough on YouTube as we had that same night last year. We had a place -- a special location that was ours. We had a song -- Neon Moon. We sang to eachother. We went so many places together and shared so so so many experiences, both on the phone and in real life. We were going to get married, he said. I had an account with my bank titled ""Immigration Application"" and I was saving money for that, despite struggling with rent and car insurance. We always told eachother how precious &amp; perfect we were to one another. We never did an unkind thing to the other, not once. When I was doing poorly with my mental health or my trust issues, he'd shake me and look me in the eyes with the most sincere expression on his face and say ""I'd never lie to you. I love you. You are the one I want to spend my life with."" He told me he'd never abuse my trust or hurt me. There were some things I was mildly suspicious about for a moment -- how he'd hide his phone when I came near him, how some of the things he told me would contradict earlier things he'd said. Though I'd never accuse him of lying, I'd ask him a question and he'd hold me by the shoulders and look into my eyes and say those comforting words, and I'd feel better. I trusted him one hundred percent. How could I not? He was perfect. I knew he was my soulmate, my other half. He said the same about me. We had a unique relationship -- something very special, something that would be considered weird by all the normies out there. [edited to remove personal/intimate details]

Then shit hit the fan. Basically, I found out about one thing he had lied about, and then more and more came out. Things he lied about from the beginning. Things he had made up even before we had started talking. See, he fished for someone like me. Everything on his reddit account? All fabricated bullshit designed to endear &amp; entrap a lonely girl like me. He feeds off sympathy and attention, I guess. Always has -- he ended up telling me he'd been doing it for most of his life. He lied about everything about himself. Everything, small and large. I never knew him. I don't even think he knows himself. I was DEVASTATED and still am. Guess I'm just another victim of the catfish scam. But he never wanted money. Sure, he wanted certain material goods and foods, but he never badgered me into it -- he was more about pathetic manipulation. Emotional gratification. Basically anything anyone could ever possibly say to make their life seem sad, he said it. This all feels so surreal to me.

I've come to the conclusion that he was never attracted to me (I'm not a physically attractive person, and there were issues with his ""performance"" that I'm now sure were due to the way I look, though he always told me that he viewed beauty differently than most people do.) I believe he was very attached to me and wanted to be the person he presented to be. I believe he would have actually married me. Why? To get to Canada. To be taken care of and loved. To have his future set up for him. Or maybe because he doesn't really care what happens to him or anybody else. He never intended on coming clean about the lies. He never intended to let me really get to know him. He would have been perfectly fine living a lie forever and taking those secrets to his grave. 

Now I'm left here on this godforsaken planet alone, to deal with the knowledge of this: I am not worthy of attraction or any kind of meaningful relationship. I'm not worthy to be loved or wanted. I wouldn't even be able to deal with the thought of that ever happening for me. I don't know how I'll ever trust another person again. 

I know he's sick. Pathological liar: It's just another facet to his mental illness. I can't really fault him, can I? But at the same time, I do fault him, because he's an intelligent person who was aware of what he was doing all along. Is it rational to mourn the loss of a person who never even really existed? He wasn't real. Why should I be so heartbroken? 

I'll never find a person like him again, because people like him don't exist. He'd always tell me ""I know I seem too good to be true, but I'm the real deal."" But of course, he was too good to be true.

I've been sitting in my car chainsmoking for three days. My throat hurts. My eyes hurt. I haven't eaten or slept much. I can't bring myself to go to the bathroom because that's one of the places where we bonded. Anywhere I could drive around here is somewhere we've been together. To say it hurts would be the understatement of a lifetime. 

God, I miss him. I miss his face. I miss the way he looked at me. I miss kissing him. I miss holding his dick. I miss touching his hair. I miss his smell. I miss him. 

Where am I to go from here? I have no clue. I'm a lost puppie.

4376,springtimestrawberry,1654505943,1,"1. Religious upbringing and trauma.
Many of my family and friends would swoon at my use of profanity in the title. You see folks, I grew up conservative Mennonite. What is that, you ask? It's sorta like Amish-lite. A subset of Christianity that is extremely rooted in tradition and rules.  No television, homemade dresses and headcoverings for women, limited choices for what music you're allowed to listen to, books, movies, etc. Super strict gender roles, spanking of children.... All of this is basically the tip of the iceberg.
For much of my life I was trying to make it work. Having been brainwashed that I basically had to be a good Mennonite to be a good person, I would squash myself into the box of who I was supposed to be in order to please everyone else. It wasn't until last summer that I decided that I needed to get out of the situation. 

2. Family issues
 Telling my family about this decison was hard because my family was already going through a whole bunch of crap. My mom is in such a weird place mentally. She has a whole bunch of narcissistic tendencies and the polarization around covid really did a number on her. Of course it affects my siblings, and it especially affects my dad. My dad has sometimes in the past even used me as a confidant as he's having a hard time and doesn't really have very many friends to talk to. But it feels really toxic.
 
3. Depression and anxiety
Like many in this new and beautiful generation, I have stumbled across the wonders of depression and anxiety. My first bouts of depression started a few years ago, after I had three grandparents die in the span of two weeks. And it's stuck to me since. School didn't help either.

4. Failure
  Not only did I start college late (because most Mennonites don't even go to college) but I'm an absolute failure and couldn't hack it. Part of it was because my college was sort of Mennonite and as I came to the conclusion that I no longer was Mennonite, it felt like a super bad fit. But also my anxiety and depression took over and I was unable to do school and this past semester I ended up having to take medical leave. So then, I had to leave the city that I had finally gotten to and go back to rot in the small town in the absolute middle of nowhere where my parents live. So now I'm 24 and don't even nearly have a degree. Stupid failure.
  
5. Fomo
Meanwhile, it feels like my only friends that didn't get married at 20 are always off having great adventures. I've never been off the continent and they've all been to the wild reaches of unknown places and territories and I'm stuck. 

6.  I'm broke
I can't afford to go travel and have fun times. I can't afford to buy the things I like. I can't afford to be independent from my parents. Which is pathetic.

7. Lack of friends
I'm an extrovert and I gain an energy and hope from being around others. But others don't want to be around me so often it feels like. And my family growing up, I was often given the message that I was too annoying or that I dominated conversations too much.  And maybe that's why I have had trouble with friendships my entire life. People have been friends with me and then just decided they weren't friends anymore, sometimes my friendships have died because we couldn't keep up long distance, sometimes my friends are just too busy to give me the time of day. But either way I end up spending most of my time alone.

8. Loneliness
 Not only do I struggle with friendships, but I struggle even harder with romantic relationships. Part of this also has to do with my Mennonite background. Mennonite boys don't like opinionated chubby chicks... That's just the long and short of it. And since people get married at 19, the fact that I had never ever gotten asked out by 23 has always felt like it was a reflection on my self-worth. 
 Since spending some time in the city while at college, I found out that I'm not horribly unattractive to some people. However, even though those people don't really want to give me any love or spend time with me. They really just want to fuck me. Which honestly doesn't help with the loneliness. 

9. Lack of hope
 It's really hard for me to feel hopeful. I can't imagine life where I'm happy. Or sometimes I can imagine that happy life but I can't imagine any way for me to get there so I feel stuck. I feel really tempted to just give myself up to alcoholism or drug abuse or sex addiction (I feel a pull for all of those things, and I'm pretty sure I have a pretty addictive personality) 
 
10. Me
 Isn't it clear? I'm pathetic. I'm clearly not worth people's time and energy. I'm not worthy of  love. I'm too stupid for school. I'm not worthy of prospering or of having things that make me happy. 
 Obviously, I know those things are untrue. But they feel so true deep in my core. And it's so hard to counteract those when everything around me screams to me that I'm worthless.",lonely,10 reasons why life's a bitch right now,2022-06-06 18:59:03

4380,fuckthisshitimout83,1654504445,1,"I’m a highly visual thinker, so when the term ‘dead to me’ entered my mind when I was young it conjured a very specific image influenced on the word ‘dead’ because I didn’t know what the phrase meant. Obviously I haven’t been keeping track of my mental image associations of words, but as I get the image in my mind now it feels indistinguishably familiar - as if it’s been with me forever: a clip-art style headless and appendage-less body with black in place of the missing parts. 

I could certainly guess what the phrase meant, but I didn’t know how it would feel to be metaphorically dead to a person and I never thought I was going to find out. But as a write this now, recently, in the most vulnerable time of my life for personal reasons, I’ve had 2 separate people get way too comfortable narcissistically rambling about their personal lives on a regular basis, me doing nothing but receiving it with attentive ears, and them getting cold when I desire them to turn this one sided draining relationship into something fair to me: a reciprocated friendship. I left them because the circumstance was so toxic, and I feel dead to them. I know so much about both of their lives from their rambling it’s appalling that I feel this way. I never thought I was going to feel this way, and I’m in a position in life that feels if I don’t make up for the friendship I thought I could have with either of those people soon, things are going to be hopeless and grim real quick.",lonely,When I was younger I didn’t expect this to happen to me,2022-06-06 18:34:05

It's just that since my friend circle ain't that big (mostly cause of almost everyone in my classes is kinda socially awkward AKA introverted), and since half of my friends be travelin to they home countries fo summer, and the other half being in my home country (I moved), I can't really imagine how boring my summer will be this year. 

Since there's a bigass time difference between the US (where I live at) and Armenia (my home country and where 95 percent of my friends are at), I'm finna need to talk to em at night-time, which is kinda OK but still ain't really it.

My 2 bros are babies and my parents are workin most of the time so the fam is no option.

Can't really go to parties and shit like that cause as I said, ma parents are workin, and I can't drive a car to go by myself cause of my blindness.

4429,erikbadua,1654484151,1,"I'm a 26 year old closeted gay guy. However, being in the closet was the least of all my problems in life. I've had a lot of issues with my relationships — parents, sibling, friends, and colleagues — and with my self. It is a *me* issue. Most of my issues, just like any ordinary individual, were sown and nurtured by my upbringing and my environment. My life wasn't exactly the ideal life I would have wished for myself. In reality, no one really gets their ideal life, right? And, I accept that. A lot of times, it was my expectations that fuck me up.

Maybe, I just had a lot of hopes when I was a kid that everything would get better. That by working hard and persevering I would get the kind of life that I want for myself. I did what I was asked to do, I did what I thought I was supposed to do. I had a lot of achievements in school, at work. I thought my family was okay. I thought I had a lot of friends. I thought the man I love wasn't going to leave me. I thought I was okay.

Well, I was not. I haven't been okay for some time now. The pandemic was the catalyst of everything in my life falling part. Maybe, my life had been falling apart before the pandemic and I wasn't just aware. But I feel like I lost the life I was living before the pandemic. 

I went back home to stay with my family during the lockdown 2 years ago. My office job turned into a work-at-home set-up. My boyfriend of 3 years ghosted me and left me through a message (we used to live together). I resigned from my job because I was overworked, not properly compensated, and not to mention that my ex-boyfriend was a colleague. No friends check up on me and I realized that I seem to have no real friends at all. And my family turned out to be not a source of comfort, but of anxiety and insecurity. 

I seem to have lost all the hope I had when I was a kid. All of it just became unmet expectations and just plain failures. Back then, I was a confident achiever surrounded by people. Now I'm living like a hermit, unemployed living with his parents and sibling, no motivation or prospect. My savings are slowly dwindling down and I still haven't fixed my resumé. 

Nothing makes me feel better. I just feel traumatized and imprisoned, otherwise dead inside. I know the things that happened certainly weren't the worse that could happen to a person, and they weren't an excuse to throw my life into a shithole by procrastination and self-sabotage. All I know at this very moment is that it's not going to get better soon enough, and I fear it's going to get worse.",lonely,Life isn't going to get better,2022-06-06 12:55:51
4430,InfininityLegend,1654483547,1,"Today I graduated high school and I really wanted to hangout with friends afterwards, but all of them told me they were either with their families or busy. And of all the people I asked there is no way one person, one person couldn't spend time with me. Now I have some friends, but most of them are not close. And I feel like I am not even close to being anyone's favorite person or anything similar.

Part of this is my fault as I never was very extroverted, and during quarantine, I didn't really socialize with anyone in real life as I spent all of my free time playing video games. And recently between school    work and sports, it is a hard to find time to hangout with people. But it is not impossible by any measures. Even people I do my sport with I am not very close to them, as they will choose other people over me in a heartbeat. And people from school, will do the same. In fact they will openly talk about do stuff together(often on Friday/Saturday nights) in front of me, and never bother to ask if I would join.

Recently I have gone to a couple graduation party's, but it was either a quick stop and go, or I just kind of lingered in the back. And I really did try to get out of my shell and talk to people, but its really hard when they talk about things you cant relate about.

I as well have one close friend, but we are not at the point of talking about anything super deep. And plus they are moving to a town about three hours away in the fall, so that makes it a little hard sometimes.

Even with family it can be hard as I am not really super close with anyone, as a lot of the people my age don't live close to me, and the one person who is my age, just doesn't really talk with people or open up about anything. I as well do not have the best relationship with my parents, and it is getting better, but I would never be comfortable telling them about how I feel, and my relationships with other people my age.

All of my close friendships I had in elementary or middle school, all started to fade away as I went into high school, and the pandemic did not help at all.

And I know other people have it worse, but It still doesn't ease the pain, I have been feeling like this ever since the U.S. has gone on shutdown since March of 2020.

It is so painful to feel so alone especially on a day that is meant to be so happy and so great.

4437,xsyddhi,1654480664,1,"The title basically sums it up. 

Has anyone else been so undeniably lonely the past few years that you now feel like you could survive without anyone by your side? I'm not talking about physical loneliness, more so with being surrounded by tons of people and still feeling alone. For the majority of my adolescence, I've come to realize that I've felt a certain drift between my personal life and those around me. No matter how much I shared, how much of ourselves both of us gave to each other -- something at the back of my mind always told me that no one understood me as much as I understood them (except 1 person and that is my best friend to date). It's a very weird and a very painfully isolating feeling to experience and I honestly would never wish it on anyone. A Disconnect with the world is awful. 

But as I grow older, I've come to realize, and maybe even find comfort in the fact that if I were to be ***this*** lonely and disconnected for the rest of my life, I wouldn't mind. Yes, I'm suffering, and yes it's incredibly hard to meet new people without feeling like I'm wasting my time, but I suppose it's still better than yearning for a companionship you'll never have and setting yourself up for failure. Life is very dull when you're alone, and that is the truth, but every time I meet new people and get disappointed, I come to realize why I stick to myself.

I guess this is a very pessimistic way to look at life and loneliness too, but I can't help it anymore. Any advice, stories, tips, etc. would be very nice to read :)",lonely,I'm so lonely I feel like I'll never need anyone ever again.,2022-06-06 11:57:44

Like now that I just understand that there’s no one out there for me and there won’t be a sexual/romantic partner for me it sort of feels rather liberating. Instead of sitting there basking in my loneliness wishing that I had someone to hold or to love I can now just sit there and realize that this is how the rest of my life will be-and I’m okay with that. I’m okay with being on my own forever, and I might not have kids or a wife that I love, but I can still love what I do and my friends you know. But with this decision to come to terms with my own I definitely loneliness im realizing that I should no longer even think about trying for another partner - these actions only lead to further pain, hurt, and rejection and there is no reason to ever put myself out there again. No need for tinder, going out, or any of that type of stuff. Solace in my work and my friends is all I should ever consider, as I am unfit for any potential romantic partner. Sure, understanding that no one will touch me lovingly or erotically is a tough pill to swallow, but through past experiences and rejections, I now understand that this area of human emotions is just not for me. Love is something that not everyone can ever find - it’s why you see such a high divorce rate across the globe as people leave the “conformity” age of the 60’s. Love is not for everyone - and it isn’t for me. Complete social-sexual rejection from society can have some detrimental consequences on social animals like us humans, but if we can learn to change our mentality and understand that there will never be a partner, one can learn to negate a lot of the mental stresses of loneliness. It’s sort of like losing a limb, the realization that you will never be able to move that arm is horrific and painful, but as one continues to live they can learn to appreciate their own uniqueness, even if they are technically less fit and competent of a person. This is why I choose a comfortable lifetime of loneliness. Sure, I will be left with staggering amounts of free time as others find their partners, but I can utilize this free time to do something else productive. Some might argue that dying alone on your deathbed is the one thing in life they hope to avoid, however I like to think of it as my inevitable end, and not a bad one at that. You went through life living for no one but yourself, and as you reach the end, people might not miss you, but you at least left a mark that will stain the earth until it is inevitably eroded away with the infinite passage of time.",lonely,Coming to terms with a lifetime of loneliness,2022-06-06 11:29:26

He still remained my friend and best cheerleader.  I even dated someone new, S, for about 1.5 years.  R and I are both in the healthcare field, and I got into PA school 6 hours from home.  It was and is a very lonely time.  My ""new"" relationship ended due to me moving away (ironic).   I had some very rough times in school, and he helped me continue by periodic phone calls.

By chance, R and I reconnected as we both happened to be in Chicago at the same time.  I hadn't seen him in so long.  I instantly felt how I used to.  We were intimate, and falling asleep with my head on his chest was like a dream.

I just visited him in his state for a week, and it was mostly wonderful.  However, half way through he got weird and basically said I am not interested in dating you, we should not have sex, etc etc.  But he was still holding my hand and kissing me.

Long story short, I had to go back to this town of 8,000 in the middle of fucking nowhere, with no friends or family, and I am only halfway done with school.  I don't even know what to do when I graduate.  R feels like home to me, and I truly feel the last time I felt true happiness and joy was when we lived together.

I just can’t help but feel like if I disappeared literally no one would even notice. I’m so unbearably lonely, I don’t know how you’re supposed to go and meet people in your mid 20’s. Sometimes I go days without speaking to literally anybody and I just feel like I’m wasting the best years of my life. As much as I don’t want to be dependant on my boyfriend, every time I’m alone for a long period of time (which is often) the sadness kicks in that I don’t have anybody to see or speak to. If it wasn’t for him I genuinely don’t think I’d be alive. I just don’t know what the point is anymore",lonely,Feel like I could disappear and no one would notice,2022-06-06 10:29:27

I think having an animal friend even if it's a pigeon can be more than enough. If you accept yourself as you are and continue to work on self improvement it's a good start. Tesla already knew he was different from others, and as lonewolf as he was, he was still very comfortable under his own skin.

&gt;[His money long gone, Tesla spent his later years moving from place to place, leaving behind unpaid bills. Eventually, he settled in at a New York hotel, where his rent was paid by Westinghouse. Always living alone, he frequented the local park, where he was regularly seen feeding and tending to the pigeons, with which he claimed to share a special affinity. On the morning of Jan. 7, 1943, he was found dead in his room by a hotel maid at age 86.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/extraordinary-life-nikola-tesla-180967758/)

My parents have always cared for me but they were always emotionally lacking. Their marriage was never great and most of the time projected on to me and my sister. I grew up in different parts of the world and every country I’ve been to I’ve always felt like an outcast. I’ve been in the US for about 15 years now and I still have this feeling of never fitting in. Don’t get me wrong, I’m overall personable and don’t have a hard time making friends but I have never met anyone that fully understands me. 

I’ve been in a few relationships and most of them ended with them cheating on me. My most recent relationship ended because she just never cared for me and only used me as her emotional crutch. Ever since then I’ve had a hard time getting close to women even in friendships.

In these past few weeks I’ve felt overwhelming loneliness and I am ready to end it all. Only reason I can’t do it is because I know it would ruin my parents and my sisters life. I can’t do that to them considering how much they have done for me.

Ever since I can remember I've always been respectful and polite. From a young age. And I only thank my mother for raising me how she has. I'll be forever in debt to her.

But over the years of having no friends and especially never having had a relationship. Is that I have respect for women. Excellent. That should be the bare minimum but unfortunately the world as it is today it is very below standard for what is common decency. (you know exactly what sort of things I refer to)

Maybe the online world and hearing generally about the treatment of women, sure men too, has just taught me very young to just be overly respectful. And that's not me trying to sound amazing or some crap. I'm just saying how I feel. 

I fear I have so much respect for women that I wouldn't even be able to approach one. (I've never had a date or anything just FYI if you couldn't guess already haha) like I feel like despite feeling I have really down to earth qualities and feeling good about my appearance, I just would worry about wasting their time, or looking like I'm trying to desperately hit on them (which I'd never do) or even just be flat out annoying them. 

It honestly fucking kills me having no social life and not even a contact. Like my 2 contacts in my phone, are mum, my manager from work who's on maternity. Neither of which I text of course ( still live at home so) 

I feel like, the 2 only influencial people in my life being my mum and late grandmother. Raised me. I never had a dad (he is a total ass) my uncle also in the end was an ass hole, and my mums only bf was a narcissistic person who has now scarred my mum mentally and she is still struggling even a few years on. 

I get even more saddened when I see people posting they've been left heartbroken bc of a fling or manipulation etc. And that shouldn't bug me but it really nails my lonliness in the coffin. I see it always on 'hot posts' or 'best posts' 

I'm honestly not sure how much longer I can go on without friends. It's been 7 years since I had friends and I'm gonna be 25 this year. Never had a partner is a bitter pill but I feel my qualities are good so it's a harsh life in that regard. 

I'm gonna be honest idk where this post is heading now as its an essay... I sincerely apologise. If nobody reacts to this I'll probably have just wasted my time so I apologise if you've read all this. 

I don't drink so I can't head to a club and try to meet people, I gym alot but other gym goers will know people don't wanna chat they wanna get their head down and smash their work pit (me included) 

I'm stuck. I'm in this rut for as I say many years. Sure a partner isn't gonna fix the world but that or a friendship would honestly be the world to me.

I guess I just wished I had an outlet or something. I ask him to take the baby when he gets home and he is on daddy duty for an hour at best... but when his friends call he is out the door gone for hours.

We’ve only visited her a few times in the relatively short while that she’s been there, and it seemed that she was doing fine. But today she just crying and saying how lonely she was.

She kept calling her husband (my grandpa) “dad” because he had been the one to take care of her, so she associates him with her dad. She kept saying that she wanted to go home, and I just had to stand there and tell her that she is home.

What hurts the most is that I can’t do anything about it. The people at the home as far as I know don’t treat her horribly, it’s just her mind is so far gone. It’s really the only option for her, but it hurts so much to just sit and watch her die slowly in that place. Alone.

I’ve lived here about 4 or 5 years now. I’ve had friends I guess I began to realize weren’t really interested in me as a friend. I asked to hang out and made every initial social interaction. So one day I stopped just to see if any one would reach out. If anyone would say hello. How are you. Anything. Nothing came.

Lost my girlfriend during pandemic. We weren’t compatible so it was for the best but it didn’t help that feeling of not feeling wanted and alone.

Since the pandemic I’ve been in therapy weekly. Trying to focus on building my life. Make good financial choices. Do some solo traveling past two years. I’ve done some dating but it has done nothing but made me sadder. By third date they either don’t answer or say they aren’t interested and wish me the best.

I’m over 6’. 32 years old in the best shape of my life. Constantly told I’m attractive guy with a great 6 figure income.

By every metric I people would assume I’m happy but no one knows how alone I am and being on my alone no texts or calls, not even from my family unless I initiate has broken me.

I’ve grown to understand this isn’t the life I want for myself. I want a life with companionship. A wife. Children.

I wake up every morning and get ready for gym, go to therapy, work, etc. and wonder what is the point of any of this? 

I don’t want to gripe too much but as a man I don’t really have a lotta people who care to listen to me complain about my feelings unless I pay them (my therapist). I’m well aware a lot of people have it worse than me.

Writing my first post here. I want to hear different opinions, helps me a lot.
While I am writing this, I am sitting stoned on a chair next to a basketball court, my favorite sport. All by myself and thinking after a talk with my father about my life. 

I am a student abroad and ever since then my life is ups and downs. My study fortunately is going well, but I can’t take it anymore.

I feel like all the people around me want to be the way they think it should be appropriate for my age. I am 21 years old and I don’t have really close friends here or a partner. The sad thing is that when I go back to my hometown to see my family (as a child most of my family hated me, and still don’t know the reason today, and yes I have a quite big family) and friends they all behave so different (I know my friends for 10 years). They all look at me like a hopeless sad man. Which my dad indirectly confirmed it today…
I am still crying and find it difficult to react to this. The idea is that my friends see me as a dumb person sincer I don’t have a partner since last year. I had a bad breakup here which totally changed my mentality, being more mature. Ever since then, we had a few holidays together where they tend to ignore me and not have fun or express themselves around me. This is eating my thoughts and who I am. And to you people reading this, do you think I deserve this? Because I am alone? As a background I am a very kind person who is always smiling and helpful. I am always there for a lot of people even though I know them for a short time. That’s just who I am, I don’t express hatred or anything like this and everything that I get are gossips about how foolish I am and dumb in every possible way. I don’t understand why everyone is looking at me with such eyes, it just kills me every time. I know I should not complain since there are people that suffer even worse than I do, but if a problem affects you that much, it represents something for you. I just cried my eyes a lot today and my hear hurts so bad, like it never did. Honestly I feel totally lost.

He was so caring and gentle and kind to me both emotionally and physically. He told me to stay over because it was so late, so I did. We barely slept, just spent the whole night together talking and existing. In the moment I felt so content and happy because the way we acted was so domestic and fulfilling

I've never been in a relationship, and my hook ups have always been clinical compared to this. So waking up in the morning in someone's arms broke something inside. I secretly hoped he wouldn't wake up so I could stay there forever. When I left we vaguely agreed to meet again, but I know the chances are slim. 

This guy gave me something I craved so deeply and now I am so aware of the fact that we will likely never meet again. I feel like a teenager waiting for a text. Every time my phone buzzes I hope it's him. And the thing is, I'm almost certain he won't text back

I don't know if it's because i'm lonely, or no man has ever been so kind, but I feel like this guy just destroyed me emotionally.

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety.

Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them. 

You can find the Zoom link here:

4549,Demiurgeinapte,1654439180,1,"I'm struggling with this question for a while now. why can't we be happy in our relationship/friendship. I feel like human can't just stick to simple things such as chosing someone genuinely for who they are and then working on it everyday and enjoying life.

I feel like we put a lot of strategies, we build some lies, we give up when there's an obstacle.

It's like it's cannot be simple when it can be. 

I've always been considered as ""attractive"", ""intelligent"" and so a lot of people tried to flirt etc.. But I've always been single for my whole life because I feel like it's not real. They are superficial, they want something and tomorrow they'll want an other thing.

And for once in my life I opened up to someone. It was real and prefect. He was so invested, expressing how much he was happy with me and how I was the first woman that he felt he always knew, and how I was so surprising. And then there's an obstacle : his job is taking him a lot of time because he had a sort of promotion and he has to move in an other town. I was so happy for him, and supported him, telling him how I was proud.

Suddenly the relationship, the bond we had is like non existent and I feel that he gave up. And to me it makes no sense. When you like/love someone you fight a little bit, when you have that sort of happiness that is hard to find you dont throw it away so easily. I can tell twice in my life men looked at me that way and acted in a way you know they are in love and can't control their feelings no more. But it doesn't matter, even this doesn't stop them from giving up.

It's the exact reason why I've been so closed to relationships, people aren't constant. And I don't understand it, like for real I don't. I feel like simple love doesn't exist. Nobody want to fight a little, they just tell themselves let's move on, let's try what's next. It's consumerism at it's best.",lonely,why can't we be happy? why human has to make love complicated?,2022-06-06 00:26:20

Currently in freshman year of college and had regrets be brought back up due to old email scrolling, wanted to get them off my chest.

If you can please don’t judge me. But if you do I get it. But know now, that college has really helped me to grow up and mature. I know I have made so much progress in this past year.

First regret, was emotionally and verbally abusive to my ex as a teenager. Honestly probably the only person I have honestly liked. Said person, was the only time I ever remember having genuine, death do us part, unconditional support and love from someone. And I fucked that up big time.

Second regret, enlisted in the marines corps straight out of hs graduation because I was depressed and hoping to have an honorable way to die. Hid that and horrible indigestion from my recruiter. Issues from my recruiter which would have dqued me if I was honest with him . Ended up breaking in bt so that didn’t end up happening. So I got discharged with an entry level. 


Third regret, not cutting ties with parts of my family sooner. As I have been in chats with my therapist about my upbringing as a kid. Realize a lot of my family members aren’t fit to raise or support children. Biggest of all was my mother and father who were abusive to me physically and mentally.

Fourth regret, not going to therapy as a pre-teen. Looking back I was a creep in middle and high school. Literally everyone expect my parents knew I needed therapy as a kid. And they didn’t even try to get me help.

I could have devolved healthily, had a decent self- image, nor made so many poor decisions. If the people that held the power over me as a kid used it reasonably like adults do as a parents",lonely,Regrets,2022-06-05 18:51:03

anyways, off that tangent, its just the most frustrating thing to know you likely wont ever be able to experience something. and i dont mean something rare like winning 100 million dollars through the lottery, i mean something that the majority of people experience, and brag about, and flaunt. something you cant go anywhere without seeing and being reminded of. reminded that they're better than you and you're unloved, unfuckable scum (supposedly)

I have one friend here who I live with but he works 80+ hours a week so we don't hangout very often and when we do he's usually tired from work and just wants to stay home. I work from home so I don't get out much. 

I googled ""how to make friends in a small town"" but none of the suggestions on wikihow are possible for me. This town does not have much to offer. There are no organizations for me to volunteer at, no classes for adults i could take, no gym to join, not even a community center.

I have pretty intense social anxiety so I can't exactly strike up a conversation at the grocery store. My therapist suggested i try Bumble BFF but it said there were no people available in my area. At this point I am out of ideas. 

I've considered getting a dog just to get me out of the house. An off leash dog park is one of the few perks this town has. But I'm not sure if that's a good idea because I'm pretty bad at taking care of myself so how could I take care of another living creature, you know?

4585,Dont-Lick-the-Cat,1654413493,1,"I’m not really looking for advice so much. Mostly just here for a long overdue venting sesh of never-ending situational/self over-analyzation.

Three years this month I left an abusive relationship of 20 years, which I am truly grateful for. 🙌🏽❤️🙏🏽

Being a Social Butterfly most of my adult life, the overall nature of that relationship left me a socially exhausted, borderline-alcoholic by the time it was all said and done.

Needless to say, the last 3 years spent sans socialization was well needed, but now I’m starting to think this self-seclusion has become far more alone time than what I really needed or what one would consider healthy. I’ve become this unfamiliar kind of Hermit and have no clue how to go about releasing myself back into the World. 

Ten years ago, we moved 1000+ miles away from closest friends and family. I’m No Contact with the ex and all the socially toxic behavior he previously brought into my life. So, now it’s just me and the Crotch Goblins. 😈 ❤️

I absolutely love it here and have no plans moving closer to “home”, and I’d easily guesstimate that AT LEAST 75-80% of those I’ve met here over the last decade are also “transplants” from other states. Socially speaking, the populous here is a little different than what I’ve always been used to.

It seems as if everyone moved here to get away from their own life’s B.S. Now they are here living their lives,  trying to do as little “peopling” as possible…much like we initially tried to do.

Being an adult tying to make new friends is hard enough as it is, but it’s even harder when almost EVERYONE around you, from neighbors, to co-workers, and casual acquaintances have zero interest in developing new friendships of any kind. It’s safe to say that the general population here is cool for the most part, but they are anything BUT inviting. So, it goes without saying I have ZERO friends or trustworthy companions to hang out with.

I don’t necessarily feel lonely or depressed, but in the very back of my brain, thoughts of returning to some sort of “normal” behavior has been nagging at me more and more. 
…and at 14 &amp; 18 years of age, I’m also starting to feel like the kiddeaux’s would like for me to stop being so obnoxiously erratic and find a way to mentally/emotionally work off some of this pent up “energy”.🥴🫣😹

~Which leads me to the second installment of a long overdue venting episode.~

When thinking about THE VERY ONE adult thing I miss more than anything else…?

The first thing that ALWAYS comes to mind that I miss the most, is being able to go out and listen to live music. 🎶 ❤️

I’ve taken the kids to a few really great shows this last year. Bands they’ve heard in the background of their lives since birth. Always an amazingly-awesome experience for all of us, but it isn’t quite the same as sitting in some dive bar or small venue with a friend or SO, drinking a beer and enjoy listening to some great music. It’s always been one of my favorite things to do and miss going out very much. ❤️❤️❤️

…but as a single female, going solo to a bar is…well…

ONE: Not very fun, relaxing, or enjoyable in any capacity, mostly due to the fact that any solo guy that notices you are alone will immediately try to buy you a drink and start an unwarranted conversation that I have zero interest in being a part of. No matter how clear I try to make it to them that I’m not interested in hanging out or chatting it up with them, they never want to take the hint and understand that I just want to hang out and listen to the music mostly unbothered. Despite my obvious disinterest, they still (typically) continue annoying the ever living F’k out of me until I’m short of becoming a straight up bitch towards them, but instead find I’m better off just going home. 😒😔

…and 

TWO: It’s also just not very safe or smart for a single chick to be hanging out in a bar drinking solo in a large metro area, and I feel that OLD apps are not a conducive solution.

However, I remain hopeful because I know at some point something will eventually give as it always does. 
Sooo…for now, I just vent here to those willing share in my pain.🫤😹😶😭

I don’t know what to do, I can’t live like this anymore. The loneliness is killing me. Has killed me. I live since 4 years in Berlin and I have zero people to meet. My biggest wish when I go to sleep is that I don’t wake up anymore or when I wake up my first thought is, not another day again… I am actually a very nice, funny and lovable guy, but my life situation is not allowing me to be like this anymore. If you would see me and my look or how I act on my workplace, you would never believe I am that much down or that I don’t have anyone. I changed a lot in last years since i live in total isolation. Even my coworkers say this, I barely make fun and jokes anymore for which I was known the most and people liked me. Now I only go to work or to gym, because I have no more friends or anyone with which I could socialize (coworkers have all familys or different lifestyle). I am 35 btw. I am having a great job which I love and I earn good money, but beside of that, there is nothing positive in my life anymore. I have now money and freedom to do almost anything I would want (travel), but i can do less then the most broke person, because I have no-one to go with. Before corona I had a few people, but since 2 years I haven’t meet any person. The isolation has totally killed me inside. I was the biggest, most passionate music guy, now I don’t find even my favourite tracks from the past enjoyable. If somebody would tell me 2 years ago I would not enjoy some of my favourite tracks in the future I would have bet all the money I have with him that this can’t happen to me. It all feels so empty and hopeless, when you know there is no future for you. Now I don’t feel worthy anymore to meet other people, who had in those time much more from life than me. They went to another level in this time, had so much fun, normal stuff they did, sex then me. But I also don’t want to meet with other people who are in same situation. I had a few chances to meet with a few people from my country who live here in last time, but I canceled the meeting on last day a few times, because I didn’t feel I am on the same level as them, since they have a normal social life and went clubbing regularly (women).

I am living in such a great city, but I have no benefits from it, I haven’t explore and saw almost nothing from the city yet. There so much things I would like to do, from riding a bike with some friend, driving a gokart or travelling to Thailand or any other beautiful beach. All the things I would like to do, I can’t do because I don’t have people for it and I don’t wanna do it alone, because it makes me feel even more weird.

When I was 20, my ex-boyfriend proposed to me. In the end, I decided to attend university. I thought that I was far too young and far too ambitious for marriage. All I saw was my dream to travel the world and harness more knowledge of it. I got my wish. After being accepted to university in England, he left me. I'll be graduating with a biochemistry degree in 2023.

I'm now filled with remorse. Today, I saw a young family take a photo together in a café. It struck me. I crave that. How I wish to spend my life adoring someone. And as a result of our love, to have created a tiny human. It's pitiful, but I'm desperate for it. Desperate for something I let slip through my fingers. I'm such an idiot.

4603,pickedmyname2020,1654406347,1,"Where to start. About 7 years ago I was entering a relationship I was convinced was my life's great love. For the sake of brevity, I will just say that it was not to be - it ended in spectacularly awful pain and sadness and blame and guilt and shame - most of it resulting from what I only recently realise was a sexual assault on me and not a foolish decision I made. We had an open relationship and I contracted HIV from a hookup, which I then passed on to my partner.

After trying our best, it didn't work. I couldn't hear what he needed from me through the pain of my guilt, shame, fear, self loathing and isolation (we didn't tell anyone while we were togethet).

Flash forward a year and I'm deep in drug addiction, chaos, high functioning but met an inevitable crash. I overdosed, intentionally, and thankgully survived it.

But since then... I haven't been the me I like. The me I respect, admire, care for, love. I've had various happy periods, but my overall sense of self chipped away. I got sober, and that sparked a period of real progress. But for the last year, I've felt increasingly like all of the therapy I'm doing, all of the reframing my life to see where my behaviours come from... Is for nothing. Years of therapy later anf I still can't stand to look at myself and I don't have the strength to feel the deep pain and work through it. 

As a result, I've slowly, subtly, isolated myself from my friends, family and colleagues. I find reasons not to get past a 3rd or 4th date for fear of ruining that person's life. Ive passed on so may invitstions they don't really come anymore. I spend days on end by myself - I see feiends, call them, but I'm no longer anyone's ""go to"" person. I've slowly pulled myself out of the threads of their fabrics.

I'm not hopeless. I know I can work on this. But it felt important right now to finally write down that I am deeply, desperately lonely.

I comment, I reach out and say hello on occasion. I'm never anything but polite, but I struggle to connect with anyone.

I'm 38M, so perhaps people just don't want to talk to an old person like myself. I'm really just looking for people to talk to about anything to get my mind off the negative feelings floating in my head.

Life lately has felt like I'm losing my way, at work and in general. I have felt spent up and definitely alone even when people are around.

I used to find it almost effortless to connect with people, but these days I might as well shout at a wall. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this and need to find a better way to connect somewhere, somehow.

I don't want to say anything, and I am sure there will be a lot of hate comments below or downvotes here. In fact, there is nothing for lonely people. I still remember I saw a student in 2 grade who lost his mother, and the teacher hated him because he didn't do homework. No one cares about him. Everyone said I was a bad person because I didn't have parents and I didn't work hard in school because I was so loneeeely. After I tried to find my parents, they just left. I tried to join the club, and they just told me they didn't like me because I was so lonely. In the discord, I did one thing. I tried to ask women to talk, and they started to invest it. After a few arguments, they said I was trying to spread misinformation. They told me to stop it, and I told them to ban me if they think a man asking a woman to talk is a creep. If a woman asks a man to talk, the story must be different. In the end, why not just stop downvoting this post and leave me alone. 

Life is so loneeely like the one who didn't have parents. The teacher in school just love the hardworking and smart students and didn't even like those ones who didn't have parents. And the discord will never understand people. I am tired of those dating apps. The people who talk to you are the one who wants to hook up. 

I just got my degree last month. I didn't have friends or family. It was only me. No clipping. Everyone said a successful man is a man with a lot of friends. 

Just leave me alone and don't say any bad thing to me at the end. It is fine to ban me here too. 

Don't downvote this post. It is fine don't leave any comments. I am going to leave that discord that is not for man or understand man's pain.",lonely,"I finally got banned from the discord because a lonely woman ask man for talk? No, it was opposite!",2022-06-05 14:32:14

4614,moriati18,1654403077,2,"i'm 26 years old, and i feel increasingly anxious that my time is running out and i will never get to have a happy and satisfying relationship that doesn't end in failure. 

Like, objectively i have a ""great life"", a good job, hobbies i like, great friends and family who love me, i've boyfriends before, so on some level i know i'm not unlovable...but i am truly just exhausted and terrified that i am destined for either complete loneliness or extreme dissatisfaction.

* I've had a total of 4 relationships, and every one has failed for one reason or another— mostly I ended up dumping them because i fall out of love (my longest relationship was 4 years. There was nothing ""objectively wrong"" with that relationship, so i tried to rationalise it and make it work for the better part of a year, but i couldn't lie to myself and him about how i really felt, so i ended it). 
* Most recently, i got dumped for the first time in my life. We only dated for three months, but i liked him and we got along really well. when he dumped me i was angry, disappointed, and deeply exhausted at the thought of trying this shit again with another person.
* The other thing is that the vast majority of people i know have been with their partners for years now already, and they are all moving in, getting married, buying houses and just building a life together. It's making me anxious that all the good people are taken, and that anyone left at this point (myself included) means there's something wrong with them or they're a psycho.
* And the last thing is that since the pandemic, there are just less and less opportunities to meet people in real life, and most people meet on apps nowadays, but i absolutely HATE using dating apps. i'll go through vicious cycles of downloading tinder and then immediately deleting it. i'm worried that ditching the apps completely is just putting the nail in the coffin and REALLY means i will be alone forever.

So basically i'm afraid that i'll never meet anyone again that i like or get along with because of:

a) my hatred of the apps b) pandemic bullshit cancelling any events where i might have met people in real life c) everyone is already in a relationship d) i'll find someone else i like but i'll get dumped again, or e).... that there is really no one out there for me that i will ever be satisfied with, and i will just eventually get bored with anyone who actually wants to be with me and i fall out of love!?!!

i feel like a stupid ungrateful piece of shit and i hate everything right now. i don't know. if anyone has any advice id love to hear it and stop being sad. :(",lonely,Worried I will be alone forever and time is running out (26F),2022-06-05 14:24:37

They told me to go to the toilet room to wash the cooker after we did the food sale for the club. The teacher in the club always cares for the others, except me. They all tell me that everyone doesn't like you because you are so lonely. 

I still remember one of the club members said it loud that he wanted to be friendly to me.

Everyone just wanted to kick me out. Most of the church friends (I don't have a religion) told everyone that they don't want to be friends with me because I was failing the school. But somehow, after I was kicked out of that school and started to live totally lonely. I find out the stress became lesser. Last month, I finished my CS degree. But I am an orphan and no one understands me. 

I still don't understand why people told me that they hate me because I was so lonely. I smiled at them. Washed the cooker. Do all the dirty work. But everyone just used me. One of the club members can not find a job, and the teacher of the club tried to help her. But the teacher of the club really hated me. I think the person who read it must think it is my fault. Maybe there is a reason why people do not like lonely people, and I think we know it or maybe it was my fault. She even told me that don't even get close to them. I tried to change myself and be an outgoing person with friends like anime, so I joined the club. But I later found out that is not the path for me. 

I saw the subreddit for lonely woman that they want men to talk to them. I tried the same way, but I was banned from a lot of places because I am a man. They said this is like treating women like dolls or telling me to go to the strip club. I tried dating apps or chatting apps, but they are all about hooking up, such as Tinder. I am not a person who does not want to play. I am just tired of hook-ups. In fact, I got a woman who said she loved me and even send a love letter to me.

4633,beenkickinsince88,1654396501,1,"34 year old female here! I truly believe I do not have a soul mate… every time when I make a connection, they always  leave . 

For me, and maybe to you as well, the reader, it is hard for me to find a connection to others in this world. 

I am different, like most humans on this planet. I have done well to keep a balanced — hmmm—- yin to my yang so to speak. Every bit of light in me, darkness matches it to full extent. I am extreme, loud, energetic, quiet, lazy and would rather sit in a bath tub and eat cookies over jumping out of an airplane . I am an Aries go getting conquerer with a happy go lucky attitude. Just do not rub my horns the wrong way, I have a hot headed temper to match. I am loving, kind, always willing to help, but I am also reserved, wary of new comers who likes to keep the peace, while smashing your face into the ground. 

I basically have a lot of emotions going on all at one time. All the time. 24/7, 365 days a year. I am one of those wretched people who TRIVE on 5-6 hours of sleep. No more . No less. 

I am a morning person who looooves to stay up late. I raise every. Single. God damming. Morning at 4am, (give or take) and watch the sunrise. Hell, I love staying awake for 24 to 48 hours to greet the sun and then turn around to star gaze at night. 
I have always been this way. I am either all go go go go — or stopped dead. Grey areas are very small for me. It’s either yes or no - rarely a maybe. 
I give great advice, either life, love, friendship, death, different points of views, mediation between friends, problem solver, and able to rally the “troops for war.” Unfortunately For some reason I cannot follow my own advice…., I lead amazingly. Leadership has always came naturally for me, I know to be a great leader sometimes you’ve got to step back and let someone else in front. To always be encouraging, truthful, to be right there for whom ever. 

I will get on the ground and pull a stone weighing a ton with my crew, no questions asked. They are my equal and I am there. No one is above me nor below me. The weakest link is all of us. The strongest is each of us. 
You can never ask someone to do something, you wouldn’t do yourself.  Complements, compassion, and understanding go hand in hand. 

I am a force to be reckoned with. For sure. 

Do not harm. 
But take no shit. 

So throughout my 30+ years of this little old life, it has been hard to find connections such as friends and lovers.  Most people tend to tire of me or I of them. I do not like to be bored when around others, I prefer to be that way by myself in my much needed solitude. Do not disrupt the solitude. 

My longest relationship last almost 9 years. It was a good relationship for the majority of it… but it did end in chaos… we are still friends, but my love as in romantic love died long before our relationship did. Our lives suffered and got held back because we both believe we just needed to wait it out. The only thing that happened was destruction to our souls and happiness. 

He was and still is my dear friend. The one person I could count on until I couldn’t. 

Just like all my friendships. 

He’s moved on, new partner, new friends… 

I have put myself out there, some inquire others shy aWay. 

I can be intimidating, even with a smile on my face.  

I am a lot. 
I am too much for people. 

I am just too much. And it’s led me to a very lonely life. Everyone always seems to leave me behind in the end. They move away, they distance themselves, burry themselves in work to the point they no longer have time… 

I have never been married nor engaged. 
No one, even my almost 9 year relationship, has ever asked me. 

I’ll never get to be a mother due to my biological Time clock is ticking away. 34 isn’t old, but it is not young either. No Middle Ages but we are definitely walking up to that door to give a huge knock on it.  

I cannot just lay with someone, one night stands have never been a favorite. I have always needed meaningful loving connection… so random sex with strangers is not really a logical answer… 

Depression eats me up most nights. My soul is lonely, my heart is scarred… 

I just want someone to love me for me and I love them for them. I have all the passion and love in this world to give … one on wants it. Or they like the idea of me, they just cannot handle all this for very long .

I keep this smile and upbeat attitude slapped on my face but truthfully, I’m alone, and tired of being alone… my depression deepens daily …

I’ve pegged 6 different guys now. They all take some level of convincing but eventually everyone agrees. Watching this big strong man turn into a cute little guy just sprawled out on my bed unable to speak or even think while he takes a strapon he insisted would be too big for him. I live for that shit. 

And I am good. I mean really good. All of them give some silly ultimatum like “oh ok but if you get to peg me then I get to do anal too!” Guess what, nobody has ever wanted to do the anal afterwards. They just get the best orgasm of their life and can barely walk and then they can’t think about anything else and they come right back for more. I’m happy to give it to them too, any time and any place.

Then of course there’s the dude-bros that are like “oh yeah I never do this but you’re just so hot, I wouldn’t be doing this if you weren’t so attractive, it’s only because you’re hot” and it’s like uh huh yeah baby thank you now bend over so you can get rammed! Oh and guess what, they always come back again. And again. And every time they’re all ashamed but I make sure to go extra hard on them. Maybe I’ll fuck the shame right out of them and we can all be adults and admit how great it is.

I’d say I have 3 regulars who ask for it about once a week. I do extra special stuff for those boys because they at least admit they love it. Then there’s 1 that will never ask for it but asks to hang out and then spends the whole time talking about what we did last time until I go get the strap then he becomes a nice obedient little boy and bends over for me. Then of course there’s the other 2. Reluctant to admit how amazing I am but they’ve both had it more than twice now and every time they say “ok cool I’m only doing it cause you’re hot though, I wouldn’t normally do this” but weirdly they just keep coming back. Silly guys. 

One more thing, the moans. Boys moan so beautifully while they’re getting railed and you can tell how good you are by how loud they get. I’ll just be rocking my hips back and forth and suddenly I’m getting these gorgeous moans to let me know I’m hitting the spot. Best sound on earth if you ask me.

4640,what_a_geek_,1654395602,1,"I do want to clarify, I’m not suicidal, just in a really rough spot in my life that I’m working to get through.

I am a 20 year old woman who’s really mentally and emotionally exhausted. I realize that I’ve practically been alone my entire life. It didn’t really occur to me until I turned 20. I have a mom, a dad, and three older brothers. I’ve had a pretty okay relationship with my parents growing up and spent quite a bit of time with them, but I’ve never really felt close to them emotionally and I feel like I have to filter myself a lot around them and I never get to be 100% myself. I’m not close with my three older brothers and I never really was. They’re significantly older than me (4-11 years older than me) and they’ve always had a special bond with each other because they’re “boys” and “brothers” and they’ve always excluded me out of that.

I didn’t really have friends outside of school. When I was in school I always had people to hang out with during school, but I didn’t hang out with them outside of school and I didn’t have any friends outside of school. I spent a lot of time by myself at home. I have to admit, I’m not entirely upset about all of this. All of this loneliness I was surrounded with helped me to develop a great sense of creativity and imagination. I’m still pretty imaginative to this day, I’m always lost in daydreams. Of course, it sucks when you’re 20 years old and you realize you’ve spent most of it daydreaming.

Making friends has always been difficult for me. I’ve always thought I was friends with people and then I’d find out they didn’t like me as much as I liked them. I became fairly depressed in high school. I had some friends in school, but none of them really reached out to me outside of high school except for a few. I was a part of many clubs at my school, but no friends. I cried the night I graduated from high school bc I realized I spent 14 years at that school district and had no friends from it.

I made some pretty good friends outside of high school and it was really cool. We were pretty close bc we were all at home bc of Covid-19 so we all texted and called a lot. Once things began to return to normal, they all stopped texting me except for 2 of them. But recently both of these people basically stabbed me in the back and now I’m completely friendless and have been over 4 months. I’m not close with my family even though I live with most of them so there’s that extra layer of loneliness and isolation. I’m currently in therapy, but that’s just one hour of my week and I’m alone most of the time. It just really fucking sucks some times.",lonely,I’m 20 years old and not okay.,2022-06-05 12:20:02

Her mother told her that is a woman's role and woman's responsibility and told her that she should not be outgoing as a man.  She escaped from that family and married to the son of the general. She finished college. But she throws away all the female gender roles, woman responsibility, and became an outgoing man who read a lot of computer books. When I was 1 or 2, she decided not to take care of me because she wants to be a woman. She ordered my father to cook for her and gave him the order. She really hate my father's mother after my father's mother told her she was messing up the family. When her mother told her that women should not have high school life and marry to an old man, she really thought men created the woman role to destroy the woman. Until I escaped from the place I live because it was too much child abuse and met her when I was 15, she decided to call the police to kick me out because I was so addicted to playing PC games because of the loneliness. My father lost his Job in 2008, and she decided to teach him a lesson by kicking him out of the house and making him sleep on the street. 

She passed away soon after I met her, and I even gave up my education and take care of her body and her shit. That was because she got cancer and slept on the bed. Of course after my father had that lesson from her, he filed a divorce and forced me to return everything she left to me.

I say there is no one, in this subreddit, whose life was even worst than my life. I had an abused childhood. No one helped me. I went to the worst middle school, failed high school, and more.

EVERYONE just hates me when they see my loneliness(students, professors, boss, co-workers). Some even scam me and call me a friend. Some say they remember how men beat women, but I remember how my mother kicked my father out. She was so violent, just like a strong man.

Today, I see a lot of lonely women asking for help, and there must be a few men trying to help them. A female gender role is weak and needs to be protected. But when I was a man try to ask for a woman's help, I really got a lot of banned. They even said I was treating a woman like a doll when I asked for a chat for practicing how to ask woman out.

That I’ll fall out of touch and lose contact with them. Luckily I talk to them almost daily, so I can distract myself from the anxiety. 


But of course, just my luck, Im going on a family vacation for about 3 weeks. I don’t have any way of contacting my friends, so now I’ll be pretty alone for the whole trip. I’ve been away for only a couple days, and I already feel really lonely. I feel so silly over this, it has been 2 days and I practically want to jump off a cliff. I’m not sure how well I will be able to manage over the next few weeks. I feel really guilty as well, some people have no friends at all. I feel like I should be more grateful than I act over this. Don’t get me wrong, Im extremely grateful for my friends and I don’t know what I’d do without them. I’m just really missing them I guess. 



All of this is also fueling my anxiety over my friendships. I’m so worried that when I come home I will have lost my friends. I doubt I will, but it’s hard to tell myself to just stop worrying.

4674,marchrui8,1654383601,1,"Growing up, I came from an immigrant family. My parents did not give a shit about friends, so we had almost no family friends or connections in the neighborhood. It's been two decades and they're still like that. 

I was really isolated as a little kid. I saw other kids having playdates and sleepovers and I never had that. I almost wasn't aware that they had a social life outside of school until I was around 8. Their parents set up playdates and stuff, mine did not. They had sleepovers, I in my life have never had one. 

That carried over into middle school. And at that point I was starting to become more and more painfully aware of how I was at the bottom of the barrel socially. I had school friends, but had zero clue how to hang out with anyone outside of school on weekends. They excluded me, and I was socially clueless once the final bell in middle school ran. I vented to my mom at the time, and she was confused why I cared at all. After all, I was just supposed to be focusing on my studies. 

High school hits. I started to mature a little bit, started to make a few friends outside of school. But socially I was still a loser, I was just in denial about it. The pain numbs to an extent, though. But longer and longer the desire for acceptance that I never had grows. My friends were going out multiple times a week, I went out maybe once every several weeks. Covid hits, and what I had built up socially evaporates. 

Then I go to college. At this point I don't have my parents or situation at home to blame anymore for my social ineptness. Sure, I stupidly chose to be assigned to a bad college house, but the other people in my house still had way better social lives than me. I had become timid, unable to reach out to anyone. Barely went to any parties, did not make any lasting friends outside of a few friends who I was not that close with. Did not rush a frat, even though I so wanted to. And now my prospects for getting into Greek life and having a semblance of a social life are dimming. 

And at this point the desire, the hunger for acceptance reaches an all-time high. I can't deny how much of a loser I am socially anymore, I can only hide it from others. The only thing worse than being lonely is having others know that you're lonely, after all. My desire for acceptance due to the fact that I have never been accepted by anyone is probably going to affect my psyche forever. Mentally it's killing me, it's on my mind 24/7. From the moment I wake up to the last seconds before I doze off to sleep.

But I have no idea how am I supposed to find a girl to talk with and maybe ask her out, I live in a Muslim country and so schools were always unisex, and now that im in university, There are no girls here as well cuz it a technical university (electronics and mechanics and stuff like that) and so as well gyms and everything else is unisex.

I asked few people about approaching girls in public, like asking to sit next to them in a park or sth and they all said its creepy af to do that. Now im really fcking stuck and have no idea wth am i supposed to do! Anyone here can help me?",lonely,I need a relationship,2022-06-05 08:44:03

4679,whitechair420,1654381901,1,"She was my first girlfriend in the course of my lifetime, and i was her first boyfriend as well. We both are 24, and we met on reddit. It wasnt an IRL relationship but an online one. Its all the same if you ask me, if you truly love someone whether its online or in person, if there is a connection then that’s that.

We started off as friends, then best friends and one way or another we were in a relationship. I was the happiest ive ever been, the most motivated person ever. But that all changed almost 2 weeks ago when she suddenly stopped talking to me and started saying she has no time anymore. 

How can you go from saying “i am attached to you and youre in for a ride” or “im so lucky to have you, im so lucky that we met” or “i love you and i miss you wake up, i missed your voice” how can you go from that to blocking me (on whatsapp. We mainly used discord to text and call) and not saying anything to me?

What did i do wrong to her? I keep asking myself that, i keep going back to our chat, i read and i read but i find nothing. I go back to our phone calls but it was all sweet talking and talking about our future plans and our life’s together. What we wanted in life. 

 The past 2 weeks been hell on earth, ive been having heartaches, i tear up every hour or so, i cant watch our favorite show anymore because it reminds me of her (she used to sing along with the intro and it was the most adorable thing ever) whatever i do it reminds me of her, i see a funny tiktok i laugh and her laugh comes to mind. I see a human smile, i picture her smiling (her smile brightened my day everyday) her voice calmed me down, she being in my life kept me sane. I loved her unconditionally. When she needed help, i helped her without a second thought. I was the best version of my self when she was around. I felt i was the smartest when she was around (she was very intellectual and handy, i loved that) i miss her craziness, i miss her voice, i miss her brains, i miss her laughter and jokes. Most importantly i miss my friend, my best friend and my lover. 

I try to distract myself by going to the gym, go to the park, play video games and other activities but at the end of the day all i can think about is her.

What about those of us who don't have people to celebrate with. Stuck at home lonely, alone and forgotten. Yes, there are many events on over the weekend, but I can't attend them, they are for families, friends, work colleagues.... Solo people can go, of course, but there's no one to enjoy it with, striking up a conversation with a stranger? That's just gets you side looks as they slowly back away, it's happened before  it will happen again. Give up. 

What I've described above is what I experience everyday. Loneliness. 
It is just amplified when there are celebrations, parties, carnivals.... Mass gatherings. 

Somedays it does not trouble me and other days  it bothers me to the point of unspeakable thoughts.

I enjoy my own company. 
I am uncomfortable in social situations but long to be included.

I battle with demons everyday.

The week we were to meet, she met someone. Just a guy though. We met anyway. I tried to stay grounded - just some talking, nothing special will happen. We had some awkward talks and walks, spent around one day together, nothing extraordinary happened.

This week she was talking way less to me. Obviously my mind panicked I did something wrong but I forced myself to stay calm and don't be an asshole about it. So the week went by.

Yesterday she told me she wasn't responding because she was with this other guy. And they are starting dating.

So why am I writing this?

First thing - I'm trying to not have negative feelings toward my friend. Obviously this is just a coincidence, she didn';t do anything wrong.

But on the other hand I'm having a really shitty weekend. We often used to talk before sleep, some random stuff. Now we can't, she is obviously in the stage of getting to know the guy and wanting to spend a lot of time with him. So I can't tell her this, I don't want to insert myself into it and bother her when she is happy.

But you know. I don't have many friends. I don't have much of anything. This meeting was just a shot, I like her a lot, maybe we would get to know eachother better in time. But now...

I dunno, this same thing happened to me third time already. I struggle to meet and talk with people irl. 3 out of 4 last times I tried, suddenly the person got a boyfriend and just didn't have much time to talk with me anymore.

4717,ThrowawayJ10112,1654364878,1,"It is difficult to be happy or satisfied with a friendship when you see how people act around you, compared to how they act around their other, ‘better’ friends, especially when they make no effort to hide it.

To me, it shows that maybe they don’t feel comfortable being themselves around me, or they don’t trust me for some reason or another. Or perhaps they don’t see value in our friendship like I do.

When I see these friends behave differently around others as compared to me, it makes me think I’m worthless, that I’m wasting their time, that I’m boring, or that I have nothing to bring to the friendship to make them want to spend time with me, no less - be comfortable to be their true selves.

I’m left here thinking; why am I not good enough to be that persons’ best friend? What makes me so horrible that I am relegated to be an acquaintance, and nothing more?

For the past 3 to 4 months I have been in a very awful and miserable state of mind. I hung out pretty rarely with people because of my poor social skills, I lost motivation to do anything productive, including hobbies, school stuff, and general activities to improve my mental health. But this became worse as soon as my parents tried to let me know that they’re disappointed in me, because I’m lazy and I don’t do anything, and that I should change that not to waste my life.

That made me feel horrible, and as a result I decided to isolate myself completely. I stood in my room for 2 weeks, I did not go outside, I deleted my instagram and discord because I was done socializing with people. But during these 2 weeks, one friend called me and asked me if I was doing ok. And the fact that I haven’t talked to him for a while (He’s got a lot of people he hangs out with so I never really bothered to talk to him so much) and also he checked up on me was quite surprising.

If you haven't guessed, I'm a woman in my 20s living in the Bible Belt, and it sucks because the only two ways to make friends here seem to be through church and school. Well, I'm currently on a gap year, and I would be hard-pressed to go to any church considering I'm not religious. Even my therapist admitted that it's hard to make friends without one or the other when I told him I was lonely. I haven't met many people around here who seem to have the same issue as I do, mostly because they are either in church and/or school.

I guess the only ""way in"" I have left is work, but I'm not the type of person to get cozy with my coworkers. I don't feel comfortable doing so; it feels unprofessional at best, and at worst, I worry that I might place too much trust into the wrong person. Then what? I don't want to feel ostracized at work. It's difficult enough to be here without having my coworkers gossiping about me. Call me paranoid, but I just won't do it. Besides, it's not easy anyway. Everyone this age has lives, has things going on. People can hardly keep up with their personal lives let alone worry about introducing someone new into the mix.

I used to be connected only with her. the day she left me, I didn't lose only my girlfriend, but my best friend also.

I'm in a very sad place.",lonely,feeling lonely after 1 year post break-up,2022-06-05 00:10:42
4735,Jurez1313,1654349945,1,"I woke up two hours early this morning. In a bit, I'm going to get dressed, go downstairs, pretend everything is ok and eat breakfast with my mom while watching gentleman jack. But in the past 2 hours, all I've been trying to do is distract myself from how lonely and miserable, isolated and hopeless I feel.   

In trying to distract myself, naturally I got a little frisky. My go to is audio roleplays, and I stumbled across one that piqued my interest. It starts with the speaker in a bath, inviting the listener to join them. Then, encourages the listener to breathe deeply, and repeat some affirmations. This is where I started to get a little emotional, as repeating things like. ""I am proud of myself"" and ""I like what I see in the mirror."" is really hard when they couldn't be farther from the truth.  

However, then I was encouraged to picture my ten year old self. And sure enough, with my eyes closed, there he was. Chubby little guy with big brown eyes, dorky little spectacles, jean shorts and a nerdy shirt. And I recognized an emotion in his face: fear. Pain. I was told to hug him, and imagine what he most think of me.  

I am such a disappointment to my ten year old self. But at the same time, when I pictured him, and thought of myself hugging him, we both wept. My inner child wept out of fear, anxiety, loneliness, isolation and pain. And I, a thirty year old man, wept as I held a child, because I knew what pain he was in, and I felt powerless to help him feel better.  

I also know that three years later, when I'm thirteen, I will have experienced some of the most overwhelmingly intense bullying and exclusionary behaviour of my life.  

I don't know why I'm sharing this. I didn't even finish the audio. I wasn't frisky anymore. Just confused, and sad. I've spent the last twenty years of my life trying to ignore the pain, isolation, and hopelessness I've been experiencing since I was ten years old. Trying to wash it away with drugs, both prescription and illicit. Trying to put a Band-Aid over it by paying for the company of women, or spending hours and hours listening to audios of women pretending to care about me, so that for a little while, I can feel just a bit less lonely.  

But inevitably, the feelings return to the surface. Never quite leaving, but sometimes buried under a mound of distractions and coping mechanisms I've built over twenty years of suffering. But they are no longer enough to keep the overwhelming sadness at bay.  

I have MDD, PDD, GAD, ADHD, and BPD. Likely PTSD from a minor abuse incident at the hands of a peer when I was a child. I don't for the life of me know how I'm supposed to cope with all of that. How I'm supposed to live a normal life. How I'm supposed to be happy, when my brain is doing everything in its power to remind me that I'm not allowed to be. That there's barely anyone in my life that cares about me, and I will genuinely never meet another person who does, or will do.  

All I've ever wanted, since I was old enough to know it was even possible, was a romantic relationship. But coming to terms with the fact that this likely will never happen for me... Facing my inner ten year old who's frightened, alone, and already so hopeless... And knowing I've disappointed him by not giving him anything he so desperately craved, despite my best efforts... It's very, very hard to see how I will ever feel any better. How my life could ever improve in such a way that I will stop feeling even 50 percent of the strength of these negative emotions.

so i've always struggled with making friends, but throughout my education i have generally had at least a couple of friends at any one time, a few close.  after leaving school, however, i've ended up with essentially nobody around me (through a mixture of petty drama, moving counties twice and nose diving a couple of times into depression). the problem is: i have acquaintances, that i could probably hang out with if i wanted to, but i feel like i have higher standards than this so i won't.  i don't know if i see friendship as more important than other people, but it FEELS like i want friends who i deeply care about and deeply care about me, who share my core values, whereas most people are happy just buddying up with anybody.  i want something more from my friendships than what i would get with the people i vaguely know and could meet up with if i wanted, so i don't meet up with anyone at all. 

this makes me feel weird, because i don't know if i'm just seeing this all wrong and i should be happy with who i'm given in terms of community.  but i have tried, and i'm not.  i crave closer companionship, i crave camping together alone in the woods without it being awkward, i crave creating art together, platonic physical affection and crying on each other's shoulders.  but i've never quite found it.  and i don't think i'll ever be okay settling for less.

i'd like to know if anyone else feels like this!

I dont feel anything and I dont care about anything, I cant feel happiness anymore, but I also cant feel sadness. Everything lost taste and become blunt so now I am just staying in place doing nothing while the time is passing by so fast. Is that what they call dead inside? I dont have any goals because I dont want anything so there is nothing to do in a day. I am eating healthy and I am working out for a few years now, but it doesnt help even a little. Working out feels so boring and it doesnt hype me up like before.
My favorite activity is watching anime and now it is killing me that it feels like work and not like enjoyment. I even tried forcing myself to do things that I loved doing before hoping that it will bring back happiness and pleasure.
My life is pretty good, I am keeping everything in check and I am very fit and healthy. I dont even know is this depression or I am just lonely because I dont have any ""real"" friends nor girlfriend (I have never had a girlfriend). I just want one person that will love spending time with me and talk to me about everything, but unfortunetly I am not very good at meeting new people and I dont even find people that are worth socializing with

Things are getting worse and I'm reaching the end of what I can handle. Since I have no fiends to go out with and have never had a gf, there is nobody to talk to. My therapist doesn't care and after begging to not invalidate me with worksheets about my problems, she sends me worksheets about self-esteem because something about me upsets her. She has no empathy for me and in fact I'm worse off than when I started with her because bad help is worse than no help. I would have to wait until almost December to get a new therapist and there is no guarantee that that person would be any better. I asked the people who gave me my last therapist who was amazing but they said they won't get more people until September and there is no guarantee they will be as good as my last therapist. I don't know why but outside of my last therapist, when I reach out for help, I bring out the worst in people. They tell me to man up, stop complaining, and deal with my problems.

I’ve pegged 6 different guys now. They all take some level of convincing but eventually everyone agrees. Watching this big strong man turn into a cute little guy just sprawled out on my bed unable to speak or even think while he takes a strapon he insisted would be too big for him. I live for that shit. 

And I am good. I mean really good. All of them give some silly ultimatum like “oh ok but if you get to peg me then I get to do anal too!” Guess what, nobody has ever wanted to do the anal afterwards. They just get the best orgasm of their life and can barely walk and then they can’t think about anything else and they come right back for more. I’m happy to give it to them too, any time and any place.

Then of course there’s the dude-bros that are like “oh yeah I never do this but you’re just so hot, I wouldn’t be doing this if you weren’t so attractive, it’s only because you’re hot” and it’s like uh huh yeah baby thank you now bend over so you can get rammed! Oh and guess what, they always come back again. And again. And every time they’re all ashamed but I make sure to go extra hard on them. Maybe I’ll fuck the shame right out of them and we can all be adults and admit how great it is.

I’d say I have 3 regulars who ask for it about once a week. I do extra special stuff for those boys because they at least admit they love it. Then there’s 1 that will never ask for it but asks to hang out and then spends the whole time talking about what we did last time until I go get the strap then he becomes a nice obedient little boy and bends over for me. Then of course there’s the other 2. Reluctant to admit how amazing I am but they’ve both had it more than twice now and every time they say “ok cool I’m only doing it cause you’re hot though, I wouldn’t normally do this” but weirdly they just keep coming back. Silly guys. 

One more thing, the moans. Boys moan so beautifully while they’re getting railed and you can tell how good you are by how loud they get. I’ll just be rocking my hips back and forth and suddenly I’m getting these gorgeous moans to let me know I’m hitting the spot. Best sound on earth if you ask me.

They just get the best orgasm of their life and can barely walk and then they can’t think about anything else and they come right back for more. I’m happy to give it to them too, any time and any place.

Then of course there’s the dude-bros that are like “oh yeah I never do this but you’re just so hot, I wouldn’t be doing this if you weren’t so attractive, it’s only because you’re hot” and it’s like uh huh yeah baby thank you now bend over so you can get rammed! Oh and guess what, they always come back again. And again. And every time they’re all ashamed but I make sure to go extra hard on them. Maybe I’ll fuck the shame right out of them and we can all be adults and admit how great it is.

I’d say I have 3 regulars who ask for it about once a week. I do extra special stuff for those boys because they at least admit they love it. Then there’s 1 that will never ask for it but asks to hang out and then spends the whole time talking about what we did last time until I go get the strap then he becomes a nice obedient little boy and bends over for me. Then of course there’s the other 2. Reluctant to admit how amazing I am but they’ve both had it more than twice now and every time they say “ok cool I’m only doing it cause you’re hot though, I wouldn’t normally do this” but weirdly they just keep coming back. Silly guys. 

One more thing, the moans. Boys moan so beautifully while they’re getting railed and you can tell how good you are by how loud they get. I’ll just be rocking my hips back and forth and suddenly I’m getting these gorgeous moans to let me know I’m hitting the spot. Best sound on earth if you ask me.

No one wants to hear a man complain. 

No one wants to know about a man’s weakness. 

I fucking hate this shit, man. I’m so broken and lonely and depressed, but I don’t have the luxury to express it at all, because if I do I’m seen as a man child, gay, or a weakling. You can’t even say it’s just the people I surround myself with because almost everyone in the Midwest thinks this way. 

I don’t want to put certain thoughts in my mind, but sometimes I really do think those thoughts are better than trying to be a man who is broken and on the path of becoming an alcoholic. If I get a disease I’m not going to a doctor to get it treated. I’ll just let it go.

4807,Interesting_Cat6184,1654312772,1,"I’m going to speak about how I deal with loneliness in a very different way than people usually hear about. So I have literally no one to talk to, no friends for years, never been in a relationship, and family that I don’t connect with.

Despite this I have been able to heal a lot of my loneliness to the point where I can sit in a dark room all by myself and not feel lonely. Ive used inner child work therapy which you guys might have heard of. So every time I feel lonely, instead of distracting myself or pushing down the emotion, I talk to the loneliness as if it’s a person, so I imagine my inner child coming up to me and telling me they don’t feel seen, heard, or anyone cares about them,then I ask them how I can support them which can come in the form of a hug, touch or just seeing them. This is usually more than enough to heal the specific loneliness that shows up. I choose to do this because when we look for other people to heal our loneliness through connection or relationships we constantly need them to be there for us which never fills up the cup but when we give the love to ourselves then the impact is permanent and lasting.

So instead of using others to run away from my loneliness I choose to meet it when it comes up and heal it by giving it the support it didn’t receive when I was a child. This doesn’t mean I’m against relationships or connecting with people, that is natural and beautiful to want that but I choose to heal my loneliness by myself so that when I’m with people, Its because I genuinely want to be with them and connect with them rather than using them as a way to distract myself or meet my needs.

I would love to hear you guys opinions about this.",lonely,My journey in overcoming loneliness,2022-06-04 13:19:32

I always have this feeling that the people around me want something from me. I ask myself “why would this guy want to be my friend?” or “why would this girl want to be with me?” I don’t know why, am I just being paranoid? I have been betrayed before, maybe that’s why I don’t trust anyone, not even my family. I’ve had classmates ask me to hang out. I’ve had women confess their “deep love” to me, and I would just make up reasons why I don’t want to be with them.

I shut her down and said that I don’t deserve her, she proceeded to tell me all kinds of things about me that attracted her, yet I wasn’t convinced, I had a feeling that there was something wrong going on. Maybe the “something wrong” is within me, not with them. I am always suspicious of everyone, I never let anyone close, fearing that I may get hurt again.

I have always been a bit of a lonely person. I don't always know how to interact with others or develop healthy friendships. My fiance proposed to me and I knew right away that I would have to find random people to invite because I could only think of maybe 8 people on my side (family included) compared to 60 on his.

My friend is planning a Bachelorette party. I though it would be just her and I. She just asked me to give her a list of all of my other friends. I literally have no one else. No coworkers, classmates, or old friends that I can think of. I haven't responded go her because I don't want to be embarrassed when I say, it's just us.

I really don't know how things got like this. I had a medium sized friend group in high-school, but college, and then work came around and I never made any new friends. Instead I just slowly lost the ones I had one by one.

I tried joining fitness classes and art classes to meet people, but I just find myself constantly alone. 


Tonight, I feel the physical pain of being alone. I want to call my fiance and ask him to be with me, but I am extremely aware that tasking him with the load of being my only other friend is too much. He is always there when I need him, and sometimes I'll lie to him about hanging out with a friend when in reality, I am at home alone, because he would feel terrible taking time to himself or going to work or seeing his own friends.

I just have nothing to lose anymore. I found out my girlfriend of two years was cheating on me last November and it's been one hell of a healing process but I got there! I did so well and got over her and was ready for something new, only something new never came along.

I've tried tirelessly to make friends as I have none, I've tried tirelessly to fit in at work.

But it’s also sad when even with people you still feel sad. I followed everyone because I didn’t want to get lost and I went on the go cart and one of my classmates was texting while on it and hit me I thought I was gonna die and I thought the car flipped over. I couldn’t breathe they said it was from the sudden collision and whiplash everything started spinning my head hurt like hell and I cut myself.A nurse said I could have a concussion and I should get it checked out but I don’t care enough to do so. It still hurts 4 hours later but I don’t care what happens.  My other classmates were mad because the ride got stopped and I felt so badly I always mess shit up. It was supposed to be a fun day. I feel bad. I always ruin things.

   We were at the place for 4 hours and the whole time I just walked alone watching everyone having fun and laughing with their friends and all I could do was cry all I could see was me the person who I used to be. That used to be me laughing with my friends but everyone’s fucking gone it hurt when my friends left but when my cousins left it hurt so bad my heart felt like it just dropped. We said we should move in together we were so fucking close I was so close with everyone and now it’s just me. We would do everything together my best friends were like my sisters and so were my cousins but their all gone. They’ve replaced me it hurts so bad, it hurts knowing it’s all gone ill never get that shit back. And even if I do I won’t be happy. It’s been like that for 3 years now and it just keep on getting worse my social anxiety ruined my life and on top of that sadness which destroyed it. I can’t tell you the last time I’ve felt genuinely happy. I can’t do this anymore. My heart literally aches it feels so heavy my heart rate is always high  it feels like my body’s constantly in a panic every step I take feel’s heavy sometimes I can’t bring myself to make it out of bed or clean my room. Nothing helps. I thought maybe I was sad because I was lonely but no someone sat down to have a convo with me and all I wanted to do was cry this deep sadness stronger than my regular sadness hit my body in waves. Tried talking to people online it didn’t help I just cried the whole time behind the screen. Is this not what I wanted what the fuck is  wrong with me. I got compared to someone that I said I would never want to be I would always say that I would never be them when I was younger and my mother said I’m like them. She’s disappointed in me she said she wish she could sell me, I saw the text I saw it all and each time it crushes my heart I also use to be very close with my mom and look at that even her I even disappointed her. That hurt the most seeing the things she said hurt. I’m so fucking tired I can’t do this anymore. I can’t. 
  last year I wanted to end things but my anxiety stopped me and I knew that all I would do is mess up her life even more I knew how much that would hurt her and I couldn’t. But it’s always been like this. I’ve felt this before.I remember holding a knife to my stomach at the age of 7 crying wanting it all to be over.

I have both internal and external personality, strong adaptability, integrity, good interpersonal skills, relevant professional knowledge, and serious work. Careful, patient, work attitude and good work ethic. I believe in team spirit to work seriously responsible, always hope to do things better!

In my opinion, everyone lives in the world, and what supports our spirit and will is value, which can also be said to be faith. So, people are bound by emotion because we recognize each other's values.

Now I have 3 friends, 2 live in a different city and the other is always ""too busy"". So yeah, the loneliest time of my life. I dont have a job, I study my degree online and live in a small city so I dont have many opportunities to meet new people.
 
Is just so heartbreaking, to have no one to share feelings or experiences with. I just wanna go in a walk with a friend in a warm summer night and talk about everything and nothing and laugh too loud when the street is silent. 
Dont get me wrong, I love my own company, I am not the type of person that is scared of doing things on their own. I go to the cinema, to concerts in other cities, to the library I dont care, if I want to do something I will, alone or not. So is not about having people in order to do something, but more like have people to not fade in the crowd, to share the moment, to feel that I exist.

4884,dark_wolf62,1654286633,1,"I am an only child, because of my parents' work we had to move in with relatives. I was fat, my family was overprotective of me and I was bullied at school, both of which generated my anxiety. I did not understand the reasons why they overprotected me, and my child's mind only saw it as being pushed away for no reason. which is why I just decided to stay away from everyone at school too, my neighbors always asked me if I was going to go out and play, and I always refused because of my fears. I was alone, and this did not affect me so much in my childhood, but as I grew up I felt lonely and sad, I saw how other people my age had friends and a partner there was a time when I decided to be different, I didn't want to be alone anymore and pretended to be someone else, I thought I had made a few friends, but in the end I realized that they didn't care about me, they weren't looking for me and I isolated myself again They clearly never tried to contact me again. It was very hard for me, I made up my mind that if even pretending to be someone else I couldn't make friends, then my destiny was to be alone forever. I isolated myself again and later, at age 15, my anxiety became stronger, I couldn't exchange a word with anyone because I began to tremble and feel more nervous than ever, I pretended to be angry all the time so that no one approached me and so on. prevent them from making fun of me at all costs, when deep down what I wanted most was someone to talk to. I lived my whole life thinking about what they will say, when I turned 18, I started taking therapy, and everything started to improve, I started exercising and at the same time I met the girl who is my girlfriend today, my life took an unexpected turn, I didn't imagine having a partner in the near future, anyway, now I'm happy, but I still have traits of my social anxiety, my girlfriend has friends and I worry more that she's going to leave me or change for someone with mental stability and emotional, even though all the time she reminds me that she loves me.I find it hard to believe it sometimes because I start thinking about the worst and I feel insufficient for her...
I had to drop out of school for a while, the last time I went to school I still had my anxiety, in a few months I'll go to university and I don't know how I'm going to face it this time, I'm afraid of being alone again and not be able to make friends. I find it hard to understand the intentions of others and sometimes I don't know what is right or wrong to say or do and I am afraid that they will think that I am weird again and exclude me, but I am learning to socialize, precisely because I don't want to be alone, but sometimes I'm afraid that I'm going to screw everything up again.
I want to be positive, but I still suffer from my past, I have not been able to overcome it and it makes me feel like I am going to be alone again.
but even so I have faith that this time it will be better, and I will have a few friends at least.

At the start of the year, a close friend of mine invited me to hang out with her friends.
Later on we all got into a big friend group. It was fun at first but became horrible as it went on.
As i said in the title, we went to alot of parties but i was the only one not drinking,vaping or smoking cigarettes and drugs (which btw i got made fun of alot), as the parties went on i became a babysitter and couldnt have fun anymore since i had to babysit my drunk friends.
2 friends of this group cut me off for pretty stupid reasons.
I never cared about those people but at that time i liked to suffer but be with friends all the time rather than being alone.
Until i got into a huge fight with the girl who kept me the part of the friendgroup (because ive lost contact with the other 2)
She snitched and told my school therapist about my mental health problems with another school friend who knew about that. The girl decided to lie to me and everyone saying she didnt snitch on me. (Even tho later on her friend adimtted she did).before that she liked to try to manipulate (never worked) and make me seem the worst all the time.
Long story short, we lost contact and she ruined my name.none of people in my friendgroup talks to me even when before that happend they always used to talk to me and be happy when they see me.
The only ones i got left after are my mutual friends with her, which ofc because of her i cant go to any hangouts since they know we cant be around each other.
And even when the teacher asked her where was i , she replied with ""we are not friends so i wouldnt know"". That made everyone gossip and ask why, which ofc she replied with talking about my mental health problems.
I know she wasnt a good friend, and the friend group wasnt a good enviorment. But even my best friend of 3 years left me without saying anything.when a little before that she used to call and text she misses me because we dont talk alot. Now i cant even get her to see my messages.
I never thought id be in this point of my life again, especially not for the 3rd time in 8 years.

4912,Top-Effective3617,1654273721,1,"Hey.
I'm not feeling so lonely, lately. I'm introverted, and an Infp. A psychologist of mine refers to me a a 'super feeler'. I was raised rough and find myself to be a middle aged man with issues around intimacy, abandonment, connection etc. I spent years yearning for love or a partner. In all that time, I was looking outwards for solace, instead of inwards for self-awareness. Buddhism helped me see that.
I'm still solitary, with a very small circle, and am still not romantically involved, but it's less urgent.
I meditate a lot. I meditate on acceptance, empathy, and on self esteem. This hasn't brought solace for my yearnings; it's helped me see how my yearnings were taking up too much bandwidth to actually deal with the empty inside.
I've been in relationships and felt alone; I've been on top of mountain passes, by myself, and felt connected to everything.
Even though there are times when I will still feel isolated and lonely, I realize that lonely is a state of mind and not a state of being. Often when I feel the most lonely, I know for me that it's connected to depression which i can manage. Neoplasticity is a thing; if we change our outlook, we can change our brains. Changing one's thinking is hard, but the pay off in well-being is worth it.

4932,Substantial_Cash7686,1654263074,1,"My boyfriend and I have dated for 3 years now. Like any couple, we’ve had our fights and put pieces of our minds out there. 

Our fights seem to be over the same thing with me concluding in the end that I ask for too much and how unsatisfied I am with him. Its come to a point that I tell him I feel like I am just telling him to be a different person completely. 

I have this philosophy that if you aren’t already naturally into something, you shouldn’t force it. My boyfriend doesn’t like a lot of things to the point that I tell him that our lives don’t compliment each other. 

Some examples like I wake before 6am everyday because I’m have insomnia. Waking up early and doing productive things around the house while he sleeps in bed. Kinda annoys me because as soon as he wakes up, he wants to do things with me like work out when I already worked out, or smoke some greens when he’s done nothing productive. 

I really do feel like his mom sometimes because, ironically, he can’t do anything alone. It has been 3 years since he dropped out of school, and he doesn’t have a natural ambition to want to finish school for himself. It has came to a point that his whole family has to ask him to finish his degree. It took multiple fights till I got him to start rolling his mind in the right direction of finishing school; not only for his family, but for himself and for the sake of our relationship. 

I had to put my life in hold as I wait for him to take action. He doesn’t take action until someone nags at him to do so. It makes me feel like a fucking parent! I don’t want to feel that way. 

Because I feel like my damn boyfriend’s mom, it really does make me feel alone… 

Im basically the girl who’s only friend is her boyfriend and I fucking hate that with a burning passion. 

What’s even more ironic is how we live lowkey in the middle of nowhere. The closest store is 20 minutes away, so there is nothing to really walk to. The only way out is freeway, and I have been trying to be better at driving alone, which is also hard. But im learning..",lonely,Lonely Even In A Relationship,2022-06-03 23:31:14

i think everyone can attest to the fact that losing yourself, and recognising it, is the most gut wrenching and confusing thing ever. I used to complain so much, on how i didnt know myself, on how I still felt lonely, all this crap about my dissatisfaction, but i would do anything in a million years to rewind to the summer of 2021. sure i was unhappy but nothing competes to the absolute absence of myself im rolling in. 

i still like looking at the sky and smelling freshly cut grass, and listening to the sound of rain, but im losing every other part of myself. i lost my brains, my passions, my drive. i have no momentum, no will. i know to declare a 'no' is a far stretch, but thats what it is, black and white, i have become bleak. ""i cry at nothing and cry most of the time"". im losing my old drive to be the best academically, to learn new languages and master new skills, to aim and to plan for my future. and i see this all happening but i cant, i dont know how to change. 

the moment i knew i was, not alone, but lonely,, the moment i realised i was lonely, it was then i began to chip away. im falling into old bad habits, im drawing on my skin and i think its what is stopping me from running away or doing something irreversible. its the only thing that gets the stress out and the temporary euphoria in.

Then i also moved to a new country to be with my partner, and the relationship is amazing, but i don't have anybody else here and i end up spending a lot of time alone when he is at work, as i work from home and only go to uni 2 times a week, where most people came into the master program with their friends from bachelor program and i just don't feel like i could fit into any of those already formed friendship groups.

The person who I would buddy up with would always end up talking shit about me behind my back. Then everybody else would bully me because I’m smaller and skinnier than the average person my age and sex. I told my family about these issues and I was told I need to stop manipulating people. Here’s the thing, I don’t think I am, and if I am then how the hell do I stop? Currently I’m out of state working for my aunt and uncle, I need to go back to Tennessee to do court but I’m scared i’ll get arrested because “I’m a good manipulator” -mom 2022 (even though I did NOTHING ILLEGAL!!!!!)
I’m also scared to talk to anyone because I don’t want to hurt them. Every friend group  I’ve been in I’ve either been the minority of it or they were just talking shit about me behind my back as I said. Since I’m out of state working at The Hey Farm in Alabama I’ve made pretty good friends with my co worker but she’s like 31 so it’s kinda weird. I’m also friends with the owner of a record store back in Tennessee but he’s 26. What do I do!!!!! I’m not really allowed to talk to anyone over the phone unless it’s family. I’ve already been through self harm and mental hospitals and I’m just at a loss. But also I work 3 jobs and have 2 careers I’ve started. (I do barn work with my co worker Mike, I groom dogs with my co worker Kristen, and I’m a musician but that’s my own solo project I’ve been doing since I was 7)
Anyway what do I do??? I also have a need for physical touch because I never had that as a little kid and I never had a father figure so every man I get to know or am related to I just want them to be a father figure to me. I have nobody to talk to other than my co worker Kristen but if I talk to her about my struggle with all the jobs and issues I have I’ll be seen as lazy and I get paid for these jobs! How do I fix touch starvation on my own. My weighted blanket got left in Mississippi so I can’t use that. How do I not feel physically and mentally alone? I could always quit all three jobs and get a job at Ike’s Beach Service which my uncle owns so I will definitely get a job there. Also, I’m too young to even have a job but I worked on the beach last year with my uncle and got paid. The Hey Farm is more fun to work at though. This is why you don’t give kids jobs.

i feel tired, super tired all the time. i look forward to sleeping. i sleep as much as i can, even with that, i feel tired all the time. i sometimes take 2-3 energy drinks a day, i still feel tired. i always feel tired. my frail body always has some sort of pain in it somewhere. i don’t have any eating problems, i think. when something negative happens, something that would have made me cry three years ago happens, i don’t even cry anymore. i just feel empty, i just don’t care. even though i love sleeping, i stay up until 1 am binging some show or something. i just don’t care about anything anymore. and when i finally go to sleep, i just think about having someone to talk to.

I had roblox war groups where I would be the King and command an army. I would tell people I was younger then I was due to the shame of doing what I was doing in my late teens. Being this Prince online allowed me to numb my ego in real life and forget about the fact that I was an outcast with no present father. I had many opportunities to grow at a young age, but I never woke up. I allowed my mom to baby me and was very rude online. 

In the real world I was alone, quiet, and timid. I was a doormat and ridden with acne. My life sucked in real life so I was a jerk online. Pretty much all of my actions were due to a low self esteem and a desire for attention. I was the definition of weak willed. I would hide in the bathrooms during lunch and look at the ground. I did experience trauma due to my father being a divorced alcoholic, but it’s no excuse for the person I was. The things I said on discord were so unbelievably arrogant that I feel forever defined by them.

I deleted this discord account 2 years ago but the messages that I sent remain. The reason that I gained the consciousness to delete my discord account was due to the character development I went through at college. You are essentially forced to be friends with people at college due to the way dorms are set up. So all of my interactions with people humbled me. It made me see how much of a piece of crap I used to be and how arrogant I was. I’ve recently discovered that you can delete all of the messages on discord using a script. But since my account is deleted all of my arrogant interactions are on full display. A few people from this time know who I am, which kills me. They are from different parts of the world and don’t have contact with me, but they can still read my messages. They picture me as someone with a big ego which is true.

Almost 2 years later we live together and today I drove his car around for my errands, because my car needs to be worked on and driving it around is a struggle. Anyways, I know he gets mad when I do that's why I drive it carefully and only in the city.. Today he asked if drove it I said no, knowing he'd be mad and I didn't think he'd notice. Well he did, then he got mad and upset. He said I risked the car, his insurance and money. That's the same thing with anyone who drives a car, it's always a risk... Even when you drive carefully. He made it like I was a moron and everything else. He made me feel like shit. Yeah I shouldn't have lied to him but he shouldn't have went off on me like that..

On top of him not making me feel loved or caring, helping around the house. I've been wanting to leave for so long and I have tried to move out before but he gaslighted me, made me feel like things are the way they are cause of me so I need to improve. 

I got a good job today and I think this is the push I needed to officially say I need to move out. I'm ready to give out my full heart but to someone who will do the same for me.

5005,BaitandSwitch1800,1654221327,1,"I F (17) have been going through a rough time lately. I’ve moved around a lot and I think it’s finally and truly catching up to me. Last year, when I was a junior in high school, I made the choice to graduate early in order to help my parents not stress as much about yet another move across states (I care a lot about my family and vice versa). So far, I’ve moved states 6 times and attended many schools. At the point in time I made the decision to graduate a year early, I was in state A, in which I had only lived there for almost a year (only attended that high school for one year). Prior to that, I lived in state B where i attended a different high school for my 9th and 10th grade years. 
When making the decision to graduate early, it didn’t take me very long to make the choice considering I could sense how much stress it would take off of my parents if they only had to worry about one child’s (my sisters) high school transition when moving to state C. And because I attended only online school my junior year, I made really only one friend in school via chats and another ones at my job. Overall, it seemed like a good choice because it helped out my family and everyone involved. 
Now, it’s one year later and I don’t regret graduating early as I’m now on track to graduate college with an associates degree next spring. But, now all of my friends are beginning to post their end of year accomplishments. Don’t get me wrong, I’m congratulating all of them and super happy that their making all of these amazing memories but it still stings. I really didn’t get to be a teenager or have a hs experience because of how hectic the last few years have been. 
I fell into a hard depression right before I graduated and made the choice not to walk at graduation because I didn’t know anyone at the school and graduating felt more like a necessity (which for me it is) more than an accomplishment or anything and I wanted to separate myself from that as much as possible. 
I feel like i’ve given up so much. Not just with not having a senior year but all together. I developed a bad habit of only making friends really out of convenience and not so much for relationships. However, I do always try to guide and help people when I can, I think it’s just my nature. I’m extremely social and love having conversations, just not longer the friendships that’s come with because the constancy cycle makes it painful.  I’ve moved around so much that I often feel like no one cares after I leave so I’ve stopped trying so hard because everything will fade eventually. And for the friendships I do try to keep, people only text me when they need somebody they don’t go to school with to listen to them rant. and no one I know can comprehend my feelings or even cares to listen, not like I would want them to. I just wonder what it would have been like to be a kid who had solid roots and just got to be a kid instead of who I am now: a person who can’t remember the last time they were truly happy.  I stopped texting first about two weeks ago and now no one reaches out. I’m getting used to the loneliness and i’m working on further accepting it. 
I’ve gotten back into working out which helps and i’m eating better. I’m reading a lot more instead of being on my phone. I also decided to take some extra courses overt the summer to help stay busy because it’s a good use of my time. Im also currently looking for a counselor but i live in a small town so it’s going to take a while. I’m just wondering if there’s anyone out there that’s been through something similar.",lonely,A person who moved around a lot and graduated early and is now lonely iso guidance rant,2022-06-03 11:55:27

Thousands of miles away from home in a new state with a new job and new people around me. Doing something very few people have ever done in their lifetime or ever will get to do in their lifetime. I should be excited right? Wrong, I can’t help but think I’m not doing enough every day I go to work. I work anywhere between 9-48 hour days since, you guessed it, military. I was going to take some leave to see family I haven’t seen in a few years but my performance at work led me down the path of not going. Now I’m considering just entirely dedicating my life to working. Nothing outside, just work. I’ve given tinder and bumble a good long run. Had one or two actual matches but nothing that lasted. All of the guys I know tell me “you could pull so easily dude” and all of the normal try to pick my spirits up thing. But I know it’s not the truth. I’m short, I’m skinny (almost anorexic if anything), stopped working out, don’t have the money to do the things I want. Any time I have off I spend lulling or running away from my emotions. I have zero confidence when it comes to meeting females, even if it’s just to be friends. It’s weird ever since I deleted tinder and bumble I’ve had a lot more free time and now I realize just how lonely I really am. No one really texts me unless they need help or advice or are simply bored. I don’t have anyone that I can just hit up and go do something because they’re either too busy or don’t wanna do anything. And truth be told I don’t even know what I want to do half of the time. All of the things i’m passionate about/enjoy doing take a lot of money to do which I don’t have and in the current state of the economy feels like I’ll never be able to do it. I’ve come to the slightest conclusion that I should maybe try to find a relationship again. For some reason with my ex, not only was I happier on a day to day basis but I swear I was actively trying to improve myself every day. Yeah I get that I should be doing it for me rather than someone else but I see no reason for me to do that. My self worth is so low that all I believe I deserve is the absolute worst. I shouldn’t be getting paid as much as I do. Have the opportunities that I have, the friends I do and the amazing family that support me from halfway around the world. I’m just a piece of shit.

M/24 Preface: this is going to be heavy and may be confusing as well

I have been isolated from having any friends and family for about 6 years. I recently started to be present with my family again but in a very different way. I was disowned by everyone around me after making a very terrible mistake and acting out sexually toward my younger sister (15 at the time, I was 17) I went to juvenile hall and then to a boys home until I was 19. I tried to kill myself some time after that because I just wanted it all to stop. I struggled with feeling like I was absolutely insane for a long time and like I was absolutely evil. I recently got myself a lot of medical help and found a lot of issues that were contributing to that. I’m now taking testosterone, Vyvanse (70mg) and Sertraline (100mg) and I have been able to regain control of myself and my life to some degree. I have been going to therapy for about 3 years now and my diagnosis is CPTSD, ADHD, and Dysthymia. From what I understand from the therapy work I’ve done, I struggle because of my CPTSD. I feel very torn internally. I feel some days like I might have a split personality. One side of me tends to act out inappropriately and in very immature and needy ways. The other side of me is responsible and mostly clear minded. Unfortunately because I seem to alternate between the two sort of subconsciously, the good side of me ends up reaping the consequences of the the bad sides actions and I have been caught in a loop of ruining my own progress for years.

There is a lot of missing context here but I just want to know if anyone else can identify with me on some level or has shared a similar experience. I would also very much appreciate advice on rehabilitating my ability to make friends and act socially appropriate and create healthy and lasting connections with people. I feel as though the isolation may be what perpetuates the cycle",lonely,I’m broken and I feel so alone,2022-06-03 08:49:17

ever since I was an early teenager, I’ve felt alone. ive been lucky to have people around me at some points, but at my best and worst I feel like nobody is really there.

i never talk to anyone. everyone’s got more important issues, or I don’t want to ruin their fun, which is why I’m here, speaking to the void in a sense. i have a great community of people, friends, partner, but I get this big wave of guilt when I reach out to anyone because it feels like I’m burdening them.

because of this, I’ve just isolated myself over the years and become less and less able to talk to anyone. im not too sure why im even writing this, as I feel embarrassed for even talking, but I think that’s what a long run of only talking to myself or my notes app has done.

Peer respite is generally a free supervised AirBnB type of place that’s NOT an inpatient facility. There shouldn’t be any type of medication involved at these places. That being said, the staff isn’t necessarily therapists either. They’re meant to be your PEERS though they are certified. I wish I had known about this sooner. I highly recommend checking this out no matter what you’re struggling with to see if it works for you. It’s helping me so much, and I hope someone else sees this and considers helping themselves this way.

One thing to note is that a LOT of people utilize these for substance abuse/addiction recovery, so keep that in mind if you’re planning on a respite stay. The other guests I’m with right now are recovered/recovering and they’re very chill, sweet people, but unfortunately that’s not always the case. So, manage your expectations accordingly. Do your research before planning a stay just in case.

Another cool thing is the concept of “warmlines”. This is opposed to hotlines, which can sometimes not be as helpful because the hotline might determine your crisis isn’t severe enough to talk you through. A warmline isn’t supposed to gatekeep talking through your struggles. Another thing I wish I knew about. Best of luck, friends ❤️",lonely,Peer respite/ warmlines,2022-06-03 02:15:02

I can't make a connection with anyone, i just feel so fucking miserable all the time, i feel like i live on a different plane of existence, and i'm not saying this as a ""i'm much cooler than you lul"" way, i'm saying it as in everyone talks a different language and laughs at different jokes while i'm just staring at everyone.

It's practically impossible, there was one single exception, but that was the exception that proved the rule because i don't have that friend anymore, and i wonder if i'm burnt out from that or i just can't make friends, i've never had any friends other than that one.

I can't even do that thing where people get made fun of for, you know the ""donate to a person on twitch to feel like you have a connection""? Yeah that doesn't work either, i can't find someone i can actually connect with on a personal level.

Oh right, i found out a while ago that i'm actually schizophrenic, and i'm not able to properly control my emotions and thoughts for some reason, it's not ""cool"" or ""quirky"" it's horrible and it sucks ass and sucks all the life out of me, i'm super depressed and shit sucks.

Now let's just get some arguments out of the way

""You don't need food. All you need is yourself.""

This is what the argument sounds like when you switch loneliness for hunger.

""You have schizophrenia? I have super Extra ADHD and bipolar multi made up disorder!""

Don't one up someone with a mental illness, that's not a fucking competition and it's not ""cool"" to have something.

I hate mental illness and i hate that i'm mentally ill, it has ruined so many things in my life and i'm suffering, it's not a fucking wave of trends to ride on.

How the fuck did we move from ""toughen up there's no such thing as mental illness"" to ""what flavor is your mental illness today?"" I'd love to be treated nicely/with care because i'm not the same as everyone around me but being treated well is different from being enabled.

On the one hand of course time off work is needed, especially with how busy my company is right now, it's important to recuperate. But on the other hand when you have no one to spend it with, it also makes you feel blue. The weather is warmer, people are out more, including a lot of happy couples and although part of me is happy for them, another part of me feels resentful. Anyone else ever felt lonely since the day they were born? Sure you have friends and family but it's still (for me at least) always felt isolating. You'd think by this point I'd be used to it but some days it really hits you harder than others. I've had brief relationships throughout my life but never anything past one year. Literally a decade later and I still feel the same; lost and disconnected. Sometimes I can't help but think maybe it'll always be this way. I'm in my 30s now and sometimes I feel like I've missed the boat and the good days are truly over. People tell me I am attractive but I know my issue is I can be awkward at times (especially talking to really attractive people) which puts people off. I know it's a skill talking to people and I know I have to put in the effort to make this change, but holy F lately I've had zero motivation to learn anything new. I do consider myself lucky and fortunate. I have a job, food to eat and a roof over my head. I am grateful because I know how much harder some people have it. But some days I just can't help but feel so down in the dumps because it feels like as time goes on, more and more people slip away from your circle while making new connections just seems harder and harder. I've had a couple of negative encounters with strangers on the street these past few months which had added to my paranoia and feelings of being undesirable. I am skeptical of therapy but I figure I should at least try it before dismissing it. Everyone has issues but not everyone bothers to deal with them. Anyway, this is just another venting post. Despite all this BS, a small part of me is still hopeful. Not just with being in a meaningful relationship but connecting with others more. They say your vibe attracts your tribe, so I'm hoping my vibes will resonate eventually. I know a lot of us here in this thread are dealing with similar issues. I don't have any real solution but I guess what I'll say is, keep that little bit of hope alive. You're not alone in feeling alone. And to anyone who read this, I wish you all the best and success in the world.

5120,ScumRunner,1654167707,1,"Just looking to see if anyone here has this issue. 

So, for as far as I can remember I've never loved anyone including my family. This sounds terrible, but to be clear, I absolutely wish the best for everyone in my life, try to support and spend time with them as best as I can and have lots of great platonic relationships. No issues sympathizing. (bit of guilt as I sometime have to fake some love/empathy more than I'd like)

This is becoming a problem as I'm pretty much unable to form any romantic/intimate relationships and becoming increasingly lonely. Stuck with online dating. It's okay; I do have some fun, but largely end up feeling hopeless. Generally, my emotional detachment is eventually felt and things just end amicably. (aside from all the ghosting pre-date, which sucks) I'm only sometimes willing to up-play any emotional attachment a tiny bit and hope I feel something. Never do, and usually just take to long to escalate and let her become disinterested. 

All my previous relationships were essentially friends with benefits. I believe two girls have fallen in love with me, and still feel bad that I was unable to return it.

My best guess is that I have some flavor of anxious attachment. When I was young I definitely felt more than average social anxiety.

I've gone to a couple therapists and was primarily treated for depression. It was definitely intertwined with lack of intimacy, but had other external reasons at the time (went back to engineering school, while working full time and part time in the Guard) I'm not currently depressed (getting there), nor on any medications.

Just going to list some stuff I've seen suggested to people in somewhat similar situations.

Don't believe I'm on the autism spectrum. Definitely sexually attracted to women with a normal sex drive. Pretty healthy overall. Don't think I'm any type of sociopath. Relatively successful in the rest of my life.

It would be a great thing if we could raise them up, change their patterns , but more often than not it is thier patterns that end up getting inside and changing us. 
The reason is simple- humans are extremely susceptible to the moods, emotions , and even the ways of thinking of those with whom they spend their time.
     The incurably unhappy and unstable have particularly strong infecting power because their characters and emotions are so intense. They often present themselves as victims, making it difficult, at first, to see their problems you have been infected by them.

Hey, so um I keep rejecting this guy I met online. We talked for over a year I think. Idk. We literally met on a discord server not kidding yall, we are both the same age just 6months differences. 
👉👉👉If you don’t want to read all, this, go to the last paragraph 👈👈👈

We started off as Minecraft friends, then we elevated the only texting about Minecraft to flirting online. All this stuff lead to lewd stuff and all. I didn’t actually minded it, I was fine with it. I think I got used to the attention he gave me when we did the stuff. I really like attention and stuff and he gave it to me the first 2-3 months but then idk we got both busy and stuff. 

If I had to describe myself in 5 words I’d say: overthinking, jealous, needy, egoistic and selfish. I know I’m not showing myself at my best..I always liked attention, only child, all attention to me, often got complimented etc. My parents made sure to keep me humble and stuff but I’m my head I’m like over the standard. 

You need to understand that all the time we talked to each other I kept talking about his real life and who could be his lover and stuff. It’s like erm looking if he actually liked me and he most often said, *my name* I only like you. Do you understand that? This stayed in my head, but the thing I didn’t understand that his word were just some online shit everyone say. We randomly texted each other but busy with school we answered maybe 2-3 times per months. Then we started talking again, but he was mostly talking then flirt then straight to lewd stuff. I still enjoyed it because he gave me attention but like idk how to say. 

After a little moment he started joking about getting a ticket to come see me to do lewd stuff as a joke I said yes, but I kinda didn’t thought much about a joke but more of a real relationship thing. I was asking if he was only going to come for the lewd stuff and  proceeded to tell me he wanted to Take me out on date, cuddle and watch tv show, do couple stuff. Then he kept going with his own life and family problem, I left him alone since he seemed to want to be alone and stuff, I still checked on him time to time. Then he came back, and lewd stuff started again. 

The thing is that I keep starting conversation if it wasn’t for lewd stuff, I always text first. I do everything first unless he wants something from me. I get attention only when he wants something from me and I feel like I got used to it. So to get his attention I talk about the thing and all. I feel used but at the same time it’s my fault for letting him stay in my life. Recently we added each other’s snap and all(we first talked on discord yah know). And like I know it’s bad but I used to check his localization to see if he would answer me and stuff. I understand people can be busy I’m not used to be a second choice. I get attached to fast it’s bad. Also there are another one that give me all the attention I want, I make sure to tell them I’m not interested in love since the lewd guy is still in my life. But it clearly show how if he wanted he would. The other text me every morning check up on me, we don’t even do lewd stuff just talk about life deep stuff and all. 

I recently deleted this guy I talked to from my snap because I was being overly obsess with him, I checked his localisation to see if he was active and if he would answer me. I really only want his attention but he doesn’t give it to me and I become mad over some5ing I should talk to him about. I push him away I don’t say everything in my mind, I don’t tell him my feelings. But he never ask for them. it’s only when he wants stuffs from me that he give me attention. I realized it’s bad so I deleted him, but he told me he don’t understand why I’m being like that. I just sound jealous and crazy. Idk what to do anymore, he’s good and bad to me",lonely,I am being jealous but caring for them/nsfw?,2022-06-02 20:06:49
5127,111jonokimyay,1654163612,1,"Hello, im 22M and i suffer from heavy anxiety and am extremely introverted which makes me afraid of meeting new people and even going outside. I've been trapped in a 2 year depression fight and im loosing badly, ive even considered sucide and researched many painless ways to die and how much it would cost. Im too afraid to tell my family that i dropped out of school and about my depression.

My depression all started when my brother moved to korea for the army and my parents moved to hawaii for work the same month i graduated. I moved to a one bedroom apartment all by myself. I suddenly felt so alone and scared of all the responsibilities i have to face. I need some sort of sound (usually music or a video) and the lights on 24/7. I also, use video games and buying things i like to distract myself. 

Ive been struggling a lot more recently because im moving to hawaii to my family in a month so im cleaning and packing all my stuff and my family's stuff. Everyday is a struggle and im sore constantly. The emptier my apartment gets and the tougher everyday gets, i become more lonely and scared. I have no friends that care enough about me and im too scared to tell my family. So i found this reddit group and am making this post now. I would love some encouragement, people telling i will be ok, and people who will give me a little care.",lonely,Far away from Family and scared,2022-06-02 19:53:32

5168,Pinecone_Potential,1654142338,1,"Something weighing on my mind


I seemed to have somehow pushed all my friends away throughout my life. The ones I didn't push away, I simply outgrew. With some, I have made the decision to separate or end friendships with after weighing the pros and cons heavily for a long while. One thing that seems to be similar in all of these situations is that I've been described by nearly all my previous closest, nearest and dearest friends as being selfish, self-centered, having a God-complex, etc... this has caused me to isolate myself from others. I don't intend to be selfish or come off that way at all. I always try to give my whole self to my friends and be as supportive and accepting as I possibly can. I guess I fail at that.


Now, I notice myself asking people frequently to make plans, get together, hang out, etc... with or without kids. I crave friendship and connectedness, but I'm also wary and don't want to unintentionally hurt anyone or drag anyone down.


These plans I ask to make usually don't get planned, and if they do, they rarely end up happening. I'm beginning to realize maybe I'm not someone that people want to spend their time with. I would love to have someone to message or call when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Someone who also feels they can do the same with me when life comes at them full force. I want more than a mom friend who only wants to get together if a playdate is in the books. Sometimes I just want to talk about life with someone who isn't my husband or family. I'd love to drive around with a friend and share stories and woes about life with one another. 


I've always had a hard time making friends, and an even harder time keeping them. I'm truly envious of the people I know who have had lifelong friendships. All of the friend I have been closest with in my life are completely absent from my life. I don't have any friends. I have mom *friends* that sometimes I can get to meet up for a playdate, but it feels like that's the cap for it. No one wants to spend their time with me, its more about getting our kids together.


I am lonely. I want a friend. I want someone to ask me to hang out for a change. I want someone to attempt to make plans with me. I'm always the one asking others if they want to get together. Even when they say yes, it never ends up happening. It's like I have put them between a rock and a hard place so they say yes with the plan of not ever making a plan. 


I wish someone wanted to spend time with me.

I wish someone wanted to be my friend.

I wish someone would be more specific about how I'm selfish and why I'm not a good friend or why people don't want to be around me. I really don't get it and I feel like I give my whole self and am always the listening ear in friendships. I rarely even talk about my own life with the friends I have had in the past because they always have so much going on and I'm the one who listens and gives advice and support when it's needed.


I actively try to make new friends, make plans with people I already am acquainted with, invite people to events and other things happening. All of my attempts seem to fall short.

It makes me look so unapproachable but I can't help it.  It's a horrible thing to say but I've realized all along that It wasn't the friendship or the connection that I craved, It's the moments and memories that come with that friendship. I've had so many chances to build up these relationships but I never committed to any of them, and I expect people to be there for the moment when I'm never actually there for them.

I've been reaching out to so many people and they always subtly reject my offers and I know why; I have never had a genuine conversation with any of them that's relatable nor have I had the chance to get to truly know them either.

I will do a summary about my old post's. I was feeling a bit lonely and all that shit you know, and some weeks ago while i was doing gymnasium with my classmates a girl talk to me and we conected a bit like she knew that i was feeling a bit bad and things so we talk, then that day ended and i kept thinking about talking to her again like saying, Hey what you said it was pretty refreshing, now i know that someone knows that i exist and all that things. But when we were suppose to talk we didn't like everyone started to talk to her and i couldn't and i felt pretty stupid, so the next day i was like ok i'll talk to her today, i'm going to say this so i don't have to write everthing we didn't talk i felt bad and had to threw up so i said to her that i would like to talk the next day that was this monday, just to make everything sorter we didn't talk i felt stupid again you can imagen how things went. And today i was going to talk to her like i had 100000 times to say hey do you want to talk but i didn't and like just thinking of not talking to her i feel remorse but today we were waiting with some of my classmates and her and i felt lonely like everyone was happy talking to her and obviously i was alone so i wanted to like go away and i was thinking that someone would notice that i mist but no one did except one of my classmates, so i was like ok this is not for me.

The only thing that i want to do is talk to her, whenever i don't do it i feel remorse and everytime that i will do it i don't so i start feeling like i'm stupid, i feel like no one cares about me again and i like the girl but she talk's to one of my ""friends/classmates"" and i think that she like's him so i don't want to go talk to her and say hey i like you and she replays with i like someone else. My problem is the only thing that i want (at least) is a frind so be his friend. So to just go to the point i feel lonely, i feel like i don't have friends, the only person that cared about me for like 5 minutos now it's just waiting for me to do the first step but i can't so i just want to cry or just vanish from the world, the thing is that if i don't talk to her in my brain i think that she thinks that i don't care about her and its you not like that it's the opossite of that i don't know what to do know some times when i imagen talking to her i'm like hey can i just hug you like at this point the only thing that i want is a hug.",lonely,This days/weeks i been feeling like a rollercoaster of emotions,2022-06-02 11:41:19

On my mom's side, ever since I was four or five, everyone would always play video games rather than do stuff or interact with me. I have grown up being isolated at home. My father would play with me, but going between houses every other week from when I was in 4th grade was a pain. I was constantly living two different lives. One life, where I'm at my mom's house, isolated from my family that is always playing video games, I eat the bare minimum to stay alive (frozen dinners and sandwiches that consist of cream cheese and cinnamon). My mom also lives in a quiet neighborhood where people don't really play outside. The other is where I am with my dad, who works to give me a proper breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and he would play with me. I also played with our neighbor who is the same age as me. Growing up like this was a pain. It is like reading two different books simultaneously while trying not to mix any of the details between them. Living alone like this made me introverted and isolated. At my mom's house, I would play on the Xbox. It was hard to keep friends I could always play with because I was swapping houses every week. Also, the only friend I had, had abandoned me in seventh grade saying that he never wanted to be with me or hang out with me ever again. I helped this guy in fourth or fifth grade by becoming his friend and helping him get along with others, but this is his way of saying thanks. This is when I became isolated from everyone outside my house and when I became more anxious and started to have social withdrawal. My dad moved houses around this time because of rent, so I lost my neighbor that I would always play with. From these events, I became even quieter as a person. I was initially quiet because my mom and siblings never cared about me. The most famous line the younger of my two sisters, who is two years older than me, said to me is for me to ""go die in a hole."" She probably said that to me around one hundred times. My brother, four years older than me, would always bully me at the house. This happened to me from when I was in first grade (a year after my parent's divorce) and lasted until, you guessed it, I was in seventh grade. My brother was a  junior in high school doing this. I thought seven was supposed to be a lucky number, but I guess it's only lucky for everyone but me. Oh, and by bullying me, I mean; my brother would chase me around the house, pin me to the ground to where I can't move, and take sharp objects like knives or scissors and put the blade up against my chest, my neck, or my face. Still, nobody cared about me, not my mom, nor my sisters. I've never told anyone about this until now. If the people closest to me never cared about me or what happened to me, I've always thought, who would? If you have read this far, thank you. There is so much more I could keep writing about, but I would turn this into a biography about my life if it hasn't already started to sound like one.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years, I've thought of multiple ways to end my life because of how I was treated, but I never do. I even have a list of some ideas I've had. I guess the reason I haven't killed myself yet is that I don't want to leave my parents with sorrow or distress, and it isn't that I necessarily want to die. I just don't want to keep living the life I have. I want to have a happy normal life where I have normal people or friends who I can talk with or hang out with. People who enjoy me for who I am and won't abandon me once I help them with their life. But that's clearly asking for too much.",lonely,I'm a 20 year old guy who hasn't had a friend or someone to socialize with for at least eight years.,2022-06-02 09:06:42
5209,FungiApathy,1654124666,1,"For 2 years I was completely alone no friends, no family. I felt like a failure in every aspect of life. I became suicidal and had to move back home after suffering from mental illness and failing classes. In August before I moved back I met a family friend we didn’t talk much but I thought she looked really cute. My parents said when she came to visit it was like I was still there because we’re so alike. 

And then she came on a trip with us in December to LA. We hit it off and talked a lot more. I realized that my parents were right and we had a ton in common almost freakishly alike when it came to opinions, sense of humor, and music taste. We became good friends over the winter. I developed a crush almost instantly. We could talk all night, and I always wanted to be with her.

As spring came around she made other friends and hung out with them more and more, and I started to realize that maybe she wasn’t physically attracted to me. We grew a little distant but remained friends. But we both knew it was never going to last. I move out in a month for college she just moved out today. We go in opposite directions as well. And the last couple days before she left we talked more than we had in a couple months.

She gave me hope again. I thought she would be attracted to me if I lost weight so I lost 30lbs since December. If I lost 10-20lbs I would be at my goal weight I wish she would’ve seen that. I realized that there are people out there who actually like me and want to talk with me. I had someone to talk to about everything really for once. It was such a breath of fresh air.

Today we all said goodbye to her at the airport it was very emotional for everyone. I fought hard to hold back the tears. But when it really hit me is when we immediately went to Costco and for the first time in months she wasn’t there and I had no one to talk to and make jokes with. I separated myself from my family and speed walked aimlessly around the entire store to fight the pain. 

I’m back where I started I have no one once again, just like when I graduated high school. She’s gone. What do even do? Even now I just want to talk to her again. I want to play games with her again. I feel like she’ll be back again like when she went on vacation to see her uncle, but in reality it may be a year or 2 before I see her again and maybe I never will. Where do I go? What do I do? I have a void in heart as corny as that sounds.

I don’t want to meet new people again I just wanted to be with her. I know there’s billions more people but she’s the only one I want to see rn. I need to work and exercise to take me mind off it all because I know I will spiral again. Why do people always leave? Why do my own friends not want to be close with me? Why can’t I find just one person who will like me and stay with me? Why am I cursed to be so damn alone? I MISS YOU SO MUCH YOU MEANT SO MUCH TO ME YOU HELPED ME THROUGH SO MUCH!

5210,livvymax,1654124477,1,"And I think she makes excuses instead of just telling me




We’re childhood friends who reconnected, I tell her everything she knows me so well and says she loves me. I feel like I always have to make plans. We did go out more often when we lived closer but it was usually just to go shopping or to walk her dog.


Plus she’d never actually invite me, i had to invite/ask her or she’d be like “I’m goin ____ if u wana join” which just reads as “idc if you come or not”. I went shopping with her again last christmas. The last time I saw her was in January lmao when again we only went shopping and cinema (and I travelled to her) but we text all the time


We said we’d go out for Valentines she even said “take me skating” but then nearer the time she was like “hmm” “depends how busy it is” so I got the hint she wasn’t arsed and left it. 


I suggest she can sleep over at mine, have cocktails etc. but she hates sleepovers. But she has had sleepovers with her other friend group when they have gatherings/parties. Granted she might complain about it but still, the fact she isnt bothered enough about my company to do that for me offends me. I have said she can just come over she doesn’t have to stay over, but she never has.  I’ve lived here for over a year. I don’t get it if i had a friend who wanted me to come to their house I’d be stoked ??? she does have depression so shes not excited about a lot of things but she does go to her friends house for video game nights. I was always asking to have a game/movie night


I suggested going on holiday bc we were meant to go abroad before covid and she said she’s not going on holiday this year, or she’s used up all her holidays (on other people) already


Sometimes I back off bc I text a lot but then she does text me a few days later so I don’t think she dislikes me??? But she hangs out with other people and does all this fun stuff, goes on trips etc. that I only see on her Stories. It hurts. I think I’m just her pen pal she texts when she’s bored, she doesn’t actually give a fuck about spending time with me 💀 


The last time I invited her out, I was near her street (my old town) seeing family so I asked if she was around, (we were talking beforehand) and she ignored. I was waiting around for her to reply and then she did saying she was in, so I said you wanna hang while im here? She disappeared again. So I double text like replyyy I’m at ______. (bc if i ask if she’s around clearly I wanna hang out) then I say I’m gonna go home. She said sorry I left my phone upstairs (???) and I actually didn’t end up going home so I said I’m still here! and she disappeared again. And said she left her phone upstairs again 😭. Sorry but she’s never done that she always has her phone on her so I feel like it was an excuse. Like just fucking say no I’m not feelin it???



So since then, and the last 3 times I got rejected, I decided for once to wait for an invite. Not seen her in 5 months 💀 typical



She’s like my only friend rn. Maybe she senses/knows that and thinks I’m pathetic. But we have fun when we’re together 😭",lonely,My best friend doesn’t wanna hang out w me,2022-06-02 09:01:17

5212,Solacking,1654123919,1,"My relationship with my ex ended almost 3 years ago and for a long time before the end and after the end I did everything to try make it work, eventually after a lot of effort, time, talking, many sacrifices, self improvements and just trying to be friends in the hopes that he would see my worth, I admitted defeat. I was faithful and loyal to him in every sense but this didnt matter to him.

Six months passed and to stop myself drowning in emptyness I started talking anonymously to random people online. It soon became apparent that there was one person I spoke to that I really enjoyed talking to. We started to talk regularly, almost every day. He definetly was interested in me as more than a friend. As time went on I developed more thank just friendly feelings for him and told him, he told me he wasnt ready for anything like a relationship so I accepted it. 

I didnt want to stop talking to him, it wasnt his fault he didnt want anything with me, and he didnt want to stop talking to me either. He is a great guy and I respect what he wants but it feels painful talking to him and realising I am alone in how I feel.

I am also realising that I am so lonely that I have attached myself to this person and Im repeating old behaviours.

Have you ever been so lonely you thought you were in love with someone youve never even met? Not even spoken to properly in a call? 

Just feel so lonely and destroyed from so much rejection that you just dont know what the point is anymore. I dont think I am a bad person, or unattractive and I have a good job and in many ways very successful but when it comes to men, I dont seem to attract or pick people who are good for me.

I have cuts on my hand but not in the right spots, spots where I knew It wouldn’t happen if I cut it…. My friends and family have tried to help me, it came to a point where one of them spent 2-3 hours in my room just to make sure I don’t do it. Alcohol makes it worse, makes me sadder and more depressed than usual. My family is the only reason I haven’t gone through with it yet. I look at them and think what was their fault, how much they’ll suffer and cry when I do it. That’s what stops me every fucking day. It’s painful to live like this. To self sabotage your life because nothing feels good any more. I feel like there’s a void in me that I’ve tried to fill with food, alcohol and everything else but it doesn’t get filled, it will never get filled. I’ll never be truly happy and I don’t know what I should do.

I've tried looking at it objectively and tried to dissect my need for intimacy and love(even in an unromantic sense). I've pondered whether the need for intimacy and personal connections is an innate part of human nature or if it's learned human behaviour, hardwired into us by our socialisation and the emphasis we as a society put on the importance of relationships. The truth is, whatever the cause, I still feel like a part of me is incomplete and will remain so until I find someone to share my love with.

• I am valued by men only for my body &amp; never for my heart.
• I am valued by my friends only for my open ear and flexibility and encouragement I give, but am never greeted with tolerance or love or support myself.
• I am valued by my roommates only because I’m easy and understanding und helpful all the time, no one every makes time for me or makes space for me.
• I am valued by my job because I’m dedicated, but no one gives a shit about my well-being.

I am just giving and giving and giving constantly, because I never want anyone to feel as insignificant, lonely and hurt as I have felt and still feel sometimes, which I guess is the problem. 

But I just want someone to put their arm around me in public, to give me the feeling of safety and belonging, to make me feel like they are proud and happy to have me in their life. And it feels so ridiculous to want something so basic, to admit I’m dependent on someone else’s approval. But to some extent I am. I love myself and I know I am a loving and wonderful person, I do well on my own and I don’t (want to) need anyone.

Guess I should have been used to it by now. 
But here I am. Feeling it in my bones, eating away my will to live, till I desperately try to search solace in another movie, my new script, a painting perhaps, or music. 

The paradox stays unsolved. Night after night, week after week, year after year .. Loneliness drives me to seek refuge in things that remind me exactly why it might not be a good reason to split my wrists or let myself OD on the pills. I mean, the dead can't watch a Paul Thomas Anderson film and get blown away by the deliciously flawless use of multiple compositions and cam movements, can they? The dead can't watch their favorite football team lift the Champions League, and for one day at least, feel the sky to be a bit bluer than usual. The dead can't taste those amazing burger and fries that the guy by the corner of the next street lets me have for free in exchange of me helping him with his night school Maths papers. 

Like I said, 
the paradox stays unsolved. 

It's loneliness that makes me discover why I've never been able to hate this life, in spite of being so horrible in the company of people, always.. in spite of being that guy who never makes friends.. in spite of being that guy whose lovers have always find a reason to leave, no matter how much he tries to mold himself into the cheery bloke full of life that they demand him to be. 

And it's this loneliness that makes me want to pull the curtains down.. to let the darkness flood in. Once and for all.

As we got older my grandma died, my uncle became estranged and my brother developed mental issues and no longer associates with us. My mum has since moved over an hour away.

Growing up I always had a close group of friends so I never felt that alone until they all partnered up and are now leading they're own life's. 

I thought I got lucky when I found a partner and out of desperation i got married. My husband is estranged from everyone in his family and is a lone wolf who barely spends any time with me so I've found myself here at 31f spending most of my days alone. I've even tried to start my own family but have failed to get pregnant with over two years of trying.

Now I really regret my life. I always told myself that I would compensate for having a small family by marrying into a big one and I've done the total opposite. I told myself I would have at least four children and I've failed to have even one. I can't even get a dog because I'm renting and my landlord would never allow. I can't even make friends new because I'm introverted and people don't seem to gravitate towards me. 

It hurts knowing that I have so much family out there but I feel like an orphan. I'm so jealous of people with good families who get together and do things like parties and BBQs.

This year started off great, like it was amazing. In class, i sat next to people i wanted to talk to and i knew that feeling was reciprocated. i was rly happy with my friends and everything felt fine. i made new friends in my class and they seemed to genuinely like me. but my seat was switched and i sit right in front of the teacher. 

so heres a list of events that led to me feeling lonely 25/8

1. No one I really knew sat near me and everyone who sat around me seemed to dislike me and never really talked to me.
2. Everyone else that i was kinda close with sat miles away from me in the classroom, they all made new friends. i can't blame them, i understand that they're really smart, funny, interesting and fun to hang out with, all of which i try to be but fail miserably at. maybe they never felt i was a friend after all, but those friends i made at the start of the year did instinctively hang out with me. so i ended up with absolutely no friends
3. I realised i don't have a friend group and i probably have differing interests from everyone. i am into startups and pop music but everyone else seems to focus on tests and other stuff that i rly suck at. one of my ""friends"" plays basketball every day but my hand-eye coordination is shit and i think he even chased me out of the basketball court once. so i don't have any group to feel comfortable with and hang out with. and everyone else has one friend group one way or another. heck, at the start of the year, someone made a group chat made up of everyone who sat at the bottom-left corner of the classroom, which is where i sit, but they didnt add me in cos reasons. when someone else added me in, they responded with ""bruh why"". and someone sitting in the centre of the classroom got added. this week has been horrendous to open instagram because everyone's hanging out in their friend group this week. and im this loser who spent all his time alone watching gaming videos in his bedroom
4. every one of the ""friends"" i made have already moved on to people smarter, funnier, more interesting and more fun to hang out with. in school, i just try to find someone to go for lunch with and im feeling rly desperate at this point.

You can rant about anything, he can listen to it and give shitty advice 

Well he share lame memes tooo

He is preparing for the SAT and might prepare for APs like self study, if you have advice on college, majors and stuff help this poor guy. He's 17 and still has no idea what he wants to be 

He likes to do origami, Sketching he recently started doing both of them. So, he sucks a lot in it. I wanna have some more cool hobbies. Suggest some hobbies for me 

He might learn to cook as well, it's cool tbh, well he wants to move to usa. So, just wanted to be independent I guess but is not independent. Every thing is done by his mum from washing clothes to cooking

He reads novels, he tried reading Hindi and Urdu novels but heck it's hard, I think he might wanna improve it or start off reading something simple before moving on to something complex. He did read some English novels though. He has started a lil time ago. So, he didn't read many. He will be having holidays. So, he will be on a reading spree. You can suggest some 

He likes to listen songs and podcasts, his taste is real stupid, it goes from pop to classic in no time. He listend hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi, hebrew songs a lot 

He likes to watch movies and series. So suggest some, rn i am watching 2 broke girls and American dad ( he even forgot the name)

Because I never did before. 

I hate who I am. Why am I like this. Why can’t I change? I’m so tired. I want to give up. Go away forever. Drift away. I want to run away. I’m awake at night, but I’m not alive.

The one who was filled with passion about going to school, making music, reading, going outside to admire the sky, the buildings, the trees, hell even the bugs. When did he die? When did I abandon who I was for this shell of a man. This pathetic waste. Hollow inside. Bleak outside.

I cry myself to sleep. I force myself to wake up. I have no motivation. The fake smiles, they’re wearing down on me. The social interactions, I’m making it more obvious that I want no part in them. This is no life worth living. Nothing here looks the same. Everyday, the colors fade away. Everyday, my life ahead of me blurs. The fleeting moments of bliss I catch throughout the week give me a weaker high every time. The same thing everyday. I’m no longer living, but I don’t want to survive, so what do I do? I can’t leave because I don’t want to make the people around me sad. I’ll feel guilty if I leave them like that. But I can’t live like this either. Nothing helped. Nothing helps. I am not alive.

This made me think that romantic love is not the cure to this infinite void that takes over my life right now.

Lately I've been getting hypertension (much too young for it) along with the constant weakness and pain in my legs (plus sometimes arms) that's been there for years, I get light headed from just trying to walk across the house and my legs feel like they'll give out if I try to walk a block. I live off of advil (talking to a doctor already, no clue yet, who knows if I'll ever know what it is)

It feels like my life has just become my bedroom, I can't leave comfortably anymore, especially since I get weaker and weaker the longer I can't do things like I used to

I'm still in school, now that the school year is over for me and the people I knew don't have to talk to me while we're in the same rooms together all day, I talk to nobody but my parents. The constant monotony and isolation of feeling stuck in my bed with no conversations to take me out of it has really been getting to me.

I had maybe one person who I knew had more important people in their life and I suspect was still talking to me a bit out of pity ghost me. Nobody else I knew talked to me over text or outside of group settings, even when we had been around each other for years. I thought I was lonely being around people but feeling like I never connected, but genuinely talking to nobody is a new level of it (not to downplay the other kind of loneliness either). I'm too socially stunned to talk much in online groups anyways, I've only ever really had one close friend and the friendship slowly fell apart in a way where I haven't been able to get it back yet.

Hell it's been barely any time at all with these new circumstances but I'm already cracking. 

I'm not usually the type to dump my problems to strangers on the internet, but my poor parents worry enough with my health, their health, and our lives right now to have to hear about the full extent of my mental and social issues, even with the snippets they know.

Ive always wanted a nice loving guy to spend time with.

Today I saw this str8 couple and it made me so sad. The man was so handsome and I longed for him. I became upset that he would never want me and jealous that he found love and I didnt, so I started hating him, fiery anger. His girlfriend was very beautiful and I was jealous of her for having a handsome man and also jealous of the man for having a beautiful partner. I was upset that his dreams and longings were met. I was jealous at everything he had and I wanted to see them both sad.

I know VERY well my emotions are wrong. It’s unhealthy, and it causes me more pain. But its so hard to stop. Because im lonely and just want love kindness and companionship and im so hurt. To stop the hurt I use anger and hatred. I tried to make myself understand its okay im gay, its okay im a person of color, its okay im lonely, but my mind has so much self hatred and turns to anger in defense.

5345,xoxoxo734,1654052674,1,"I literally created a reddit just because I want a place to share my experiences with people who may understand. I don't know who or if anyone is going to read this, but I hope to at least get this off my chest. The title may raise a few eyebrows but it's true. I've received plenty of compliments from girls, and lots of attention when I had clout on twitter so I know I'm good looking but I still feel like I'm in a hopeless place when it comes to relationships.

I grew up in a religious household where relationships that weren't going to directly lead to marriage were strictly forbidden (i.e no dating till you are in a place financially to be able to do so). Because of this, through my middle school years I was in an awkward place because I wanted a relationship of some sort, but I also wanted to stick to my religious and family principles. I still had crushes, and those never ended up working well especially because I was not good looking at the time and I would stay attached to one girl who didn't like me, missing other possible opportunities.

High school rolls around, and I begin liking this new girl who was also of the same religion and I decide I do want a relationship, but I just won't have sex. This was a common practice. Long story short, she went from showing me high interest at first to basically despising me by the end. I had no idea wtf i was doing since i missed my foundation when it comes to relationships in middle school. I was also friendzoned by this other girl, who would continually lead me on and I had essentially faced 2 different major heartbreaks already by senior year. There were also other girls I had tried with in between, but it would always lead to the same result (they lose interest) since I had no idea what I was doing.

Now it's senior year and I had learned about fashion and self improvement. I also had puberty on my side and I was able to glow up. I had tried with girls from other schools, but it is once again the same cycle since my personality would just turn them off and it would take me too long to move on. But I always had hope that if I continue on my self improvement I could one day eventually find someone for me.

Now I'm in first year university. I have high hopes that this could finally be when I could meet someone for me since it is a brand new place with a blank slate. I was able to get this girl's contact and I was able to get her on a date. After the date, she stops responding and basically blows me off. Fast forward and now covid happens and everything is on lock down.

During the covid lock down, i became a heavy user of twitter and I was constantly in group chats. This is the main reason I believe I'm good looking. I would receive a lot of positive attention from some REALLY attractive girls, but of course since it was online, nearly all lived too far away. Regardless, i would still fall for a few but they would usually either end badly because they were toxic, or the distance. Regardless of that, I did meet a cute girl who stood out to me, who lived a couple states away, and we would talk consistently for a long time, through summer 2021.

I did not want to take her too seriously because she lived far away, but instead I was focused on the fact university would be in person again and thus it is another chance for me to meet someone in real life who could be for me. I am an engineering major, so there are few girls in my classes let alone my type. I had tried attending events and I could never find someone who was interested in me or vice versa.

Eventually me and this girl I mentioned earlier started to text and facetime more. I had started to realize that she was exactly my ideal person. It may not be true but it really felt like it was true. We had so much in common and we thought the same and shared the same values, and even finished each others sentences. We even helped each other grow so much. Eventually she had confessed that she had feelings for me, and I had told her I felt the same but was more so hoping we could meet first.

We were basically in a relationship for a couple months, and everything was amazing until it wasn't. The reality of how we were going to meet had to catch up eventually. We are both young and our only hope of meeting was through crossing paths when her and her family travel through my state to visit their family. Eventually we had come to realize that could not happen anymore. This is when things fell apart. She had decided it was best to end things between us because the distance stressed her out too much and that we just ""remain friends"". I respected her decision, it only made sense after all. I did decide it was best we stop contact for a while.

I was absolutely heartbroken and borderline depressed for the months to come. Nothing would make me feel better, all i could do was focus on school (which paid off since i finished with a 3.7 GPA semester). 

That leads me to where I am now. I missed out on so many years of building a foundation to be able to interact with girls in romantic/flirtatious way thanks to being stuck on the same girls in high school and thanks to the covid lockdown. Now I'm just awkward around girls. I never had a first kiss, never had a legit relationship, only person who's hand I held was the girl leading me on in high school, and even with all that, I was still heartbroken on multiple occasions.

Furthermore, I want to mention that I want a healthy and fulfilling relationship. Not just a relationship. I can't bring myself to just take anyone in order not to feel lonely anymore. I want someone kind of like that girl I met online. Where we could grow together and avoid all the toxicity. That's partially to blame too since I'm holding out for someone that I want to be really good for me, and that is hard to find.

Regardless, as I grow older, it's getting even more weird that I never even had a first kiss and that my flirting skills aren't on point which makes me awkward around women. They always say being single isn't a bad thing and to focus on yourself, but having done so much self improvement after senior year I just feel like its getting old to be single. I feel like I had focused on myself enough, even if it may not be true that's how I feel. The fact I don't believe I'm an ugly guy makes it even more confusing. I just don't know what to do. I don't know how true it actually is, but now I feel like I'm doomed to be single forever and it sucks a lot.",lonely,"I am a 21 year old male, decently looking, never had a relationship and feel like I never will",2022-06-01 13:04:34

Looking back at my teenage years I always thought that dating happened around freshman year of high school and everything else happened a year or so after that but when I hit grade 7 I had somewhat of a culture shock.

All of my friends had significant others in their lives and I felt like a third wheel. I do very well in school (educationally) and was told that if I focus on my studies every thing in life would be easier but that's just not the case. (This leads into the bigger conversation about how gifted kids are actually special needs but thats a topic for another day) 

I guess I just feel that I missed out on a lot of the big social growing experiences that you have as a teenager and when/if I find someone special the magic won't be the same since that other person has statistically already had their first kiss and gone through break-up.

it really makes me upset since i know i’m going to see people post about it on social media and even though i’ll try to avoid social media that day, i’ll end up seeing those posts or stories eventually. i’m not too upset about missing the senior trip anymore which is a trip to an amusement park 3 hours away since i figured it was for the best since i get really carsick and i’ll have other chances to go to amusement parks in the future. 

however i’m really upset about missing out on prom because it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity. i feel like i’ve always imagined it as a kid. like i even had a dress planned out which was a gift from my grandmother and i usually don’t really wear fancy dresses but i figured prom would be the perfect opportunity. at school i don’t really put much effort into my looks and i’m not necessarily attractive either, so i guess i wanted to go to prom to show off a bit and show people what they’re missing out on. 

i have a school senior bbq coming up but i’m not really looking forward to it because i’m going to see a lot of ppl i don’t want to see. plus all we would do is eat and sign yearbooks which doesn’t seem like as much fun as the other events. i’m not even going to graduation either especially hearing how my friends aren’t going and i couldn’t bear to sit alone anxiously for a few hours just to get a peace of paper. i guess it really sucks since i know class of 20 and 21 missed out on their senior events so i felt like maybe i should’ve taken advantage of my opportunities but i couldn’t. i really wanted my last year of high school to be enjoyable but it’s just been a really rough year for me.",lonely,missing out on senior events,2022-06-01 12:36:46

I'm turning 23 towards the end of June, and I will spend another birthday alone. Meanwhile the people around me create groups within themselves that don't include me, so they build connections and memories and I'm left wondering ""when the hell did that happen"" when everyone starts acting close. Everything I say I feel like people are judging me, and I can't get that bug out of my head. I know everyone thinks I'm a freak. I wish someone cared about me enough to try and see that I'm a normal person too like everyone else, but instead I'm stuck looking through a glass window into what everyone else calls ""life"".

I'm in so much pain everyday, but no one knows because I don't show it, and I can't show it because I know nobody will care. I've tried in the past, and bearing your heart to others only ends in disappointment and heartbreak. It's truly every man for himself out there, and unless you can provide something to someone or are a convenience to them then you might as well not even exist.

Hello world!
Life is short and I’m hoping to connect with the like-minded, open-minded, and free-spirited people that don’t take life for granted.
My life has had its ups and downs just like anyone’s, and being hard-headed has been a fault of mine that has taken years to navigate. As an aspiring author who has written four satiric-creative nonfiction novels, a science fiction novel and a crime fiction trilogy that includes international crime, steroid/opiate abuse, and the deep dark web, I’ve come to love art and literature. Recently, I also decided to write my first movie script. It’s about an archaeologist that unearths ancient alien technology that was used to build the pyramids, Stonehenge and the Mayan temples. Writing saved my life. Being incarcerated saved my life as well, for without it I’m not sure I would have found the kind of passion for life that I have today.
A few of my other talents and hobbies include being a street artist, an HVAC technician, a soon-to-be CDL truck driver, and horrible singer. I’ve had the pleasure of meetingDub Step, Pop and Rap or my musical preferences. I’m an exercise maniac too.
If you’re interested in corresponding with a guy that’s been told he has no filter, write back. If not, but you LOVE vulgarity, write back! Let’s do this! I can’t wait!

I somehow understand the social norms yet I fail to follow them. This makes it incredibly hard to establish any relation whatsoever. 

Yes, I don't see the boundaries people see, and even when I do, I don't want to respect them because I find them stupid. Yes, I rush things. Yes, I might have some questionable opinions. I love talking to people but even people that tell me they like talking to me never really text back by themselves, it always, always has to be me. Yes, I want a relationship, you accept a chat invite from a guy with an account like mine and think I want to just chat?

Yes, I understand whoever is reading this must think I'm a prick. I guess I am. Yes, I understand it's my fault. No, I don't know how lower I could possibly go with my expectations and preferences. The only thing I'd call a preference is that I want to chat with a girl. There's literally nothing else.

Are you telling me, there isn't a single girl that doesn't like the stupid social norms same as I do and want to skip to something more interesting without the brain hurting slow progress people are keen on doing usually?

5407,Dr_Manhattan86,1654028162,1,"The girl that I've been dating for nearly a year left me for good yesterday. 

The relationship itself had its red flags, but I decided to ignore them because they weren't related to her as a person, but rather to the circumstances (long distance). 
I know for sure that she hasn't cheated on me or met someone else, so that's out of question. 

She was, still is, special. We still keep in touch because we both are lonely and we like each other's company, but unfortunately, as she told me yesterday morning at 4:45 am on our second video call of that day:
""I would like us to stop looking for a relationship. I've come to the conclusion that I don't want nothing more than a friendship with you."" 

It hurt. Fuck, if it hurt. 

For nearly a year she's been pursuing me, wanting a relationship. Hoping -and telling me about such hope- that I was the right guy for her. She joked and sometimes we both even fantasised about us getting married, and looking back at how we met and laugh, while our kids slept. 

But she left me. 

The reason why she left me is because, as she has already expressed back in April, she didn't find me attractive enough for her - which was a huge hit to my self-confidence. Girls usually look and smile at me, either at pubs, clubs or simply while I'm outdoors walking -. 

So now all I'm left with is a dark room, enlightened only by my PC's monitor light, a few bottles of empty beers on the floor and pain that comes haunting me each time I wake up, making me cry.

() im always alone but it's not cause none wants me to be around me. i made it this way i isolated myself from everyone i wanted to be alone. when im alone no one can hurt me it's just myself to blame. i stay alone in my small bedroom while everyone else lives there lives, go to the gym, hang out with friends. but i just can't find a motivation to do all the that. i don't wanna be alone but im so scared of other people. it's cliche to say ive been hurt to many times and it is, but there's no other way to put it. im terrified of other people and starting relationships and leaving the house. my very first boyfriend raped me when i was 14-15 years old everyday for 9 months he was 16-17. people ask me why didn't i say anything if it went on more months, i don't know. i didn't know what he was doing to me was bad i just knew i hated it and wanted it to stop, he would ask me and force me to do things i don't even remember anymore and i would go home afterwards and just cry and scrub myself but never feeling clean i had thought all this was normal. The justice system did nothing when i told people what happened and told me i waited to long to say anything. it had only been 5 months. apparently some of my male friends had all agreed i was lying and told people that. he is 18 and dating a freshman girl i hope she's safe. im scared of men like him im so scared to be taken advantage of again it's so easy and there's no repercussions to the offender. my second boyfriend he was sweet but had a lot of issues. our relationship was unstable and toxic when we did finally break up he spread rumors about me to a lot of people and it made alot of people dislike me but honestly i can't care enough. i don't care what he told those people they won't remember me after high school anyways. i don't know if i like being alone i feel so sad and empty all the time there's no joy. everyday i wake up and repeat the same day excepting something else everyday. did you know that's the definition of insanity? repeating something excepting a different outcome when you know it's not gonna happen. i like being alone here i just listen to music, draw and just get rlly lost in my own thoughts like i am now. ive been depressed my whole life since childhood ive had a diagnosis. i don't know how to explain it to someone but the best way to put my depression into words is, it feels like there's this overwhelming dread of sadness like a cloud that suffocates your mind with thoughts of sadness and grief but it's unexplainable you're sad and upset and feel like crawling into a hole and just never leaving but there's no reason why. even in the happiest of moments i want to breakdown crying cause i know it won't last none of the joy i feel last it's all momentarily and then just like that it's gone and im stuck feeling sad again. I've been that my whole life i wonder what it's like for someone my age who grew up differently maybe was just born with luck or had a privilege to grow up better, i want to know what they see the world as. i don't want to feel like im wasting away in this room but where else can i go? i don't want to directly kill myself lets state that i don't know what's on the other side but i feel like maybe it's better and calmer then this life, i wanna know how my grandfather is doing after he passed i miss him so much. im definitely not also against the idea of dying in some freak accident i don't want it to be of my own hands i couldn't bring that guilt into my family, thinking about my dad, my little brothers and my cats those are the only things that stop me from killing myself. i know my dad wouldn't be able to handle my death, my little brothers are to young to understand what happened to me and i can't put that on anyone else to explain, my cats are the only things that showed me loved during my most darkest of times. i want to be happy i want to be surrounded with friends and love but im so scared all ive known is just being secluded by myself i wish i wasn't like this. i wish i was happy i wish i never let any of those men touch me when i was younger i wish i had understood what was happening to me and told someone sooner i wish i didn't feel like this all the time i want to feel clean and happy that's all i want to feel loved so badly every person who said they loved me ended up hurting me. why? why did i have to be born like this why did i have to grow up so depressed? why am i so sad? why do i feel insane? i am i really that hard to love?",lonely,some writing,2022-06-01 03:10:00

All men who love me and then wake up one day and decide they don’t anymore. But, I’m never given a reason why. And the way I see it is, without “feedback” I can’t really “fix” anything. Maybe they’re just being polite. Maybe my entire being is something you just stop loving or is hard to love. But in your experience, what has made you gone from loving someone to suddenly not anymore? Maybe I can see if any examples apply to me and try fixing it so that if/when somebody else ever comes along, they don’t leave like the rest.",lonely,What makes somebody unlovable?,2022-06-01 02:51:52

5438,Roboticcatisgreen,1654014967,1,"I thought it would be neat to do a small fundraiser for a local charity (no kill pet shelter) for my birthday on Facebook. I put the goal low at $100 because I don’t have a lot of Facebook friends (122) and of those, lots of people don’t follow me, or really talk to me much, or are poor/struggling so I wouldn’t expect them to donate. 

My mom, sister, dad and best friend who lives far away, all gave me gifts so I knew they wouldn’t donate to it. 

I thought maybe some of my coworkers or other “friends” might donate $5-$10. But nothing. No one donated. 

Then, my sisters friend and her husband donated $50 on my birthday. I was shocked. I’ve only met them twice. My sister said “yeah they like to give money for fundraiser.”

Then, I got a notice the fundraiser ends tomorrow and I was going to login and donate the other $50 so the shelter got the funds I wanted them to have. And I saw my sisters coworker gave $10 and some random lady who lives in my town and I don’t know, donated $100. 

I’m crying. I raised $160 out of a goal of $100. And no one I thought might donate for my birthday, did, and my sisters friends and a stranger did.

Im so happy, I’m so so so grateful at the thoughtfulness of strangers and my sisters friends and coworkers. I appreciate it so much. 

A tiny part of me is sad because I didn’t have any coworkers or acquaintances who donated for me. It was my sisters friends and coworkers and a stranger. It’s a weird feeling. But I won’t focus on that. 

Thought I’d share on here because I wanted to tell someone and for someone to understand.",lonely,Fundraiser for my birthday,2022-06-01 02:36:07
