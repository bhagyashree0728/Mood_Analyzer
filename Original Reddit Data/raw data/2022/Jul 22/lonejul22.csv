4,Accurate_Ant6926,1659273751,1,"I don’t know if anyone else feels like this and I’d really appreciate if someone felt the same, as shitty as it is. 



I’m 19f and have struggled with BPD and major depression for as long as I can remember. But in the last six months or so I feel like I’ve slowly become isolated from everyone else without even meaning to.
Until a month ago I had a full time job. I have a small group of friends who love me. I have a boyfriend and a family. I have a dog. 

Yet every interaction feels forced. No matter how hard I try it doesn’t feel like I’m truly connecting with them. Even when I try to open up and express how I feel it all seems superficial and like no one really gets me. 



A month ago I quit my job to go solo travelling, thinking maybe that would help. Despite having a job I was agoraphobic and struggled to get myself out of the house unless it was for work or to travel to see my boyfriend, who I’m also becoming emotionally estranged to as well. Travelling solo did force me to come out of my shell and yet it didn’t ease the pain at all! I still feel like I’m drowning under water when I see people living their lives and socialising happily. 


Maybe it’s just deep self hatred but I don’t think I fit in. Anywhere. I feel like a monster on display everywhere I go. Nothing brings me joy anymore except for nature and animals because I know they don’t see me as a freak, just another human. 



All I want is to feel like a normal person. I don’t want to be alone in this",lonely,I feel like there is an invisible barrier blocking me from connecting with other people.,2022-07-31 23:22:31

7,Rare-Replacement-175,1659273025,1,"Hello! I posted this in r/agoraphobia but thought it would be helpful here as well! Thanks!


Hello! I am a fellow struggler of depression, anxiety, and yes, agoraphobia. I was perusing the community when I saw a post that made me think that a post about tips for college-aged individuals dealing with agoraphobia would be an awesome thing! I myself am a graduate student who deals with these things, so I thought I’d share what has helped me stay in school and work toward finishing my education. In the comments, please feel free to add your own helpful tips!

1. Most important is to seek treatment for your panic attacks, depression, etc if it has come to the point where your daily life and quality of life is being significantly impacted. 

2. Most people don’t know this, but you qualify for ADA accommodations through your university IF you have: A. a diagnosis of a mental health condition, and B. A letter from your treating physician stating you would benefit from accommodations. These accommodations range from extended testing time, extensions on assignment deadlines, and being excused on times where your mental health is rough or being allowed to leave class if a panic attack happens. Don’t worry: your privacy is of upmost importance and they do not disclose this to professors, Nor do you have to. A letter of accommodations will be made that will state your accommodations that a professor is obligated to provide. All you have to do is communicate the need to us it and communicate with your professors about them. And you’ll be set!

3. Search up your university and counseling to see if your university offers counseling (Most do to students free of charge). This is helpful if you are unable to access care through other means.

4. If things are so rough, please consider a semester off or a gap year to work on yourself. Don’t worry about outside pressures or getting behind: LIFE IS A SPRINT. NOT A MARATHON. Take time to work on you if needed and have no shame in doing so.


5. College can be tough due to adapting to adult life, managing relationships, and new financial pressures. Try to take time to reflect on what you want out of life and make that your focus. Sometimes we get caught up in the future or past so much. You are only young once so please try to spend your time doing things you enjoy. This will help with socializing and your overall mental health, which should hopefully help you manage the stress of school and get the grades you want.

Lastly, I’ll part by saying this: please realize you matter. I tell myself I don’t matter sometimes, but people do care about people in some form. Sometimes people just aren’t good at expressing. Life is hard, but all we can do is try and get out of life what we want through the means we have. Keep fighting the good fight people.

Getting out of an abusive marriage and trying to make friends so that I can get out sometimes and do things.. but there's an issue I didn't foresee. 

I cant befriend girls easily as I'm hella masculine in nature, and end up accuse of stealing their significant others affections, even if I don't talk to their partners when possible, because of previous accusations made by friends...

Then dudes, even married ones, will drop me the moment they find out I'm not going to sleep with them..

So I need to figure out how to navigate friendships, I mean, I don't understand why it always ends up that way, I just want someone to chill and hangout with and have the occasional adventure. :(

10,Accomplished_Bad8636,1659270475,2,"I have always felt lonely. Even though I have a family and friends. My family has never been the loving kind. Ever since I was a child I have been witnessing horrible fights between my parents (sometimes violent). I have friends, and they are really nice, but everyone of them has a loving family so they can't quite feel what I go through. My best friend has really warm and loving parents and I can't help but feel jealous of her. She's really nice and has always been a big support for me but really idk I just feel so pathetic to be always complaining about my horrid fucked up family. She even has a boyfriend, a successful first relationship. 

I have been working hard, reading up on childhood trauma, meditating, practicing self-compassion but it's so hard when my fundamental support system is so bad. 

Yesterday I received my first ever job offer. There were only five people in the whole program who got selected. All the others who got selected were out celebrating with family. In my home I was witnessing a horrible family fight that ended in me getting slapped by my father. No celebrations. 

The reason I want a boyfriend is because I want a second chance at a family. I'm tired of feeling like it's me against the world, I want someone to be on my team. I'm okay on most days because my friends are really nice, but at times like during college breaks I get so lonely. All my friends are out spending time with their families, but not me. I can't quite ask them to drop their family engagements to hang out with me. But I don't wanna be alone.

I have had two relationships in the past and been dumped both times. I just want a boyfriend so so bad. Someone for whom I will be a priority.

And please don't tell me about loving myself. Like I mentioned above, I have been working on those things but really it'd be so much easier if I had someone who loved me.

It seems like my life is just a series of events I wish I could rewind and do differently or fast forward far enough to when it stops bothering me so much or I know I'll never see the people I was so awkward around again. 

I hate that everyone my age has a family and or kids. I can't relate very much with them and they always have more important things to do than talk to me which I completely understand. I haven't met anyone in years who has similar tastes in music. I like stupid nerdy shit like history and political stuff beyond what you'd hear on cable news. I like to make spreadsheets and catalogue dumb shit. I'm adverse to ""popular"" stuff. If someone asked me to go to a movie I wouldn't care what it was as long as I felt like someone wanted to spend time with me. I just feel so damn weird and unlikable lately.

Honestly it has never been easy for me to get over these things. Everything just feels depressing when I’m depressed. I’m constantly tired, I don’t have the motivation to do anything, and every time I do anything it feels like I’m taking every ounce of my energy to do it. Getting through it feels like it’s even more difficult. I never know when I’m going to get through it, I try everything in the hope that something will work, and on top of that I’m doing all of this with it weighing down on my conscience. 

I should think that it would feel satisfying when the pain has gone away and I realize that I had overcome my depression. But it never feels like that. It always feels like I’m right back where I started in the sense that I haven’t done anything meaningful during that time, and even if I did the  pain I felt seemed to overshadow my accomplishments. 

Other people would never understand what it feels like to go through this. There’s not a day that goes by without me thinking that I have no friends to contact. To feel empty and alone in this world is like being around people but you are invisible to all of them.

Because of his fame, he has difficulty trusting people since so many people are out to get him. He will talk to me about his loneliness. I talk to him about my loneliness too. He says he understands, but I don’t think he really understands. He is lonely- but I am all alone. It’s not the same. Like, physically, I am all alone.

He has over a million subscribers on Youtube. Each video gets at least 1 million views. He has thousands of likes and positive comments. He can reply to a comment and get a response at any moment. People are hoping he will talk to them. On Twitter, he also has thousands of followers. He could tweet anything and get a like and a reply. People get so excited to talk to him. He also had a discord server with thousands of people. If he joined a VC- people rushed to talk to him. His viewers are always DMing him in the hopes of a conversation. People talk so positively about him. He probably has the best reputation in his community.

He also has many friends. He has a large group of video editors that he gets to work with. And they all love talking to him. He also has a group of IRL friends that come to his house often to hang out. They go on trips and such together. They are constantly messaging him and talking to him. He lives in England, and I’m in NJ, so I can’t join them. He is also close with his family. I believe he has a good relationship with his parents and brother from what he said.

I am incredibly alone. I come from an abusive household where I am forced to hide in my room all day. I also never made any friends, IRL or online. I feel like it’s too late for me to make IRL friends. I graduated with a master’s degree and never made any friends during my time at school. All of my coworkers ignore me. I try really hard to make friends but get ignored. Any texts I send in the GroupMe to hang out get ignored.

I know what people are probably thinking, what about your best friend? He is amazing but is often busy. And I feel like when I talk too much to him that I’m annoying him. And I don’t want to lose him. He’s all I have left. I can’t lose him. He’s also the greatest friend I ever had. I can’t go back to having no one. I refuse to. I can’t go back to that place EVER. NEVER AGAIN!!!! He did introduce me to people, but no friendships developed. I tried and tried again. I would ask my friend to help me. But I was never good enough for them. They didn’t like me. I tried everything to be liked and start conversations. But people slowly disappeared. None of these people live near me, so it was all on Twitter and Discord. It’s easy to be ignored by online people.

I even feel ignored on social media. Since I’m not made to have friends, I want my existence to be acknowledged. I’ll tweet something and can’t even get a like. I make posts on Reddit and get ignored. I used to post in r/lonely and r/suicidewatch, but no one bothered to upvote. It would just be nice to know that my life impacts others. People are aware of my existence. I am not trying to be loved or needed or wanted anymore. I tried that for years, and it didn’t work. I am not made to have friends. I am not important. But can I least exist? Can one person see and hear me? I don’t even mind my parents abusing me because it at least means I have their attention.

I am so desperate for someone to acknowledge my existence that I am jealous that my friend gets hate comments. I know it’s wrong for people to send hate. But it means that he was worth someone’s time. I used to have abusive friendships, and I miss them. I miss being used, mistreated, and taken advantage of. I feel like my presence is so awful that people aren’t even willing to abuse me. I want to beg people- please abuse me. I don’t know why everyone in the world just ignores me. The world doesn’t want me. I don’t want to marry because I won’t have bridesmaids. And if I die, no one will find my body or carry my casket.",lonely,"I feel like I’m the loneliest person in the world, and my best friend is a famous Youtuber.

99,Pensive_Nights,1659227373,1,"it's now day 3 since our last conversation about whether ""us"" should still be a thing. 

My iphone just reminded me of the letter that I had been working on for the past month and a half. It was a love letter... for you. But unfortunately, I never got the chance to give it to you. Life prevented me from doing so. I first got covid, then we got into an argument. 

This letter took a lot of courage for me to write, as the word ""love"" had been difficult for me to say, as I was afraid to fall in love from all the heartbreaks I had been through. I just read the letter again today (thanks to my siri suggestions) and was surprised by how much our dynamic has changed since our argument. I wrote about how I loved you for caring for me and supporting me through my hard times despite your busy schedule. Your selflessness melted away the guards I had put up the past few years. But now, I cannot say the same. Since our argument, you told me you could no longer could support me as you realized you needed to be selfish. Don't get me wrong, being selfish is okay... just probably not the way you are doing it now. You said you weren't sorry for leaving me during my hardest week because you knew you had the right to be selfish. 

Dear you, I used to want to believe in you and love you. I remember before I left your place after our argument, I was so afraid that that would be my last time of spending time with you that I created more opportunities for ""us time"" out of despair. That night, I faked being horny and having pleasure fucking you (Who knew I would ever fake such a thing). That night, I asked to eat with you just so I could remember this for one last time (but who knew that you would make me eat away from you, on your bed). That night, I asked to borrow your shirt to feel the fabric of your clothes (but who knew, after I took off your shirt, you threw it in the hamper as if I were dirty). Dear you, that night, I tried so hard to recreate the scenes of our inside jokes. Still, I could still feel the tension in the air. We changed so much babe. Now, I could not help but feel my chest tight, and my throat suffocated. I missed who we used to be... we were so happy. I don't think I ever wanted my love for you to have a past tense.

I usually go out with them not more than once every month. Every day i feel more lonely and without hope of having a social life. I haven't had a girlfriend in 5 years so things aren't better on that side of my life. 

I don't have a job and i'm not studying for uni. The only two good friends i have are away because of uni and i can't afford to go visit them. The only ""childhood friend"" i had in my small hometown (where i still live) is an asshole who used to beat up his ex girlfriend so every time i see him around i just want to throw up.

Every time i'm in a room with people i don't know i either start panicking or i just shut up and say nothing until i leave. The fact that the world is going to shit right now doesn't really help (climate change, wars and all that beautiful stuff).

I used to go to therapy but that didn't crack it for me even though i really hoped it would. When people ask me how it's going i just say i'm okay and that kind of does it. I'm not capable of sharing what i'm really feeling, not even with my closest friend. And the truth is that i don't feel much. I don't feel interested in anything, i'm always bored and the only thing i feel is this mild feeling of sadness and loneliness. Sometimes i feel like crying but i can't even do that. 

I spend most of my days binge watching something (doesn't really matter what it is, as long as it makes time go by), hoping for something to change even if i know that nothing will. I can't stand motivational messages or that ""resilience""/""positive mindset"" bullshit because it's mostly a 21st century way to say ""just ignore what you're going through and get back to work"".

I really enjoyed seeing her the other week but when i went over the night she was talking about how she hooked up w some guy or something and it was TMI and kind of upset me. Also i got a bunch of rashes on my arm when i spent the night there the other week but this time I wore a jacket and pants and still got a ton of rashes on my arm . She also told me she had some other dude there last night and yea. I guess it wouldnt matter if I was in a relationships or something but the fact that im lonely makes it hurt more. They havn't text me back from the last time i texted them. Also im not on the same vibe anymore . They said they love me but I honestly would prefer if people didnt say that unless they are family or im dating because it makes me feel manipulated a lot of times. I feel like people say that who are players and send heart emojis and stuff , it makes me feel worse lol . i started watching porn again the other night for stress release but it makes me depressed afterwards.",lonely,I feel like crap,2022-07-31 08:07:38

137,cba2name,1659218559,1,"I tell myself it will get better. I don't believe it, but I tell myself. The old, fake it till you make it. I made a post on here last year I think. I can't remember, the rona kind of warped my sense of time.. I feel like I've lost 2 years, I'm 32 and I feel like I should be 30. I still live with my parents. I have a job, I have an undergrad and Masters's degree, and I have a Harley. I have a Harly got it recently. My first bike. I got my full license and wow, apart from the first week when I found this needle-thin nail in the rear tire and I had to take it back to the dealer to get it fixed. I've pretty much been on it every day. There's no time for anxiety, there's no time to think about loneliness. There is just the road, watching out for the cars: the wind and the sound of that Stage 1 screaming eagle 114 big v twin. The roar when you rev it just burns away all of the negative feelings. It makes me feel alive and scared and excited. Then I come back and I get off the bike. I chain it up, put the cover over it, and come inside. I'm back to being alone. I want a girl friend, someone to spend time with and you know \*fun times\* with. 

I think It will get better. I'll get on my bike and it will all go away for a short time. Just me, my bike, and the road. 

I'm grateful for what I have, I am...I've done things I've set my mind to. I got my undergrad after having a bad time at university, I got over 6 years of crippling depression to go back to University and get my master's. I got a job in a place I hated so I could pay for it. I achieved my master's degree, I got a job. For the last 5 years, I've wanted a Harley and now I have it. I can do what I set my mind to. I want a girlfriend, I want friends, I want to get fit. I'm going to do this. I will do this. Do or Do not. There is no try. 

I'll check back in in the future with an update. all the best guys. Wish you all well.

143,Lone_thing,1659217867,1,"So recently I got this new job. My trainer was cool, chill and we had awesome conversations. She even took me to her house. Nothing inappropriate happened. I genuinely just wanted a friend. So I thought we became friends so I invited her to do something on our day off. She then said she couldnt make it. I started thinking it was a mistake to ask her to hang out. Maybe she thought I was asking her out on a date. But, that wasnt even in my mind. Now she ignores my messages and changed a bit. I couldnt build the courage to admit I didnt have any romantic intentions. I was embarrassed that I accidently asked her out. When in reality I just wanted to go do something. Since I usually do things on my own. Like conventions, movies and going to pick out some manga. I know yall might say I should of made a male friend. But, all my male coworkers will just talked about cars, sports and how many women they slept with and who they would sleep with. Don't get me wrong I like sports and Cars. But, thats literally all they talked about. I was so bored when I went to hang out with them. Fake laughing and nodding at everything they'll say. Point is even making friends can be difficult now.

144,wtvidontcare-,1659217828,1,"
I (19f) thought this would be the greatest summer of my teenage years: I finally got a boyfriend and I got selected for a summer job. I feel so fucking stupid now. The boy that I thought that loved me, didn't. He broke up with me in the beginning of june. I think he wants to get back together, but I can't trust him again. I just can't. And the place that I was so excited to work at turned out to be shit. 


On top of this: my best friend is not in town, she is on vacation with her parents, grandparents, and cousins. We've known each other since we were in pre school, and we now go to uni together. Sometimes she goes days without sending a single message. She is too busy getting high with her favorite cousin, who is a really toxic and manipulative person. I text her about the most random shit at the most random times, but i am afraid I am coming off as clingy... I really like her and I don't want to lose her, I can't lose her...


My other four friends are all busy with their other groups of friends. I text them sometimes or send some tiktoks, but they take ages to reply or they don't even do it at all.


My family can be really toxic sometimes. My mom acts like she is so trustworthy, but as soon as I do something wrong she uses what I confided to her against me. My dad is not very present. I mean he is there, but not really. My brother is just a kid, and even tho I love him, I don't want to tell him my whole business.


About three weeks ago, I downloaded tinder again, in hopes of finding a great guy to go on dates with, in hopes of doing things differently this time... I've been on three dates now, with three different guys, and it just feels wrong. I don't feel any chemistry with any of them. I don't know if I have some kind of emotional block, or if I still like my ex, but truth is I am just doing this to fill this stupid void inside of me, to feel more like a teenager.


This is so embarrassing for me. I feel so stupid. People my age are going out almost everyday, going to the beach, to carnivals and festivals, to sleepovers. Meanwhile I am just... here. Existing. Wasting oxygen. I spend my days rewatching the same youtube videos and favorite series, and crocheting. Occasionally I go on tinder to answer the messages, but it almost feels like a chore at this point tbh.


I just fucking hate the summer. Its hot af, too much mosquitos and I always have this overwhelming feeling of loneliness...


(TW: suicide)


I feel like my meds are not working anymore... and sometimes I just think about taking a bunch of them at once... but don't worry, I will not do it, I am a big coward. I kind of wish i could be in some sort of accident. That way nobody would ever know how sad I was and they will never suspect that I was just waiting for that moment to happen...


I know I am really young. I know I am privileged. I know that there are people suffering more than me. But I just want to die. That is the only way I can put it. Nothing ever goes how I want. I feel like I don't belong anywhere. I don't think I have ever belonged somewhere. I just wish that I had someone to share everything with. I feel like I don't have anyone to rely on. I wish someone would love me as much as I would love them.",lonely,I hate the summer,2022-07-31 07:50:28
145,ApplicationPublic398,1659217540,1,"The worst feeling in the world (imo) is knowing the only irl friend you’ve ever had dosen’t care about you as much as you do them. They never reach out and they’re always having more fun with other groups. I think we text a couple times a month? It just hurts knowing if i didn’t reach out our friendship would fizzle out. I feel like I always put the most in this friendship, I’m always asking about her and her life, talking about whatever shes into but she never asks about me. 

Even when I was little I always dreamed of having a big friend group, I’ve always wanted friends that cared about me. I wanted this as far back as elementary school! I was always a bit introverted so it’s mostly my fault my friendships weren’t ever as deep as I wanted, it still hurts to think about though.

I even have a group of online friends that I love dearly! But lately they’ve been getting busier and busier with their actual lives and I’m stuck here with nobody like a loser. I’m always waiting to see if someones online.

At this point I’m starting to wonder if something is wrong very with ME! I think I’m a caring person but nothing has ever worked out.

147,Comand94,1659216852,1,"22M. When with people, I like hanging out in small groups, talking, telling jokes, playing video games, watching movies.

I have social anxiety, but I've tried going out more this year - eating, to a concert, to play pool, drink some beer (being totally drunk is not for me, some is ok)... I've also challenged my social anxiety in other ways and succeeded in pushing myself many times.

Problem is I feel extremely lonely. When I hang out, no matter if it's with people from A (highschool), B (uni), C (family) or D (work) I never get to meet anyone new. Not a friend, not romantically. The focus is always on people you're with.

I feel like this is why my dating life is non-existent. I may have social anxiety, but I'm far from shy or uninteresting, but for online dating standards I'm not that attractive to get consistent results and I also suck at it (it's really, really hard for me with my social anxiety to organize a date with someone I don't even know). I don't want to be single for extended periods of time anymore and I don't know what to do. 

It seems like most people my age just drink and smoke weed and that's how they manage to find dates (for something casual or otherwise) so quickly, but I don't think partying like that is for me... or is it?

160,Rahjan01,1659213519,1,"I may be writing this from a drunken stupor right now but I just need to vent... 

All my life I have been ""the Outcast"". The one guy everybody knows and most laugh about behind your back. 

All the way through school and college I had only some ""buddies"" but no friends. Everybody just was looking out for themselves and nobody really wanted to interact with me. I got people through classes and tried to help where I could but I always had the feeling, that my physical appearance alone (I am rather overweight) was enough for a lot of people to just ... I don't know.- Ignore me? It is really hard for me to put this into words... 

I am male, 34 years old. Currently I would say I have 4 real friends, 2 married couples that share hobbies with me (roleplaying, tabletop, video games that kind of stuff) and that I could even rely on if something happened.. so I guess I don't even have a right to post here, because I have those... 

These are my only friends. Everybody else is - at best - an acquaintance or work ""buddy"". At worst is it someone I care about but who wouldn't give a flying f... about me. 

My famiyl consists of me. Until a few years ago there was me, my mother and my grandpa... we never had much contact with anyone else in our family since my grandmy died because the lot of them are lying assholes who just want your money... when my grandpa died... I don't really know how to say this... he was the only human on this world I 100% knew loved me and I could rely upon always... his last years were a bad trip through multiple illnesses where I took care of about everything that came up because of this until he died.

After that... everything was empty... I tried to live with my mother, because it was my grandpa's last wish that we get along and keep the family dog together (we got the little guy to help with my grandpa's illness among other things) and... it didn't work out... This woman... my own mother.. she.. she stole from me, multiple times... since I was 14.. she does not want to work... she does not want to do anything household related... she... she nearly lost us the dog because of ""forgetting"" to pay the dog tax... 

I tried for a year... but in the end.. when here neglect lead to us nearly loosing the dog because she allowed him to bit someone (we alwys knew he was too aggressive after living in the animal shelter for half a year.. I always kept the reigns on him to make sure he does nothing of the sort but she was just... careless.. - as usual - while I was at work) and only told me two days later... I snapped.. and moved out...

I left her the dog.. even though I love the little guy to death... because I know she would have went crazy without him...  the dog is way more attached to her than me because I have to work 8-10 hours per day and she.. is at home and taking care of him.. so I left him because it was the best for him and her... 

I still see her every week once.. but honestly think that's only because I want to see my dog... our relationship got a little better after she was hospitalized for smoking related illness, after she actually quit smoking (which was the reason she stole from me the aforementioned multiple times) but still... I do not trust her a little bit.. she stole from me so often.. and so.. callously sometimes... I just.. can't... 

My last relationship is 13 years ago.. a woman in a city 5 hours away I met through online gaming.. she.. she was a man once before I met her.. It did not matter to me, I loved her. But she broke up with me 6 months later, never explaining the reason or allowing a discussion about it. Before that, every woman in my life just used the fact, that I try to be helpful and nice (to everyone, not just women) to extort money from me or laugh about me behind my back (happened to me with my ""girlfriend"" when I was 21..  found out later she was just using me to make fun of me behind my back). 

I don't know how to amend this situation. Everyday I am going to work. Saturday is roleplay and Sunday I visit my mother... or to say it better I visit my dog which my mother watches over. 

I was never outgoing, I don't know how to meet someone, anyone.. all I am feeling is a perpetual feeling of loneliness every damn day.. every day at work is the same dumb shit. Every Saturday is somewhat funny but in the end.. when I go home from one of these married couples I know as friends... I just want to cry.... and sunday I try my hardest just to keep myself occupied... 

Sometimes I feel like I am a prisoner of my own mind, which keeps torturing me with thoughts I don't want to have about facts or people who couldn't care less about me and live their own lives... and I don't know how to continue...

I used to dream about my ideal best friend when I was a kiddo-teenage years. Now as an adult, I’d love to have that best friend go shopping with me, try new restaurants, go to the zoo or park with our kiddos etc. I don’t have this and I never will. As I grow older, I’ll cookout and sit outside alone. I’ll go to the movies, shopping, out to dinner- alone. 
And forget finding a good man, a good husband. People don’t believe in loyal one-one relationships anymore. 

I’ve found that by being alone though, I don’t have to deal with anyone backstabbing me, cheating on me, and more.  No drama period. My exhusband is a prime example of this. He was always too busy for me &amp; our family. I basically was married, alone.

165,Figoverlord,1659212406,1,"(25 M) 
I'm sitting here in a motel 6 (semi homeless, long story and not going to go into it here), all my friends are gone in a way. They're busy with life (wife and kids, job and family matters etc) so I go weeks before anyone has time to chat.
And yet I've been an outlier, I never got involved romantically nor ever dealt with family since they disowned me a long time ago. So those problems never bothered me.
I'm in a sort of limbo, neither going forward nor ever moving backwards, clinging on to the past and living in it 24/7.
I spend my time biding my time with nostalgia and sad music to drown out the deafening silence and yet I can never leave this self created limbo since it's oddly comforting in many ways.

I'm so used to feeling like this I can't feel anymore than a nihilistic apathy with some 3am hope mixed in at times. 

I sit here listening to alicks - on my own and I find myself loathing the feeling I have yet I want more, I deliberately make myself sad sometimes and yet when I do it feels like I'm an dry emotional husk until I cry.
It's like my tears water the barren wastelands of my heart and mind and it flourishes with life but only for a little while, then everything dies. 
That barren wasteland feels like a blackhole on my chest and the feeling of uselessness and the utter void of my social life is painful yet I'd rather observe society from afar.
It's a double edged sword I'm dealing with and it's hard to really explain but Like one of my favorite shows Bojack horseman, a character says ""I can't be alone and I can't be around people"" that's the only way I can describe it simply.

I'm the guy at a party who maybe a friend of a friends brother invited and who's chilling in the background with his headphones on and taking minimum participation in the party so as to not look weird just loitering in the background. 
It's strange but I take joy in observing others having fun yet when I'm in the background I so desperately want to join in and yet when I am involved I often hate it so much as it's happening yet secretly I'm in heaven for weeks after. 

90% of my time is spent wandering around town listening to alicks or simalar music to induce a almost dissociative state as I wander the streets.

Sorry this was really rambling but I had to get it out there to a bunch of internet strangers.

However the thing is that no amount of self love can replace the love of another human and that's just a fact of life. The same people telling you to ""love yourself"" would be miserable wrecks if all of their loved ones didn't exist.

Is self love important? Absolutely, it's extremely important. But don't let other people gaslight you into thinking being sad about being lonely is indicative of low self esteem or low self worth. Socialization is an intrinsic human need. 

And just because it's okay to be sad doesn't mean you should wallow in your own misery. By all means, do what you need to do to get better. But don't let people delegitimize your own feelings.",lonely,it's okay to be sad about being lonely,2022-07-31 05:57:02

I work full time as a chef I left school when I was 14 and  my grammar is shit I'm sorry......my family was fucking shit alot of alcohol and drug abuse and alot of violence I had to cut them off but I do have a brother I live with and he and I out of 5 children are the only 2 in the family that talk normally to each other, growing up I was called the garbage dump kid at school, I missed and skipped alot of school it wasn't a good time I spent my nights hiding from drunken parents, eventually my dad left but my mother was still violent and did a great deal more psychological damage without my dad around, I left school early and started a trade as a chef the pay was shit and I was giving my mum half my pay plus extra whenever she got drunk and violent its crazy to look back and think that I'd bitch out and cower 18ish years ago to her violence when I could have easily defended myself or just left and obviously I did leave and did cut out all of the toxicities from my family.

I qualified as a chef just after I turned 18 and very easily secured a sou chef position I believed aslong as I work hard then ill make it but honestly all I did was loose the few friends I had because I never hung out with them and I never met any women aside from rare  late night 1 night stands and financially didn't really get that far ahead but.

I reached a point where I wanted to actually meet someone and make a life with someone and quite literally went 6 years without touching someone that wasn't an accidental graze at work quite literally not even a hug from a family member for reasons already stated and it's honestly kinda easy to deal with until you think about it then it becomes pritty heavy, but I did meet someone a waitress I worked with she was honestly unattractive a bit over weight goofie and kinda stupid (I know I left school very early and my grammar is shit but on many subjects I turned out way above avarage intelligence wise funny how that happens) she was studying at university to become a vet and god damm I fell in love with this girl and I really shouldn't have, originally she quite literally treated me as a price of meat she knew from work that I'd left school early and she definitely treated me like I was an idiot which I completely let happen but I pursued a relationship and for a year I was the happiest I'd ever been but then it was 3 months befor she finished university and I got the  talk from her and what she wanted all along was a good looking guy to treat her like a queen till she was ready to move on.......it was a few years ago and it shattered me im still shattered I still love her I still think about her everyday and the life I wanted to make with her I've never told anyone about my feelings for her.......

It was my birthday last week I managed to get my first bout of covid on my birthday 2 people wished me a happy birthday my brother and my boss only after I cracked a joke that it took covid for me to get my birthday off which led me to think a great deal about how fucking lonely I've been the past 12 years which has led to this post thanks for reading........",lonely,"32 M 6,0 tall, strong/hint of dad bod body decent looking face, good job and absolutely alone",2022-07-31 04:45:10

176,SwxtchHitta,1659205535,1,"I’m a male, 26 &amp; have been having severe depression issues since highschool accompanied by some serious anxiety &amp; PTSD. 

I used to be one of the “emo” kids that everyone at the local small town highschool made fun of, accused of being gay, a school shooter etc. the typical shit that small town highschools are known for being, that’s how this place was. I was not the good looking kid,  nor was I popular so my entire existence has been on the basis of being unliked by my peers. 

Once I graduated I joined the military (4 1/2 years of service) once I got out, I came back to my hometown &amp; everything had changed. I had changed or had a “glow” up, a major one. All the people who made fun of me, suddenly wanted to be my friend. The girls who wanted nothing to do with me had suddenly been ”in love” with me all those years back. I can’t lie, it made me feel kindve nice. It felt almost like I had this power over them at this point. Yet I can’t even bring myself to be happy, or feel like anyone actually genuinely cares about me because of all this. Why was I not ever good enough until I became attractive? Not even for a relationship but even just for friends. 

I’m more lonely in my life now than I ever was, I do a lot of studying on psychology &amp; how to read people. So I understand when someone isn’t genuine in what they say &amp; that’s how I feel most people are. I feel like I’m a trophy to these people, just another notch in their belt. 

It’s progressively gotten worse as I’ve gotten older, my only family doesn’t feel like my family. I feel like a stranger in their house. My family has always been on the narcissistic side of things, my mom to be specific. She loved me when she could brag on me but if it wasn’t what she wanted that “love” could be taken away.

Idk what the point of this even was or why I’m telling you all this, I guess aside from don’t allow people to get here before you care about them. Treat everyone with love, just because they aren’t your type or part of your “cliche” doesn’t mean they deserve less love.

Salutations everyone, I am he with the name of Michael, preferable nickname is Mike, has a pet rabbit, aged 24, blue eyes, stands up to 5’11, personality traits of an Ambivert, zodiac sign Aries, single likes girls, started the game of life from Colorado, then moved to California for collage discount then after having enough of the dangers of that environment finally moved out to Oklahoma to work on getting a life in a nice place with unpredictable weather.

As a self-taught student of computer programming I still turned out to be a passionate, team oriented, software developer who aspires to work on large-scale projects, learning new tech and applying new skills whenever I can. Currently finishing my UCSD classes for my C/C++ Programming certification and will continue work on my Python Programming certification. Previous to my current work position I used to be an Amazon warehouse associate at PSP1 packing, sorting, teaching associates and be the fastest water spider in the hole building, currently I’m working at the Braum’s ice cream and dairy which is a lot of fun.

If you’re someone that expects instant responses 24/7 then probably not compatible with your list since there will be times when I’m really busy with life in general like working at Braum’s for example but rest to sure I’ll get around to responding when I have time to do so, do not mistake it for ghosting understand that life is unpredictable. Those probably a little faster if it’s a conversation, it bugs me not to finish a conversation. If you jump in my DM and think your gonna be posting (NSFW) content or trying to sell NEFW, forcefully promoting some stupid tool at me, spamming me and or selling crypto then yeah got another thing coming so keep that to yourself or else. 😁

If you’re into video calls then that’s fine, it’s probably a good way to develop a connection that is stronger than texting messages back and forth and for the love of God please don't suggest Discord, I already had enough bad experiences on that platform as it is, Snapchat creeps me out, and god damn it if it involves giving away my number then assume no, so that means no WhatsApp, Telegram or whatever I haven’t mentioned sorry my number is mainly reserved for the event I actually find a girl I like who is around my age and happens to be in the same state.. I’ll do video calls on Instagram since I’ve already established a spot there with many connections I made over the years.

**Hobbies:**

Learning new things is one of my favorite hobbies as I take the opportunity to understand new topics and perspectives so rest to sure that I’ll take interest in learning anything and everything within reason, science, space, astrology, philosophy, future and past events. Photography is another thing I tend to do, favorite photography would have to be landscape photography, I just like how some environments look and happy to have the opportunity to express my thoughts through the images.

I like to listen to a lot of music, some favorite bands would be Dexperia, Infected Mushrooms, Gorillaz, Pixel Tarror, and Otyken. Not only that I listen to music but I play some musical instruments as well some being the Jaws harp, Violin and an Ocarina.

Reading and writing go hand in hand, I’ll read about topics of interest or do some research for an idea I come up with which is a lot of ideas to research for if ya think about it, writing documentation for my projects is the other half of the reading writing collaboration though some times when I feel like it I’ll write some really deep thoughts or some poems.

Solving programming problems with C, C++, Python and D just for fun on HackerRank seems like a great way to pass the time and to keep my strategic part of my mind sharpen up for any problems I’ll find in real world applications.

Some of my biggest projects would be the Meson-UI project which is a build GUI for my favorite build tool, Troglobyte stdlib which is a GitHub organization hosting custom libraries for use in applications I’ve written using either C, C++, Python or D, Troglobyte apphub which is a GitHub organization hosting custom applications built with my components for users like you written using either C, C++, Python or D.

start - if you want to start finding friends and receiving messages  
next - if you want to pass current friend and find new one.  
help - if you want to see these keywords again.

Is it too late for me? When I go on a date and look like Nosferatu's younger more paler son who's only redeeming quality is I'm not overweight. Feel like I'll be eaten alive by these females I see today. Much different then the girls I talked to when I was younger and still had soul and emotion.

Goodbye.

202,MostMacaroon8530,1659193534,1,Love and everything in life is not worth trying your best to be with someone. Be with someone that will love you and want to be with you don't waste your time hoping for that one someone to turn around and see the good in you. Fight for your right for the right love the love that is recieved after giving. Love is that if you give and you don't recieve walk away and try again but of course if friends is possible with person and you still care that's possible but love is that to. There's to much pain in this world to force and make people feel force. We all have problems and some destroy that such thing as love but some still fight. Why fight because it makes life more less dull. I don't get it if people fight and stay it makes no sense. Maybe that's why I'm not in a relationship. I hate fighting I hate drama or creating such a fuss over things. Life is to short to be so stuck up in a bad mood and fight all the time. Life is to short because of the reason we don't choose are destiny. We don't choose wether some day the world will end. Humankind can only be the one to destroy all and there is always someone or some that are calling the real shots. The most meaning in the world and what happens on earth. So why fight when there's someone or someone's out there calling the shots to make things negative in this world. Instead of pieceful but there must be choas right that's life if not there would not be piece.

209,JustTryToBe,1659190157,1,"My story is pretty long and quite complicated. The main points are:

1. I don't live in my home country since 2017.
2. since 2020 I am living completely alone in small studio.
3. Before I moved out of my country I was addicted to weed, and even was after I left it. I am clean for 2 months now. For this whole time I had depression. 
4. I also quit smoking cigarettes two weeksago after smoking almost 17  years.
5. I almost dont have any contact with my family.
6. I don't have any true friends or coworkers willing to hang out with me.

Those are just points which put me in the situation I am and how I feel right now.

Recently I don't feel much. And don't get me wrong. I see how much I did in my life, how much good things I did and how much I can offer. I started skipping on the rope 2 months ago, I came back to playing my guitar, I found a therapist with whom we are working over myself, for 1,5 year i am learning new language and recently I signed up for classes to get it faster and better.

So I know I had a worse and better time in my life. I just feel tired of being alone. Except for my therapist I don't have anyone close to me and even with him it is strange, becasue i know he would not help me if I would stop paying him. It is not becasue he wants, it is becasue i want and need it. I am just missing some basic and deeper interactions. I am feeling tired of people which are saying one thing and doing something completely different. I feel cheated and used. It is harder and harder for me to push myself to do all of this things I like. I would like to share things i have and things I care about. It is hard for me to start doing new things alone or even go outside. I am spending my days at home and again I am feeling tired of this, but when I am outside I don't feel like i am in place I should be by myself.


I am afraid of getting back to smoking weed, I am afraid of getting outside and meet new people. I don't even know how. Thanks to all of you whos are going to read all of this.

It hurt more than it probably should have given that we weren't really a thing but eventually I felt better and let it go. She's my friends neighbor so whenever I would go visit I would remember her which made it a little difficult but I never actually saw her in person, which suited me.  

Yesterday I was helping them move out of their apartment and guess who I see in person throwing a party of some kind and kissing her new boyfriend. Yeah. It shouldn't have, but that stung quite a bit. Probably because I'm so raw right now. This month has been really hard overall because of changes to my employment I didn't really ask for and because July is always hard for personal reasons. 

The worst part was that yesterday would have been my 5th anniversary with my ex-wife if she hadn't nuked our marriage six weeks in so I had been already feeling kind of shitty all day because of that. I've been to visit my friends dozens of times and never seen her and the last fucking time i will ever go there i not only see her but the universe rubs it in my fucking face by making it happen yesterday of all days.  

Why I am not good enough? Why wasn't I good enough to keep my brand new wife from cheating 1.5 months into our marriage? Why wasn't I good enough to keep this girl's interest?

215,friendfromsomewhere,1659187648,1,"Just like a lot of people here, I've been struggling with loneliness my whole life. Despite all my effort to escape, i just return to where i was. Making friends is hard.

I wanna talk about how people treat you when you open up to them. When you tell them what you've been through and your struggle with loneliness. I never dump my background on anyone. I have trust issues and It takes me so long to open up. But according to some people I'm a ""good listener"" yet despite that, whenever i finally open up to someone about my loneliness they push me away or treat me differently. Why is saying ""I'm lonely"" so frowned upon? Nothing changed. I'm still the same person as before, it's just now you know a little bit about more about me.

This happened to me several times. With friends or love interest. I ended up hiding my emotions and burying my past with me whenever i try meeting new people.

Lately i met a really good online friend. We have been talking for months. I felt good and decided to talk about it. Same thing happened. I don't get it. I'm still the same person you talked to over and over..nothing changed.

I feel like I've lived a double life where i pretended to be someone else. I pretended to have a lot of friends, i pretend that i met a lot of people. I pretended to be someone else just so people won't push me away or feel sorry for me.

I don't want you to feel sorry for me, i have no expectations from you aside from just being my friend, i want you to know who i really am. Just like how you told me of your struggle with ur love life or job and i listened. I want to tell you about my struggle too, so i could be myself and comfortable. I think i deserve it.

No more hiding, I'm not ashamed of who i am anymore. I'm lonely and that's okay. I might be lonely my whole life and that's okay too. But I'm no longer letting people appreciate me less for my loneliness.

I started paying for prescriptions at 16, because I was too scared to ask my parents to keep paying for them. They never realized it.

I am finally living and working in this city by myself, sure the first 1 1/2 years were wonderful. I've finally got what I wanted. Then slowly, over the years, I didn't realize that I'm becoming more and more unhappy. 

Looking back, it actually seemed like I got everything I dreamed of. Got my own place, the dream job, the company where I want to work, I'm in a beautiful city, and I really thought this is where I will retire. Now, 5 years later, I can't wait to get out of here. I recently quit my job. I went out today and looked around. It made me feel so sad to the point that I was about to cry in public. All the memories of 13 years ago came back, how excited I was to live my life as an adult, full of possibilities. And I asked myself, what happened? I am now living my dream, why am I still so miserable? 

I guess I didn't take into account that I will live my life alone, that it will be so hard living a life without anybody, not even friends. I'm in a beautiful city, why can't I make friends? I had my dream job, but I also did not take into consideration that the environment and everyone would be toxic.

I have dated a lot of women and while I really loved them when we dated, my life was always filled with uncertainty. Her problems were our problems, to put it short. There are certain things you can’t do, there are things you must do even if you dont like it. Every decisions seems to always need tje concurrence of both parties.

I have a few hiccups in life here and there but generally, my life has been peaceful ever since I became single. No one asking what I did for the day, no one getting mad when I dont reply, no vacation or wedding to save for, no one to ask permission from. But at the end of the day, the price is loneliness and it sucks.

Saw an old friend I used to hang out with at school [M19]. We drifted apart since I changed schools so we don't talk anymore. Saw a photo of him on social media just chilling with his girlfriend. I got envious, man. He has someone to be with, has friends, is free to be his doofy self and enjoy life. 

I never had a girlfriend before. I'm too shy, a nervous wreck, and have been consistently shamed for doing masculine things since I was a kid (twisted hyper religious Catholic background; being timid is good, being manly is bad). I also don't have any friends I can hang out with since people tend to avoid me since elementary for being the smart kid. People praise me, but nobody really likes me. I don't play basketball, don't do what others normally do. I'm happy for my friend and wish him all the best, but it just stings. The loneliness eats me up.

A person I have known and been friends with for 5 or 6 years now has been using me and I finally am going to do something about it. I don't think she means to, but she has for a long time used me to get herself to feel better and then go on and stop talking to me once she does feel better.

That is the simple version of this story, since it has been many years in the making, but it was something that was always in the back of my mind and yesterday someone I trust told me that they think that is what is happening. I was devastated as the memorys of my time with this person became clear and I saw what I was trying to hide from for years.

She is a nice person, but she unintentionally used me for all I'm worth and then ditches me for someone else, often a new boyfriend, because they are more exciting. Honestly, I feel like a fool. I feel like I should have trusted my own institution instead of going on with this repeated cycle of friendship and then no contact unless they need me. This latest time from the break of not talking to me, they wanted to meet up and catch up. Turns out she was breaking up with her boyfriend. Shocker. I should have known there was something. There always is. She often says I say the same thing her therapist says. I think she just uses me as a human form of rehab before going out and doing it all over again. And now she that she has found a new person to date she is becoming more distant. One word replies, not responding for sometimes days, overall just not acting like she cares about anything I say.

I finally am doing something about it though. She sent me a text thanking me for doing something for her, and I'm not going to reply. I'm deciding to take the advice of my sister-in-law. I'm going to be the one to cut her off this time. I'm not doing it to be mean, but I'm doing it to hopefully get a message across that I'm tired of being her rehab and her not acting like a true friend. I'm hoping she will either come back to me and have worked on herself for once instead of just throwing herself into another relationship, or that she will learn from this and never do this to another person.

Tldr: I'm taking a break from someone that I used to be amazing friends with, and I feel extremely lonely. I feel like an asshole even though it was a toxic for me to continue the way things were.

279,lavendxrtea,1659152139,1,"hi! i’m f18 and i just graduated high school. i’ve done musicals and plays and basically everything fine arts for as long as i can remember, and i love doing it.

i did two shows this summer: one final musical with my high school district and one for a community theater. they were awesome to be in!

not sure how to transition into this next topic but here we go. it’s hard when none of the people you consider yourself close to have come to your shows. i totally get that theater isn’t for everyone; everyone has their own lives and timing is tough. i don’t fault them at all for not coming, but i sometimes just can’t help but wish my friends, especially my close ones, and my family would come and outwardly support me, maybe even once. i know it’s so stupid and that i’m not entitled to their time at all. i realize i’m just another person and that everyone has their own shit going on. it just hurts and i wish i didn’t feel this way.

the shows during the school year are easier for people to come to, since teachers sometimes give extra credit and many teens are finding things to do on a friday or weekend night. plus, they’re advertised well around the school. i am sincerely grateful for all my friends who’ve come to my school year shows; it means the world to me.

it’s just been a little harder on me recently. i love performing, but there’s just something about going out to see the audience and realizing you have no one there. of course, you’re not gonna know people at 14 shows. it just kind of sucks when it’s the 10th show and you still are just wandering alone as fellow cast members see people they know and are greeted with cheers and hugs and flowers and whatnot.

with my family, they never know when any of my shows or concerts are. i understand that it’s my job to inform of them, but i see so many of my theater peers’ parents excited for these shows, and it makes me wonder what it’s be like to have parents who are invested in this. it’s stupid, i know. it just kind of hurts. my mom walked in late to this year’s spring play and my dad didn’t come to my last summer district musical. with my most recent community theater show, they didn’t even stay after for when all the cast members come out so i could see them. they just left. i didn’t even know they were here until i called them and found out they had left.

it hurts just a bit more with my friends though. again, i preface this with the fact that i know these are a lot of selfish ramblings and that i totally understand that people have their own lives. i’m just kinda feeling hurt and wanna get this out. again, i’m insanely grateful for all my school friends who’ve seen my school year shows. i know it’s a ton of time to dedicate and it means a lot to me. 

two of my closest friends, one who i’ve known for 17 years and another for 11, have never seen any one of my shows. they don’t go to my school or live in my town, and i know it’s not their fault that timing is hard and that they might not be interested. it just hurt a bit when i’ve made efforts to come to their recitals, even virtually, and other performances and they’ve just never seen me perform in one thing. it especially hurt today when i asked one of those friends if she was free tomorrow and she said she was going to a dance recital for another friend. 

none of my friends came to see my last summer district musical. i had to beg my now ex-boyfriend to come and see it on the last day. i had one friend make it to this summer district musical. a bunch of them told me they couldn’t see this district musical last minute after they did say they were coming. i totally understand that things come up, but one of them went on for a while about how they were excited to see it. i dont fault them at all of course; it just hurt a bit. i had zero friends come to my community theater show that i just did. it ran for two weeks. some people dm’d me when i posted it on my story and i really thought they’d come. also, one show was m on my birthday, and none of my friends but 2 texted me happy birthday as well.

my boyfriends been at basically every show i’ve done this year, and i’m really grateful for that. he’s been incredibly sweet and supportive. i just wish that some of the other people i’m close to would outwardly show some support, even if just once. i’m sorry about how long and whiny this is. i’m just kinda hurt and many of my friends and i haven’t spoken in a while, so i’m just trying to grapple with my feelings. thank you for reading and i hope you have a lovely day &lt;3",lonely,i do theater and i wish some people i know would come to even just one of my shows,2022-07-30 13:35:39

286,AloneHippy,1659151057,1,"I’m sure my story is too long to read much like most other individuals so I’ll aim to be brief. 
Basically throughout childhood I was abused by my parents. 
At 18 I took advantage of their pressure for me to study and thus moved away. I’m 24 now, and basically not been back. I dropped out of uni after spending most of the student loans I’d received. 
I had a great experience there nonetheless, fell in love but ultimately ended in a lot of pain and she left me and it ended up in lots of problems for myself financially. I moved away from the city to try and start fresh, again. My entire friend circle disappeared as they lived closer to my ex and would never let me speak on the situation that unfolded. 

So for the past three years I’ve been living in this new place, with no friends or anyone trying to reach out to me. I abused various substances throughout my time here, now I only really smoke weed.
I’m so depressed. I’ve tried dating since and it’s never really worked out for one reason or another. 

I can tell that people see the pain I’m in. I have scars from cuts on my face that have been there since childhood and also through years of skin-picking self-harm. 

I’m genuinely a very kind and compassionate person. I don’t look to street-fight anymore and avoid confrontation when necessary. I work in mental health care and I can safely say I’m good at supporting and empathising with the clients I work with. It’s very hard to listen to their thoughts and experiences when they’re so similar to my own. Mines just bottled up. It hurts me to know people look at me and basically see a freak of an underclass society. People are intimidated and I don’t want to be scary because that’s not me.

I'm broken. I'm lonely as hell. I do a good job hiding it 99% of the time. I'm sociable, I go out, I have friends I spend time with. I'm funny, know how to introduce myself to new people. I'm not the typical ""lonely"" guy. I have friends of both sexes and love meeting new people.

Yet I'm still, mind numbingly lonely, because I feel like I'm always having to wear a mask, never letting myself be fully seen. Always acting the right way, but never feeling truely known. feel like no woman could ever really want to know, the real me at least. They might enjoying hanging out with me as a friend, but I can't imagine someone wanting more with me. Part of that is my own self esteem talking, but nontheless I still feel that way.

296,No_Helicopter9361,1659147748,1,"I was recently given the idea that I may have trauma from my childhood. I always think people are making fun of my. I do have night terrors and sometimes scream in my sleep. I always try avoiding people because I am afraid of what they'll say to me. I am always on edge around others and intimidated by them as well.

More about me that could relate to my ptsd. I laugh at other people's reaction when I insult them. Not in a way to be mean but in a way to just feel comfortable and feel like I can be on their level. I believe this has something to do with the fact that I still experience people laughing at me when I was a child and how funny they viewed my reaction which in turn has me develop that kind of humor.

I believe I have an underdeveloped mind. I still watch cartoons to this day. I have never dated anyone. I am really not into porn. I am not asexual because I still find female attractive. All that points me in a direction that I may have an underdeveloped mind.

Other things I do that relate to my trauma is depression. I feel very isolated and alone from everyone else in society. I have terrible facial expression along with awkward positioning when I walk. When I was younger I wasn't always like that. I was a very cheery lad as a kid until my ocd and adhd started to get in the way of my social life

I feel really intimidated when I see other people talk to me. I am scared of what they may say to me and it makes me feel uncomfortable. When someone does insult me I react in a very scared way that makes it fun for them to insult me. They see how easy it is to insult me and they continually make fun of me getting in my head. It is hard for me to say anything back to them because I have a very bad time communicating my thoughts. 

I cling onto friends real easily. Everytime I lose a close relation with friends I tend to feel even more isolated then I already do. In the end I really care what they think of me. In this internship I tend to always go out of my way to help my superiors so they can accept me.

 I always had the idea that I am a super hero that can defeat anyone. This image of myself being one started in 6th grade and it continues to this day. I'd imagine myself being like that when I listen to music. This kind of imagine gives me the belief that I am superior to everyone else but when reality is being faced in front of me all, that feeling goes quickly away.

For the first time ever I meant somebody else who had adhd and ocd but didn't show any kind of issues expressing themselves through their face. They could speak perfectly fine and I could see they were very confident in their words. They do enjoy being around others and don't have any issue with conversation. This has led me to a conclusion that I have something other then ad/ocd and I believe it might be ptsd.

More information that might help answerthis question! 

I am currently working at a company  and I majoring in management information systems or business analyst I have 2 siblings with my brother becoming a freshman in college and my sister is going into the 8th grade. Both my parents are very loving and caring. My mother is a business owner and my dad is not working because of his heart which he is currently on disabilities for. 

I have seen therapist in the past, I stopped because I thought that I didn't need it after I graduated from high school. Once I did hit half way through my freshman year I wanted to see a counselor on campus which she did help in some capacity but I eventually did stop seeing her. I started seeing another counselor on campus two weeks ago but I wanted more help so I wanted to try betterhelp and give it a try. I learned that my mindset is not set in stone as in I can change who I am. Before I started seeing my counselor. I believed that my adhd and ocd were things that I could not change. She has taught me that I can change who I am. She introduced mindfulness and mediation which got me to believe that I can improve or in other words get better with dealing with my adhd/ocd. I stopped doing both of those because they were not in my interest but I still am trying to figure out other ways to improve myself. 
While I was doing this internship I believed I was not going to perform well because of my disorders. As time has went on however, I started to realized that the main issue was not my disorders but my self esteem.
My motivation has been through my work ethic. When I was younger was made fun of a lot by my peers from being different from them as in not being as good enough to enjoy a conversation with them. In middle school I specifically remember that every 2-3 months I would no longer be welcomed by others I sat with who I thought were my friends. In high school it got better but I started feeling lonely and still do. In high school I vouched to myself that I would prove them wrong by getting a good job so people could look up to me which has made my life good and bad in some ways. The good thing is it has got me to work really hard in college and I enjoy doing work because I feel part of something. The bad being that this kind of mindset has got me to think that people are always out to get me.

I take medication which is 125 mg of stetraline which my docter wants me to start taking 200 mg soon, 40mg of atomoxetine, 25mg of adderall, and trazodone.

One thing I  often do is getting sidetracked easily. When I am giving a task it is easy for me to get distracted and do something else which becomes an obsessive thought from my ocd and my adhd. I will then make the obsessive thought a thing I will hyberfocus onto which in turn makes me be in the clouds a lot.

 Another issue I tend to do commonly is I commonly have a hard time paying attention in certain situations which in turn makes it hard for me to pay attention when someone is giving me instructions.

Conclusion!

Do I have complex ptsd? What other kind of disorders/mental health issues could I possibly have. I am seeing a therapist within less then a month but the more information I get from people the better I get. Thank you for reading down this far and I look forward to reading any comments you post.

I'm the most important person in my life but that's by default. I'm what's left when everyone and everything else is chosen. 
Nobody thinks about me and that's probably my fault due to being a chronic hermit. 

To be honest there are internet personalities or fictional characters that have a bigger importance than I do to myself to the point that I doubt that I am even real sometimes.

Real as in when I die would anyone even recognize it. They wouldn't; my parents always know where to find me and usually leave me to myself, my siblings too but they genuinely don't care about me (middle child tingz). 

I have crafted my life to be a very specific, predictable way and sometimes that's boring and everything blends in and doesn't seem real. Spontaneity doesn't work well for me so it must be with way. 

I'm not special, not even in the patronising way. Not even to myself. But I know I'm a real person among other real people (maybe) and that doesn't feel good either. 

Being real isn't enough, just once I want to be the main character. I don't know how to do that. I don't know if I could if there was a way. Frankly I'm far too lazy and lose interest in a blink. 

I probably could change whatever I have going on, I know I can be personable and whatever but it's so draining that it's not worth doing to begin with. For now I will attempt to make myself the main character but most of the details will be false lol. Delusional even.

What makes me feel lonely as of late?

I turn 40 this year, and have been making some big mid-life reflections.....mostly this centers around how i started a career 10 years go that got me out of poverty and into self reliance... however, it seems like i traded away some pretty important life things. 

i work alone and am gone  from home for days on end (used to be weeks on end).  The last 10 years have gone by so fast, i am realizing:

-  I mostly likely wont have children and become a dad, meet someone who will want to be a wife/partner, 

-vacationing alone be it whale watching off the coast, camping, or visiting cities of antiquity are great and all, but the entire time, i feel a void is missing as i dont get to to share the moment with anyone else like i feel it should be. 

- i do have a few good friends, and enjoy time spent, but i feel like the biggest 3rd wheel as most of them are all married with lives of their own. 

I've tried dating, making new friends, however its incredibly difficult to make a strong impression for the first day or two meeting someone, then i have to turn around and leave again. So few encounters have lasted beyond acquaintence-ships.... ""out of sight, out mind"" is real.

- in my house i only use 2 rooms, my bedroom and living room. The other 3 bedrooms are just storage.. the old adage ""if these walls could talk"" makes me think ""these walls are deafenly silent"".

- so here i am a slave to the system i've built. I live to work, but there is no purpose to the machine, no goal to work towards at the end of the finish line.. just rinse and repeat.

Sure, you could say ""just do something else"", but comming hot into my 40s it is terrifying to change the one thing that has defined my existence... not to mention in today's economy there is nothing else that pays even close to what i make (think  $40/hr) for my education level and skillsets. 

So there you have it. Signed,sealed, and delivered",lonely,39 and comming in hot to my 40s,2022-07-30 09:50:07

Birthdays just hurt cause for me this is the day I'm reminded I'm not important to anyone (or at least it feels like that). I mean my sister hung out with me a bit and my father was nice but other than them I don't really have anyone and it really hurts. I've never really experienced anyone celebrating my birthday. Even when I was a young kid, for some reason, people did not like me and I was often excluded and sometimes even bullied. Maybe it was cause I was a shy little girl, not loud or assertive. The few birthday parties I had as a really small kid were never that great and little people used to show up cause being a summer child everyone would be on vacation. After the age of 7 I think I never had a birthday celebration with kids my age again. Now I sit in my room and there's an event in our city I really wanted to go to. I can hear the music playing and people having fun right at this moment and I'm just here, alone. It's just painful. I don't know why I can't seem to get close friends. Over the years I became less shy and had some acquaintances that I liked but it always stays superficial, I don't know why it seems like most people my age don't feel like making more friends and just hang out with childhood/youth friends. I always try to be thoughtful and wish these people good luck with certain things, remember things we talked about etc. etc. but they never do that for me so eventually I just give up and realize they don't want to be friends.

323,Hot_Ad_1223,1659137255,1,"I dunno if am allowed to talk about suicide here but I had a close call a few nights ago. Brother found me choking on my own puke. Just cant believe I let a girl make me that self destructive. I'm sure alot of you can relate but you ever have that feeling in your chest when your so lonely it hurts? Its like every part of your body is tense and you just wanna roll around in agony and bash your head against the floor? Been feeling that way lately and its too much to bear sometimes.

I met this girl Dec 2021. I was immediately just entranced. We were best friends immediately it felt like. Talked for hours on end, sharing our pain and bonding over everything. She had a kid with her ex who was such a sleazy fuck and made her life hell with stds and cheating and manipulation. He ended up moving back in with her claiming he was gonna be homeless. Would tell her to kill herself, quit her business things like this, all while not even filing for welfare. Just living off her bank account not leaving his room to even help with the kid most days. I comforted her all the fucking time. She would explicitly call me to cry and never once did I not pick up. We talked for 9 months before we hung out and it was obvious we both had feelings very intense. I guess or so I thought.

After hanging out for 6 months, sleeping together, me helping her with her work cause she was swamped with bills, making her the most beautiful collages, meeting my parents, etc. I asked her to be my gf, she said we were just friends. Said she had to consider her exs feelings. Said she never thought of me as a partner but still had feelings?and didnt say anything cause she didnt wanna lose her best friend. I've always been a loner but this just sent me into a tailspin. After 8 years of no romance and being a back up plan for everyone I thought this was it. She was the one who instigated dirty talk, sent nudes, told me she couldnt live without me, all these things I would never say to someone unless I loved them. Which I did I 100% loved and trusted this person. I did everything I could for them. I am low income and yet I still managed to spoil her and buy her kid stuff on christmas and valentines and all that shit, even made sure to grab extra treats for her half witted ex. And yet somehow I was just a friend to her. Said she loved me even. Reneged on that one too obviously like the user she is. I just feel crushed. Its been 5 months. The last thing she said to me was ""if it all had to be a negative experience then im sorry I did that, if everything has to have a manipulative or disrespectful existence behind it then thats that""

Part of my shitty self esteem wants to just message her and tell her I fucking hate her guts. The other part of me says well your never gonna find anyone who gets along with you like that ever again so best to shut the fuck up loser. Just dont understand how anyone can be such a fucking leech. I feel so fucking used and im coming off suboxone and cant even just get fucked up and forget about all this. Nothing is ever as it seems. Just wish there was an easy way to make friends. The few friends I did have years back are just stupid hillbillies now who are total pseuds/assholes/uncompassionate fuckfaces. I dunno I guess the moral of this rant is chronic loneliness makes you an angry bitter person. Just hope we all get to have a nice pleasant partner and supporting friends. Cause everyone deserves that shit I dont care what youve been done or havent done. People deserve to feel validated.

Does anyone else feel pulled in 2 different directions? 

On one hand I feel like shutting everyone out, going on my way as a lone wolf, blocking everyone that hurts me from social media, and just do my own thing. I'm afraid if I go this route I'm going to find myself in 30 years being a bitter old man and looking back on my life with regret. 

On the other hand I know what being alone feels like and I don't want to feel that way ever again. But I also know how difficult it is to go out and be social, to find anyone who will accept me into their lives, so this route is filled with the uncertainty of trying to find my people and maybe being successful or maybe finding myself hurt and alone again.

i actually managed to get into a long distance relationship a couple years ago then got cheated on. but the only reason the girl even wanted to date me was because she was quite mentally ill and just jumped to the first person she saw after breaking up with her ex. i felt incredibly pressured into the relationship in the first place. i know i will probably get into a relationship again or find close friends eventually, but its incredibly disheartening when you have to go through being ghosted 100 times over and over again. in the last 7 years or so there was only one other woman besides my ex that expressed romantic interest into me.

honestly, worst case scenario i just wait a couple years, finish my degree, get a job and then when im more materially desirable i hop on dating apps to find someone to settle down with and proceed to never be satisfied with life. sadly it doesnt help that my standards are rather high

374,Bruce_The_Triple,1659115350,1,"32/M 

I've never been very positive towards myself. When I was younger I was more brash and outspoken. Was less introverted, unashamed. I always felt unattractive, but it didn't stop or hinder me from seeking companionship. I dated through most of middle and high school, dated a really nice gal for a few years until I was about 22 or 23.   


I fell head over heels for a girl I saw online, I messaged her anonymously on tumblr (nothing creepy or obnoxious but just expressing my admiration and embarrassment for reaching out in such a red-flaggable manner) I didn't share my identity with her, but she figured it out and I was quite impressed. By the time we were acquainted she had a son, which was something that I was never ready for. However we tried on and off for a few years. With years in between sometimes.   


On our last attempt to hold a relationship she cheated on me. With what seems to be a more handsome and unabashedly nerdy guy. I don't blame her, looks alone I can see why she wanted to be with him more. Plus they shared a circle of friends, which was always a crux of our relationship. Me some creepy poetic stalker who reached out and was able to meet someone I held on a pedestal. Only to have it crash around me due to my own fears. How could her friends ever like me, obviously they would instantly see red flags and never give me a chance.   


I'm equally happy for her and her relationship, that I am jealous and somewhat angry, that now she shares all these interests that I wanted to share for so long.   


Recently after 2 years of no contact, she liked my single tiktok I posted. No mutual friends etc, so I was curious how she even found it, but I didn't ask. I reached out and thanked her for liking it. We texted back and forth for a few days, never talking about our past, or her current S/O. But just our day to day doings, interests, plants and shows etc.  


Then I had to ghost her when I began crying when I looked at the screen and couldn't come up with any more responses.   


  
When I worked at my previous job I did end up meeting someone who gave me the time of day, and after a few months of aggressive flirting and encouragement from our coworkers we ended up seeing each other. The first few months were a dream, I was taking certain care of myself, spending more on clothes, food, dates, getting out of the house, going out with friends etc. Then the routine started, and I started seeing cracks in the facade. Endless cycles of paying money for food and drinks, multiple times a week. Just to have it leave my body later. She rarely picked up the check, even though she made probably 3 times as much as me (we were both food service and she is a very conventionally attractive and personable young woman, aka she PULLLLLS tips)  


However our difference in age/maturity and general interests started driving a wedge between us. It took a personal toll on me when we would wake up, be cuddling, checking our phones for the day, and seeing unsolicited pictures sent to her by other men. Not even strangers, just her friends on FB. My jealousy hit it's breaking point when I glanced over and saw a message saying ""I need to see you again etc etc""  


She will never admit to being an alcoholic, as it's just the thing to do in your 20's in her circle of friends and coworkers, to get black out drunk on a nearly daily basis. However it did encourage me to stop drinking personally. I didn't drink like a fish, but sometimes I did have more than I could handle.   


The third woman who I had interest in the past few years, I have been interested in nearly a decade, even though we've only met a few times. I was always attracted to her, and felt maybe she felt the same. She is/was nerdy in all the right ways, except she had no weeb interests like I do. But I appreciated her knowledge and love of Star Wars, we even played the mmo a few years back.  


She was out of state for a few years and had moved back home and we made plans to get dinner at some point. And my low esteem got the best of me when she ""lol'd"" at one of the restaurants I recommended we meet at. I wasn't sure what it was but it took the wind out of my already windless sails.   


The second to last person to show me any interest, was one that I had met nearly a decade ago, things went poorly the first time, and we both seemed very interested in each other this time around. However she was somewhat two faced and hypocritically and very outspoken politically. She was born into money, and lived in the guest house of her parents estate (the guest house being larger than the home I own). Yet she was hyper liberal and was always complaining about this and that and saying rich white men were the source of all the worlds problems. (Which perhaps I would even agree, however she takes full advantage of being rich and white, however female, living off her parents dime)  


When the day came for our first and last date, which was just going to be hanging out at my place, she asked ""do you have A/C?"" which in my mind was such a shitty thing to ask, yes I do have it, but for someone who champions the poor and downtrodden you have the audacity to ask about my climate conditions in my home? We ended up just playing cribbage and I drove her home at midnight. I texted her that I wish her the best of luck finding someone, but that we wouldn't work.  


My final interaction with anyone I had interest mentally/physically etc was via online dating, and things were great. We have so many shared interests, she is beautiful, has a job, but didn't tell me she had a son until a few weeks in. After I mentioned I am not interested in seeing someone with kids. I felt bait an switched and deceived. For a few days I thought, maybe I can just suck it up, maybe dating someone with a kid could be okay. Then the day of our date came, and I flaked like a bastard and a chump. I didn't even message her I wasn't going to pick her up. Like a POS that I am I just deleted her contacts from my phone/apps.   


Now here I am, constantly thinking of these ladies that I have let down, and been let down by. Thinking of the what ifs, whens, and hows. My situation is so bleak and dire but on paper I should be happy. I'm very blessed in life, but keep walls up so no one can share blessings with me. I have health, a job, a home, knowledge, some skills, hobbies. But I have no idea how to meet anyone. I don't drink so bars are a no go, and it's not like I can just walk up to someone while hiking a trail, that is so creepy.  Any ""nerdy"" events where I could meet someone with similar interests are filled with unwashed men holding paper cards in sleeves, and the rare woman who attends is either spoken for, or, for a lack of a better description, like the men at those events.  


I've closed myself off and am enjoying the benefits of being alone and have no one to blame but myself. But part of me knows I've made a grave error in judgment. I have human desires wired into my brain and want companionship. But my resources are exhausted and my will is broken. I have nowhere to turn and am holding out for someone to just knock on my door and be ""The One.""",lonely,Do I enjoy being lonely?,2022-07-30 03:22:30

So I moved to another part of the country when I was 19, got a job as software dev, albeit shitty one, because I had to work 16 hours a day (boss would call me a midnight to make sure I’m still working) for minimum wage. I’ve managed to hold out for a year, but my already bad depression (I have a lot of cuts on legs and arms, some of which I’ve covered with tattoos, I’ve also had many suicide attempts in middle to high school, because of alcohol problem and mental abuse in house).

My step dad which will call dad from this point forward. He worked his ass off because we were poor and so I had to grow my self just like my sisters. In 2014 I was 14 years old moved to Canada.  Great life until my family got hit with financial instability . When I was 16 depression hit me hard I hated to be outside I felt an outcast no friends no nothing yet my family never understood that I was great student but I hated to study when depression hit me. So when I was 17/18  I did not graduate high school and my family judged me cursed me every day for not graduating they started telling me instead I should of dropped out and started working to help family. I truly understand but I was super depressed. I started working at McDonald's for 2 years full time . All my income I gave it to my family to help them out. All I wanted in those 2 years to get home and sleep and die maybe . Video games was my escape . No one believed my depression not even my self but I knew I was not normal and worst part my family kept taking anything I was playing with and tell me to do chores . 1 year later I met my dream girl. I am sorry to offend anyone here with this but I always wanted a Japanese girlfriend who I can learn Japanese culture and as well I take care and cherish her. For once someone started talking to Me and listen to me and so I told her everything from my dreams my weakness and stuff. And that when things got sour . Then we decided to have sex . We were stupid we did not do it right and then she started getting cold to me completely and that was 5 months in then 9 months in she broke up with me. I genuinely was dead inside I could not do anything I was so heartbroken she was my first gf and my dream girl and shit got worst when I learned 5 months in ( I have nomprove but I know ) she was talking to this dude and she tried to pull her self away from me. I desperately asked her back because I never felt loved by anyone or at least talked to anyone before. 1 year and half and I am depressed af. My best friend found a girl he likes and he spend most of his time with her. I am completely alone I am not attractive and that a fact . I try my best to look good but I don't look good. I started going gym and I can't do it I am too depressed . Amd today I broke down . I am crying as I type this I don't know what to do. The thought of killing my self is lurking around my head but I know I am strong enough not to do it but I really need help. No one love me or listen to me. I can't even go to therapy because I don't trust them or have extra money to throw away. I am really scared .",lonely,please I need help!,2022-07-29 20:59:49

Online dating has not been working for me. I’ve been trying for a couple of months now and I only got one match, and she never replied to my message.

I have friends , good friends but none of them ever seem to completely understand me . This is the first time I’ve had friends in years as I was emotionally and physically abused by people / relationships so it was extremely hard to make connections with people genuine ones .

Just not always in the most helpful way , or they can never truly have an understanding

All that makes me feel whole and understood on a different level nobody else can understand. I don’t want to feel this way but it’s the only thing I crave and I just crave to be understood.

473,i-cant-human,1659059667,1,"Title says it all. I feel like the people in my life, the few that are left, don't care about me at all. I have a childhood friend with whom i still hang out once in a while, but we go months without texting and I'm always the one that initiates the conversation. We used to be best friends and now I'm just a nobody he meets with from time to time. He has a bunch of new friends and they always go out together, even go on holidays together. That used to be me. 

I lost all the friends i made in high school, we used to hang out all the time and one day their concept of fun changed and i got left behind. Suddenly it wasn't enough to go to somebody's place and hang out, watch movies, play tabletop games. Now they like to go out and drink, party, go to events. I hate all of that so i never went, that slowly made them stop inviting me. I'm not blaming them, what's the point in inviting me if i never go anyway? But it still felt nice to be invited and having somebody think about you.

With my childhood friend though this never happened. I always found the time to do stuff together, talk over discord, go to the movies, he was the only one i was really comfortable with, i could be myself and not feel judged. I always feel judged by everyone i meet, but it never happened with him. One day we simply started talking every day, we started hanging out less and less, we drifted apart and now we barely talk at all, and every time we talk it's because i start the conversation, which ends a few texts later anyway. We're not close anymore and we don't have stuff to say to each other anymore. Sometimes i just think about not trying anymore, letting this friendship end, but then i would be completely alone and that scares me.

I'm used to being alone, but it doesn't mean i like it. I find myself more and more trying to meet people online. Doesn't matter if they're on the other side of the world, i just need somebody to talk to, somebody that listens to me whenever i have doubts, anxiety, when i want to go on a rant about my hobbies etc. I met a few people like this but even then, if I'm not the one constantly texting, i feel like they would stop reaching out. Some even started telling me how they would always be there for me, that i had somebody i could open up to, but in the end they just ghosted me. That hurt, we had been talking for just a few days but i guess it didn't take that long for them to get fed up with me. 

I know I'm clingy, i pity myself a lot and i try to be conscious about it and restrain myself, but i just can't stop it completely. I guess that drives people away.

I end up caring a lot for the people i meet, much more than they care about me, and it hurts. I had this friend in high school that I was really close with, we haven't talked in years, he stopped reaching out and I guess i stopped as well, but i just sensed he got fed up with me and i just didn't see the point in trying anymore. I still dream about meeting him regularly, in those dreams we're still friends and everything is ok and I'm so happy to see him again. Then i wake up and i blame myself for losing yet another friend.

I know I'm not entitled to having people in my life and i can't force anybody to stay, but i wish they would.

478,SuddenSignificance30,1659058618,1,"I will call this woman M. Her friend made a post here couple weeks ago saying that I did things like harassing, threatening, and doxxing her.

So long story short, I saw M posting on this and noticed she is also from the same country as me. So I decided to DM her asking to be friends. I never forced her to give my number to me. I shared my number through the DM and she *voluntarily* chose to add me on Whatsapp.

So I texted M for a couple weeks and it's not like I texted her all that much. Maybe like every five days, give or take? I just try to keep the convo short so that I do not overstay my welcome. She just keeps giving me one-worded answers even though she chose to add my number. Then one day, she just blocked my Whatsapp out of the blue even though I did not do anything.

So I went back to her Reddit just to tell her how I felt. I do not remember the exact details of what I wrote, but what I felt was like: ""I did not even force you to be my friend. You have just respectfully decline my friendship invitation if you really did not want to be friends with me.""

Then two months, M unblocked my Whatsapp just to respond to that DM. Saying things like nobody is owed anything. I mean, she could just have the decency to tell me she changed her mind? So we exchanged a few rude messages then I stopped after I realized I wanted nothing to do with this woman anymore. She also shared my number to one of her friends to send me a hateful message. Fucking asshole went and shared my number to somebody else without my consent.

Then here comes the juicy part. Her friend went and made a post on this sub saying I harassed, threatened, and doxxed M. I do not deny I sent her some rude and insulting messages. But like I only sent *four* such kind of messages only? Where is this *repeated* harassment that she speaks of? She act as though I sent her hundred of messages in a single day. Also I did not threatened anybody. I never said I was gonna do anything shitty to her. She made that part up. And she also said I doxxed M. The definition of **doxxing** is *""search for and publish private or identifying information about (a particular individual) on the internet, typically with malicious intent.""* When have I leaked personal information about M such as her phone number, identity card number, or house address on the internet? I think she has no idea what the word ""doxx"" actually means. I have done no such thing. Ironically, M accused me of doxxing her but also gave my number to a stranger without my consent. LMAO at the lack of self-awareness.

I do not deny I sent her a some rude messages. That part I will admit is true. But nothing I did was as bad as she made it out to be. She is just making it sound worse than it is to play the ultimate victim card. I kind of felt like M is probably not even telling the whole truth to her friend. Something she did not even mention to her friend was that before she blocked me, I was still being friendly with her. She just blocked me for fun even though I was not rude with her at that point. She claimed that I intimidated her when really I just ask her ordinary questions at the start of our texting. And also if she felt so intimidated, then why unblock me after TWO fucking months just to say shit to me? TWO fucking months passed already so just let it go, M.

It’s been 3 years since anyone has taken me out to dinner (or gone out with me). My ex rarely liked to go out to dinner because he was so cheap. Didn’t like me having any friends. Divorced now. 

It’s been 4 months since anyone met me for coffee, and that was the first time in 3 years. I was so thrilled to go out for coffee with this person that I wanted to stay and chat to the guy for hours. He did not want to, he cut the coffee date short after an hour. I was boring him, I could tell. I sent a text telling him how much I enjoyed our coffee date. He ghosted. 

My acquaintances from college ghosted. Haven’t heard from anyone all summer. My texts to them went unanswered. Everybody’s wrapped up with their families and friends at home.

In May I went to an island to go camping (glamping) and hiking. I camped alone. I hiked alone. Nobody would talk to me. Everybody else was coupled up with partners, spouses, friends or on a honeymoon. Nobody was there alone like me. I had dinners alone. I ended up not speaking to a single person for a week. Paying for meals and other things was automated so I didn’t even talk to clerks, waiters, ticket takers, campground staff. 

In early June I stayed with my family. They don’t like me much and all they like to do is watch reality TV. I’m a STEM student, I do research and work in a lab. They don’t have any interest in that and told me not to talk about my work, because they didn’t care and science is stupid. Ok. I just sat on the couch and watched their TV. Then they started wanting me to wait on them and getting abusive with me. I left.

Now, I’m somewhere else many miles away, in a college town taking summer classes waiting for the fall semester to start, living in deserted dorm housing. Nobody in this town talks to me, I’m invisible. The students in my classes are “gunners”  (the annoying pre-meds). I used to be pre-med but switched over to wanting to do the PhD route so they have no interest in me. When somebody in this town does try to talk to me I wierd them out too much so I get ghosted (I have ADHD and aspergers). I had a roommate but she moved out.

The book is going to be called ocean; neverending

Here is the draft:

 It’s a seemingly endless ocean. Here they are paddling in their boat, hoping for some sign of land. Hoping for some sign of getting to leave this prison behind. They are not the only one in this ocean, sometimes they will find others. Some on bigger boats with more wiggle space, some with even smaller boats. They take joy in trying to help these people by simply carrying them along, allowing the other to peddle a little less. Sometimes the others manage to find a bit of land to live on, often with others. The others would occasionally tell them that they were fine, that there was no reason to be in the ocean. The others would sometimes promise them rocks and stones; land to live on, but whenever they would ask about the rocks, the others would have seemingly forgotten about it, would become agitated if they would ask further about it. So they just paddle on, hoping for land to arrive, knowing in their heart that it probably never will. That there is no land for them to live on. They will continue; they will never stop; they know that there are others, equally scared about this ocean. There are others that are lost, that need a friend to haul them along. They might never be happy, but they might finally be content in knowing that at least for some of the people they’ve found, there is an end to this endless ocean.

Its not even that I'm an emotional person, because I dont cry that often, or when one normally would. I don't really consider myself as a depressed person, nor do I not have anyone there for me.

None of them really have any experience with romance, and the only one who does is constantly in and out of toxic relationships.

I used to move around a lot because military family, so I never settled to until third grade, so I sorta had childhood friends, but i didn't grow up with them, with the whole ""just like family"" vibe

But I have this overarching feeling that I'll never find love. It may just be because of a self confidence/esteem thing, or that I may or may not have semented myself as the funny weird kid in middle school, but I genuinely don't ever think I'll be loved romantically.

And as a teenage boy, it may sound weird to not be intersted in sex. I mean yeah, I have and use the internet, but I don't really desire something like that. I want to be hugged and told that I'm loved by a someone I love.

I realized that as a young man in my early twenties people don’t actually seem to have empathy or care about anything you say because men are mostly judged off of what they can do and not actually by their personality.

521,MedievalHunter,1659037491,1,"Well it's a long story and Please bare with me as i need to let this thing of my chest 
It all started at 16th September 2020
I texted my old classmate whom i had never even expected that I would speak to &amp;
It all started with an reply to a story on Instagram to which i thought all i would get is an single reply and that would be it but it wasn't like that at all. My god she was soo communicative and her energy was just something which would make anyone's day better 
I was a guy who used to like stuff which were different from what another guy would like and society would think otherwise
She used to enjoy talking to me everyday like there wasn't a time she never did
But as time went on we grew even more closer we spent each and every day sharing every detail of our lives every little thing
I used to be a really good listener and she used to like that fact about me a lot.
During 2021 due to the pandemic there were several lockdowns placed and we grew closer and closer during this time
I used to be there for her and she used to be there for me and it is a thing which any two close best friends would do but the unfortunate thing happened i started to develop feelings for her but she didn't and it wasn't until mid 2021 that i confessed to her about it but we both seemingly brushed it off and we didn't really talk much about it and we were back to how we were before 
But as I started to see her from a different POV i started to fall harder and harder for her 
I wanted to be there for her , make her smile , wanted to spend my life with her, literally fullfill all her dreams that's how I felt about her
Every day i used to indirectly mention her about how i could be a good partner for her and how i would be perfect for her and she seemingly used to accept the fact several times that maybe i could be the one for her and there were several times when she used to feel like this could actually never happen
And this stuff went on for several months until recently on june 2022 we had a conversation when i mentioned to her about a fact that i would like to meet her and she was even more excited to do that and several days later on we had a video call and i mentioned her about how excited I was to finally meet her after 2 years and seeing her reaction i noticed something was wrong and that she felt really uncomfortable about all this 
And the immediate next hour I get a text from her telling that She wants to break all relations from me and that she would never wanna speak to me again. I immediately realised that i stepped over my line and now this is something i messed up
My mind went blank and numb i didn't know what else to do because she was that person who grew closer to my heart and its something i wouldnt have even imagined
It took me a lot of time to move on from her and i realised maybe it is for the best
Even then i tried to text her thinking that maybe she would have said those because of something she was troubled with but it was something serious she kept ignoring me for months until recently i confronted her and she was all ready to be friends with me with a condition that I be just friends with her and I was fine with that :) and as I thought things would were getting fine we decided that we would meet and we actually did. I was really damn excited because well I finally met her :) and things went really fine on the day i met her but after all the stuff that happened prior i felt like being too mingled would make her feel awkward and uncomfortable so i was just being a normal friend towards her and we had a great day in the end 
And until the next day the disaster falls upon me she tells me that she didn't really enjoy being friends with me and that she wants to stay away from me and stuff 
I started to panic because it's not like i had done anything wrong to her she felt something wrong about me and she wasnt ready to tell me about it and she blocked all communications with me.
It's been 2 weeks since this thing happened and i don't know what to feel about any person anymore and how they can change this bad
I don't know whether it's my fault in this or its her i need help like seriously anyone who could talk to me because i feel like i have been broken off by someone whom i couldn't even imagine would do something to me
This thing has triggered my anxiety and depression so bad i just feel like Life is unfair with people who are always geniune with everything.
Right now i feel like a part of me has been separated off and i have lost interest in almost everything 
There isn't even a time when i don't think that i just wanna go back in time and just stop all of this stuff from happening",lonely,I feel empty right now i don't know what to feel anymore,2022-07-29 05:44:51

524,DisclosedForeclosure,1659035802,1,"Context: Male 30+, living in a foreign city since 7 years. I consider to be myself fairly normal (except mild introversion/SA, that is). In same relationship over 10 years, have a well paid profession, I'm not unattractive, not overweight (ok, only a lil bit atm), not handicapped, not autistic, etc. And yet somehow I just cannot get along with people, I'm unable to make new friends. I have only two friends from my school years and that's it. Well, actually, as I look on my past, it seems that it was not that difficult to meet people, but it's extremely difficult to make it longterm.

Some examples:

1. When I joined new work almost everyone was older than me, but there was one girl my age sitting in front of my desk, at first she was friendly, we went out for lunch few times, but when I asked to go out downtown to hang around after work together she refused. Fair enough, maybe she just didn't feel like it. But once she posted something on fb, I commented it with a bad joke, after which she made EVERYTHING on her fb (posts, photos) not visible for me (WTF).

2. Went out to a club on Friday night myself, was kinda bored all by myself so after some beer I forced myself to approach a pair of girls, who all seemed kinda unoccupied at the moment. One of them had a dead makeup so it made a good convo starter. We talked a bit, I don't remember much, we parted few times. Third time I tried to rejoin she got really cold and told me I should go my own way XD I asked why and she replied I'm not her type - she thought I was hitting up on her! On that same night I remember talking also with one gay dude which was probably the most interesting conversation I had that night. Man, idk, maybe I should be gay?

3. a) Two years later went to the same club, met two guys, one was an ex-addict and other a diehard metalhead, it was really fun hanging out with them, we even exchanged fb. Few weeks later both of them removed me. Was it lack of contact? Was it something I posted? No idea.

b) On same night I tanked a bit too much and I wasn't alone in that regard. After I split with rock'n'roll dudes I spontaneously started talking with a girl at the bar who just popped out of nowhere next to us, wanted to show her something on my phone and as I got closer she suddenly started to kiss me. I guess one could call it a success, but it's not exactly what I had on my mind when I just wanted to find friends.

4. I needed to borrow something from my collegue from work, so he invited me for a tea and to meet his wife. Turned out she was extremely shy and I'm not a big talker either so it was very difficult to keep the conversation flowing, we just ended up talking about our work and my tea seemed like an endless sea of prolonged awkwardness. The dude is cool, but they never invited me again.

5. After I moved to other city I was living in a shared flat with three other guys, each from different country, it was really fun, I could feel like a partying youngster again. It didn't last long tho, I moved out to my own place and since then the contact faded away, they only texted me when they needed something. Same story with my first flatmates back in my hometown. And with people at the uni. And with guys from work. And with virtually anyone I ever met.

6. Very long time ago, back when I was single and ""in the market"", I met a really intelligent girl online, in RL turned out she's visually not my type, but we still hanged around as friends, up until the point when I ruined everything. At the time I was struggling with a rough breakup and needed something to make up for it, so knowing that she still was into me I took advantage of her, we both got wasted and hooked up. As you can imagine it got kinda awkward since that night, so the contact faded away and I lost another friend this way.

7. My old friend from same high school bench invited me once. Turned out it was not a social call, he wanted to get me into some sort of financial pyramid scheme -\_-

8. At one point we had a really good team at work, well at least until people were fired or started to bail out. But even then we still hanged around after work few times, even when I was the last person still working there. It was a while since we last met tho. I've checked fb today, someone posted a recent pic of the old gang reunion. No one even bothered to invite me :/

I can go on for hours, but those are the most memorable failures.

Basically my trigger is that i found a new job, so i'm leaving a toxic place where i worked without a contract for a very poor wage (4€/h), it was a saltuary job, and at the time and i accepted it for facing my social anxiety.

I'm happy to leave and fuck off my boss with style 'cause she treated me like a shit , but at the same time i'm terrified for my insecurities, i'm scared despite i have a little experience for this job.

My fear it's not to be capable enough. 

The same thought it goes for an art school, that i'm going to start it at septemeber, it reminds me my failures at high school, i was very immature and my dyscalculia didn't help as well, but i have taken my responsibilities about this.

I worked really hard for paying the courses, i have already studied in another school (Graphic Design) and passed the exams months ago, while I was working and studying, i was going also to a free psychotherapy (on a mental health place for youth) for a couple of months, because i can't afford a real therapy, it helped me to manage my stress but nothing more.

But now, i think i can't handle it anymore, i don't know if this anxiety it's a burn out sign, i want only to be strong and trying to make my dreams come true, i spent 10 years fantasize about my dream job and career, trying a lot of paths. I can't accept to fail.

Days are going by quick and I’m 19 already. I’ve given up all hopes of finding love, every girl I’ve spoken to either wants something from me or isn’t looking for relationships. All my friends have either moved out to different countries after high school or have new friend groups. 

The people in college are way different than the ones in my school. All attempts to socialize and make friends haven’t been successful mainly cause I don’t feel like I’m being me around them, have to put on a character just for them to like me. 

I don’t mind being alone for the most part, I stay away from drama and shit but having no one to talk to just sucks. 

I live with my parents and they are good people but not the ones I can talk to. They believe mental health isn’t real and that you just have to smile through the pain. 

I genuinely don’t know what to do. It seems like most college students are having the time of their lives and there’s me doing nothing like a loser. The only thing stopping me from ending it all is small ray of hope that things may get better and I’ll meet some good people.

548,OkAnnual1631,1659023673,1,"I'm David, 17 years old from Scotland and I am so lonely all the time and I'm lonely as heck! I don't have any good friends, all I have are people who will play with me but then they'll either hardly even chat to me, or they will judge me for who I am as I can be kinda strange sometimes which I never mean. In school the only person I'm friends with hardly does anything with me and is so much more interested in his real friend so yeah im almost all by myself, I know I do get people to talk to and they can sound like my friends! And yeah some people on here don't have anybody else to talk to other than their parents or even don't have anyone at all... but it's still soooo painful for me because I'm also too anxious and insecure that I can't even near go to someone by theirself and have a conversation as I know what people are like and it would still take forever to make a friend! And online I can't make any friends either as its usually either they ghost me at some point and the friendship fades away... or they aren't a good friend in some way, and a lot of the times it's because they are listening to something while in vc with me or something! OH AND PEOPLE WHO GO ON THEIR PHONES WHEN THEY ARE WITH YOU!!! Dude! I can't freaking stand that, I was playing a game with my cousin today until she went on her phone and watched the Simpsons, horrible moment I had to even leave back home! And also every time I'm out I'm always so upset because I've always wanted a girlfriend or girl best friend for ages now and I always see girls hanging out with other people like they hang out everyday! I've never hanged out with anyone so how do you think I feel? I really wish one day ill meet someone who understood what I was going through who was similar to my personality and interests such as videogames who could just ask me to become good friends, and they wouldn't judge, make fun of me over something, get distracted on their phone, or leave me after a bit of time! The reason why u prefer girls btw is because I've never had any female friends in my lifetime and its so bloody depressing.  I also like 1 to 1 chats and not groups so that answers why it's harder as I'd only hang around with individuals one at a time.  If anyone understands how depressing this is for me is there any website online where I could make a good friend and it would become local and I'd meet them in person? Or something like that on reddit or facebook? I know I should probably put myself out there but I'm already depressed and I can't put myself through more again! Just thought I'd say I'm diagnosed with autism as well.

It was my pleasure sharing this and I hope someone can help me find my dream :/",lonely,I just have no friends!,2022-07-29 01:54:33

Dear you,

I always thought our differences complemented each other. I thought my adventurous side will drag your ass out to try new things, and your conservative side will sit my ass down and give me my reality check. I thought my chattiness will make sure we never run out of things to talk about and your quietness will let me be me and you just listen. I used to be really proud of our relationship; we were so happy (and my dog loves u). I thought our relationship was one where people would be jealous of...
But tonight, I found out that it perhaps wasn’t the case.

You told me tonight that u weren’t sure about our differences anymore as it might cause trouble. I was a little shocked hearing that news. It made me think. You said you wanted some time to think more about us. But I really hope you give us a try because u never know. You said I wanted attention by posting my feelings online, but for me, this is the only place I can express my raw feelings without worrying about burdening others. It sucks that you think about me this way. But I guess it can’t be helped. You tell me that I am victimizing myself, but how? You did do all those things I said you did. 

Maybe we are just hitting a road block because I am at a really stressful time right now. I hope everything will be better later. As of now, I will be somewhere out there missing you.

I never told him that because I thought I should just be should just be happy for him and it made me feel really guilty. There's one person I've known for years but we only see each other every few months and we definitely don't talk regularly so it doesn't feel like much of a friendship anymore. I used to be part of a close circle of friends but we all sort of grew apart and now it makes me so sad even seeing people texting regularly because I haven't had that in so long.

555,Texasboy1957,1659020450,1,"I signed up on an app called Longwalks a few weeks ago.  It's actually a mostly pointless app since it's 90% answering fill in the blank questions and 10% responding to others.  You can have friends, sort of, but the only thing you know about them is how they answered questions.   There are different ""groups"" with special focus where questions are asked from that perspective, like ""senior walkers"" and ""social worker"" walkers, etc. 

Anyway, you kind'a have to see it but the thing is, a few days ago there was sentence for you to complete: ""I have a friend who's the master of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.""  I answered, ""nothing, because I don't have any friends.""

A person read that and said, ""I find that hard to believe.""

My first reaction was to tell them to fuck off but instead I just deleted my answer and along with it went their cruel comment.

It was probably not technically true, I am married and my wife is my friend but otherwise I am just a stray without a home.  I am an atheist, free thinker, open-minded guy with an entirely different viewpoint than christians.  I live on the point of the star of the Texas belt buckle of the bible belt.  Nobody in this town has the courage to admit their atheism out loud, much less befriend others who are.

Even my wife is religious, in a subtle, quiet way.  Her relatives are much more outspoken, evangelical and virtually completely sold out to you-know-who way over on the right.  Same for virtually everyone in this town, especially those from here.  I cannot stand their viewpoint and would not be friends with them if they ask.  

So here I sit, alone and lonely.  I am 64.  I'm retired do to prior medical problems.  I might find work but not likely.  My car was repo'd when I was in a coma so I can't go back to  Uber.  There's not even a decent bar to hang out in here.  I am isolated.

I would move if I could, most likely to Houston.  My wife will not move, she's stuck to this place.  I can't afford to go on my own.  SO, here I sit all broken hearted... to borrow a phrase.

Basically I don't why I deserve to be friendless. I know people will say people need to chuck themselves out there and boast confidence etc. Of course I agree, but I've always been myself which  proud of. Rather than trying to be someone I'm not in order to obtain a friendship.

I don't quite know how to describe it but most of the times I feel like I'm invisible to people especially to girls. I don't have many friends... well only one to be precise but everytime we hang out in a group or something I feel like I am alone and don't get noticed by anyone even when I am crowded by people... I don't really know how to put it. I do gotta say that I've always been a quiet guy and I think much about what I'm saying so most of the times I rather not say anything at all. 

It's probably got something to do with my past cuz my life has always been quite shitty. I've dealt with heavy depression and ptsd for a very long time in my teen years and I've just recently began to finally get up again and turn my life around. Lost about 60kg (roughly 130lbs), changed the way I dress, began to exercise and started an education. And I honestly thought that these things would help me get out of my shell and maybe even talk to girls more but I just don't get noticed and even when, I wouldn't know what to say. I'll turn 22 this year and I never had a girlfriend hell I never even kissed a girl.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Maybe I need to change even more but I don't know what I should change.

I'm not bragging about my positivity, people told me about it so many times that I came to accept it.

Everyone thinks that I have everything sorted out, that I have a very happy life but that's far from the truth. There are things happening in my life that I can't talk with anyone that I know.

TW: mention of a friends self harm

Using a throwaway account because of reasons.

Today I watched a memorial video released by the family of Joey Jordison to mark the one year anniversary of his death.

I was a big fan of his and found the video to be touching and a beautiful tribute. Unsurprisingly, it made me a bit teary eyed. But once the video ended, I cried because it dawned on me how lonely I am in comparison.

The video has dozens of photos of Joey surrounded by a huge support base. Parents, siblings, grandparents, cousins, friends, band mates and of course his millions of fans.

But my reaction is based more upon his life before he became rich and famous. I don’t have any of that. The family vacations, shared meals, parties with a group of friends. Everyone cuddling and happy together. I have no one.

My mother was an abusive deadbeat. And my sibling and I went our seperate ways 10 years ago. My family life was dysfunctional and toxic. I don’t have any other extended family members. Social circles were scattered at best, everyone has drifted away. One close friend took his own life. And I’ve been drifting in a fog ever since. 

I’ve always been a loner because connecting with others is such a struggle for me as I battle depression, low self esteem and crippling anxiety.

I guess I’m weirdly envious. I’m so sad that Joey is gone and I really feel awful for his family but man, he had an amazing life surrounded by people who loved and supported him. Who would I have been if I grew up in a similar way? What is it like to be that loved?

But here’s the reality: All I have is a dead end job, frequent panic attacks and an empty home.

No one would care if I died today, let alone make a memorial video. 

I don’t know, I’m just feeling so broken today. Like I’m taking a good long look at my life and it’s just so empty and bleak.",lonely,Watching a famous persons highlight reel has me questioning my whole life,2022-07-28 18:26:13

(Not my main point for this but) I was definitely disappointed but not surprised by redditors when I found out y’all just gave someone a shit time because they’re the opposite sex. Just personally as someone who’s been alone most of their life I have found myself to appreciate peoples openness and be disappointed by ignorant behavior whether as a gag or sincerely ignorant. I’ve spent years of my feeling friendless and it’s because no one taught me anything , I only really spoke to adults at school, and at that point I already knew I wasn’t gonna fit in. I’ve lived life, I’ve been fortunate enough to have tried to love people, to have sincere friends. But I’ve been both romantically kicked aside, and I’m not relevant enough in my friends lives to spend constant time with them, I’ve spent the past 2 years alone away from everyone in a new town, trying to leave a mark on someone. I can say I know why it’s like to feel lonely. And I just think it’s “kinda lame” that y’all did to someone on this subreddit. But I hope the people who spoke didn’t speak for the majority as I’m possibly in denial.

Another struggle I have is that while alone, the worst thing I feel is watched. I’m constantly in fight or flight fearing whatever my mind will create besides a chemical that’s inducing the anxiety. I struggle with shadow people and subliminal messaging, and I fear at times that I may never be able to interact with new people in person. I always compare myself to Frankenstein’s monster and find myself to be unredeemablly  damaged as a person, with no value in the eyes of everyone who isn’T; materialistic, or “black and white” thinking instead of “colorful” thinking, anyone who thinkings having toxicity inside you is healthy or people who think others are less valuable, I find it hard to be lonely when people make it a pursuit of solitude, all around where I live people seem so self centered in a bad way because of what capitalism has done to us.

602,Karl_Karou,1658994244,1,"I [] lost 3 very important people in my life in less than a year. I lost contact with most of my friends. 

The worst is how I lost them.

My 1️⃣ first loss in my life was my cat. Nobody can imagine just how close we were. She passed about a year ago. 

Then I used to have a group of very close friends. We were 4 in total. We’d tell each other everything. We loved and cared for each other. I brought them all together and we were best friends. Then some day, couple fights happened. I lost contact with one of them.

Of this group was my very best friend. I seriously loved her. We knew each others for years. She’d make me laugh just through texto. But then I got my 2️⃣ second loss. She told me she don’t actually really like me. That she finds me annoying. That she can’t keep faking it and she has no energy for me anymore. That she can get similar friendship as ours, more easily, with other people.

My 3️⃣ third and most difficult loss was my (ex) boyfriend. Noone makes me as happy as him. We were over 2 years together. It was the most amazing thing I had ever lived. We were each other’s life goal. Like soulmates. Until I learned he cheated on me and lied to me about many things. That day I learned just how mentally ill he really was. I never found anyone as smart, handsome, funny and perfect as him. And he ruined it. I lost what I thought was my best friend, my soulmate, my goal and my life. 

I’ve been lied to so hard. I’ve lost so much. While i know i’ll keep going and keep living, i’ve never been so hurt before. I can’t even process it properly.

In second and third grade I was bullied into depression by a kid we’ll refer to as “sam”
Sam would tell me nobody loved me, or cared for me, he pushed me around and threatened to lie to my mother about hurting him. I went to therapy and was diagnosed with depression. In fourth grade it stopped, but something much worse happened. My best friend (F9) (we were both 9 at the time) whom I had a crush on had died. This sent me back into depression, while also adding some anxiety and panic attacks in the mix. I had a existential crisis at the age of nine.

Cut to the start of middle school and my depression is gone. My anxiety is still there and my panic attacks are more rare. School was rough. The pandemic was at its worst so I was in school one day and virtual the next. I had a small friend group of 4 (Including me). One of my friends was super toxic and I had to cut him off. He harassed me for 2 more months until school ended.

The summer before 7th grade (last summer) I broke my leg. I had to do virtual for 5 months by myself (with parent help) until I could return to school. All of my friends had abandoned me when I returned. Two old friends invited me into their friend group which I am still currently in. Cut to now I have only hung out with 1 of them this whole summer. I’m more lonely and depressed than ever but I don’t plan on telling anyone. The only reason that is , is because I know I won’t hurt myself and being lonely/depressed isn’t hurting anyone.

I believe when I return to school it will become worse but I know how to deal with it (I think)

-Confucius

Hello fellow redditors, in this post I'm going to offer a brief plan of action as to how to combat our social isolation which plagues us so thoroughly. Feel free to combine any of these objectives I offer, though I highly recommend striving for all of them.

1. Seek purpose!
My first year of college was rather demanding and it inspired me to seek out my own meaning to life. This ended up redirecting me to the Catholic faith I grew up with. I recognize not all of you are fellow Catholics, however becoming an active member of a religion or spiritual group will help us realize that we are unique individuals made with a purpose by a being far more powerful and wise than we will ever be. Thus we have value that nobody can take away from us.

2. Improve your body!
Discipline is the road to success. It is our only true friend when times are hard. I understand many here are not physically active, so for those in looking for a start I have detailed a simple plan below to get us on our way to success:
Week 1:
1/4 mi run/walk
10 pushups
10 sit ups
Every week add 5 situps/pushups and every month add another 1/4 mile. We may speed up or slow down as necessary, but never quit on ourselves. If you can't do a full pushup, for example, try to do one without your knees and complete the rest with your knees. I highly advise finding a buddy and/or making a group to keep each other accountable. Not only will you stay motivated, but you'll practice talking to others.

3. Set your world in order!
Every day, we are presented with things that enforce our belief that we have little value. This may start as simply as making our beds, as Admiral McRaven suggests in his book. Perhaps we need to stop watching pornography or clean our rooms more. This one is a little more open to your personal situation, but always strive to improve. We don't need to compare ourselves to others, it is better to compare ourselves to who we were yesterday, and be better. After all, we promised our future selves we would do better for their sake.

4. Go on an adventure!
A great place to meet new people may be things such as museums or art exhibits for the urban members among us or the hiking trails or parks for our rural friends. No matter where we are, we must push past our boundaries and see the beauty of this world we inhabit. There is so much for us to see and smell and hear and taste and touch. We must live because why not? Out there is our future; we could meet others and talk to them about the great forest trees or the long painting strokes. There is always an opportunity in front of us; we just have to take it.

5. Never give up!
There will be times where we want to quite and return to our old, safe ways. But we can never relent.

This constant getting to know the same things about different people is so aged. The need to cover what you want to talk about in ice breakers or impersonal questions. What does it matter?

635,Thegraduate1333,1658980743,1,"I don't even know where to begin. I have so much on my mind. I've had a really difficult past two weeks that's made all of these feelings surface. For the past year and a half I've just been working endlessly at my dream job, to the point of burn out because I have been trying to outrun these dark feelings that have built up inside me over the years. I don't have much of a social life anyways. Well, long story short, my car mechanically failed yesterday so I had to take off work which is a rarity. I have nobody else to talk with. 

I've had it rough, fighting for life since the day I was born. I was born with a rare blood disease. I wasn't supposed to make it but at the last moment, a stranger who had the same blood type, donated blood for the transfusion that saved my life. I've been on borrowed time since and all I've experienced are tragedies. I'm not saying my life is worse off than anybody else because it's not. All of our own problems are difficult in their own way because we are the only ones who experience them. I never compare my experience with another because we can't feel what someone else feels in those moments. I can only empathize and only begin to imagine what it would be like. 

I've never purposely been a bad person. Sure I've done dumb shit as a kid but as I've grown into an adult, I realize the consequences of my actions. I grew up to a lot of bullying and family trouble at home. Having experienced that my whole life, I have never put someone else down nor have I purposely hurt anybody because I'd never want someone to feel the way I have. Sometimes things happen and we hurt people in different ways like being cold or doing something compulsive, both of which I have done. Sometimes I just don't think things through. Like cheating on a loved one. But the biggest thing is that I always learn from these experiences and take away what not to do in these situations moving forward. I always try to be a better human being than I was yesterday. I've always been the kind of person to give another my jacket, even when it is pouring rain out. I try my best to think of others before myself. My rule of thumb has been to treat others as I'd want to be treated because of how shitty most people have treated me. A reoccurring theme in my life has been me helping others only for them to screw me over in some way, shape or form. That's caused me to be guarded when considering letting someone in my life. 

The shatterpoint that has shaped my entire adult life started in 2013, when I met the love of my life up until this point. From the moment I laid eyes on her, I just knew she was the one. I didn't even know her at the time, I drove past when she was dating a friend (who treated her like absolute shit). I had this incredible feeling like butterflies that flew from my stomach to my head, telling me that I had to get to know her. Well weeks later, I had that chance and we clicked instantly at a party. We hung out the whole night and the rest was history. Never in my life did I share such a strong bond with anyone nor came close to how close we were. For the first time ever, I had this wonderful human being who actually wanted to be around me and talk to me as much as possible.  She cared more about me than anyone else and anyone ever since. I'm not going to gaslight and say I was a perfect boyfriend but I always cared about her and did the best I could. We'd fight and had broken up a couple times but we'd find our way back to each other. This is the first time I felt unconditional love. After a couple years of dating consistently, I had a plan to get married and move away with her. I had so much saved up and we were so close to marriage. She was the only person in my life that truly knew me, better than I did. She cared so much for me and I cared for her. I almost died from an internal infection in 2014 and she was the only one by my side. I got through it partly because she was by my side helping me fight for my life. Towards the end, she began to drift while I continued to get closer. It was like we switched places in the relationship. I changed my bad habits that was the only thing that put us at odds, but it was too late. Then in 2015, my life wouldbe permanently scarred like a dark cloud over my head, drawn with sharpie marker. Towards the end of the year she broke it off for good and I haven't seen her since. I still have feelings for her, 7 years later, and I've waited for her while she started dating again and moved on with her life. I cried so hard. Everything I had worked so hard for had begun to unravel.

In the following years, I began to get heavily into hard drugs. I almost flunked out of college because I had lost sight of everything, it was all pointless to me without her. I tried to move on but how do you move on from something and especially someone, so significant. First I had gotten into the Xanax that I was selling. Things were spiraling quick. The Xanax made me into a zombie, literally. I almost killed myself and a few friends while driving under the influence. That was enough to make me seek help and eventually got off the Xanax. But to get off the Xanax I started using opiates. Eventually I fell into heroin because I built up a tolerance to the pills. I didn't want to feel the pain, I still don't. I didn't want to feel the weightlessness of my broken heart, knowing she wasn't coming back. I still wake in the middle of the night hearing her voice, and feeling her right beside me. It's been 7 years getting deeper into addiction. From 2016 til 2019 I was a mess; I was nodding out, I stopped taking care of myself, got into car accidents, lost friends both friendships and their actual lives. It comes with the territory. During those early days of using, I found myself in very dark and sketchy situations/places. I spent my life savings, and was selling my belongings to support my habit. I had a ton of Bitcoin that'd I sold which would become worth a fortune later on. I was punishing myself every day for letting such an incredible relationship fall apart. 

Eventually I learned how to live with the loss of her by using heroin, how ironic that name has become. At least I feel somewhat better in a fucked up way, enough to work and continue wandering through this life. I can't even imagine what life would look like had I not found this drug. I don't inject it, thankfully I am deathly afraid of needless. I just snort it. I realized I wasn't going to live long with the trajectory I was on. Like a comet that looks like it's going to impale earth but instead it was always doomed to burn and disintegrate in the atmosphere. That woke me up to start taking proper steps to get clean heroin that doesn't contain fentanyl, the adulterant that is killing my fellow users every single day. I knew deep down I wanted to live but didn't know where to begin. So I started to learn how to use less, just enough to feel the warmth inside that it gives (I've always felt cold. Literally and figuratively throughout my life) and just enough to not be sick but less than I was taking to completely check out. I got back on my feet, moved back with my mother and started working various jobs. Things were beginning to level out. 

Fast forward to last year when I started my dream job. Everything up til that point was so bleak, like the afternath of a devastating war. Since getting this new job, I've found purpose again. I started to take care of myself, work on my perspective on life. Become a beacon of positivity starting in my workplace and eventually all aspects of life. I was tired of being miserable day in/day out. I was able to save up for the first time in years, and move out on my own again. Buy my own car. Support myself while not struggling every day to get by. Finally I began to truly live again, in my own broken kind of way. I go out to concerts by myself, doing activities by myself. It was an unbelievable transformation. I stopped hating myself, stopped focusing on the love lost, and began to put faith in myself and live more hopeful. It sucked I couldn't share this with anyone but I was proud of myself for doing it all on my own, for myself for once. The biggest perk of the new job was being able to get to know my two little sisters. One who is in grade school and the other an infant just on the cusp of Kindergarten. During the past year I've been able to get close with them because of my job. They live 3 hours away, which is a trip but still reasonable. Having those two girls in my life had my heart full for the first time in such a very long while. I never had a family like that before. Every time I walked through the door they'd scream my name and give me a big hug. The smiles on their faces would ahine bright through all the darkness behind me. The youngest was hesistant at first but the older showed her that I was someone to be trusted, family. Things were really looking up. Life can be fucking crazy. From a lonely, bleak existence to a family man. I was actually... happy for once? 

Occasionally I'll fall backwards and get into that pattern of thinking. Let's be real, getting out of a 7 year depression isn't going to change in a year. It takes work and a lot of effort. The negativity comes naturally. I have to stop and count my blessings often. But between work and my family, I'd be able to largely ignore the negative thoughts. 

And then it all started to crumble, just like 2015 and the instances before that. These past two weeks have been the ultimate test of my progress. Starting with my father and two baby sister's moving half way across the country. Long story short, my neurotic step mother (the mother of my sisters) forced my father's hand and he had no choice but to keep the family as together as possible, as well as partially out of fear that she would do something crazy and hurt him (which has happened before, I was there for one of her ""episodes""). But I would soon find out that I would not be included in their plan. They told me at the end of May that they were planning on moving across the country. I couldn't believe it. I fought so hard for our little family. Other family members tried to intervene. I even hired a lawyer to talk with my father. But nothing worked. They put the house on the market last month and the house sold within days. The closing was last week. It was weird seeing the house empty. I hated my step mom from the beginning and wanted nothing to do with her and that house. But everything changed once those two girls came to be. And after all that, I had to say my goodbyes. How could I explain to an 8 yr old and 3 yr old what was happening? I have been so worried for my father being isolated from everyone. I have been so worried for my sister's well being. My biggest fear is that I'll be a stranger to them because I won't be able to see them and spend a week or two each month like I had been. All these moments of my two sisters growing up except I was missing from their milestones in life. It all feels so surreal. Saying goodbye to my family was the hardest thing I had to do since saying goodbye to my ex. Seeing my innocent sister, caught in the middle of this ridiculous situation, crying and knowing that she won't see me in person for a long time, smashed my fucking heart back into a million pieces. She's just old enough to understand something wasn't right but still too young to understand her batshit crazy mother has just torn her brother from our family. I hadn't been able to cry since 2016 because I cried so much from 2015-16, except when my best friend (my dog I had for a long time) passed away from cancer. Well, I cried that day with my sister, then my dad came upstairs and cried with us together. These were our last moment together for the foreseeable future. The 3 hour drive home was unlike anything that I had felt in a very long long time. Like leaving the scene of a murder. All was silent that drive, tears streaming down my cheeks. I hadn't cried since then because I've been trying to block it. Scared the negativity will creep in, and even more afraid of going to that place I was on that day. 

This past week has been one thing after another, bad news upon bad news. And it's just grinding those broken heart pieces into dust. Writing this and reliving these moments has made me cry more than I have in years. Every single time I get close to anyone they either leave me, die, or end up hating me. I haven't had a best friend in years. Whenever I message old friends they ignore me, act like the years we knew each other had never existed. How can people be so cold? I don't understand why I don't get have even just one person to be close with. All I've ever wanted was to love and be loved. But all I get to experience is the cascading weight of loneliness, crashing all around me. It follows me wherever I go. My kind but broken heart trapped within 88ft thick walls. I've been doing right by those I encounter, even strangers, for years now. I don't understand why I have to suffer alone. Am I being punished because my medicine is unconventional? Is it because I did stupid shit when I was a teenager? Or is it because I never was supposed to belong in this world, my life having been saved when it was supposed to be damned? Will I ever find love again, have a family of my own? In finishing my story up to this point, I reflect upon Van Gogh's final words, ""la tristesse durera toujours.""",lonely,my story.,2022-07-28 13:59:03

639,Full-Newspaper4459,1658979513,1,"FOMC has been a trending accronym in the financial markets lately.
I created a simple quick read that explains the following:
•What is FOMC?
•What role do they play in the financial market?
•What happens at FOMC meeting?
•Why should an investor be interested in FOMC affairs?

Hang on tight😁....

FOMC  is the accronym for Federal Open Market Committee.
It is a 12-man committee set up by the federal reserve USA which oversees the buying and selling of government securities with the aim of effecting interest rates and money growth.

Here are some FOMC roles in the financial sector:

•Presides over open market operations that affect the federal funds rate.

•Adjusts the discount rate for financial institutions opting for short term loans.

•Authority to change the reserve requirement for banks.


The FOMC holds eight meetings per year. At these meetings, the Committee:

 •Reviews economic and financial conditions.

•Decides monetary policy. 

•Reviews the risks associated with these policies as to how it will affect it's long term goals of price stability and economic growth.

Whether you are an investor or not, FOMC affairs concern you as long as you use financial systems like bank. Here's why:

Banks use fund rate to guide all other interest rates. The fed funds rate controls the availability of money for salary and investment returns!",lonely,what You Must Know About FOMC,2022-07-28 13:38:33

659,pokevoiruwu,1658974053,1,"This will be a long winded post. I don't expect anyone to read it all, but I find solace that someone out there may hear my words.

I have been someone who is always full of life. Growing up my childhood had a lot of highs, but some of the deepest lows that I wouldn't ever wish on anyone. For all intensive purposes I was a very happy kid. I was always able to make friends wherever I went and generally had this magnetive personality that pulled people in. I can thankfully say that I had two wonderful loving parents who did their best to provide for me and I will always be so deeply appreciative of them. However a lot of my childhood was tarnished by being rather heavily abused by my older brother.

To say my brother was abusive would be an understatement. I'm sure that over the years a lot of the things he has done had been thoroughly suppressed but of the things I do remember they were not great. Almost on a daily basis I was emotionally, mentally, and physically abused. He was a very angry person growing up, often compensating his own insecurities by making it his mission to utterly break me as a person. Being constantly told I'm worthless, a burden, a piece of shit, fucking mistake, unlovable. To name calling such as calling me an ugly or fat waste of life. I was on the recieving end of countless beatings, being strangled, having a knife being pulled on me, concussions, bruises, cuts. Him being older and larger I would try my best to fight back but you know how that usually ends up. 

Because of this while externally I was a very happy child, internally I was pretty much broken. As the abuse progressed I became more and more reserved, isolated, and fearful of people. My parents often would say that I also instigated with my brother and I gave it just as much as I recieved it but they were honestly not home the majority of the time these things happened. They both worked full time jobs to provide for us. I couldn't tell you how many times it was just my brother and I home and I had to hold on for dear life as I baracade my door from his physical harm. 

Because of this I often found comfort in food, and my weight began to balloon significantly. By the time I entered 6th grade I was already 200 pounds. By the end of highschool around 280 (I'm 6 foot dead even). I was always self conscious about my appearance and looks and would often punish myself by eating more fully being lost in my brother's words that I was a fat piece of shit. Despite this however all throughout school I was able to make and maintain healthy friendships. To this day I still have friends from primary school that I still very much keep in contact with and appreciate them. 

My brother ended up finally getting out of my life in his senior year of highschool. To make long story short of what happened he ended up getting into legal trouble (stalking, harrassing female coworker, destruction of property) and was admitted to a psych ward as per my parents will as he was a minor at the time. He ended up being diagnosed with anxiety, depression, oppositional defiance disorder, multiple personality disorder and some other things I don't recall. He refused all treatment or medications, and shortly after turning 18 he left. He has many sociopathic tendencies and would often paint not only I but my parents in poor light, lying through his teeth to others just to get sympathy from others.

The reason why I bring all of this up is because I have some deep rooted issues that all stemmed from him. Self confidence issues, self image issues. I tended to seek validation from others almost to a fault. Always looking for or wanting approval , going out of my way to be selfless to others just to feel wanted or valued. Don't get me wrong, it honestly does make me happy to make others happy, but that is probably more just the fact seeing other people experience what I crave helps me feel good. I have completely cut all ties with my brother, he is a dispicable human being and will never forgive him for the things he has done to me, my family, and all of those that he has hurt. Although I don't keep tabs on him from what I've heard from others he is still very much the same aggresive , narcissistic , petty, insecure person he always was, probably even moreso.

While I will never forgive him for the things he has done, somehow I find myself being greatful to some extent. It is these experiences that has shaped me into the man I am today. And while I'm aware that I am not perfect, I wouldn't change anything about who I am. It is the name calling, the bruises, the trauma that has made me into the strong person that wakes up every morning and keeps tracking forward. 

To stop from deviating I will now come to address the title of my post. As many of you are aware, being severely overweight especially growing up has many disadvantages when it comes to finding intimacy. Especially when entering adolescents people are attracted to face value characteristics. While socially I was and still am very much liked, physical attraction not so much. Throughout primary school (grade 9-12) I ended up being rejected by 6 love interests. All of whom who were pretty blatent in the fact of telling me while they romantically were interested physically they were not, which not only crushed me inside, but validated the fact that because of my looks I was considered lesser or valueless. As each rejection came and went it became harder and harder for me to open up to people, and slowly over the years I straight up began to loose all interest in finding a relationship, but rather focus on myself. 

I am 23 now and I have come along way since highschool. I ended up dropping out from university (long story short I drank the year away and failed all my classes, very huge dose of reality) but bounced back rather quickly. I ended up securing a very well paying job in the government sector making 6 figures. About 2 years ago I began loosing weight and within a year I lost 130 pounds and hit my goal weight (I have tons of loose skin and will never look traditionally normal but I've come to terms with that). In the last two years I was able to splurge on myself a bit, bought my dream sports car and also pruchased my first home. Although my job isn't something I would say is a dream job, far from it, it keeps me occupied and pays the bills and then some. 

I thought loosing all that weight would really make me feel like a new person but nothing has changed. Physically I am far healthier and being completely objective I became quite a bit more attractive (turns out under my fat I actually have quite strong features) but my mentality is still the same. Apps such as tinder and bumble haven't helped either. I take time now to care about my appearance, not only in upkeep but also in clothes etc. I probably get a few more matches than before but not many more. I live in a rather small isolated community (20000 ish people) and the next city is more than a 1000 kms away. The dating scene here is rather limited. My career takes up a lot of my FreeTime which doesn't help. I don't drink at all, so never go to the bars (of which is the go to place to meet people in my area apparently). I ended up meeting a girl online of which I dated for about a year and had made plans to visit to but found out not only did she lie to me about most aspects about her life that she was constantly cheating on me, and only kept me around because I met her emotional needs (her roommate ended up messaging me through Facebook with evidence beyond reasonable doubt). Even things like lying to people saying I proposed to her and bought her a ring, a house for her, etc. It ended rather messy and blocked her on everything. This really fucked me for the past couple months.

I want to prefix by saying I don't believe I deserve to find a romantic partner. I don't feel as though I'm owned anything by anyone. It's not even a sexual thing for me. Although I am a sexual being I would be content with sexless relationship. I want the intimacy.. knowing that the person you're building a life with is your biggest confidant, cheer leader, best friend and so much more, both ways. I want to be able to share my life with someone who will not take advantage of me or use me. Stay up late just laughing, just being real with each other, being held and saying you matter to me. 

I really do try to stay optimistic, and I'd love nothing more to keep this blind faith strong that I will eventually meet my forever person, but I have given up all effort into finding it. So many co-workers of mine are always surprised that I'm single. Just last week one of my co-workers (bless her heart) kind of jokingly said ""you are sweet , kind, funny, have a good job, own a house, have nice cars, you'd be the perfect man for my little sister hahaha"" ""I hate her boyfriend he's such an ass I wish she would get together with someone who has their shit together like you"". I kind of just laughed it off, you and me both sister.

With all that being said I'm finally coming to terms with not finding someone. Whether my friends and family know it or not I am deeply lonely, but I will try my hardest to never let them know that because it's not their issue to deal with, it's mine. I don't know if I'll get any comments from my post, but it's cathartic in a way to just express all of this somewhere. Surprisingly even with all my past trauma I never once have been depressed or suffer anxiety or anything. I'm a rather rational and level headed person and often take the logical paths to reasoning. That's why I'm finally coming to absolute terms with my lonelyness. 

Thank you all in advance who takes the time to hear my words and story. Due to my line of work I am actually certified in mental health first aid, suicide crisis negotiation/prevention and trauma informed care, amongst other things. If any of you need someone to talk to I'm more than happy to do so. Please take care Reddit.",lonely,coming to terms I will never find someone to share my life with,2022-07-28 12:07:33

The second someone is kind to me I tip a lot. One night I went to pick up food at a restaurant. The lady took the time to make sure everything I ordered was in the bag and added napkins. That act of kindness is the only one I saw that week and I still think about it. It didn’t mean anything to her it’s just a job and not even a good one but I still remember it. No one else does that there. 

Last night a lady came to deliver my pizza. She got lost and called me so i helped her find it. She delivered it and had an amazing attitude. I don’t usually tip. 

But she took the time to find me where others might not have and when I tipped her she was truly great-full and the look on her face. She needed it.

745,k_aevitas,1658938094,1,"It's difficult for me to share this but I am feeling quite helpless and want some advice. 

Without going into huge details because that would take forever, I am someone that has endured severe trauma throughout my life that started since childhood. Most people cannot believe I went through some of the things I did and still function properly as a normal person. They have not even the faintest clue because on surface I come across as a successful good looking person that can get anything I want. I attempted suicide multiple times in my life and still sometimes feel that way when things push me over the edge. 

I have no friends or family, and not a single person in the world I can truly talk to about anything. Everything is superficial, random acquaintances or people I met while I traveled or something similar who are not friends or anything.

Years ago I went through absolute hell after being involved with a malignant narcissist that almost ruined my life. I finally managed to cut it off and worked on myself. For 4 years I was not involved with anyone in general, especially the opposite sex because I figured I needed to take that time to heal and work on myself. I exercised frequently, became fit, got a new degree after studying my ass off and a new career. Unfortunately I had to live with my single parent who is a narcissist and mentally unwell so I believe that's part of the reason why I could not fully heal. Even without that however, if I was living alone I feel like I would have died from loneliness regardless.

For years I have tried everything, therapy, medication, daily affirmations and tried everything in my power to change my subconscious belief. Eventually after some years I came out of my shell and got myself out there, actively tried to meet new people like therapists suggested, was friendly, courteous, polite, went out of my way for people only to be used or just ghosted. Everyone says you need to change yourself within and feel happy with yourself but how can you possibly do that if you truly have no one at all in your life ? I think most of that works because the average person has someone, at least a single person in their life. I've never met someone else like me and even other people the few who know a glimpse of this, are stunned and don't understand why it's like this for me.

I had some psychic that apparently said that my life is going to be full of perpetual loneliness, and that sadly it's just the way it is for some people , a fate that can't be changed and it sent me into a spiralling depression even when I don't want to believe it.

When I try to date, everyone I fell madly in love with were abusive or those who were unavailable in the end. I have tried EVERYTHING I possibly could to resist and prevent this, affirmations, scripting, telling myself daily that I deserve more and deserve love but something obviously isn't enough because the core inner child wound still is there that I'm not fully aware of. Consciously I truly believe I do deserve love and happiness but how helpful can this be when my subconsciousness isn't changing? Therapists also don't tackle the subconsciusness they can only help you consciously take steps and my trauma is a lot more insidious and severe than most people. 

I also think revising and pretending like my trauma didn't exist makes me feel worse because I feel that its dismissing who I am as a person as a result of it. I also tried that and again, it still doesn't work to change the subconscious that's still wounded.

One of the biggest challenges when it comes to dating and becoming close to people in general friendship or otherwise is eventually I think they sense this inner void within me. I try my best to hide it but how can I? I am very selective and guarded but once I like someone, I end up attaching myself to people very very intensely and quite quickly. Even when I force myself to step back I think they can sense this energy. I find it very difficult to resist because I try to follow the advice of just letting go and going with the flow in a positive manner but it isn't giving me the results I want. I also actually had to come to terms with the fact that the reason I attach so intensely and deeply for people far more than most are capable of is because I had no one, and it's trying to make up for the love I never received growing up. It's like I'm chasing unconditional love that my parents never gave me even though that's impossible to expect someone to give. I end up sometimes having an anxiety attack at the thought of people finding out that I have no one and it makes me embarrassed and ashamed. 

Anyway, I can ramble forever but I was curious if anyone else has ever been in a similar situation, or even if you haven't, did anyone successfully unwire this subconscious damage once and for all ? I desperately want to change my life because I can't continue like this, I feel I am being slowly sent to an early grave.",lonely,has anyone actually cured their chronic loneliness?,2022-07-28 02:08:14

They felt insecure over something, something they really had no reason to feel insecure over, and I said, "" gonna use the same advice you given to me when I am in my head. You are in your head, get the fuck over it."" Only to have them start crying, saying I am smug about this and think they are stupid. Granted, they never said the advice I gave word for word, it is just how I process it when they do speak to me during my insecure moments. But the other parts? I value this person so goddman much. We been there for each other for years, helping each other when ever the other needed it, sharing in the highs and lows of our lives and the growth we made. All of it to be tossed aside by them because of one bad comment? I apologized and spilt my heart out to them later that day. Explaining how I thought, felt, and how they were so wrong in thinking I felt/thought that way about them in their insecurity. Only for days to pass and get ""I really dont know what words to say, but we are good."" Then never really talk to me again.  Weeks pass, and yesterday they comment about "" so am I just never going to see you again?"" And I was honest. I brought up the issue of the one sided responses, how it seems they dont care and that I am not worth the effort to put words forth. An attempt too address this problem and fix/ learn from it so our friendship can stay secure and grow. Only to be ignored again all day and night. Presumably because they were with their SO, the source of insecurity that caused this whole event. And now, I feel so empty. Like I really did not matter to them as much as they said. That my friendship is only valuable when its convenient to them. That the moment any effort needs to come forth from the other person (takes two to make a friendship after all) that I am marked as not worth the energy. So today, I just feel empty and cold.

Today is my 18th birthday. A big day you would say, but to be honest I can't wait until it's over. I'm just sitting at home with my parents and brother, forcing myself to smile and act like I'm having a great birthday. But I'm not.

The only 'happy-birthday wishes' I got were from my parents, my brother, a text from my sister and a call from my grandparents. Oh, and don't forget the automatic email from my work... :') I haven't heard anything from my 'friends' or other family members. I guess people forget about me easily. And that's fine.

I know I should hold onto my life, since its my most valuable thing I have, but on days like these being alive just feels like a chore. But I'll guess we have to move on to live/'fight' another day. 

Thanks for listening.

Take care guys.",lonely,'Happy' Birthday to me...,2022-07-28 00:33:23

Everytime they told me they are scared, feel pressured, know the parents are homophobic and others always told them to come out, they will feel better, if your family don't accept you then they don't deserve... And of course I understand but I tend to think that having people acknowledging you shouldn't be something that important in your life.
As long as you are able to accept and love yourself then you should be fine

Being a huge introvert myself, I understood that some people needed time alone but the realization that my best friend is ignoring me is daunting because she was the only person I had. She’s on Twitter talking about hockey and I’m here wondering why she hasn’t texted me back in months.

During July 4th (her birthday), we would always watch the fireworks together and joke about whatever. This year, I sat alone at the docks watching fireworks and with each explosion, it felt like my heart was exploding too. I wanted to jump into the ocean so badly.

We’ve been friends for over a decade. I remember when we first met super clearly. She was a timid child who hid behind her mom and barely spoke English. I asked her to play jump rope with me, introduced her to all my friends, and helped her become accustomed to the U.S. (Ngl, I miss the innocence of childhood and how easy it was to make friends with everyone)

Over the years, she was always there for me because I was there for her when she first immigrated. She stopped my 2nd suicide attempt, offered me a place to stay when I wanted to run away, and held me in her arms whenever my mom cursed the shit out of me.

Now I’m left wondering if she regrets saving my life or having ever met me. All the people I’ve given a piece of my heart to always seem to leave and I wonder what’s wrong with me. I’ve asked classmates their impressions of me to find a root cause and their general responses were that I had a scary stare, am pretty, polite, and a workaholic. Besides the scary stare part, I don’t understand why I’m a people repellant?? Maybe I’m too emotional or depressive? I’ve tried smiling way more but as time goes on, I feel fake

771,Big-Addition8154,1658928540,1,"For context I had a girlfriend for over a year and a half and for the last couple months of being in the relationship I'd really been wanting to get out of it. Everytime I tried to talk about how I felt to her she would turn it against me or get upset over something about it leading to me comforting her instead. I have some online friends but I'm not close to any of them nor would I want to be. I have a brother aswell, but he's a lot younger than me and I couldn't talk to him about anything on a personal level to do with mental health.

During the relationship I'd been through quite a lot and I'd done quite a lot of things I'm not proud of. I tried to kill myself and self harmed quite a lot leaving scars I still have. This was about half way through it. I'm far from perfect and I think I'm mostly the reason it didn't work out because of how controlling I felt.

 I didn't control what she did or what she wore and I believe that everybody should be able to have their own choice on that, but when I can't even say that it's making me really uncomfortable without being screamed at and told I'm an asshole It's painful.

Theres some other things i'd rather not say that had happened in that relationship. but I've shut off every emotion I have and I can't cry anymore. I just feel empty, and I can't talk to anyone because I'm afraid of what they'd think or that they'd think its immature or stupid. 

I don't want to be in a relationship again because I'm afraid of the feelings it'll bring back or the things ill constantly be worrying about or the million ways i'd mess it up. 

I desperately want love but I can't have it. I'd feel so controlling and not say anything about it leading to me just destroying myself over and over. I have no idea what to do and I can't talk to anybody at all. 

This was my first serious relationship i've ever had and it ended about a month ago. I'm still a teenager and I end up falling for any girl I talk to when they seem caring but quickly shut out those feelings because it'd only ever end worst for me if I didn't.

Growing up, I always had three or so close friends at a time. When I got to high school, I was down to one best friend, but he was usually an ass to me, so I stopped being friends with him after high school. I’ve always been the type that enjoyed having a few very close friendships instead of a multitude of surface-level friendships, but that backfires in situations like the one I just mentioned above. 


I made one friend at a job in early 2019 after not having any irl friends for almost two years straight, and we both hung out a lot that year. Due to logistical issues involving him moving away, we didn’t hangout at all in 2020 or 2021, and then we only hung out one time in February of this year. However, we still had weekly multiple-hour-long phone calls throughout the time we didn’t see each other in person. Back in May of this year, he suddenly ghosted me over a super small disagreement. 


That leads me to now. I have zero irl friends. I was close to my cousin five years ago, but we stopped talking in 2018 due to stupid extended-family drama. Because of that drama, my immediate family also stopped having get togethers with my extended family, so I don’t have a relationship with them either. I’m not exaggerating when I say the only person I speak to outside of my immediate family is my one online friend. I could leave my phone off for a year and not return to a single notification. 


The way my social life has turned out is really starting to fuck with my head at this point. I feel completely alone and out of touch with reality or society. Even when I see people on here or other forums talking about being lonely, it seems that they still at least have some old buddies they could catch up with if they wanted to, family members, old classmates, etc. My one online friend has some social difficulties, but she’s formed 100 times more social connections throughout her life than I have. It feels like I’ve literally gone through life as a ghost.


This post is long and no one will read it, but it’s just frustrating. I’m well aware at this point that 99.9999% of my current situation is my own fault, and I know I didn’t take any initiative to make friends throughout my life. I’ve actually done the complete opposite and turned down quite literally 20+ people from school, work, etc.  who wanted to hangout, play video games together, etc. because I’m a judgmental fuck.

I changed my number, moved, deleted social media, removed my info from every people search website I could find, etc. Yes they were that toxic. To be honest my parents were toxic as well but they were my parents and I loved them. My father was an alcoholic and womanizer his whole life who didn't seem to give much of a shit that I was alive most of the time. My mother was a mess and among other weird things once decided it was okay to tell a 10 year old (me) his dad may not actually be his dad. They were never married. I was the lucky bastard (literally) that was the result of one of his many affairs. A fact my half-siblings always seemed to remind me of somehow, like it was my fault.

I woke up thinking she was alive still only to realize it was the same dream I've been having since she passed in 2007.

786,LaminarEntropy,1658912561,1,"I kind of thought about this today. I noticed that I was in a rough state for the past two months and I spent more time trying to reach out to people because of it, but the past two weeks have been sort of better and I find myself returning to how I was before and I don't really reach out to people anymore. It makes me feel like I only care about people if they can do something for me and I feel selfish for that.

But why? I think part of it is that I was hurt by the people who were supposed to care about me. My Dad had rare instances of physical harm towards us but it was enough for him to not have custody of us after they divorced around 2002-2003 I don't remember exactly. My Mom seems like a person who regrets having kids, especially because of the period of time where she had to raise two kids on her own. She got frustrated with my brother and I and was generally distant. I wouldn't consider her abusive. The person she eventually married was a horrible parent though.

There was this point around 8th grade where a bad report card lead to me having all of my stuff thrown away never to be seen again. My entire childhood and identity was erased. I felt like this was normal parenting stuff. I shit you not the only things in my room was my bed, my backpack, and my clothes. If it wasn't for visiting my father every other weekend, I wouldn't have been able to use a computer. There were so many signs that I might have an interest in computer science related things which I eventually got into, but my parents hated the idea of me being anywhere near it. It's like they didn't care about understanding me. The combination of my Mom and step Dad was so defeating. At some point I wouldn't be surprised if they were in denial about me being high functioning.

So I build this wall during my childhood. It's the best way I can describe it. My brother was sort of inside of that wall but he was sort of walled off to a deeper part I guess. Last year this person I had known for years started talking to me a lot. I fell in love but they didn't feel the same way. It wasn't a breakup but it felt like one. I realized later the things they said and did showed little regard for my feelings much like my parents. It hurt so much for me to watch this image of this person in my head change realizing I never truly understood them. I was used for a purpose and that was it. I was a tool to them. They were the first person I let see me. I mean inside each layer of walls. They're still there even after all of this pain. The only thing left that I can do is build another wall deeper inside.

What's this more inner wall like though? Well sometimes I feel like I'm in a coma or dreaming. I questioned a lot if what I was experiencing is real or not. I have never been so lonely and now I can't trust anyone. Everyone has a motive to me now. At least that's how it feels sometimes. Is anything good faith anymore? How can I trust people to see me? These walls make it hard to communicate my feelings too. ADHD has a tendency to make it hard to match what I feel with what I say. I just want to ignore people. I felt nothing my first time having sex and I feel nothing all the time because my life is a movie and I don't want to stick to the script.",lonely,I might be alone simply because I can't trust anyone enough.,2022-07-27 19:02:41

804,WarMitaka,1658899618,1,"I just turned 25 a few months ago. I'm basically a loser in every sort of way. I'm riddled with  social anxiety and overthinking. I haven't had friends IRL since I graduated in 2015. I'm not exaggerating at all. I know some people say they have no friends when they're surrounded by people but I have no one. I've never had a girlfriend in real life. Never hugged or kissed anyone either. You can figure out the rest without me going into detail.. sadly.

I'm 25 but mentally I feel 18. No one has taught me anything about life when  I was growing up. No one ever encouraged me and helped me with college when i was in highschool so here I am as a 25 year old with nothing going for him. I work alone in a gift store. I'm basically the NPC people see in games and forget about 10 seconds later. 

i don't have anyone to text or talk to through out the day. I'm constantly checking my phone to see if I got notifications on discord or someone replied to a reddit post I made. Of course they haven't but I've trained my self to always check regardless. It's a horrible feeling to wake up to an empty phone and then have 10 hours pass by and still nothing. I wouldn't wish this feeling of isolation on anyone not even my worst enemy.

 I've tried improve myself like getting rid of the nerdy smash-player afro and getting dreads. dressing better and new glasses. but then once I did all of those things I realized I still don't have friends so what's the point..

My brain is so fucked. These days the only thing on my mind is dying. I'm scared of death and pain but  I feel so bad I don't know how else to move on in life or cope with being all alone. I'm a nice person.. I've never hurt anyone in my life. I don't raise my voice at anyone and I'm really shy and quiet. But I'm so envious of everyone.  I wish I could be them or experience life again.

I always knew i was ugly but I hoped i would develop some intelligence to counterbalance my short comings but I wound up average in almost everything besides looks (subpart). I have horrible self esteem due to everything and my life has been completely altered due to an injury. I have tried doing everything to improve myself and love myself mentally, physically, and emotionally. Nothing has worked, I have been laughed at by women and my parents have also mentioned (on more than one occasion) that I am weird and or stupid. One girl even told me to my face that she has higher standards( doesn't sound bad in writing but hurt like hell in person). My friends and classmates never really talked to me and never invited me to anything. I see my friends stories of parties at least twice a week. I don't know what it is about me they don't like. I try to stay clam all the time and try not to talk too much in fear of beeing annoying or sounding like an idiot.I feel like I will never be able to love myself or even be good enough for anyone. I think i have developed a complex because i feel so disgusted by myself and annoyed at my existence. I believe I am also terrified of marriage not for commitment reasons but for financial reasons as well as the fear of failure/rejection and the possibility my spouse will stop loving me one day. Im loyal and hard working and would do whatever it takes to make them happy but I haven't had any luck ( which I have none in any aspect of my life).

It wasn't too hard, not too time consuming, let me a lot of free time to play video games and chat with friends and a lot of clients were extremely nice when I had almost nothing to do in the end. Perfect job for a lazy piece of shit like me. 

Less than a month ago, a childhood friend calls me to ask if I can get the files from a corrupted SD card. I say sure, thinking it's strange he contacted me since my shop is 1 hour from where he lives and there's one closer to him. I think nothing of it, maybe it's some porn or pics of his tiny Weiner and he doesn't want a stranger to see them. Tell my best friend about it and she's getting suspicious. I say it's her paranoia again. 

Next day, the friend arrives with the SD card, looks really nervous. Says something in the lines of ""don't look at it too much, this has to stay between us, I trust you bro"". Tell best friend, she says I should get rid of the card and not even touch it, tell the friend it was too corrupted to get anything. Should have listened to her but I call her a paranoid bitch and go work on it.

It was porn. But ... You can probably guess what the problem was. Let's just say that the oldest person in those pictures seems to be middle school aged. So I freak out, call best friend. She says I need to call the cops so I do it. They come, confiscate the SD card and my working computer. Friend is arrested. I'm a hero. WRONG ! 

Boss gets angry because they took my working computer and now people are talking about what happened and clients are going to leave us. And all my pedo defenders ""friends"" are threatening me because I snitched. 

So now I have no job, no friends except suicidal bitch best friend, my parents don't talk to me anymore and my brother is in Ukraine. My life is miserable and I really don't know if it's still worth trying. I'll be 40 next year, no girlfriend, no bitches in sight ...

868,windblowstheotherway,1658871666,1,"For the last 4 years, I’ve been creating my own story that reflects my mental state.

So let's start at the beginning, where my story, Chalin (or Kaleen), began.

In the summer of year 1, the prototype Chalin was created, with the main character being Kara.

She was pretty naive, the typical hero vs villain and honestly pretty empty, with her ability being Sound Manipulation. Why? I liked it, cause it was versatile and also because it meant you could scream your heart out without anyone hearing you. This was my crying phase, and honestly it was pretty cringey for me:/

Year two, I trashed prototype Chalin and just started again, with the baseline of Kara. In that time, I managed to make a *lot* of characters for different time periods and different places though like half of the older characters never meet the younger characters and half of the younger characters are stuck in another land. 

Despite being created last year, Kara was starting to get developed in year 2. Kara’s personality was summed up to show a ton of expressions but none of them were real and only wanted to keep the peace by never getting into fights or getting angry.

At the time, I was crying a lot but I could never get openly angry, since any signs of aggression, slamming the door, walking around angrily, or other stuff was not tolerated and you would just get more punishments (although I guess it wasn’t that bad).

Year three, Hanna Asashina (created in year two) was starting to get some character development, but not anything that complicated. Covid ended and school could distract me, and I left Chalin alone, and concluded that the story had ended, with a new character coming out to replace Ark: Ru Toko, a wanderer.

Year 4, I started having violent urges to hit something, someone, or even myself. And Ark got some character development too. He was a villain that was mainly neutral but slightly manipulated by Juke. Anyways, Ark was more of Kara’s real feelings than Kara was herself and he went out to get rid of obstacles.",lonely,draft (ask questions if you'd like also i'll rewrite this when I feel bored),2022-07-27 07:41:06

878,maroonedowl,1658866551,1,"I am so so lonely. I have so many interests, like psychiatry, hip-hop, rock, piano, reading, learning etc etc. and I have absolutely no one to share this with. Nobody at all. All my friends have completely different interests and up until few days back it didn't bother me as much because I'd tell myself that friendship and relationships are beyond this. But sometimes I just wanna share or talk and everytime I do that with my friends I feel like they are burdened to respond. And off late I have been feeling like they are growing distant because of how different we are. I don't know if I'll ever overcome this. 

I can't be in a relationship because I am not girlfriend material and not pretty enough. I had a scene with a boy and he listens to the same music and I want him to be my friend so that I have someone who I can bounce ideas off but I don't think he's interested in that. Why would he be? All of my other friends are dating or are in situationships with someone so that occupies most of their time. Don't get me wrong, I do a lot of internships, practice my piano a lot, and keep myself busy. But it's at night when all of this starts sinking in that I have no one and that I probably will never have anyone and it's crippling. 

It's so crippling. I am an extrovert and I need company. Will I ever find company? Do I deserve company? I am so so alone. Should I just kill myself so all of this goes. Everyone has someone, I don't have anyone.",lonely,It's crippling,2022-07-27 06:15:51

880,MonkeywithFeelings,1658865192,1,"I am in a bad place right now. Everything has just become a bit too much and I really need to vent. So that is just what this is.
I feel incredibly alone. I generally like living on my own and am an optimistic person normally but the past few months I really miss having someone who I can trust fully, someone to share my day with and cuddle on the couch with, someone to fall asleep next to. Someone to do anything with.

I don't have any real friends, I have a few friendships but I see them only a few times a year, and none of those are people who I would really call in case of an emergency.
I did have 2 people who I was very close with in the past but both of the relationships didn't work in the past. I don't know if it will work now but I am not in a state to say right now. But I can't let those go, I am still with my mind in the past and don't know if I am ever able to really let that go.

I know I am desperate for some attention at the moment and will accept anything that gives me a little form of human contact. I am swiping around a bit on dating apps, never swiping right or talking to anyone because I know I am not ready for a relationship now, and I don't want casual sex. I have done something like that in the past and I know it isn't real, it isn't really love or care for someone but I couldn't take it anymore and wanted to fool myself with the feeling of someone that cares for me.

I've lost my mother quite some time ago and my father isn't the comforting type of person. I really have no one to talk to, to share my feelings with and to comfort me when I'm feeling down. I think it is really my mother that I miss and although I know I won't get her back but I just want someone that will love me unconditionally as well and feel at home again.

I'm not saying all my friendships have been bad, some of them have been good but I've had a bad friendship for around 2 years that I got out of a couple of month ago. There was no bullying, just being forgotten and ignored. They'd talk to me a bit on their own but I kinda had to start the conversations myself which is hard for me because I have bad social anxiety and low self confidence.
Recently I've been feeling a lot lonelier than usual. I don't have any friends rn. I'm starting uni this year so it's kind of an empty space until I start in September. I've kinda been get really desperate for friends. Like, I see someone in TV or film or on social media that I like. I learn more about them and what they're like and then I kind of attach myself to them. I like the idea of them but I don't really know what they're like. It hurts to do that though because I know that these people, whether they're famous or not, I'll never be able to be friends with them. I can't help myself though, it's just become a thing my brain does without me knowing or having control and it makes me feel more alone than I was before.
I see it a bit like ""I have so much love to give out but no one to give it to"" except not romantic love, friend love. I don't know if that's the right way to see it but it's the way that describes it best and feels right.
I figure this feeling will go away once I've made friends at uni because I've never felt this particular way until recently but I felt like sharing how I'm feeling now might help me a bit",lonely,Feeling desperate for a friend,2022-07-27 05:33:08

888,EducationalBig39,1658861135,1,"It’s been this way since I was a child.

I leave. I experience what it feels like to not be alone and it heals something. I experience how it feels to walk down a road and see other people just existing. I feel like there’s possibilities and opportunities at my fingertips and if I just reached for them they could be mine. I feel alive. Happy even. It makes me wonder how I could ever feel alone when there’s so many people around and I don’t. I don’t feel alone.

And then I return and I could walk out of the door and see not one person for miles. I wake up to an empty house that for the most part, stays empty all day. I refresh email inboxes for confirmation dates of return to study because at least that’ll give the days some purpose. They never come. I try to drown myself with said study and it only ever burns me out. Without the frequent classes I’m losing motivation fast and I think I’ve reached my limit with the amount of private lessons I can take and that my tutor can (thankfully) give.

This place steals the life from me and I *know* I shouldn’t complain because there are people that would kill for this, this solitude, the freedom, the breathing space, but there’s only so much quiet one person can take. 

When there’s rarely any messages pinging your phone, no chores or responsibilities to keep you occupied, no small forms of contact that you would get from colleagues or acquaintances that remind you ‘Hey, you exist too’..

I feel like a ghost here. Waking and walking in what I can only describe as a ghost town and the only thing that keeps me going is the hope that I’ll one day leave again. To anywhere. Temporarily. Permanently. Though I’m not naive in thinking the latter will ever be anything more than a pipe dream. 

I’m just tired. I’m tired of being tired. I’m tired of never truly escaping this place. I’m tired of being alone because nobody really understands what it’s like to be *this* alone and I just wish the happiness stayed. I wish I could take a weekend and keep it on repeat because it was so incredibly nice to not be alone.

I have never and will never be happy for as long as I’m here and I am absolutely terrified that I won’t make it out.

890,VioletFlorence,1658860104,1,"Yea title explains it. I feel so unloved recently and idek why I’m posting it here. I just wanna get things out of my head I guess. 

I don’t have a family bc my parents are emotionally and physically abusive. My sister abuses substances and has a really short temper and could never wanna listen to anyone that has a different opinion than her. And my extended family are either passed away or toxic af.

I lost the person who I thought would be the love of my life, and I know that this happened quite a long time ago but sometimes it’s still hard to move on esp when I find out only 2 months after the breakup, they already found someone new. It just makes me feel like I’m easily replaceable. I guess I am. It didn’t help that during the early stages of the breakup, their friends were doing their best to gaslight me to justify all their shitty behavior bc “they have a bad life” and trying to get me back together with them.

My friends often tend to prioritize other people, usually their other friends or sometimes their partners; which the partner one is probably more understandable. I would see my friends hanging out with their other friends a lot but never hung out with me or seem to chat me much at all even if I initiated. Hell no one even remembers my birthdays even if they remember everyone else’s birthdays.

Even recently I lost someone who seems to be close to me and told me they were their best friend. And I lost them because, despite being their “best friend”, they ghosted me for their new partner.

And like I’ve been here a couple of times so I’m kinda used to it but I’m even more upset that whenever I vent to people, people don’t seem to sympathize with me. I vented to one of my other friends and all they said was essentially “well to be fair I did this to you too. It’s just normal for this to happen” no sympathy at all.

Idk when they said that it kinda made me feel like I don’t deserve to be someone’s close friend, or someone who is at the same priority than their other friends and I only deserve to be the extra friend if they have no one else to talk to. It’s been kinda eating me up inside. I’m kinda tired of trying so hard to prove I’m worth someone’s time. It makes me want to cut off everyone out of my life but I just can’t bc they’re kinda all I have. And finding new friends is so hard when you’re too burned out to engage in interest groups and finding friends in a socializing site/group such as r/MakeNewFriendsHere or r/NeedAFriend or r/r4r don’t take much interest in anyone who isn’t female. 

I just want to be with people who actually care about me. Not have an unhealthy attachment with me, not the exact opposite just the healthy middle spectrum.

During my other friend's engagement party she was with me the whole night, playfully flirting and it caught a lot of people's attention.

I've had a thing for her for a little bit but it was mostly infatuation, but after last week I couldn't stop thinking about her and I started to really like her. Long story short one of my buddies reached out to her and blew up in his face, she's still trying to find closure with an ex among other things and as far as I know, she only sees me as a good friend. I was expecting that answer anyways so tbh I wasn't really surprised.

Still sucks tho because it's always good vibes with her and me, and I figured she'd be the one I could see myself being in a relationship with. After this whole ordeal, I've begun talking with an ex again, they're quite toxic but I'm keeping them at arm's length, I think it's more for the company right now.

917,anonymous27911,1658843285,1,"So I am a 15 year old, like gaming, music just basic stuff like that but I'm hella lonely. 

I live in England in quite a busy small town and I have no family. I have friends that I will occasionally speak to but at the end of the day I feel like everyone has so much going on like travelling, hanging out constantly with people, going on trips with family and even just talking to family but I have none of that and never did. 

At times when my friends tell them about their day or what they have been doing in life - I hate to say this - but I just envy and get mad because I wish I had that, and also when they complain about their day how they are stuck with family and can't do what they want it makes me want to scream because that's what I want the most in life. Just to be surrounded by people, feel loved and wanted. 

I live with my brother and my mum but I do not communicate at all with my brother (he is 17) so I only really have my mum. On top of that my mum is depressed and stays most her days in bed and my brother at work. The only things I really have left to do is play games ( or hang with friends but I don't do that too often)

My mum doesn't have any friends since she is originally from a different country and lost them over the years of depression and stuff with my dad that happened and on top of that we don't have any family here to speak to. I don't speak my mum's language so reaching out to them to communicate isn't really an option.

I don't know what my goal is here but is there any way I can make my life a little less depressing? I don't have a lot of money and can't work at moment so there's nowhere I can really go or anyone I can talk to.

I groom myself, has proper hair, and wears nothing overly fancy but passable by realmanstyle's standard. I drink for occasions but I don't smoke, and I make sure my breath doesn't stink. I can carry a conversation and crack a joke or two, but only if given the opportunity. 

My wife left home for career opportunity overseas and due to various factors I couldn't join her and we are basically separated from each other for almost 3 years now. Naturally we have gotten more distant to each other emotionally. She is always busy and there's been more than once I've been told off for trying to message her so we don't really exchange messages often anymore other than forwarding random funny stuffs (which she also sends me) and a weekly catch up phone call. But nevertheless...

**I feel lonely.**

I used to think that being alone doesn't mean lonely, and I really didn't feel this way previously but I think the loneliness is creeping up and it's getting worse. I think part of it is also due to crypto bear market as I mostly feel ready and excited everyday during the bull market to make profit, but not anymore. A lot of people have left the market and it is very boring now.

**I feel bored.**

At work, the girls I am attracted to (and would like to talk more with) don't seem to be noticing me, more so getting attracted to me. Imagine being in the same pantry and not even making eye contact, she's not even in a rush as it's a slow morning.

**I feel unwanted.**

At commute, the girls I am attracted to are either paranoid of getting close to male commuters, or stuck on their phone the whole trip. No, I do not have body odor, suffocating perfume, psycho stare or touching inappropriately. It's simply nobody is interested.

**I feel invisible.**

I joined a swingers online community, and tried a little of asking around for a casual date, nobody is interested. No, I did not send lame one-liners, dick pics or asking for sex in DM. It's simply nobody is interested. Or rather they are only interested in connecting with people they have already trust since it's a swinger community anyway. I am not looking for sex, just someone to hang out with in a casual outing.

Almost 3 years of not having sex, and I have gotten to a point that I hate myself for masturbating because it feels lame. I don't even masturbate that much, never going more than 3 times a week and most of the times less than that.

I missed getting touched.

Getting hugged.

Getting kissed.

Getting laid.

But I am not wealthy enough to just pay women to do all that, nor do I want to. Most of my money goes to my investments. But I am not a stingy person by any means. I will pay for dates. I treat my colleagues randomly. I drop a note or two to buskers and beggars.

Other than delivering at my job and getting thanks and compliments at work, I am trying to work on my personal project at home as well. I try to spend my time productively, or so I thought.

929,jawong50,1658838704,1,"It’s 3am on a Tuesday morning and I am typing down my thoughts as they come up. The reason I had woken up was that I had a nightmare, something about an apocalyptic dystopia like from War of the Worlds, and was generally feeling uncomfortable, not only due to the feeling of the bed but I had several thoughts in my head that troubled me. 

I’m sitting in the dark, thinking about how I was rejected by my crush and how alone I felt on the inside. That was 2 months ago yet I still think about her all of the time, a thought that used to make me happy now left me heartbroken as I clung on to any feelings of happiness I could find. It has become so bad that I have been having obsessive thoughts on a regular basis. I preferred not to cling on to the past because it just made moving forward all the more harder to do but it felt better than feeling lonely as I do now. 

The feeling of being lonely can be described as being unable to emotionally connect to people around you. I was told that to get over my obsession I needed to spend time alone. But for me it only intensified my obsessive thoughts.

What made me feel so lonely was the feeling that society had turned its back on me. I tried reaching out to people in an attempt to make friends but every time I tried people ended up losing interest in me and just leaving, leaving me on my own and discouraged to try again. I felt like I had to do everything myself, take responsibility for everything, carry the weight of myself and everything that people have given me over the years, feelings of failure, rejection, heartbreak, frustration, hopelessness, anxiety, depression. If I did something right it didn’t really matter but if I did something wrong it was my fault and my fault alone because I had no one else to blame and I carried it for the rest of my life.

Sometimes I just wish, by some miracle, that I would get help, be able to overcome what I am dealing with, and get on with my life. I just really hate feeling lonely.

I can't tell if it's from a build up of exhaustion or a build up of the effects of countless phone/computer/tv binge sessions. Feels like someone is prying my eyes open while blowing a hair dryer in my face.

The obvious solution is to just put my phone down and get some sleep. But the second I put this thing down, get comfy and try to sleep... I have nothing to distract me from what I don't want to think about.

Why am I so unlovable? Am I gonna be miserable my entire life? Why can't I do anything right? Why am I so worthless? Will anyone ever love me? If they did, would I deserve it? How can I possibly make myself happy when I can't even get out of bed?

That's only a fraction of what starts racing through my head. That is, until I pick my phone back up and mindlessly start consuming content. I can't think bad thoughts if I let the blue light of my phone screen burn away all my brain cells.

I just want someone to hold me. I want to cry out, scream in agony to the world about my pain but here I am instead. Sitting in complete darkness, minus the glow of screen and that one crack in the curtains that exposes the streetlights outside. I don't cry out, the only sounds around me are the whirring of the fan, whispers of the wind and snoring of dog.

At this point, even if I got what I wanted... Someone willing to lay in bed with me, stroke my hair and tell me it's ok and they love me dearly, I'm not a pointless burden, I doubt I would believe it. Maybe that's why I don't have such a gift, it would be wasted on me.

I am not told i am doing good ever, i am only told when i am doing bad, like when i got honor roll i never heard a word from my parents. but when i was failing ONE CLASS, i am told that i am expected to be better. also i get alot of pressure being the oldest in the house, and being the only boy that my dad has ever had. whenever i want something, i am expected to buy it myself, but if any other kid wants something, BOOM they have it. i had a tv put in my room one time, and i was told not to touch it, that it was being givin to my older sister with 3 tv's already. also my mom recently got back together with my dad after being separated for half of my life and she had all of her stuff in a storage unit. we were getting things out and everything of mine was basically sold. all i wanted was to keep a keyboard that my grandma had given me for christmas and i was told that i am not aloud to have it. that made me pissed. also i try to act fun and nice around my little sisters, and its summer so me and my  mom watch them during the day.  my mom really makes me angry when she says things like "" shut the fuck up"" or ""be quiet before i knock your teeth out"" and other things along that line.  she never actualy does it but what makes me mad is that she is an asshole to me around my little sisters, and i dont want them to haveto hear that. also i told my mom to shut up around my sisters, and when my dad got home, he started to attack me without my side of the story. my sisters watched as there fun big brother cried while being attacked on the ground, and i was blamed for the fight. did i also mention that i am not allowed to get a job. i also get rejected by everyone i have ever asked out.  i am either to ugly or they just dont like me. i have trouble asking people out. i am to afraid of rejection. i try my best to look the best i can. but its not enough. i once asked a girl out and she said yes, so i planned a date. but when i arrived at the place she never showed up. i was then laughed at by her friends who called me really bad things i cannot say here. i also found out that all of my close friends of 8 years had a GC without me. they all hung out all the time, and went to the fair without inviting me. lots of things have happened to me throughout my life, these are just a few.  i dont know what to do, and  have lost all hope.",lonely,I feel like the world hates me,2022-07-26 16:26:04

954,Infinite_Stay_9707,1658815744,1,"So, a small introduction about myself.  y/o (M). I have graduated from high school and am appearing in the entrance exams for universities and colleges. Two years ago, i.e., before the COVID-19 pandemic, I was pretty social. I used to hang our with friends and was happy-go-lucky kind of a person. I never over thought about anything, just enjoyed life and faced the problems along. 

However, now, I feel like I've changed a lot. For the past 6-7 months, I have isolated myself. It all started because I had to study and focus on my academics for tests and entrance exam preparations. So, I stopped chatting over the phone and stuff like that. And now, it feels like I'm better off being alone for the rest of my life. I like it better when my parents go out for work, I like the serenity of the house, I like the freedom - I can study for long hours, there is no-one pestering me to eat and bathe (I know it's weird, but sometimes I do not feel like getting up from work). Recently, my high school graduation results were declared and I was happy with my own score, I did not even contact my classmates to know their scores. Some of them contacted me, and there's the catch: I felt extremely irritated about that. Although my scores are better than theirs, I feel extremely irritated when someone tries to pry into my 'own snug world'. 

I can't remember when it was the last time I had talked with a friend over the phone, and honestly I don't care at all. When someone texts me something, I just reply to that message in the most concise way possible, thus nowadays no-one contacts me anyway. What bothers me the most is that I always tend to imagine what others think about me and that they are always judging me. I start overthinking and can't focus in my study. I just like to spend the time all by myself, studying, watching series in my free time or lying in bed listening to music. 

I don't know whether this is weird or not, but honestly, this is peaceful and I really don't want to get involved with other people at all.

But some people talk for a day then they ghost you. No one is willing to put effort, no matter how much I try.

972,wiggedcow,1658805997,1,"Greetings everyone, 
Awhile ago I made a post about hitting the road, but before I decided to commit to the project, I decided to practice a bit. Long story short, I made my way to Vermont from Kentucky, and I saw a lot. I saw a drunk getting kicked off a bus, I saw fights break out for nothing, and I saw what people in poverty would do to survive. I remember being in the New York subway watching a mentally ill homeless man, so far gone he’s not even speaking just making noises, wandering the subway system without any help. I don’t know if this is a normal for city folk but it really shook me. While in Albany I was threatened, without my knowledge, as I kept asking my aggressor to repeat himself not knowing he was trying to provoke me. I got stranded at a bus stop in that shithole Columbus, Ohio. It was bad, really bad, that’s all I shall say.

While I was in Vermont, I fell in love with my surroundings, I slept at Burlington International Airport and made my way to Shelburne. Really nice communities near that area, but I learned a valuable lesson, Vermont sucks for hitchhikers. I was stranded, facing rejection as every car drove past me, and all I could do is walk. I eventually wandered into a huge garden. It was nice, it calmed my nerves and I took the time to journal my travels, but I had to go. Eventually, I wandered into this restaurant place, and some dude saw me walking on the road and offered me a ride. Fuck yeah I accepted. He opened up about his past to me, so much I don’t really wanna reveal anything, but he was fine with me journaling it. I remember he asked me “The fuck were you thinking?” I said something along the lines of “It gets me out of the house.” 

I’m home now, and I already want to be out in the world again, but I learned a lot:

1. There is always someone in a worse condition than I am currently. Especially after what I saw in New York, it’s really humbling.

2. If someone treats you with respect, cherish it, not everyone will like you.

3. Enjoy the small things. I was scared and more alone than ever, but if I could find comfort in a simple garden in the heights of my anxiety, then maybe I could bring that home with me.

While I’ve been home for awhile, I still have so much to think about, I was always so isolated growing up. But I had fun, and I hope all the people I met on the road are safe.",lonely,What I learned while traveling,2022-07-26 13:26:37

976,BamWeasle22,1658804376,1,"A bit of background about myself...   
I'm 27, M. Straight, not had a long term relationship past a year since I was 15/16 longest job was 6 months (Labouring, but was bullied to the point of mental break down and left)  and in and out of temp jobs. Oh and I have a degree which i'd like to use, but the support I've been given keep discouraging me ""media is hard to get into"" but no where is willing to take me on even for entry jobs because it's been 4 years since graduating and opportunities are hard to find, more so when you can't drive (I was learning but then covid and got to re-do theory... feel quite defeated on that). 

I got told in my first industry interview good CV, but lack of industry work is a concern. What's that got to-do with my skillset at an entry level job? Then they said confidence... I was asking questions relevant to the job itself as I was given a task pre-interview to research the programme videos for understanding. ""let me know if there is anything else I can for you?"" I asked for feedback, so basically got told to work for free to showcase my skills.   


I'd like to work in my chosen industry because well everyone one else is in the job they want... (talking about peers and friends). Some hate it but they are reasonably happy to be there if that makes sense.  

When I did trial shifts at a bar I got told I did really well but they didn't want me back.  
 I was in retail for a month after graduating... Got let go because the managers didn't like me, yet got on with the other staff. 

I did try factory work but did not like the shift patterns and communication barrier... Gotta meet those targets too. I could sign to more factory jobs and be in a job by the end of the week, but i don't want to go back to a factory ever, I'm aware i'm shot myself in the foot big time here.  

I really haven't enjoyed my life since high school tbh, i'm not suicidal. But I just can't seem to ""adult"" correctly no matter how hard I try... I'm more of an observe in this existence.   


My friends don't wanna know me because I haven't held down a job...   
My life shouldn't affect them in this manner... They have it better so I don't know why they are bitter. (Relationships, own home, job)   
I legit just stay at home, go out to walk my dog and shop for food.   
I don't drink (unless out rarely with mates)  and do drugs... I'm legit alone living with my Dad in isolation which is no better than a cell at the best of times. 

This way of living has impacted my hobbies to somewhat being numb. My craft is taking videogame stills and storyboarding them and that is the only time I interact with a community. (Some friends have laughed about this and I heard them say ""He ain't gonna get famous doing that""... funnily enough this has been brought up in my industry interviews and I explain my process how it relates to film.   


Anyways purging my friends list and not being invited about by my main group of friends has opened my eyes more to me being alone... 

My hometown friends: 

I chosen to cut two of them off because they were selfish. They could make jokes about you, but you  couldn't say anything to them. Very childish... Moaned about their GF (calling her a karen and forcing him to live with her. She did his washing, cooking, basically was his mum... what's the problem?)  but won't break up with her because he likes shagging her. The other just constantly broke plans then when you did the same to him was very pushy, and only did the things they wanna do. Cutting these two off the other pals didn't wanna know me... They even forgot why I left the group (they cannot take accountability)  and one tried to hoover me last month. 

Oh the hoover friend liked a girl but he was always slut shaming her for doing things he was doing. Breaking plans, and having tinder... Guy's a fool. He kept hoovering her too. These lad's (they are 25, 27) are not nice blokes but come across likeable it's infuriating. 

My school pals... It came to a point where I think they just had me on social media to keep tabs on me. There was a guy I would see often but he is gay (this isn't me being homophobic), he kept pushing my boundaries: 

I spilt a drink down me he kept rubbing my chest. I didn't want this to happen.

When we went to pub he would take my knife and fork ""that's bad luck"" like what's that about?  And keep asking me if I've been talking to any girls (which is no... Dating apps I'm invisible No girl finds me interesting, but now doing gaming photography more girls speak to me and want to know me, but live too far away or another country, but the conversation fizzle out which is fine, but there is one girl that I got on with and she a very heavy texter at first then drip feed... yeah I don't do that. I'd rather have consistent text than drip feed one liners repeat) 

He kept wanting me to go out into town on a nightout with him, but it began to feel like a datenight. He kept staying at my house too until I said ""Mate, you live in the same Town as me. You can go home"". His parents didn't trust him with a key? Like I don't understand... I had my own key since I was 10 and allowed to go to the shop up the road by myself.  Even his Mum was questioning me if we had a relationship, not cool (He was ""late all the time"" so I had to wait once). It came to a point where I was like this guy needs boundaries and it got a point they no longer spoke to me. They do have new have a woman bestie and do everything together... you'd think they're a couple lol 

I don't understand how me setting some boundaries has made them distant. Everyone deserves boundaries.   

Anyways, this guy is one of those gay lads that put themselves as woman to groom men on dating apps... This to me is predatory and I had a lengthy conversation saying each time I log on tinder he's always there even bumble. Going after straight men isn't going to get you laid or a relationship... Oh bi-curious fellas, but that's still grooming because your forcing them to come out, let them figure it out on their own.  Apparently it's an ego thing, but my opinion is that it's predatory full-stop there is dating apps for gay people too.  (If I've caused offence, not my intention) 

  
We got invited to a wedding of another old mate (I will go on about them soon) and his family thought we were together...  Everyone thought we had something because when were at a house gather he chosen to sleep on the top of the stairs and it was a hazard so I told him to sleep on the bedroom floor I was kindly allowed the bed... Nothing happened.    


The Married friend... this guy was a bit of an alpha wannabe back in school. People just didn't want to say no to him, I always stood up to him and so did another mate. Our friendship was rocky as we had a few fallouts.. He caused a rift between me and an ex (like got into our business when it should have been my problem to sort out, so the problem then became me and her not the actual problem...).   
He would side with the lads who bullied me in sixthform... I spent all my time with those lads sixth form became hell. (College was more enjoyable and gave me the grades needed for uni)  Pushed me aside because I wasn't cool enough for the clubs with him and another mate. Anyways we got over that... I shouldn't have forgive him for a lot of stuff, but, I did some things too like punching him in the face. I wasn't the only guy to take a swing at him another mate in the group was mad at him (2 years later) because he was excluding from events because of deserved beef. (The mates ex was in our group of friends and she told ""alpha mate"" about the problems... This mate was a bit controlling, he's a lot better now with current GF, but it wasn't really worth kicking him out the group over) . I was vocal about that mate being part of the group, but nobody listened or wanted to) 

Since he's been with his wife (8 years but the narrative is they've been together 10... They met 10 years ago) his been distant, we would always have to travel an hour to see him and he came to see us like once. They have kids now, but make time for other friends. He would message then no basically ghost...He messaged in Feb and seen my message last week... (Feb to July and being online is ghosting). I'm happy he has a family but not for shelving the friendship when it suits him etc.   


I will add despite our problems his wife isn't very nice (she's very NPD... Apparently she's strong-willed but she's just spiteful and shout. The morning after the wedding she was shouting at him and he had that look as he can't deal with it and I was like ""what do you want me to-do?"".)  He rang me at 4 in the morning (a year into them being together - Not married ) crying and asking to come round. So I let him and we had a chat about the situation. Mum was out at her ex's so no bother, i'd do the same with her at home regardless. So reflecting on this is situation and how I'm being treated now is why I decided to just get rid of him on social media... I don't need him watching me for tabs.   


My Uni friends:   
These guys made me feel like I belonged yet at the same time alienate me. They all bitch about each other it's amazing they remained a tight-nit group post uni.   
When I first moved in with them they thought I'd be this creepy guy... I didn't have the best tagged photos on my facebook? So I cleaned that up too and got rid off all the bad tagged photos.   
Anyways they could have invited me on a night-out or round to get to know me lol Me being more introverted I was like I'm sure moving in will be fine. 

So the lad I get on with the most in the group:  Before the pandemic ""Mate you know I'm here, why don't you talk to me?"" I felt awful because I'm online in the evening most of the time, but then they didn't invite WZ, or for a night on the town. When it came to talking on messenger... I'd randomly get a message seen. First lockdown over... We all met up it was great... After the 2nd... fine. This year seen everyone twice which 1st time was great.. Had pointless drama. . 2nd started off well till I was gaslighted by toxic feminist friend.  


Toxic feminist friend... It's all her feelings are the only reality. She doesn't trust men at all... blames men for all the problems in society. 1st nightout She was rude about a mate's GF and his parents told her to be nicer and she had a paddy like a child. ""His dad was so rude to me..."" and I was like ""he isn't with us the whole night and I didn't come down to see everyone arguing"" I was quite confused because another mate told me ""Can you make (name) welcome, you get on with everyone, so can you keep an eye on her"" so I was like ""yeah I can do that""... (wish i didn't bother because the GF thinks i'm odd lol). The whole argument was that the mates GF was very flirty with TXF BF when they both expressed they wouldn't mind being flirted on or getting off with random people (snogging random people) so this whole argument or beef was pointless. ""it isn't about you, it's about me"" you pulled me into your argument in fact you pulled us all into it you doughnut. I only found out the whole story on night 2 in the day when she wasn't around, so she was deflecting the argument basically at me...   


So the gaslighting event... Nightout 2 I had to sniff another girl's underwear as part of the game. I said no. But this girl was took her underwear off and was like ""sniff them"" I basically had the underwear in my hand trying to get out of it. But the group was egging me on to-do it, so I was basically in a lose-lose situation. It was say no walk away, ruin the fun... Or take a quick sniff. So I chose to take a quick sniff but keep the underwear at a distant but to her ""You were looking for the sweet spot. That's disgusting. Your vile"". Okay in my defence you wanted me to-do it the other girl had no problem with me doing it... So what's you play here? Is it because I said you were nosey? (She followed my gaming page, but most likely to make fun of it as she was the one to say ""He isn't going get famous of it. It's quite stupid"". I generally was having a fun time before than innocent, and my mate who I mentioned first put them in his mouth... But you know that's acceptable, but me ""sniffing the underwear"" isn't. 

It really put a downer on the night and she was like ""are you okay"" I was polite but I was fuming at her for gaslighting. Sure I went along with it... But vilifying me is quite childish.  She also had an argument with her boyfriend so he was upset for the last half of the night. 

I noticed that the girl with the underwear... I never get invited out when her boyfriend is invited. Which is kinda odd it's a pattern which is why i'm it brining up. Tbh I wouldn't be very happy about the whole underwear situation but she is just to blame much like toxic feminist and myself. I'd probably be honest about the whole situation and say we all had a bit too much to drink and it won't happen again, but then my mate put them in his mouth, but that's allowed.   


Another girl is more reluctant to say no when I'm invited... Like I dunno what i've done... I'm very outspoken when it comes to her veganism because she was all for saving the planet and kept the lights on.   


Why do I feel lonely - 

Because I feel so far behind in life to my peers. Worked hard for a degree to not use it, get told good CV but no proper experience then the tutor favs without industry experience  at the time got jobs... ""it's easy to find a job straight after grad"" lol no it isn't i sent emails and applied to what I could.  


My friends don't really give a toss unless it's about them. The whole equal opportunities and well-being is ""smoke and mirrors""...  I'm alone and nobody gives a damn. It's all ""found a job yet?, Are you seeing anyone?"" ffs is that all that mounts to a conversation.   


Dating: I feel no girl wants to know me... On dating apps.. No matter the bio, my pictures are alright. I'm just an average guy.    


Every girl I've gotten on well with outside of friend groups, just use me for validation or they have some form of cluster B traits.  I see relationships based on needs (sex) as opposed to caring due to how ""mates"" relationships are, so I'm kinda put off them despite wanting a connection. it's messy.    


A lady friend was like ""he dumped me, but we kept arguing and I love him very much?"" this does not sound like love... I didn't say that to her but she was like ""you wouldn't understand all relationships argue"" Yeah but not excessively... 

So, if you read this far...

979,That-Dentist8239,1658804144,1,"The past year, I’ve been going through a split up from a long-term relationship (14 years). I really don’t know what to do. I’ve looked into different sources for trying to meet new people to try to form some kind of social support system for myself, but I’ve been quite unsuccessful.

There’s no telling how many people I’ve talked to over the months on mental health related online chats, posting on here to meet either long distance or local friends, joining local groups on Discord, and trying different social sites, like Bumble BFF and Plenty of Fish (gearing it mainly towards making friends and maybe potential dating if it went there). Nothing has worked. It’s either conversations don’t really go anywhere, or things ultimately hit a dead end, or I get blown off if they haven’t seen my looks prior to talking (that didn’t happen on Bumble BFF or POF, because they knew upfront how I looked), or we didn’t really have anything in common to connect with. Not to mention, just being given a hard time on the Discord servers and on here. I had people badgering me, simply just for trying to make friends and making me feel creepy for it, because they didn’t like the source I was using. I don’t know why you can’t just look anywhere for that kind of thing. There shouldn’t be social rules regarding that. Plus, I had someone trying to dig and start problems with trying to sabotage me with cancel culture related mentality and tactics. At this point, I’m just exhausted dealing with so many different things, and so much disappointment, and not really getting anywhere despite all my efforts.

Honestly, what makes it so hard to try to meet new people is the fact that so many people in America are just too busy all the time, and their lives are centered around work. Then, my physical disability and mental health issues both definitely make it hard for me socially. I just feel hopeless trying to meet people, who I can talk to more long term, and have a close relationship with as far as really being there for each other and talking about anything, and very likely someone, who is also from North Carolina like me.

1020,ComfortableSuspect10,1658788997,1,"i was talking to a friend of mine and he was venting to me about a girl he can’t get over and he’s still in love with. honestly i was thinking to myself some shit like, ohh i know how this goes, i’ll just tell him that once you go out and meet more people, you’ll find out she’s not the only one. i was going to say that because that’s how i feel about guys. when i like a guy, i get completely obsessed over him for a year or two and beg for his attention, but at the same time, i’d still look at other guys and catch smaller feelings for them. i traveled to a different state a few months ago while i was “in love” with a guy at my school who didn’t even know me, and on that trip i saw a lot of other cute guys and forgot about him temporarily. because of this, i thought it was like that for everyone, until i remembered the first girl i had a crush on

and how i never had a crush on another girl again after her

i met her when i first started realizing i was bisexual, so maybe that had an impact on it. but i never knew how much i really loved her until she was gone. and it feels so pathetic because it’s clear to me that she only saw me as a friend, but she was basically the whole world to me. she was so nice to me and genuinely cared about me. she was so cool and beautiful too. i would’ve done anything to be with her. but we lost communication and now she’s just a memory. i was about to judge my friend being stuck on a girl until i realized that i could write about my first girl crush so many times and talk about her so many times without getting tired. i was about to judge him until i realized that after i realized i couldn’t have her, my overall drive to date other women lessened. everytime i look for what i find attractive in a girl, or i think about the perfect girl, it resembles her in some ways. that’s why i think loving a girl is different than loving a guy. i can have feelings for many different dudes and be able to get over them with some time, but now i don’t even want a girlfriend anymore because it won’t be her

or maybe it’s because she was also the first person i crushed on that was actually my friend 🤔could be that too. whatever",lonely,loving a girl is different,2022-07-26 08:43:17

1056,thr33eyed0rangut4ng,1658768965,1,"What's up. Hope you're doing well, despite being on this sub. Like you I'm pretty lonely, although I've read some things on here that make me feel like I should consider myself comparatively lucky. I have a few friends, and a lot of people I hang out with (via those aforementioned friends) with whom I'm pretty friendly- they think I'm allright but they don't care all too much (as is their right, I don't blame them).
My friends, too, don't have me very high on their list of priorities, I guess that's my fault. We're all a couple years out of high school and they're all doing stuff with their life. I feel like I'm right where I started, nothing's really changed for me. I've gotten a degree, and am close to getting a master's, but those don't mean anything if you're not connected, out there networking, setting goals, achieving goals, making actual plans. I'm not really doing any of those (don't know how) maybe the panic that's slowly seeping in will force me off my ass eventually. Maybe.
My friends are perfectly justified in letting me drift away, they know I'm doing as bad as I always have and that they really can't help me, it's my fault- and that's not me self-hating, that's just how it is. It all comes down to sociability, I think. Obviously I'm pretty introverted. I don't have trouble making eye contact and having conversations but I have trouble initiating the latter. Don't want to talk to people, knowing full-well I have to to get anything done. I hate having these forced conversations. My friends, and most people I think, have this 'thing' that I (and possibly you, too) just don't have. This sort of enthusiasm for making friends amd talking to new people and all that stuff. I widens your circle and brings you opportunities for social advancement.
It really makes me sad, because I don't feel like I'm not good for anything, I believe I have talents, I just have no idea how to work myself towards a place where I can really benefit from them. I'm gonna do something stupid now and blame society for indoctrinating people into thinking you have to be an always-smiling, spontaneous people-person to be considered normal, and that it's inherently bad, or weird, to be more quiet or whatever. I know it is way more complicated than that but it's easier to shift the blame off of yourself onto some abstract societal ailment. Just have to work harder I guess. But how? Work on what exactly?
Sorry, this is just a vent, out of need. I really didn't think through what other people should get from it. I guess I'll just close with: any thoughts? Anyone recognise their experience or thought-pattern or something? Anyone work their way out of situations like this?

Feeling bored? Fuck that. Get on Instagram. Watch a movie, do something, take a substance, eat some food, numb that shit out. You don't wanna feel bored when (sarcasm).

I've started feeling lonely and sad on and off yet not wanting to connect with my friends even if I tried. I feel like I need therapy but I'm not sure of it because during lockdown all my friends started coming out as bi, gender fluid, nonbinary and all that but I was the only one who thought we may have been too young to think of this kind of stuff (10-11). One of my friends even told me they thought they were depressed and I just tried telling them to get professional help because I couldn't deal with it. Recently, said friend told me that I told them they 'couldn't be' or that they were 'one of the happiest people I know'. To be fair, I don't remember saying any of those things but I know I didn't say it like that. 

I think lockdown connected me to the internet more and made me less social, I used to be so happy but now I'm just sad usually. I started secondary school and I had no friends until the end of year 7 (except for the ones from lockdown, but they were all in a different class). It took someone wanting to sit next to me instead of some random table on their own in a science practical lesson in the lab to have the friend group I have today. I've gained more confidence since then but I somehow gained more loneliness too.

I have a dream of getting married and have children, all the kids in my year are getting boyfriends and girlfriends and I'm happy for them but just jealous even thought I don't like anyone there. I have a celebrity crush and because I'm so pathetic I made an entire fake life for myself in my head with I'm and being an actress. I started feeling really lonely in around March because it was then it all hit me that none of it was real and I'd have to try doing something else

 I also think I might have mild OCD but I'm scared to ask my parents to check because I don't think they'll believe me. My parents are very supportive of me but they have a passive aggressive sort of vibe, and I'd tell them about my dreams of being an actress or model someday and they'd say something like 'it's nice to dream'.

When I was younger I was a hopeless romantic. I was in love with the idea of love. I envisioned myself having a loving family. Being a good mother and wife. Doing things for my husband. I’m caring by nature. I generally tend to go the extra mile for the people I care for in my life . Now almost 30 most of my peers and friends have gotten married and have moved on in their live. Here I am lonely and full of shame and guilt. I mourn the life that I once dreamed of . Countless of failed talking stages and the idea that I would have to settle in order to get married has eaten away at every ounce of self confidence I have in myself. People say being single is nice and stress free but that is only true when it’s out of choice. This is torture. Every failed talking stage makes me doubt more that it will ever happen.

I’m a 24 year old guy who is really depressed and lonely. Here is why.

3. My family is very toxic and has a lot of personality disorders and past trauma. I’ve cut ties with them, and it’s helped my mental health. But it hurts to be alone.

I just hate feeling like there were some people I possibly could have been friends with, but I ruined it with me being ""too much"". I absolutely hate that there is so much shame in being lonely. 

So I was thinking earlier today about how much of my life I've been more or less without a friend I could regularly hang out with. I'll start with when I graduated high school because I had friends because I was forced to be around the same people every day so I got comfortable with them. It's been almost 20 years since then, and I think I've only had a regular friend for about 2.5 of those years.

I realized that I would rather live  just 10 more years (maybe even 5) where I always had someone to turn to than live the average 79 years as I am now. Maybe I'd find someone, but honestly I don't think anything could be worth the wait at this point. I'm pretty sure I'd take that deal in a heartbeat.",lonely,The deal I'd take,2022-07-25 18:03:14

I am 41, never had a regular job. only day labor jobs that destroyed my back, knees, from 10 years homeless and working on farms and ranches doing manual labor. 

I am 41, last girlfriend i had gave me a bad yeast infection I can't get rid of because of health reasons. and that lasted a month in person. before that it was 5 years prior to her, the woman before her faked her death on me twice and would call me while having sex with her husband and turned out to be married. the woman prior to that was back when I was 27. spent 9 months skyping, talking sending messages and emails and actual letters in the mail to one another and i moved to iowa to be with her and in a week she cheated on me with her ex and dumped me at the local town fair. 

I am sitting here listening to music trying to get lost in the music but getting lost in my own head/thoughts. idk what to do anymore. I tried getting my GED but because of my learning issues and such I struggle really bad in getting it. have to work from the 3rd grade up to 12th in every subject. and I struggle remembering things because of my mental issues and illnesses like my ptsd. 

People don't want to hire me because of my mental issues or education , women won't date me because of my disabilities mentally or because I am on disability or the fact im on disability. I just dunno what to do anymore. I have no real purpose in life anymore, no drive, no energy to do anything or go anywhere. just no real purpose in life anymore or drive. all online jobs I find require experience or skills I don't have or proof of, or require high school or ged. and they won't hire me. im slow at learning. needing to be told the same thing about 15 or so times to understand it and do it consistently for a month to remember it. most online jobs won't put up with that. and i applied to many and my resume is blank and empty. nothing to put on it now for like 15 years now. so idk. 

Also doesn't help I live in a very small town with no public transport and no way to get anywhere and haven't left the house in almost 9 years because of it. 

feeling like ending it tonight is the best and only way out of this life. as of right now, just laying here listening to knocking on heavens door by bob dylan and remembering the 4th of july with that woman in iowa when we hung out all day on fourth of july, then that night went to the lake with her family, hung out all night, walked hand in hand around the lake and then had our first kiss that night. which just felt so right. just making me think i will never have that again with another woman ever....

im seeing so many people who have partners and their partners treat them horrible and its like how do they find women and then treat the woman badly and the woman stays and here I am a decent guy and get called a piece of trash or worse because of my issues and get abused hard by women or rejected hard or put in the category of being a *nice guy* just because when they treat me horrible I call them out on it or called an incel. 

I just don't get it anymore. im to the point that this is what my life is meant to be and im not meant to exist anymore. lost my parents when I was in my early 20s have no other siblings or family. just don't see a reason to keep going. what little friends I had were streamers i met when I would stream and because I stepped away from them they turned on me quickly and acting like im a monster. only stepped away because I got tired of the drama that was always floating around with them. 

I have never been loved or wanted by anyone. last time I was touched or hugged by anyone was that woman who gave me the stuff I can't get rid of. might as well have herpes at this point or aids. been tested thousands of times all come back clean but the yeast.  last time I was hugged before her, was when i was 27 before that i was 15. what is the point in living anymore when I don't even love myself anymore after everything.

I am a 23F. I haven't had a real relationship ever. I dated a guy off and on from 8th grade to 10th but he didn't mean anything to be other than checking a box off to my mom that I could like someone. He was a cheating prick too so there's that. My last 2 years of high school my parents died and I was left to send myself to college where I did a 180 with my personality since I was no longer sheltered. I was nihilistic, sometimes I still am. My mom's siblings bullied and caused me so much emotional stress I hated them. I got closer to God (not to be preach but it helped me) after 2 intercepted suicide attempts. I was alone. My family betrayed me and they made me feel that I was a constant disappointment to my parents unless I did something they wanted or could brag about. Until about a year ago I stopped bending over backwards for my family who wouldn't do the same for me. I even stopped talking to my favorite cousin (who is like a sister to me). I tried to defend her from her boyfriend who was disrespecting her. It became a big argument about how I make things worst. I have friends I'm close with, bestfriends too. I started back being promiscuous like when after my last parent died. I know it's bad but I do this thing of making the guy feel so amazing and wonderful but when they want a relationship I can't . I also will go to movies or bowling with a guy every once and a while but I can't commit to a relationship. I don't think anyone will stay with me long. So I never open up or invest because I see myself as a comma in a page in that guy's book. I want to change.

So it's no surprise that i have always kept my romantic feeling to myself. Multiple crushes and romantic interests flew by, without me saying a word. And after many many years, when i did have the courage to confess, of course i got rejected, or stood up on a date.

As time goes by, my friends keep talking about their past/present relationships, sex and all that stuff, while i just feel lost. So, i invented some stories about some experiences in love that i never actually had. I only told a few, so it didnt seem suspicious, they know that it's not like me to sleep and be with lots of people, i believe i made it look convincing enough though.

I invented those stories so that they could not see me as the pathetic loveless virgin that i have always been. I dont know how they would react if they knew, i dont wanna lose them.

But i hate lying to other people, it makes me feel like shit, i hate myself for it, but for some reason i keep doing it. I feel like i am behind everyone else around me. Even the shy introvertes kids, that are just like i once was, have more experience than me. There is this voice inside my head that keeps telling me that i am gonna end up alone, my biggest fear, while some other quieter voice tells me that it is gonna be okay soon.

But right now, i dont know what i should do. Do i keep going with those fake stories and hating myself for it until (IF) i actually find someone i can love ? Or do i spit it out, and assume the pathetic lying virgin that i am, and risk losing the friends that i worked hard to get ?

I also don't want to shell out $23 a month for a PO box at a UPS store. I don't order stuff online that often that I need to have a dedicated PO box to recieve packages but I also do not want to have to pay to pick up a package at the UPS store. it's $10 a package to pick up at the UPS store which means if you get more than 2 packages a month it makes sense to get a po box. but I don't do it regularly enough that it would make sense. which means I'm stuck with whatever the local stores sell in the store or I have to send it to the store for them to hold onto so I can come pick it up later. It's basically a tax on being single and having no friends that you trust enough to take in your packages for you. it makes me feel so alone. Like nobody gives a fuck about me. that I'm doing everything all on my own and there's nobody to do small favors like that for me. I can totally feel that my needs for love and exceptance are sorely neglected. My sex life is non-existant. and No, I don't count my  own hand as sexual expression.  if you could die of touch starvation I wouldn't have made it past 27. it's comming up on a full decade of being single, basically involuntarily due to lack of finances. being unemplloyed for an extended period of time due to my terrible mental health.  I think my mom's aniversary of her death is weighing on me extra heavily this year. it's not till the end of july but close enough.  I could always go to her with this kind of stuff and she'd help cheer me up. My dad's solution is pull yourself up by your boot straps, give yourself a swift kick in the ass and get moving. which isn't always as helpful as he thinks it is. I'm sure all this whining is not productive but I just wanted to vent to the void to get it out of my head. if anyone read this thanks for listening. you are not alone in your loneliness. I don't know if that helps anyone but it's a fact. to me it makes me feel bad for both of us. but it's also kinda comforting that i'm not a freak. that everyone feels lonely sometimes. that it's ""normal"" to feel lonely. I just think that I'm lonely more of the time even around people. it's about being understood and seen. ppl laughing at my jokes. which rarely ever happens. that makes me so happy when I can make someone laugh.  my humor is not easily understood by most. I think it's time to get off here and go to sleep. gotta get back to my slavery in the morning.",lonely,Recieving packages,2022-07-25 14:43:58

I’ve felt lonely for way to long, to give a little back story about tow years ago I dropped out of high school, I use to have friends but no one kept in touch with me so I guess I wasn’t much, after dropping out I didn’t do anything for a year just stayed home and played video game, I didn’t realize how much it would affect me. Last year I decided to go back to school everyone I use to know already graduated so I didn’t think much I try to focus on school and not making friends since I felt like a stranger to these people, I almost quit a couple time due to the amount of pain I felt tru that year. The feeling of eating alone every day and not talking to anyone is harder than I expected. I was able to pull tru and finish achieving sadly my social life didn’t improve. I hate the feelings of getting home from work and not having anyone to talk to me no one call, texte or try to get In touch with me, I’m nothing, I’m a nobody. And as an 18 year old guy I feel like I need someone to open up to, someone that will listen and ask how my day was I wanna be able to answer that question honestly.

We were both on the way to the next class and we started chatting before the class started. So we talked and talked until they started to joke about my looks. I mean I know I’m not the most handsome man in the world, but still I didn’t think women care about looks as much as they do about personality. Oh boy, I was wrong. They proceeded to joke about how I should go to a beauty place to look better and other ugly jokes. They were laughing as I shrugged it off.

Why is this significant? Well, because that interaction still affects me to this day. I have never had a girlfriend and I’m a KHHV. Whenever I dream about finding the love/girl of my life, I still think about that interaction and how the girls were just laughing at how bad I look.

1143,HaleOfBayLeaves,1658720852,1,"Hi Reddit.

This whole day has been a day lost to depression. I slept most of it. Browsed the internet for some of it. Now it's bedtime and I'm exhausted. Emotionally, mentally, physically. I can't concentrate, because depression. I'm going to do my bedtime routine now, and I'm going to tell you all about it. It'll keep me on track.  Tomorrow I'll wake up feeling better.

* I made herbal tea. It's a blend of different herbs, and has a faint caramel flavor. It's my all-time favorite bedtime tea.
* I'm trimming my house plants of dead leaves, and taking those to the compost.
* I'm petting my cat who, is requesting attention.
* I put my shoes away in the closet. Two pairs needed putting away.
* I'm putting dirty clothes in the hamper. Mostly socks.
* Do you ever think of a better life? I usually imagine mine in the woods with my tribe. That's my happy place.
* I emptied out the trash can.
* I put away my makeup and hair brush / hair dryer.
* These headphones should be on my desk next to my computer stuff, not with my makeup stuff.
* What is all this paperwork doing just strewn around. Filing away paperwork.
* Feed kitty. She really wanted my attention.
* Speaking of kitty she tracked in so much dead vegetation and stickies from outside.
* Sweep sweep sweep, vacuum.
* I brushed my teeth
* It's weird Reddit, I use to really hate myself. I don't anymore. I kinda love myself now. You can love yourself and still be super lonely, and have the occasional suicidal ideation, I found out. You can absolutely still have depression days.
* Wash my face, moisturize.
* Clean my piercings.
* Pee.
* Take my bedtime medication.
* Made the bed.

I'm really lonely. I fantasize about falling asleep in someone else's arms nightly. Maybe a man, maybe a woman. The fantasy's not that specific. Someone who loves me. Who looks at me and can't imagine not wanting to fall asleep next to me for the rest of their lives. I keep going in the hopes of finding that connection. If I don't.. I dunno. Maybe it's ok. Maybe I need to be ok with it, regardless of outcome.

I'm going to sleep now. Thanks for listening to me ramble. Good night.",lonely,Bedtime after a day of sleeping,2022-07-25 13:47:32

1145,ThrowRAshamwow,1658720102,1,"-where one sad thought spirals into 10 and now I'm crying on reddit again lmao. I'll be okay but I just need to rant into the void. 

Sometimes my life feels so empty, no matter what I do. As a teen I was always worried about not being good enough at my major, and now I'm way ahead of others my age and it still doesn't feel like enough mentally and fiscally. I used to feel ugly and fat and sometimes I still do, but I've lost a lot of weight and built some confidence and I still feel like nothing in my life has changed as a result of that

Tonight I had a realization that was extremely first-world-problem-ey but long story short, I realized I haven't been able to really enjoy a hobby I've prided myself on since I was a kid and that has helped me through a lot in about 10 years because I've never had the money or means to get halfway decent equipment. I always feel left out of things because of this but I didn't realize it'd been ten years already and that just makes me extremely sad and old lol

And I'm so not excited for my birthday. Another year alone in my apartment, no friends or family to visit, no gifts I like (socks if I'm lucky), same as its been for years now. It's been so fucking depressing for years and I'm starting to hate my birthday so much 

I feel like my entire life has just been me waiting for things to get better. I never feel in control of anything, no matter how much money I make or how much I transform my appearance or whatever, nothing ever changes no matter what I do. My life is completely out of my control and has been forever 

I'm sure I'll be okay because I've been getting kinda better recently but I still crack sometimes and these feelings never get any easier. I just wanna feel like a normal person",lonely,just another one of those nights,2022-07-25 13:35:02

1147,anonymous_5002,1658719689,1,"I am a 17 year old girl about to enter my senior year of high school. As of now I have never dated, or at the very least even entered a “talking stage” with a boy. ’4.5 and around 133 pounds, so while I am not model skinny I wouldn’t classify myself as overweight and believe I hold my weight well (other girls have told me that I have an “hourglass” figure). I have longish, curly/ wavy dark hair, dark eyes, olive toned/medium skin, and wear glasses. Although I am very much average in appearance, I oftentimes think that there are so many people that look just like me or are in my league that have gotten a boys attention that I can’t help but think that my appearance is not the issue. 
Onto my personality, I consider myself to be very intelligent, very kind (to the point where some may consider me to be a pushover or a doormat), and can be a bit shy. However, I do warm up to people very quickly and have quite a bubbly and humorous personality once you get to know me. I also hold quite a few leadership positions at school and a good amount of people around school know my name so it’s not like I’m a hermit. 
All my close friends have gotten close with people before. Whether it be just snap chatting daily, dating, or just overall having a “guy best friend”, at one point they have gotten a boys attention, while I have not. The last time a boy confessed he had a crush on me was 7th grade, which I did not reciprocate back because I was too young and did not share the same feelings. However, that was 5 years ago. Since then, I do have conversations with boys, but these are almost completely limited to “in school” conversations, such as while walking together in the halls, sitting by each other in class, or any other situations where small talk would arise. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had crushes, I find boys cute and am not too specific in my type. I just don’t understand what it is about me that prevents a boy from texting me on Snapchat or making more effort to talk to me at school. I am not extremely quiet, and know how to return a conversation and keep it going, but it jsut seems like nothing ever goes from there. 
So many people at my school have been in relationships, and i just can’t think of anything outstanding that would make me unattractive or unlikeable. I know this makes me sound like a loner, but I just need a little advice, because I am at the point where I think I am truly unloveable. 
Please don’t give me any BS about how relationships suck and “I’m lucky” to not have gotten into one. Or how I’ll find the one and to just be patient. I apologize if I sound a bit aggressive or harsh, I just feel so alone and left out because of this, as shallow as it may sound.

1159,shadowlarvitar,1658716195,1,"I know people probably won't read this but I just need to vent. I have nowhere else to go with this, I have no irl friends, I don't want to bother my sister with it(She's going through her own thing), my brother doesn't give a damn and my parents won't understand.

A few weeks back I made a friend, I tried opening up and putting myself out there by joining a gaming sub to search for friends. First response was a girl, I shrugged it off and accepted her as it doesn't matter what gender your friend is so long as they share the same interests and personality. We talked a good long while on the first day and I could tell our personalities mixed but unfortunately I made an error and realized that GTA Xbox Series X version is NOT compatible with Xbox One, so I told her and although she was upset we can listing off other games until I talked about Saints Row(One of my favorite franchises). She was intrigued and I told her it was sort of a GTA clone, explaining everything you could do and she was 'sold'. She bought Saints Row 2 and even bought the DLC so we could play together, my heart was racing and I felt legitimate joy for the first time in months as I finally got to play one of my all time favorite games with somebody.

My mic unfortunately didn't work but she didn't mind and I simply used Discord speech while she used her mic. I felt bad about what happened so I went out and bought a new mic(Going for a Razer instead of being a cheapskate, I simply wanted to chat with my friend!) so we could talk.

We played again two days later, no mic but we both used Discord chat and had a good time. The next day I brought up my interest in Back 4 Blood and how I'd been wanting to try it out since release but didn't want to play it alone and she responded with ""Back 4 Blood is awesome!"". I felt legitimate joy yet again as despite Back 4 Blood being SP, I couldn't stand playing it alone... I played Left 4 Dead with my brother and sister so playing Back 4 Blood alone just didn't sit well. (FYI: Sister doesn't game anymore while my brother has his own social group and only plays with them)

I had a blast playing Back 4 Blood and although we both had functioning mics, she'd smoked something and told me that she probably wouldn't be up for talking so I respected her wishes. I was rather quiet throughout it but typed at the end of each level how much fun I'm having while she praised my kill count(I'm not even sure if it was impressive, I wasn't paying attention tbh and just hammered A on that screen so I could type something without holding her up).

She also called my behavior 'sweet' and used the blushing emote a lot(Did she like me? Not sure but I refrained from saying anything out of respect, she came from a platonic sub and I wanted to keep it that way and not scare her off due to how close I felt to her. Like a best friend)

So after I felt comfortable, I disclosed the fact that I was autistic to her. That I had asperger syndrome(Essentially saying that ""If I ever upset you and don't take notice, please say something as I don't mean to be rude. It's just hard for me to pick up on emotions"", she was quite understanding and thanked me for coming clean to her. We talked for a bit longer before agreeing to play Back 4 Blood, she asked ""Play more tomorrow?"" afterwards and I responded sure.

She forgot and played with another friend, I did mention it to her after she told me she was done playing with them as I sort of 'Waited around for her' and didn't want to just log off without a word if she was waiting on me. She was confused before I quoted the earlier conversation but reassured her that it was okay.  
The next day I came clean to her about my depression as I wanted to talk to somebody who would actually listen to me and she did, I was SO relieved to finally get all the things I've had on my chest off and have somebody actually listen to me. (I'm pansexual so I'd grown feelings long before, I simply kept quiet out of respect and confusion. I wasn't certain at the time if I 'liked' her or if it was simply me not having a friend to talk to. After that conversation though? I knew it was love and she cemented it after she shared pics and called me 'cute')

I panicked and began working on dating apps and improving them while also posting... places on here to try and 'push down' those feelings as I legitimately didn't want to lose her. She was my best friend, my gaming buddy and I didn't want to be stuck all alone if she took offense to me saying something.

We even shared names with each other and she showed off a Gaming server to me to try and get me some friends. I then posted something and copy/pasted it to her, showing her that I deliberately left stuff out such as ""Saints Row, A Way Out/It Takes Two(Two other games I wanted to play, even bought A Way Out with my own money as I didn't have Gamepass at the time), and Back 4 Blood"". She said ""That's sweet, tear emoji"" then asked if I wanted to play Saints Row later.

It took me awhile to respond as I took a nap but I immediately responded with ""Yes, certainly! I'd love that!"" then while I was at the store picking up food for my mother(Who has COVID) I got out my phone and quickly asked 'Voice chat or text speech? We've yet to do voice chat and I wanna make sure the first time I use my mic is with somebody I feel comfortable with. So I can try and open myself up more and get out of my shell.'

""Yeah sure, we can do voice chat if you want! :)"" After dropping off the groceries, I came home and told her that I was ready. She was delayed by work(I'm EST, she's PST) so I told her 'No worries, if you need to cancel or don't feel like playing after you get out feel free to say! I understand that mood and we can play some other time.'

"" :/ You're not upset are you? I told you that I'd be around, I didn't think i'd be swamped!""

Me: 'Nono, not at all! I was simply telling you that I understand and can wait. Friends are supposed to be understanding of each other after all and I don't want you to feel like you're forced to play. If you need to rest or something then I'll understand :)'  
Her: \*smiley emoji\*

We then talk GTA Online and share out mutual love for the Combat MG, she says 'It's a shame that there isn't a MK II'. I informed her that there is one as that's my favorite weapon, she was confused and said she didn't see it.

""I can hop on the game real quick and check it out if you like, make sure you're looking at the right thing? It's been years since I upgraded a weapon and I want to make sure I give you accurate information""

Her: 'Yes please! We can hop on Saints Row afterwards as I'm home'

Me: ""Okay, you go to your weapon bench and scroll down to the desired weapon. Click said weapon then hit 'Upgrade' and viola! Just upgraded something\~""

Her: ""Oooh! Hopping on.... I don't see it?""

Me: ""Huh?""

Her: \*posts screenshot that says she's looking at a Combat MG MK II\*

It's still text chat so I snicker and think of a way to tell her without coming off as rude or 'smart' as I didn't want to hurt her feelings but she was quick to notice and laughed.

We then went to Saints Row 2 and hopped into a party. I reminded her of controls when she asked while showing off a few apartments and vehicles that I mentioned last time but didn't have the time to show her. We were having a good time just messing around, then we went to her game and began messing around there as mine had the gangs eliminated so there wasn't as much fun to be had. We played around with several activities for an hour and half before she left to eat. The goodbye was a bit awkward and haunts me(I've never said 'Goodbye' to somebody so it was like 'Bye') then later I see her chilling on Watch Dogs 2 and think to have a bit of harmless fun.

When I sold her on the game, I mentioned how 'Invading' is a favorite past time of mine and explained how I loved messing with other players. She got a laugh out of it so I thought I'd surprise her by invading her world. Sent: ""I hope you're enjoying the game! :D""

Then didn't hear a thing from her the next day, I messaged her ""Thanks for talking with me the other day btw, I feel LOADS better now. The chatting was great in itself but actually speaking to somebody? That helped a lot!"". Genuinely wanted to thank her and potentially make her day knowing that she made somebody feel better(I mean I know that it'd make mine!). No response but eh, I see her offline but she could be 'offline mode' so I can shrug and play something else. 12 hours later I drop in another response letting her know that I MIGHT have COV cause my mother just found out that she has it(and that initially we thought that it was the bad flu that I caught earlier this year but nope, it's cov!) so I warned her that we might not be able to voice chat this week. And that it may be a good time to try out It Takes Two or A Way Out.

No response... the following morning I get anxious. I see evidence that she's been online so I drop a quick apology to her and apologize for 'invading your world, I thought it'd be fun and didn't mean to upset you. I won't do it again, I promise.' No further word... I sigh and continue on with my day. Meet somebody else on another gaming friend thing and add them, only to notice she's no longer there. I check Discord and see she's still friends with me there so I drop a quick message and apologize to her one more time stating that ""I understand if you're upset with me, I thought it would just be harmless fun as you laughed when I talked about it the other day. I'd never mean to upset you, you're a great friend and I'd never do anything to ruin that. If you truly want to go then I won't stop you, unfriending is up to you and your choice. I'll respect it but know that you can come back if you ever need a friend or somebody to talk to. I'm here for you"" Unfriended a minute later without further word....

I'm hurt and emotionally torn, I have no idea if I upset her and did something wrong or if she just put on a mask and eventually had enough of me and tossed me aside. I know I can message somebody a lot(And apologized to her for it, I tried playing Stardew simply because she liked it and I wanted to see why but was confused. I told her I had like 100 questions but didn't want to be a burden and list them but she said 'I don't mind you asking, go ahead!' yet I never did cause... yeah. I worry that I was either a burden and she was too nice to say, or that she never truly cared about me as a friend, or that I upset her and weirded her out.

It's 10:30 now and I've been crying since 4pm. I lost my best friend and now I have *nobody* I can confide it and I already feel myself dwelling back into depression, it's a good thing I'm not allowed to go into work tomorrow as I'm not in an emotional state...",lonely,Lost My Best Friend and feel like shit,2022-07-25 12:29:55

1161,WelcomeSweaty,1658714605,1,"I’m 16, I was a privileged kid who has had the honor of my dad inheriting money from his moms death and was given a good childhood despite my bad behavior as a kid. I was and still am the “bad kid”. I am disrespectful and constantly angry with my self, I want to just be left alone and wanna rot in my room until the end of the world. 

I witnessed many things growing up including domestic violence,drugs, and abuse. I have saw at the ripe age of 8 how cruel and nasty this world can get.

As early I can remember my family called me names and poked at how nasty and ugly I truly was. At 8, I watched my father shove a knife up to my moms neck. At 10 I was shunned away from my dads side of the family because I look like her and told “I wish you were never born” by my own father. At 12 I was shoved into therapy because I tried to end my life but quickly removed by my mom because ‘I was telling too much’.  At 13 I was dealing drugs with my mom in order to keep a roof over our heads and pawning every I own in hopes it would be enough money for my moms addiction. At 14 I was forced into online school due to covid and told to do school work while babysitting and if I was to speak about it I would be hit. At 15 I was raising a kid.  Ian’s to stay up every night until 2-3am and make sure he slept then get up at 6am to catch my school bus. At 16 I’m exhausted. I get yelled at and my hair pulled by my mom and hope she’ll forget about me later. I’m not allowed to get a job because I’m “irresponsible” I have no family to go to. I will not get to graduate and I honestly want to rot in my bedroom on the floor. I know everyone had had tough times and people have it worse but I have nobody to turn to. If I tell my parents they just try to give me weed and hope to calm me down.

I’m not me anymore. I don’t feel happy anymore and I just want the world to stop. I want to be left alone.

1170,CinnamonBScudworth,1658711415,1,"I’m 32 years old and I’ve never been on a date in my life, much less a relationship. I’ve asked a few girls out and got the “maybe some other time” each time. I haven’t gotten a match on a Bumble since April of 2021, and I never received an initial message from any of the matches I did get.

Deep down, I feel like I’m not a terrible human; I think I have a good personality, I’m interested in a lot of things, I’ve become semi successful professionally (I got to $40k/yr with nothing more than a HS diploma and I recently started freelance writing about sports, which I love). But it’s like, if I’ve gone 32 years without finding any girl who thinks I’m worth a shit, how could I possibly be a good person? What good are all of my individual accomplishments if I have nobody to share life with?

I feel like a selfish piece of shit every time I go to my friends’ weddings because l look around and it hits me that I’ll never get to have this. I’ll never get to have that happiness. All of my friends are either in serious relationships or married and some are beginning to have children, another thing I want some day. I’m the only single one (they don’t even give me a plus one because they know it’s a waste) and it’s fucking embarrassing. I’m the only one that has nothing going on. 

I don’t see them nearly as much as I used to because they generally do couples stuff and I’d just be an extra wheel, so I feel like I’m losing my friends because I’m an inadequate fucking loser. They’re all taller, more accomplished, better people than I am. I’m the ugly duckling of the group and always have been; girls not liking me has been a running joke since high school and at this point I just use the humor as a coping mechanism because I’d rather laugh than cry. They’ve never tried to set me up on a date before, at least that I’m aware, so they either don’t have faith in me or the girls they’ve tried to set me up with turned me down and they didn’t tell me. Either is an indictment on me.

I haven’t spoken to my mom in three years (our relationship has been toxic since I was in 2nd/3rd grade) and my dad and I were never/are not close. I’ve never had a stable home life, and I’d just fucking kill for the chance to start a family. To show that I could be an amazing father with no fucking help from them. To be the parent they never were.

My grandmother basically raised me, and it kills me that she’s been looking forward to seeing me get married and have kids since the day I was born, and I’ll never be able to give that to her. I failed her. 

I’m sorry if this comes off as tangential rambling, I’m just really struggling and I don’t know what the fuck to do. I look at my 401k and it’s just like, what’s the fucking point of this? Why am I saving money for retirement when I’m just going to be alone with nothing? Why not just take it out and buy a house or something. I love to travel, but I can’t do it alone anymore without getting in my feelings. I went to a baseball game in April and saw all the couples around me having such a good time, and I got sad.

i feel like i’m never going to find friends like these again and i’m terrified of trusting people enough to tell them what i believe now. i’ve seriously considered suicide but held fast to a promise i made to myself never to do it. 

i still feel like i did the right thing by telling them, but why does it hurt so much? did i do the right thing after all? i feel like i should have just shut up and kept it to myself, pretend to be someone i wasn’t and they wouldn’t have picked up on a thing.

1214,myASMRisHOT_,1658696807,1,"I’m 15 and for the past two years or so, I’ve been feeling terrible. Before I got into high school I was pretty okay with my social life, but I soon became jealous of the friendships people had formed around me. I began feeling separated from my friend group, finding no joy in their company. I started to hate my friends and the people around me, the smallest flaw caused me to hate them as if they had betrayed me in some way. 

Luckily, this phase was cut short due to the pandemic and I began to appreciate the people around me more. I saw relationships fall apart and friendships break and thrive. I had gotten into a relationship myself, I was under the impression that a high school student should have a girlfriend/boyfriend/SO. So when a girl confessed to me, I accepted despite not feeling much towards her. The relationship started ed out okay, it was corny and very cringe but felt right at the time. We would cuddle and kiss all the time, she’d come over to my house so we could cuddle up and watch movies together. I was happy with this for a while, I felt like I’d unlocked a new part of life, like I’d bought a DLC. It felt great, and I was happy. 

The relationship soon began to fall apart, however. Although it survived through the pandemic, the commitment I had to the relationship began to fade until I was happy when she wasn’t with me. I knew I had to end it, but getting the courage to was difficult. I was very aware of her emotions, and hurting her was something I wasn’t ready to do. 

Our eventual end was to happen in math class, through a note. She said she wanted to go back to being friends, I was overjoyed and immediately agreed. She didn’t speak to me for a while afterwards, she looked at me with a sort of hatred and disgust. 

It’s been around two years since it ended, and I’ve noticed how much of an awful person she is. I’m glad it ended, but it caused some damage. I got a taste of affection, I became addicted and have now grown desperate for someone to love. I’ve done some pretty weird things to relieve myself of the loneliness I feel, turning to boyfriend audios on YouTube. I feel ashamed to watch them, but they help me forget about my sad reality. 

It physically hurts to realise I’m alone sometimes, I get a sharp pain in my chest and feel my body become heavy. It’s gotten pretty bad recently, I see couples around me and it hurts to see them so happy and content with their lives. It makes me wonder if I’ll ever find love. I don’t know if I’m pretty or likeable, I don’t know if people will like my personality or love me for who I truly am. And what makes this whole thing worse, is that I’ve got severe anxiety and possibly autism. 

I feel like I shouldn’t be feeling this at my age. I’m only 15, I’m going to collage in 2 years and I’m here worrying about my love life rather than focusing on things like studying. I don’t know how to get rid of these feelings, I can’t tell anyone about them as no one really knows about any of this. I’m unsure if I’ll be able to stop feeling like this, I think getting into a relationship would solve my problems but it’s a lot easier said than done. 

I said to myself that when I leave high school, I will find myself a partner. But I’m not sure if I can wait that long. I’d love to have a partner, I think I’ve got a lot to offer when it comes to a relationship. But I’m doubtful and awkward so finding someone will be difficult. I kind of wish someone would just appear in my room one day.  

I don’t know how long I can go on like this, the feeling is making me depressed and living is getting harder. With little motivation to keep me going and nothing to come home to after a hard day, living seems pointless and I feel helpless.",lonely,I’m getting desperate and it hurts a lot,2022-07-25 07:06:47

You’ll regret being on your deathbed not doing anything about your situation, acknowledging that you just missed out on so many treasured memories because you were shy. If you’re boring, itd because again, you’re alone all day doing nothing. To have SOMETHING to talk about, you see, you gotta do SOMETHING. Because you see, when you do SOMETHING, SOMETHING happens. Your brain needs exercise to pump blood through it to work properly and function at it’s best, to create the chemicals that will make you feel like the king/queen of the world. And nutrients. You’ll be surprised by how well life goes when you eat well. You can run fast, be agile and slay like a warrior! Go outside, be spontaneous, you only know a teeny portion of your universe. Pick up any hobbies that full fill you and find people with those same passions, interests and ambitions. Filling your social group with positives will make you positive and happy as well. What good do you need the negative ones for?! Try art and travel, they please the soul. Joining a club will no doubt help find relationships. “But I’m too anxious” well tell me this, does the small pain of having to do something for once compare to the pain of 50+ years of loneliness, emptiness and misery?

There’s gonna be people in the comments who will make excuses to why they continue being miserable, let them, why do you also have to follow them to the abyss?

My wife doesn't mean to, but she does little things that make it hard for me to exist in our home. Since I had surgery in December I've been smoking weed. It's slowly escalated but now she is vacillating between accusing me of being high whenever I do something she seems ""stupid"" or when I'm ""slipping and making stupid mistakes"". (we both have ADHD and she basically relies on me to make sure the house stays in order. 

I'm exhausted and it's isolating. Now she's starting to push me to wipe every trace of my smoke stuff any time she smells it. She constantly claims everything gives her allergies, to the point where she will randomly boycott my grooming soaps if she catches a whiff when she's in a bad mood

I'm not trying to be dismissive of her, but if she doesn't see me smoke she rarely ever notices a smell. But when she is home all day and sees me her ""allergies start acting up when she smells it"".

I don't have any small space to hide in except the bathroom anymore and now I'm being moved to the guest bathroom where the kids make it gross

I miss my old condo where I could relax without judgement and I was allowed to have smells in my life... I miss vanilla and lavender and incense and cinnamon....

I thought I was fine, I thought I could make it, but now I'll see her tomorrow. Maybe today. I fell for a coworker and she got her heart broken. I tried to be a good friend, I tried to show her heart that not all of us are bad guys. She doesn't see it that way and if I posted the texts between us, without knowing the situation; I'd be crucified. I just wanted to give her a gift card to buy her favorite coffee after work. I wasn't going, but the smile on her face would have made my day. I bought a new outfit, and then she never shows up. She called in and said that she was depressed, which I find hard to believe. She was at the clubs just a few hours ago, so more than likely she was hung over. But what 18 year Olds can drink at the club? Something doesn't add up and I got deleted and threatened with a block.

I wasn't trying to fix anything, I just wanted to give her a smile in whatever she's going through.

Like when you're having the worst time of your life and you think, this is IT. This is where I die. Then all of a sudden a new song comes on and it's so beautiful and upbeat; that you find yourself dancing and thinking you can take on the world. For those few moments, you're truly happy. Until the song ends.

I've gotten better. Everyone was worried after my Facebook post and me completely dropping off the face of the earth. People thought I did it. I didn't mean to worry anyone...

I just needed to get away from everyone. I'd look at her Instagram and other social media accounts. Still do... Then I end up sick to my stomach. That vomit feeling takes over and I'm holding myself up in some hidden part of the store as I try to breathe.

I got a second job just to numb myself. The Cash Back movie had the main protagonist working at a grocery store during the night. That's when it hits the hardest and you replay texts and old scenarios in your head. So I took on a second job which at the time was just to make more money. Now I'm working 15/18 hour days just to get away.

I got a raise at my other job. I don't know how much, but I'm doing my best or trying to beat my best.

I just don't know how to act when I see her. Our schedules overlap and I KNOW myself. If she talks to me or asks me anything work related I'll say, ""I'm not your supervisor, go find your supervisor"" or ""Do you have a walkie"" with an annoyed tone. Which is true. If you have one, page them.

I finally came out of my hole when a girl friend of mine said that she as throwing up and crying because I didn't answer any of her texts or calls. I just turned all of my notifications off. I told her that I'm still here. Still hurting.

Now I just need to get up, but it's so hard. I can fake it and work really hard, why can't I fake being happy and okay?

I just want to be okay, NOW. Do it! Make it happen. Make it to where I don't feel sad anymore. You know it's bad when it cuts right through you schizophrenia medication and anti depressant. Oh man... I haven't felt like that in a year a and then I was back at the edge. May I never fall or crush for someone ever again. I have to get ready for work.

I guess the way she treated me for the past few days just came snowballing all of a sudden and so I answered back and told her sure that’s fine. She usually celebrates my bday by buying me a cake that I can’t really eat and serve me customary noodle dish. (While my brother, gets to have a full blown party and every time I do all the work. Doing Dishes and basically slaving myself.) and well that’s fine with me cause a one point that’s just the norm within our family.

But then I don’t know why I never feel like she appreciates me or love me. Even though I’ve always done what she wants and do everything for her like for example whenever it’s her bday, I always go all out. Like literally go all out. My dad doesn’t have a romantic bone in his body and my brother is doing charity work to his gf’s family 🙄(basically, he’s their cash cow. My brother is gullible and doesn’t see it) so he can’t even spare one candle for our mom’s bday and yet he still gets the best treatment, while I get his scraps.  At one point, I was mad and confronted her about her having favorites and then she got mad and rebuked me saying that she doesn’t have favorites and she treats us, equally. Like yeah right. And then I got tired of arguing and telling her she’s lying and well I really thought I accepted the fact it’s normal for her to treat me like this and I can never be cared and loved for like my brother. I thought I’m alright and used to it already but then when she told me she won’t celebrate my bday, I just got tired like why am I even trying at this point? Why did I have to feel so sad about what she said. So, I realized maybe I’m still trying to get her  approval and love. And then today is my bday, the day is about to end and not once did I ever receive a bday greeting from my mom. My dad gave me money and ask if I even wanted him to get me cake and then I saw my mom and heard her say, it’s my fault that she had to cancel her plans of eating out, to this fancy place that my brother suggested and well cause he wants to try it. Did they ask me if I wanted to go there? Noooope. So suddenly it felt all cumbersome. 

I’m both sad and angry at myself for having any expectations and well if I can get my mom and dad a full a$$ catering, a whole roasted pig and designer stuff during their bdays, then I can also just celebrate my birthday on my own. So, I ordered whatever stuff I could immediately have and delivered it to my room. 

Which, btw, is extremely stupid I just feel emptier than ever, seeing all these food in front of me now is making me lonely. I guess this experience will just add up to one more reason why to hate birthdays and my existence. Like really, if there’s a God or something, I wouldn’t have minded if I was born as a rock or some cactus out there or sometimes I  wish I’m adopted but I’m not so….😬🫥😂

so im 22f and have no friends. not someone who says they have no friends but has a few, i have 0. some days i dont even know why i have a phone. its empty.

bc of my disability i dont work, but i live with my mom and brother. i dont have a relationship with my brother, and they both work all the time. im at home alone constantly just wandering around. i would go outside but it just feels like it makes me feel worse seeing people especially together and happy. i have pets, but they are more independent animals that dont really want to sit with you and listen to your problems (especially since one is deaf lol).

i am in a relationship but we only see eachother on weekends and im just sitting here waiting to be told its over and im not good enough or something. maybe thats just my brain being mean but idk. i did have to see a mental health team at my house for \*reasons\* but have had 0 follow up. he works weekdays without connection too, so again, those hours, i am alone even through messages. 

i have always been close to my sister. she now got a job and is constantly travelling. shes never close to home, shes always outside so her phone is never connected, it goes days without sending or receiving a message. we always shared a room or if we werent together we were always messaging or playing games, but now shes gone too. im glad shes finally happy but i want to be selfish and have her with me all the time again.

i just feel so loney and lost it makes my heart feel like it aches. i dont know really how to make girl - friends, i had a lot in high school but that was me pretending to be into makeup and stuff i dont like. now i am into gaming, (WoW, cod, horror games etc), manga, nature, walking, and any man seems to want something sexual.  idk, friendships also feel like so much work. i complain im lonely but a lot of days find it so hard to keep up with relationships and get very overwhelmed (mental health problems too lol)",lonely,"lonely, lost in life, siblings moving away",2022-07-24 20:01:14

But I spent the entirety of my freshman year of college online, so that went out the window after the first week and meeting new people/making new friends became extremely difficult.

But it seems everybody took the opportunity freshman year to actually connect online- which makes sense, I think covid really helped with that end. Come sophomore year, it’s my first time in person living on campus and I struggled to make any friends, or any connections at all. And now all my old friends from high school I barely talk to anymore.

I can’t tell if it’s because I’m not trying enough (or at all), or if I’m just that fucking awkward. I’ve tried talking and reaching out but it seems like I only ever make people feel uncomfortable. But it also feels like when I’m trying to be sociable/outgoing I feel like such a fake. Maybe people can sense that? Is it so obvious?

I don’t think I was ever that great at socializing to begin with, but I had friends at some point. Idk it just feels kinda shitty when you don’t have anybody to talk to. Everyone is branching out, and finding their groups and people they feel comfortable with and I’m just kinda there. (Funnily enough, one of my old friends used to wear an “anti-social” shirt, was the type to say “ew people” but even they have a new friend group)

I barely talked to or hung out with anybody since I got home for the summer. The one person I’ve seen this break asked me about my college experience and all I could do was admit I’ve done nothing but work and have no friends. It was so fucking embarrassing to admit that. 

The idea of not making any friends for my entire time in college is depressing, but honestly looks like the route I’m heading.

At this point, I don’t feel close to anyone at school, none of my old friends, and most certainly not my family.

Sometimes, I think about cutting myself off from everyone entirely. Tell people to lose my number, delete all my socials, and just disappear. It’s not like it’d matter.

1310,PozitronCZ,1658652591,1,"DISCLAIMER: I'm not native English speaker and I have never written such a long text in English before. I'm sure there may be (and will be) a lot of grammar mistakes.

My story is long. I was always a ""weirdo"". At school, I was always the weird kid who was bullied by others and having no friends. Looking at it retrospectively I made a lot of mistakes. I was avoiding people because I was scared if I talk to somebody it may result in another wave of bullying. And I wasn't really interested either. I was always a nerd who was in computer science and stuff. When at the end of my primary school (in my country for kids 6 – 15 years old - nine grades) when my male classmates were staring to date girls I was doing my computer stuff. I thought why would I lose my time with others. What a stupid of me.

Then I started my secondary school (four grades). I still didn't think about talking to others so much, but I was started to change when I was about 17. The secondary school I was attending was a electronic/computer science school and in your class there were no girls. Literary the whole school had about 1000 students which only about 50 was females. But I still didn't consider this matters important. Soon after I graduated.

When I'm looking on it now I clearly see I completely wasted the era of my life when one is supposed to learn the principles of socializing.

After the secondary school I gave a try at a university but I failed. It was just too difficult. Also during those two years I didn't make any social contacts that are worth mentioning. I was still the weirdo.

And then I got to work. My first full time job was at McDonald's. I considered it being ""temporary"" but at the end I was there at full-time for about 18 months (and I still occasionally work there as part-timer). At the work for me it was first time after YEARS I actually have a chance to talk to a girl (or rather I say woman) of my age. It may sound crazy but at my secondary school there were no girls and the same goes for the university. And for me having no friends at all it really meant I haven't casually talked to a girl for maybe five or six years.

I remember how clueless I was. I was (and I think I still am) an overgrown child with no clue how many things in adult world works. One day the manager sent me to wipe the floor. They tell me they want me to wipe the floor at locker rooms. Both men and women lockers. I remember how I was uncertain and how it feels just not right. I'm a guy, so I really shouldn't enter women lockers. It was very awkward for me but I got to use of it after some time.

And then the weirdest thing in my life happened. One of the female workers here somehow showed interest in me. I still don't understand how it happened and even what actually happened. Well as expected our interaction last for about one month. Then we ""break up"" without even officially saying it. I think the guilty was on both sides. Surely, she quickly realized I'm an incompetent idiot who have absolutely no idea how to treat her. Honestly, I was scared. And it also somehow doesn't feel right to me. It was something I was thinking one day may happen but when it was there I didn't know what to do. I was really scared, I was scared about how I'm supposed to tell somebody I have a girlfriend. How I'm supposed to tell my parents the big news that their weird son who never ever shown any interest in women suddenly got a girlfriend.

Another thing is I think I didn't fall in love with her. I liked her (until I found out she isn't that great as she looks at the beginning) but I don't thing I actually fallen in love with her. But really I do not even know what ""falling in love"" really is since I have probably never experienced that. I'm not even sure if I'm even capable of falling in love anymore.

Not much happened between us. We hold hand for few times and I received my first (and last) kiss in my life. Nothing more.

When we break up she already ended her job (in reality - she was fired) and I never hear about her or saw her ever again.

This was in 2016. Shortly after this episode I also got a new work which I have until today. I work as a electro-mechanist for a railway company. After all the years my life doesn't change. I'm still a loner, with almost no friends (I have few friends, but we are all ""weirdos""). I realized how bad my life is it the spring 2020. Everyone was talking about how they can't go to the pub with friends, and they have to go somewhere else but for me literary nothing changed.

Now I'm almost 31. I feel bad. Lost in life. Lacking motivation to improve myself. Because there in nobody to applause it. And it gets worse. I remember my grandmother telling me being alone doesn't hurt that much when one is young but become painful when one gets old. It is already painful for me. I do not understand myself. I feel badly because I do not have anyone who cares about me (except my parents) but I also can't imagine myself being in relationship with someone. It's a weird idea for me. I have a coworker who is two years older than me who have wife and three kids. I know it's totally normal to have a family in this age but I just can't imagine myself in the role of being ""a father"". I look just absurd to me. I guess I'm still an overgrown child after all. And I will probably always be.

For all the younger people than me here, please do not let yourself became a failture like me. If you are 20 you still have time. If you are over 30 like me, your time is up.",lonely,[ long] My life story,2022-07-24 18:49:51

Never being invited to the after work girl's night out (which hurts even more being trans), always just being the person they go to for work related things. I practically have no friends that I see regularly. All my close friends are online and far away. My most recent dating experience was terrible, had an amazing time with her on a date but got ghosted yet again. A friend that promised to see me one more time before they headed back to school overseas didn't keep their promise. Time and time again, I feel like the world is moving on without me. Like if I suddenly stopped existing, nobody would bat an eye, everything would keep going. Nobody seems to want anything to do with me. I lose my temper more at work, which probably only pushes people away from me more because they think I'm just some bitch that hates her job and can't get along with people. On my days off, I only have myself to spend them with, while coworkers are living through their best years with people that care about them.

I need someone now more than ever. I'm falling apart and feel like there's never going to be a way out. I just want to matter to someone, be enough for them to want to hang out with me, and enjoy their time with me. I want to matter to someone enough that they want to be with me. I don't want to be alone my whole life but that feels like how things will turn out for me. Being the chick that's always alone. I don't want my loneliness to take my life away. I struggle to find the will to live a lot, the only thing keeping me from ending it is because I'm a coward, and because of that very small possibility that someone is out there for me and that I will one day meet her.

1332,nyutacom,1658640762,1,"**I watched bojack. And I guess I just want a space to let out how I interpreted  it. Firstly, I saw some comment on a bojack edit and how sarahlynn (plays a foster child in bojacks tv show in the actual show) was groomed as a kid to show love but never felt love and she killed herself as an adult because she wasn't able to ever get the feeling that she was groomed to believe she deserved because she was now an adult. Not even in a sexual matter, she was an adult. to everyone else she didn’t “deserve” to be groomed for love anymore because we’re made to think adults, even struggling with drug addiction, don’t deserve the same amount of love as we got as a child. and she spent her whole adulthood finding that love in drugs til she finally found the internal love in them (od). and it was like. heart wrenching. Life truly seems to be black and white these days, I reminisce of days when I was able to watch Disney movies and truly think that I could live my own fairytale and now, I think back and it feels like it's so foolish in the most nostalgic way. Secretariat especially makes me melt into a puddle of sadness. This little boy, bojack, looked up to this guy who in the end of it all, didn’t do wrong to bojack. But yet he grew into the literal copy and paste of what Secretariat was. I think bojack had tons of epiphanies of, “oh shit, I’m everything I don’t want to be now but wanted to be as a kid.” and that view of it really hurts. Knowing that none of you fully fits together. We watched bojack as a victim when he was the** antagonist. Which I think is interesting, I don’t think a lot of us are accepting of people who go through a hard time because of the actions they’ve always committed but bojack makes us see it from a point of view of sympathy for him, almost. Another “view” is Holly. You know when she and bojack talk by the pool about how Holly feels like she's not good enough? Or how bojack tells Diane that she should just settle because he worries that she won't find what she thinks she deserves. To me, bojack is kind of like us, we stumble upon our own insecurities trying to help someone we care about but we can never take that advice personally. Because it’s scarier to do what makes you feel good due to the expectations of someone else. And maybe that's because of Bojack's mother. I don’t think Bojack realized he was actually someone due to his mom. His mom never noticed him, truly. I think for his whole life, Bojack was disconnected to reality because he grew up in a family that was detached from not only each other but the situation they called a family. And I think a lot of us can relate to that, growing up in a home that has no true value to us causes us to be infatuated with anything or anyone. Bojack grew a fixation on these fictatus friendships because nothing else in his life had value. Because his mom told him so. How could someone love someone so broken like bojack. I think the line (when he gets interviewed) “And you think you don’t have power over women..”, is super important because the most powerful woman has over you, is usually your mother. His mother had all this power that was given to bojack, the lack of awareness his mother and his mother had. Because as long as everyone was a good puppet in their life, nothing else is worth holding yourself accountable for. Like with Herb. The realization that we are actually terrible people sometimes is hard. Seeing the scene with Herb rejecting Bojacks’ apology made me feel like Herb was my conscience and Bojack is me trying to justify what I did to myself, but herb obviously doesn’t let the guilt go away. We’re all victims in our lives and I don’t think a lot of people can accept that. And in a way, I don’t think I can. And that’s why a lot of us disconnect from reality or disassociate.

I've always been extremely introverted with poor social skills, and generally I don't have the same hobbies as most other people my age, all of which has led to nothing but mockery and rejection. I've barely ever had any real friends, aside from my online friends and people who I thought were my friends but stopped talking to me over time because I guess I'm just not interesting enough. This is how my entire life has been, and it's only gotten worse over time. It even got to the point last school year where I just decided to start doing online school at home because being in an environment full of thousands of people my age who do nothing but reject me and regard me as nonhuman became too miserable to bare.

At this point all I ever do is sit at home by myself feeling miserable. That's all I can do. I have come to the conclusion that I'm unlovable and that I'm never going to be accepted by society. I have to live with the knowledge that most other people my age have a positive reflection on their social life and I've barely ever had one. They all have large friend groups and hang out all of the time, they all have girlfriends/boyfriends, they've all done impressive things with their lives, and here I am, having had/done none of that, and I've given up all expectations that I ever will. I'm never gonna have accepting friends in real life who will actually stick with me, I'm never gonna get a girlfriend, and at this point, I've lost almost all motivation to achieve any of my goals in life, because it feels pointless knowing that any success I achieve is still gonna leave me unloved and rejected by society and everyone.

1403,Xenerzone,1658616233,1,"Well to start off, I recently became pretty depressed about me being alone and pretty lonely this past year. I recently came home from a crappy Erasmus project in the hopes that I would eventually find some opportunities for me for the future and most importantly new friends/acquaintances with whom I can still keep in touch even after this thing would end, but a classroom friend of mine (that I will name Mike) which I kinda hate at this point made this worse made me feel like shit and I couldn't approach anyone the way I wanted and would mock me for my crappy jokes. Anyways to get back on track, during this 3 weeks of social torture for me I found out that a pretty close guy to me (he is a guy that sits next to me at school which I will name Bob) with whom I felt I could share my deep emotions and thoughts about anything and everything and even took advice from so I could maybe ease my social anxiety which has taken much of my self-esteem to even go out to the groceries or something like that well... he isn't that much of a patient person and that quote ""I can't babysit you everytime..."" which makes sense but for me it kinda hurts in a way (I know this sounds selfish as hell believe me I do too but can't help it) and that he ""can't be always and everytime compasionate to me because everyone has its limits"" which I understand, but for me this hurt a lot which shouldn't but it does, not to mention that during that legit hell of a ""mobility"" as the teachers called it he and most of the others who participated would just meet at the biggest room in the hotel and drink all night listening to music at max which bothered me even more since I aint a junky (firstly they weren't that bad but then shit went down to the point teachers caught on to them once but that's it only once and never again and they continued even further and even worse then other days) and so time went on and me and him would switch rooms since the first one had a broken communist style shower and that's when the room we were given was the new place at which the other could gather and drink until they were dead, initially he would respect my decision not to let them in, but because some guys manipulated me into such manner as to let them do their thing (even though I knew it was gonna be bad). So there I was alone in some corner, people talking about stuff I didn't even understand, events and other things, some got drunk as hell and I had to help them either go to the bathroom or send them to their rooms and so on, they didn't even respected their promises to leave when I told them to, some were pissed because I kinda insulted them for insulting me first when telling them to get the hell out. Fast forward a bit in time, during the 10th day the shower in that room broke for some reason and we had to switch rooms again, coincidentally the electrical installation in the room where Mike was and another dude was got busted and the teachers had no choice but to move the 4 of us into the same room (the teachers didn't have a choice since no other rooms were available that time). So the moment Mike said ""The vote of the majority wins"" when he heard we were all moving there destroyed me. For the rest of the project I had to sleep in other rooms so that Mike, Bob and everyone could go and have fun while I didint want to take part in any of that since it was just disgusting for me to see junkies getting high on vodka, whiskey, tequila and beer combined. Since that day I would spend most of the time in the reception since I had the best wifi there and I would just stay there and play games to pass the time, people would come by asking what I was doing but nothing more, so that was my life during that, and the only thing that kept me together were my parents to which I was keen to call almost everytime to not feel awkward since I don't talk too many people there and to fill that void of loneliness, Bob wouldn't even ask ""why are you sad? What is wrong?"", just nothing, he would come by but that's it, since the most important crap to him was his love towards a girl which liked him first but then decided not to and he is still going for her, I even gave him advice to just live his live and love can be achieved anytime not just here and now (he had gfs in the past so he knew well), but as I thought of myself helping him and seeing him tired of helping me got me questioning ""Am I that selfish of a person for wanting compassion all the time? Am I that selfish of a person for wanting validation and getting approval of any decision that I do?"" (Yeah this question might seem weird but since little I used to and still do ask my parents if I should do X or Y, and I know I should grow up already but I cant help it sometimes). And then the usual lonely acts, pretend you are fine, fake every smile every laugh until it's all over. When I got back home I still couldn't get over the things that happened then, I still think of how incompetent I am to keep a conversation afloat, of how boring I am, of how skinny I am, of how I dont have the ambition to change that even I want and can do it. I would have days where I couldn't sleep and just cry about the whole ordeal and about myself, constantly reminding myself that if people don't deserve me then I don't deserve them, and I believe that if something doesn't happen to me or I dont happen to solve this issue even though I am trying, well... I will just quit, I will isolate myself even further, limit every contact with every human being, 4 years of constant bullying in secondary school, one year of hope in high school then another year of realization that high school while people don't bully me they still make me feel like shit from time to time and make it impossible for me to learn social skills. The only thing I got left in this godforsaken world are unimportant unhelpful stuff which are games and some books, and 2 best friends, me and loneliness.

You have someone who has empathy and listens to you. I wish I had that but loneliness here is this massive taboo that you can't talk about. Maybe people who have friends can talk about it but I don't have friends or any other outlet. Professionals? Most of them didn't want to hear about it. They would tell me the same things I could be told on Reddit. Go out, say nice things about you, don't talk about yourself in a negative way are some of the things they say. In what is my reality, they don't want to go out of their comfort zone to have empathy for a bad guy like me. I don't mean a bad guy who's cool. I mean a bad guy who has nothing. Those hotlines made it worse because they would get mad if I told them the advice they gave me didn't help me. Maybe you are different but do you have places to vent to about loneliness? I wish I had someone IRL who is caring, listens, and has empathy. It's depressing that no one is out there IRL since I've been talked down to from most of the people I vented to. I think most of them don't believe me. When I say I'm almost 40 and have had no relationships, or sex, they think the worst about me. Probably words like misogynist, or the dreaded I word comes to their minds because I give off the vibe. Even when I say I don't blame women since I wouldn't go near myself, they assume the worst and you can't help someone you don't like.

1418,TAHINAZ,1658612076,1,"I’m at the point in my life where it’s necessary for me to be a hermit. I go to work and have family I sometimes see, but I have no other contact with people. 

For the most part, this doesn’t bother me. I was a homeschooled only child out in the country. I went to public school, but had social anxiety and lived too far into the country to make or visit friends. Same with college. I commuted instead of living on campus. 

I managed to get married, but divorced after 11 years, due to abuse. Now I live alone. 

I’ve never had friends, and I say that without exaggeration. I don’t know how. Honestly, I don’t feel like I should try too hard. 

I’ve always felt driven to write a novel. I’ve been trying since I was a kid, but fear and procrastination has stood in my way. I chip away at it bit by bit, but am frustrated by my lack of progress. I feel like I’m pushing a boulder up a hill. I know at this point in my life, God is isolating me so I can finally focus and get it done. No distractions. No giving myself away to a man or trying to be someone I’m not to attract friends who would only monopolize my time. It won’t always be like this. But for now, I need to be alone. 

Still, I feel sorry for myself sometimes. I daydream about having someone beside me who values me and wants to know who I am. Someone who appreciate my weirdness. Someone to share life’s burden. Someone to make me feel like a woman, or even just a worthwhile human. Someone to make me feel valued. 

I know I can’t rely on another person for those things. People are imperfect, and I’ve gone through a lot of abuse. I know what I really need is the love of God and self. But it’s so hard sometimes. Sometimes I relish the silence…but sometimes, like now, I feel so alone.",lonely,Bummed about being a hermit,2022-07-24 07:34:36

Therefore, I will try to keep it short and simple - I am lonely and pretty much alone, too (What a cliché I am).

I think I always have been kind of a loner, but since a high school graduation 4 years ago it's gotten so much worse. Back then, I still had my best friend from the same class, at least (still could never be completely honest with her). However, in 2019 I had faced some problems at uni which made me want to avoid society even more than I did up to that point. Because of that (and some other things related to her as a person) I decided to burn the bridges. She had tried to get to me for the one final time in 2020, but I told her I never wanted to talk to her again. Believe me, I had my reasons to do so then. Every time I miss her I suddenly realize I probably did the right thing. With her gone, there went the only single person in my life I've ever been closer to. She was, quite possibly, the only friend I've ever had in my life. The other people, before and after, were just acquaintances, classmates, uni mates, colleagues, but not friends.

I am lonely and alone. But this ""story"" is just one piece of a big jigsaw puzzle that has shaped my loneliness. There's so much more to it. I just can't put it all together because the thoughts in my head keep blocking each other. This ""story"" is just a prelude, it seems.

The reason of my loneliness, I think, mostly lies in the fact that I am soon 24 years old and I have never had a relationship, never experienced love, never kissed, never held hands...

(I am sorry, I can't type at this point anymore... It's all so complex, there's just too much I want to say, but I don't know how to put it all together, where to begin...)

1438,Prehistoric_Lama,1658608651,1,"Loneliness has always accompanied me throughout my life as making friends who I could consider as real friends was absurdly rare and difficult. Fortunately, back in high school I managed to make myself a friend who I shared a lot of stuff with, we had the same activities, passions and sense of humor, we had tons of private jokes 'cause we were the only ones that had some niche hobbies which is why we quickly became best friends.

That period of my life was wonderful as I felt I finally found a true friend, unfortunately, the time to go to college finally arrived, and we went to complete different universities. I tried keeping in touch but we eventually got too busy with our own lives and studies.

Yesterday, boredom was more intense than usual, so I decided to send a text without hoping for any response, but they did answer, and we had so much stuff to say, they're back in town for the month and we've decided to go hang out sometime to remember the good old times, a time when everything was simpler and so fun.

I don't know if we'll keep in touch, but I hope so because that conversation really put a smile on my face which is something that hasn't happened in a long time.",lonely,Got in touch with an old friend that I haven't talked to in over a year.,2022-07-24 06:37:31

Same goes with chatting as well.


I know it’s hard to trust strangers but at the end of the day that’s all we ever are to each other and will be for the most part, what can change that or possibly make it any different in my eyes, is being genuine and i hope it can happen because i’m tired of wearing a mask, and if you’re too, feel free to send a chat and we talk.",lonely,I wish there was a way to do away with small talks and pleasantries,2022-07-24 06:13:55

They could have thought I was following them or something but still that didn’t help. I was really excited for the Ferris wheel because it looks over my town so I saved it for last. Waited a whole 15 minutes in line only to be told by the guy “are you alone? No singles”. Yikes and it also wasn’t lost in me that I was in a line with conventionally attractive couples.

During low phases, i put forth my seemingly privileged life in the face of the envying, to get my spirits high. Because its only by proving that someone is inferior shall one feel superior.

The inner layer however is sad at times. The sadness buried so deep inside that the outer layer can’t even feel its existence. But i know its exists, when i reflect in moments of vulnerability. When everything around me has reached its saturation of pretentiousness the layers start uncovering, showing my true naked self. 

Its there that i realize what real my happiness will be. Not the one that is the norm determined by the envying but the one decided by my soul. And it will not be pretentious. It will be real.

That's why whenever it hits and I don't have anyone to meetup with for that particular day, I'd go to the nearby karaoke bar and hangout with my regular hostess there over a few drinks and dinner.

I've struggled to connect to others my whole life. I struggle with social cues, I was always considered weird, I used to imitate other kids as a child to fit in but I think I always did something wrong. I had very few friends, and in high school things went downhill because some of the few friends I did have turned out to be shitty people and I was an outcast at school. I'm doing a bit better now (I go to university) but I still don't have close friends

And I never had someone call me their best friend. Not the people I knew as a child that I saw as my best friends. All the people I was friends with at school were more like people who sort of tolerated me but never asked me to go out with them or anything. The friends I have now will go months without texting me unless I call them first, and often I find out that they went on holiday or met up together without even asking me. The only people I regularly talk to are my online friends, but even then it always feels like everyone is closer to each other than they are to me

It just hurts to know that I've never been anyone's first choice and that I'm just the weirdo who tags along. I don't know how to make more friends because I still struggle with social cues and I don't like partying like many people my age do and at this point I'm starting to feel like it's too late to find close friends because everyone else already has them and I know a lot of people who think not having friends is a red flag",lonely,I never had a best friend,2022-07-24 00:39:32
1490,Ok_Penalty_2656,1658586884,1,"This is what happened yesterday: friday night: long post ahead

I hate everything about this culture. I wish i was not born a minority and have to endure all this nonsense. im just too different from them. my parents are angry because i really dont give a fuck about their gossiping relatives. but it is somehow disrespectful to just skip a family event. ive been going for those for 20 years without question but the one year i say im not feeling it they raise a whole ruckus.

Being a minority sucks balls. im currently under our apartment playing with a stray cat. It is licking itself sitting beside me. I do nothing all day but league and reddit my brain is so dead. I had 3 months summer break to work on my body/grades but here we are. 2 weeks left to year 2 of university. forgot everything in year 1. bad mental in year 1 led to terrible habits and grades. no friends. no social life. just come home everyday and stay up till 4am.

i thought this summer would be the turning point. but no. 3 months just past like that and im still the same. except i started going on walks some days. i cant even brush my teeth at night.

i hate my body. i feel as if though everyone is looking at me on public transport. even though im not conventially ugly. talking to women in school gives me panic and i want to breathe so hard after that interaction.

i envy those in western country who can go to new place on their own and explore cities. i always google new cities in uk and canada to dream my life there. right now i like surrey, bc, melbourne.

saturday edit:

i think i am an incelish guy as well. the only good thing about my genes is that i am above average height. and i got thick hair. thats it. everything else is a negative in appearance wise. i tried to learn lucid dream to feel what it is like to hug another woman. but i failed. whenever is see my age people having fun or being with their partners it tilts me. whenever i see an attractive woman who get a partner, something inside me gets irrationality angry. even more so if i see a guy whos way out of the womans league. i know its bad but i cant help it. i just opened up my instagram. one guy i was close to in junior college ( like high school) just posted a pic with his gf presumably. they are both goodlooking. i thought he was single all these years too. guess he found someone in university.

i drink redbull and eat shit. i am a loser when i think of children dying in wars. i feel like a loser. conplaining about toxic household when there is literal wars in the middle east where people die everyday.

i wish i was never born. i wish i was born an orphan. i wish i was born into any other country. i wish i was born into any other non minority.

It hurts that i will die one day not having any memories to look back on. ill be on my deathbed regretting not doing anything for my whole life. i hope cyrogenics become possible but 99.9 chance it will not happen in the next 100-200 years. we will wll be long dead by then. that feeling hurts. 

the worst part is i cant tell this to anyone. they think im a ""smart"" guy who has everything going well. i hate this world. i wish my parents were infertile. i dont hate them. but i dont love them either. i discovered the religion i believed in all my lfie is false a few months back. 

i have no friends. i can never date in this country. i have toxic parents. i have bad habits. i have bad grades. i dont want to kill myself because a) i want to enjoy life too b) im too scared of even attempting remotely like that. all my house is religious. i have to hide it. i want to take my remaining money an djust drop out of uni and run away somewhere. but i cant.

thanks for reading this. i made some edits and its saturday night today. another lonely night of playing league and scrolling reddit. good night and enjoy your weekend with your loved ones guys.",lonely,I hate being lonely. It sucks so hard,2022-07-24 00:34:44

For instance, recently my mother forced I and my siblings to clean the house because in her worlds, ""you f\*\*king kids can't do your chores"" or ""your so damn lazy"" and my favourite \[aimed at me\] ""no wonder your grades are so bad, you can't even do your chores properly"". First of all yes, sometimes I don't do my chores either out of laziness or the fact that I contribute very little to the mess in the house; counter to what my mother would have anyone know is that I don't make that much of a mess rather she and the rest of my family make 95% whilst I contribute 2.5% \[the rest is mold due to winter and lack of heating in my house and my gutters not being cleared\]. Secondly yes, I don't get the best grades \[I'm a C or B range student so about 60-80 on average\] yet she attended school in the fucking 80s in another country \[she went to NZ for high school in the 80s, while I've been in the Australian school system for nearly 12 years\] and because she and alongside my two eldest siblings were A students she expects me to reach those heights. Yet she doesn't take in account I still have Autism \[personally for me sitting on my rear end for an hour straight is the most conducive for learning; I'm a physical learner\]. Thirdly I'm apparently lazy...well sometimes I do become complacent when doing things however rather then judge me by my actions she lumps me with my siblings; essentially if they screw up it all of a sudden smothers onto me \[note: I'm Polynesian, Polynesians are more collective/communal so that's where my mother's collective judgement comes from. And the worst thing of all her tirade and forcing me to clean was over mold that grew \[as mentioned before we don't have a heater and our gutter isn't clean so moisture is trapped in our house along with heat, which are conditions for mold to grow\].

When I ask them, they never say that I’m the reason they don’t want to pursue something, it’s always something with *them* or the circumstances. For example:

1. My HS gf cheated on me with multiple ppl and was in love with her straight best friend

2. My first college fling: Talked to this one guy for 2 months, things seemed fine, then one day he cuts me off because he has a new girlfriend….


3. Talked to this slightly older one guy in college on and off for a couple years before giving him a chance. We went on dates, texted, he took my virginity, and things seemed good for a few months…then he ghosted me/my birthday plans and cut me off because he had just gotten into a long distance relationship…this one hurt quite a bit because we were friends for a couple years 

4. Went through a series of short lived flings  after this. This period lasted like…a year

5. Talk to this one guy exclusively for like 9 months. He said he wasn’t ready for a relationship with me yet but wanted to date me in the future. His reasoning was relationship anxiety and the fact that he was busy with his new job. He would get super passive aggressive if I brought up talking to other guys. Every time I tried to tell him I don’t think were compatible he’d get upset and change his behavior for like 2 weeks before reverting back. Never asked me to be his girlfriend but we were exclusive, went on dates, bought eachother gifts….yeah. It eventually fizzled out and I moved away.


6. (Present situation) About 3 months later I move to a new city and start talking to another guy. He wanted us to talk exclusively too because “he doesn’t compete”. I’m not used to being told this so early on but I apprehensively went with it. We went on dates, texted constantly, would have sleepovers, he would kiss me at my doorstep and get sad when I fell asleep before him….yesterday we had another date/sleepover and he kissed me and dropped me off. 10 minutes later he texts me that he doesn’t think we should be a thing because he’s going to be busy with school, working out, and work, doesn’t feel romance with me, but was also afraid of “simping” for me (his exact words). This only lasted a month but I’m pretty bummed. I feel blindsided but also embarrassed. I feel like im just not worth pursuing something with.


….I would really like to be in a relationship and experience love but I feel like I’m incapable of being loved. I want to fix myself but I don’t even know what’s wrong because no one will be real with me. On paper I feel like I seem interesting: I think I look fine (scroll through my profile to see what I look like), I have a good job (I do research at a prestigious hospital), I have hobbies that aren’t just media consumption (hiking, cooking, crocheting), and I’ve always been told I have a cute/funny personality by people.

I also am pretty bad at my mother language, I don't really know why though. Maybe one reason is that my teacher never properly taught us the language and only made us memorize for tests, which is probably why my friends are also bad at it.

This is the message:

“Hi [her name]. It’s [my name]. I know it’s been years and you probably don’t want to hear from me but I hope you take the time to read this message. I mean it’s been a whole global pandemic since we’ve spoken haha. I hope you were well during that time. Even though it was years without being friends we’ve been friends more years than we haven’t been. I remember when we were younger we promised each other we would be best friends forever and maybe that’s a promise we can’t keep but I hope we can at least be on good terms. Maybe go to Costa or McDonald’s and catch up and who knows maybe then we’ll be able to be kind of friends again. I know that’s a big hope but I think we could make it work. I still think of you from time to time and wonder how you are doing. I still remember when we were little and used to play jailbreak on roblox with eachother and have sleepovers and go to [after school club we used to go to together]. Maybe things won’t be like that now we’ve grown up and apart. But you know we have one year left of school (unless we go to 6th form lol) then we have the rest of our life with jobs and college or whatever we choose to do. So yeah we might not have time this time next year to build our friendship. And right now it’s the summer holidays so I think it’s the perfect time to catch up. I hope you read this far and consider rebuilding our friendship. If not that’s your choice. But if you do want to feel free to message me anytime and maybe we could go to Costa or McDonald’s like I said.”

Then I sent a gif that says

“Have a good day”

Was this all a mistake? 

Should I have hit her up?

But, to be honest I haven't actually been happy in this relationship for quite some time. We have long distance thing going on for the last 2 years due to our colleges being in different cities. And for the last year I've been filled with insecurities and haven't been happy or able to communicate. 

When we moved to different cities, my girlfriend was quick to make friends and make a good and fun environment for herself. While I, being a loner, was barely managing to survive. Initially, I was actually happy for her and wished that she was able to enjoy her time as a college student. But slowly as she got more and more and adjusted to her life at college, I started feeling like we live in seperate worlds (which is kinda true I guess).

My girlfriend is incredibly trustworthy, loyal and caring. And I do not have any fear of being cheated on. But still I find it too hard to be in this relationship. I just don't feel like I'd ever be able to be a part of the world she has created for herself. Lately everything about her life there is starting to hurt me - the late night outings with her college group, the constant background noise of her roommates when I call, the constant buzzing of her phone when she comes to visit me. I've started ignoring her (not that I want to) and keeping to myself. I can't seem to have a proper conversation with her with me getting hurt by something or else.

I really don't want to hurt her and I really love her a lot. And I hate myself for having these feelings, I wish that they'd just go away. I don't what to do now.",lonely,"Its gonna be 7 years now, but I don't think I'm actually happy in this relationship.",2022-07-23 20:33:14

Mental health areas I have experience in dealing with or overcoming:

* Harmful relationships
* The meaninglessness of life
* Anhedonia
* Chronic insomnia
* Struggling with education
* Loneliness
* Body image and eating disorders

Other areas of interest that I can talk about (does not mean I'm knowledgeable but that I would enjoy it):

* Geography
* City planning
* Feminism
* Veganism
* Gaming
* History
* Sociology
* (SFW) Role-playing (in the sense that I used to Role-Play in World of Warcraft years ago but never quite let go of it due to how it formed the social backbone of my younger years and was something I really enjoyed. I've never done TTRPGs but the idea of being a GM appeals to me some.)
* Sustainability
* Hiking and the outdoors

1553,INeedDatingAdviceLol,1658560507,1,"For context, back in high school, there was this girl I knew from the local skating rink. I would go regularly, and she would be there a lot, so I wound up talking to her a lot, and we got pretty comfortable talking with each other. Some nights, we’d spend the whole night just sitting and talking to each other. It was really nice having that female companionship. 

I was very infatuated with her, I had built up this fantasy in my mind that of course didn’t reflect reality. As much as I wanted it to, it never worked out between us, she only saw me as a friend. Eventually, I stopped going there, and she moved away and got married and had a child, so that was the end of that.

I am 23 now, and have not had that level of intimacy with a girl again. I’ve had no girlfriends, or even close friendships with girls since then. I desire it badly and can’t get it anymore.

Anyways, I hadn’t even given her much thought at all in a while, until I had a dream about her this morning, I get these sometimes. I get to see her again, and I feel even closer to her in those dreams. Of course, I wake up and reality sets back in.

Before getting out of bed, I just cuddled my pillow for a while, pretending like it was her. It felt kind of good, but bittersweet, because there’s that nagging reality that what we had is forever buried in the past. I know this probably sounds so pathetic, I mean, this was a girl I knew when I was in high school after all.

I just haven’t been able to get her off my mind today, I keep thinking about her constantly. I looked at her social media a few times. It’s made me feel incredibly lonely.

I was fucking fine before this morning, I don’t even think about her that often.

I just feel so touch starved. I strongly desire female companionship like that again, it was a beautiful thing. It’s not just sex that I want, as nice as that would be. I just want to have an intimate loving relationship with a woman. I miss their soothing femininity, the way they can comfort you. I want to be able to cuddle, to hug, to caress, to fall asleep with. It’s something I strongly desire, and I sorely miss the kind of dynamic I had with this girl. 

Living life alone is hard. I am capable of it for sure, I’ve been managing all these years, I’m a pretty strong and resilient person, but damn, it sure would be nice to be loved by a girl…",lonely,Been feeling lonely all day because of a dream I had this morning.,2022-07-23 17:15:07

We’ve been doing marriage counseling and I’ve recently started going to individual counseling as well. I went into it hopeful, thinking that she just needed to work through whatever she needed to work through and I would continue to be here for her, and work with her.

I made the mistake of going through old pictures tonight and saw a few old snapchats I had saved of her saying “you’re so cute, I love you!” And things of that nature and instead of reminiscing on the good times all it did was make the hurt worse.

Hell, there's only one person I talk to with any regularity and she lives in another state and we might get a total of 30 minutes texting a week. It's been about 9 months since I've been around people and had to be social. I'm so incredibly lonely it hurts. I work from home so that just makes it worse.

So earlier this week there was some training that lasted a couple days and I had to go to the office and I could meet my other coworkers there. It felt really nice, but I think I got too excited and maybe was a bit too much and award and a tad too much self disclosure. I don't know how much of this is real and how much of it is just my mind messing with me, but I know I was a bit much. 

Since then I've had this terrible anxiety worrying about how I came off to my coworkers. I'm so worried that I've ruined any chance of even a casual friendship with any of them. I don't feel like I can address it with anyone, and I'm afraid that if I reach out to anyone and try to talk to someone it'll be awkward. 

I'm just sad and anxious and I have to deal with this weekend alone and I'm safe, but my mind is starting to the darker places that I haven't been to in a while.

However, when it comes to doing chores, or bearing any sort of responsibility, they fall short.

Extreme examples:
1. One of the guys in charge of trash neglected it back to back for 12 weeks straight this year, and blamed not being able to keep track of time as the reason/mental health, which I get, but I already set aside the option to simply tell me when they're too tired to do it. Not as big of a problem anymore, but I had to work very hard to make that an automatic process.

2. One of the guys I am friends with puts his current relationship (multiple since we've moved) above the needs/decencies of the people in our group of friends constantly. Instead of considering everyone in the situation, he'll often take the easiest and most beneficial path, neglecting those who it would affect adversely. 

3. One of the guys I moved out with moved back home to help with family, but left my fridge I brought with us in a terrible state (food in there has been there for almost 6-9 months, and I asked in November of last year to have it cleaned by December)


This is really the tip of the iceberg, and a lot of the time I'm at the short end of the stick, cleaning, fixing, helping them get jobs, not just shooting them information, but actively doing a lot of the work. 

Maybe it's my fault for moving out with friends. We get along great otherwise, I just wish they saw me, and tried more to actually contribute. It feels like everytime I need something done or help with house stuff, or things that affect us all, asking means nothing because it won't be taken care of.

1593,Sinister_Chopstick,1658549776,1,"So I think about how alone I am more than I should. And I'm fully aware that it serves me no good, but how do you stop? It effects so much of what I do and don't do.  For background, I'm in my late 30's, no kids, never married, single, and live alone.  I have 1 sibling that I do not speak to, and 1 living parent.  Oh, and I also thought it would be a good idea to move to a small, rural, middle of nowhere cornfield town which adds fuel to the fire from time to time. 🤷‍♀️

It's caused me to shift to a hyper independent mode.  To gather my own resources to make whatever I need to happen, happen. To make sure that I can do everything that needs to be done by myself because I have so few to no people that are willing and able to help. I rarely ask for help and have a hard time accepting help. And I get it...that's just being an adult and taking care of yourself, but I feel like the level I tend to take it to is an extreme.  Like, to the point I'll flat out tell people I don't need help when I clearly do.

It's caused me to cancel or talk myself out of so many things because I'm doing it alone...I will have no one to reflect on the memories with, so why?  I did take a road trip half way across the country several years ago by myself, and I really enjoyed it.  Wouldn't change a thing about it.  But the one thing that always sticks with me is having to ask strangers to take pictures of me in scenic areas, and when I was on this tour, laughing and having a good time and when I went to share the moment with the people on either side of me, they were strangers. I stopped entertaining the thought of buying a home a couple of years ago because why am I going to BUY more space to keep empty?  Why am I going to BUY a bigger place to be alone in? 

While I do have the luxury of doing what I want, with whoever I want, wherever I want, for however long I want to, no one else in my life does.  They're all married.  They all have kids.  It's hard enough trying to plan meeting for dinner with them.  Add to that, they generally don't invite the single girl to the family outings, or the plans with other couples.  Because I'm 1 and not 2.  Still friends with them, and still like spending time with them for that reason...but I don't have the apparently required counterpart.

The one place I feel comfortable going to alone is concerts.  I'll go to concerts alone all day.  And I do. I don't even invite people anymore. I buy my ticket and mention it to other people and if they want to buy a ticket for themselves, cool, maybe I'll see you there.

And the last piece is the romantic piece.  I've been planning the rest of my life as a single female for years. I've been going to counseling for a good amount of time. Which at a point in time had visible effects on my self worth, self esteem, self image, etc.  I felt confident, I believed I had so much to offer, I'm a great person, I'm a delight and it's everyone else's loss if the leave me behind.  So I gave online dating another shot. Terrible idea.  0/10.  Do not recommend. I now half heartedly believe all of thee above.  I can't help but wonder, when will it be my turn? I constantly hear how I have so much to offer, I'm independent and self sufficient, I'm funny, pretty, you know...all the generic good things people say. But I still walk away from it alone. Empty. And feeling worse than I did before. And my why piece to explain it all, is that it's me.  After all, I'm the common denominator in all the failed dating and relationship attempts.

1603,iknownothingxx,1658546398,1,"Or at least they’re the most important factor when it comes to whether people choose to like you or not. The deciding factor. Your personality can be a 10, you can be the most caring, thoughtful and loving person someone will ever meet, and it still won’t be enough. Not if your appearance doesn’t match their expectations or how they imagine (or hope) you might look. The fictional image of someone in your head made up of fantasies and wishful thinking. 

This is especially true when it comes to meeting people anonymously on sites like reddit. On Bumble or Tinder, you can go people shopping and nothing but their inner character is left to the imagination. And it makes sense. First comes attraction, everything else follows. Such is life. 

But what gets me is when someone claims they just want someone to confide in, a friend, someone they can be close with and share struggles with. A meaningful relationship. No, you want someone who can be your emotional dump and IF they’re attractive enough for you, then you’ll stick around and only then give them value. 

That love they claimed to have for you? Out the window. “You’re so amazing, i’m so glad I have you now”? Irrelevant. All the words of encouragement, empathy and support you gave each other? Might as well have never happened. All the times you sent each other paragraphs and lines of text that gave you both butterflies you haven’t felt in forever? Irrelevant! The hours spent on the phone feeling like finally, I met someone that feels like my person? No longer matters. 

All because you fell short of the physical expectations they had of you. That’s all it really comes down to, period. 

I don’t think i’m an ugly girl by any means. But I did make the mistake of drunk texting someone I met on here. Sent him some pics, some showing body parts I really shouldn’t have shown him. He completely switched up on me after this. Eventually stopped texting me back and now he’s MIA. 

Wow. What a humbling experience lmao. Either he wasn’t attracted to me or my behavior made him uncomfortable. I have a hard time believing the latter. Still, not even a courtesy “sorry, I don’t think this is gonna work” ? I’m tripping because I don’t even think i’m unattractive. And my tits might not be plastic surgery perfect but damn, i’m human lmao I’ve always had a nice figure but depression did some damage. Sure, I could lose a few pounds, it’s not hard, and I sure will now, but fuck. I’m sick of getting attached to people that always end up breaking me.

Meanwhile, I am watching all my former friends and most of my peers I have known growing up get married, have kids, or both. I feel like I am the last one standing. I can understand not having a wife at this moment, but never having an actual relationship? Really?

I seek a woman with the same inexperience as me. I am hoping me and a woman can be each other's first loves. I can no longer say me and a woman knew each other when we were young. That ship has sailed. In addition, I don't feel right giving my heart to the first time to a woman who has loved some other guy dearly before me. It doesn't feel mutual. 

I may very well end up alone the rest of my life. I don't know how to deal with this, especially because ever since I was a kid I always wanted and dreamed of a girlfriend, wife, and a family of my own. 

I feel I am having less and less common with my peers as they move into different chapters of their lives, forming marriages and their own families. I feel I cannot even relate anymore.

I have no real purpose in life anymore, no drive, no energy to do anything or go anywhere. just no real purpose in life anymore or drive. all online jobs I find require experience or skills I don't have or proof of, or require high school or ged. and they won't hire me. im slow at learning. needing to be told the same thing about 15 or so times to understand it and do it consistently for a month to remember it. most online jobs won't put up with that. and i applied to many and my resume is blank and empty. nothing to put on it now for like 15 years now. so idk. 

Also doesn't help I live in a very small town with no public transport and no way to get anywhere and haven't left the house in almost 9 years because of it. 

feeling like ending it tonight is the best and only way out of this life. as of right now, just laying here listening to knocking on heavens door by bob dylan and remembering the 4th of july with that woman in iowa when we hung out all day on fourth of july, then that night went to the lake with her family, hung out all night, walked hand in hand around the lake and then had our first kiss that night. which just felt so right. just making me think i will never have that again with another woman ever....

im seeing so many people who have partners and their partners treat them horrible and its like how do they find women and then treat the woman badly and the woman stays and here I am a decent guy and get called a piece of trash or worse because of my issues and get abused hard by women or rejected hard or put in the category of being a *nice guy* just because when they treat me horrible I call them out on it or called an incel. 

I just don't get it anymore. im to the point that this is what my life is meant to be and im not meant to exist anymore. lost my parents when I was in my early 20s have no other siblings or family. just don't see a reason to keep going. what little friends I had were streamers i met when I would stream and because I stepped away from them they turned on me quickly and acting like im a monster. only stepped away because I got tired of the drama that was always floating around with them. 

I have never been loved or wanted by anyone. last time I was touched or hugged by anyone was that woman who gave me the stuff I can't get rid of. might as well have herpes at this point or aids. been tested thousands of times all come back clean but the yeast.  last time I was hugged before her, was when i was 27 before that i was 15. what is the point in living anymore when I don't even love myself anymore after everything. 

Idk anymore. maybe its best I don't survive the night.",lonely,41 m about to end things so tired of living.,2022-07-23 07:48:24

The people I used to casually spend time with have stopped talking to me. My best friend became increasingly unavailable until he also stopped speaking to me altogether. I've been living with my family and they want nothing to do with me--to the extent that my mother will literally interrupt me while I'm talking to her to call someone else, and no one gave me any information to visit her in the hospital after her hip surgery. My former coworkers pointedly excluded me from things like office lunches. At this point there are literally two people who give me a second glance--and they're my new roommates who spend all of their time together without me. 
Being alone (and lonely) are pretty normal for me, and I've never really had anything resembling a support system. It would be one thing if I wasn't putting in the effort to keep in touch, or to be supportive and reliable, or to be understanding and patient. But I try really goddamn hard. I check in. I give people space if they ask for it or seem to need it. I find events in town and invite people. I talk to people at bars and grad school events. I volunteer. I offer to get coffee or play games online or do literally anything. But nothing works. Folks don't reciprocate or respond or show up; they cancel and give apologies and then never follow up. I'm truly at a loss here. Even using online spaces like this normally result in me comforting others while receiving nothing. I can't count the number of posts I've made on reddit and in forums--in appropriate spaces--that never received a single response. 
I've tried for years and years to be okay with being lonely. I invest time in my interests and hobbies. I'm deeply passionate about my work. I do the best that I can to manage my depression and OCD, etc. When I do get to spend time with people I try my best to be open and present and mindful of their needs; if I need to set boundaries I do so politely. But the truth is I desperately need and want people in my life. I want someone to check up on me or invite me for drinks. I want to be a part of someone's life and to share my life with them.

1661,Awkward_Big_1742,1658518328,1,"Hello fellow redditors! Hope y'all are having a great day so far.

Life is an emotional rollercoaster. A bunch of highs and a bunch of lows, hills and valleys. Sadly for what feels like the past 2 years, my life has been stuck in the deepest of valleys I've thus experience so far.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend last year blocked me and completely cut off any contact with me last year after us being on and off again for the previous year and a half. Don't get me wrong, my ex was emotionally and verbally abusive and was not healthy to have around so there is a silver lining.

&amp;#x200B;

However since then, I have had no luck with finding a suitable partner. Closest thing I have gotten to a relationship was recently when I visited some online friends in another state. There is one in particular I have a crush on and I ended up sleeping over her house for the weekend and we had sex. Things felt right with her. She does not want a ldr which I respect.

Her and I stay in contact and message each other, but I find that our conversations tend to die and dry out fairly quickly. A great part of it has to do with me. Continuing conversations and maintaining a good flow are skills I am lacking in and causes me a great deal of stress.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, I feel as if I was wittier and comedic. But in the past year, I feel like I have lost that part of myself, a part that attracted the friends I have today.

&amp;#x200B;

My crush would send short replies to messages or just not reply to them at all. When this happens, my negative self-talk thoughts emerge. Such as me being a horrible conversationalist and not helping the conversation flow to a point where we can expand on other subjects. As mentioned though, I am very unskillful in this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared I will not be able to build a meaningful relationship. I'm scared of being alone forever. It doesn't help that I have a lack of social life in real life and tend to spend most of my time playing games with my friends online.

So growing up I was not a very good kid by any means and i caused everyone problems growing up, I always wanted things my way and I wanted to fit in no matter what especially in secondary school (I'm from the UK)

fast forward to when I was 15 I met this girl, kinda rude like me, funny, cute and realistically out my league if I'm being honest but still she came and asked me out imagine that lol I was skeptical but she was genuine and for a while we were happy and and she got me to open up more than anyone even did, we were together for around a year until I found out about how she cheated on me with 2 other guys which ofcourse devasted me but I quickly broke it off ASAP, I took it pretty okay considering and after 3 months I was getting back on track with my life but also I lost trust in most people and in that time I had lost most my friends,  I also got some pretty bad lovesickness, I missed it because I'm only human so I had hope I could meet someone again and I went out my way to talk to girls and try find someone again and with no luck

A year later I posted on reddit when I was feeling really lonely and this girl messaged me saying she wanted to be friends and so we spoke for a few weeks and she asked to call which we then realised we live around the corner from each other so we arranged to meet, usually meeting someone really shows if you click with someone and most people don't but we hit it off straight away, she was so kind and sweet and buvbly nothing like the girl before,  we met up a few more times and eventually I asked her out and we got together which yes is a pretty happy ending until now, a year and 8 months later and she broke up with me, found someone else a month later and stopped talking to me all together, she was so different to me yet loved me so much and I never understood it, I never thought of myself as a good person and yet I felt like she changed me completely and she just didn't feel the same anymore which is okay.

Fast forward 8 more months and I'm all alone, lost the remainder of any friends I have and my depression is at its worst it's ever been and I don't understand, Is this what I deserve? Why is it that everyone leaves? I haven't gotten over it like last time but I'm not sure why and I used to be okay alone and now it hurts like hell, can anyone else relate? Will it ever pass?

I fell madly in love with a girl 5 years ago. We had an amazing year together but things ended rough. We both had issues we needed to get past before we could be with someone, luckily we ended up able to be friends a few months later.
She’s been my best friend through thick and thin since then. We’ve seen some of the most ugly and the most beautiful parts of each other’s lives so far. Needless to say I’ve been head over heels for her since we met and that still hasn’t changed.
We have both been in relationships since then but somehow we just couldn’t shake our love for each other so they always failed. 
She told me out of the blue she’s in love and how he’s a great guy. She finally shook free from the chains our love had been for her. 
I’m happy for her, I desperately want her to be happy. I just wish I could have been the one to do it though.

Fortunately, I had very great friends at the time, but once I came back to Japan, I can’t talk with them like I used to do. Moreover, I will leave Japan in a few months due to my work….

I always got ghosted but I have to be honest they didn't mean much to me so whatever. but obviously loneliness is still extremely depressing. this year I made the best friend I could ask for. through reddit by a post I made about how depressed I'm due to loneliness. she was so nice to me and caring. which no one has been like that for me. it was the first person I've ever felt that I'm so scared of losing. like I can not live without talking to her and it was such a scary feeling. over time (we talked for months) I developed feelings for her. I never thought I'd love someone this much. you ever have a crush on celebrities? everyone does right? if I could have the love of anyone, like literally everyone on earth, I would still choose here. I really don't think I will ever love someone that much its impossible. anyways, I didn't tell her directly. but I guess it was so obvious and she found out recently. sadly I couldn't hide my feelings. and you already know what happened. if you ever make a friend the same way please don't make the same stupid mistake. sadly all those insecurities are really unattractive. no one wants to be with a loser. its a harsh reality. I really didn't expect it to ever work. I'm a realistic person. but ngl it hurt a lot. I can never blame her. you can't control who you have feelings for. you can't force someone to like you. but yea definitely will give up on this. don't see myself ever loving someone like that.

But I still remember to have a ,more less, happy life until the age of 14. That summer my older sister tried to kill me and left marks all around the body. I became obsessed with scars and I felt depressed for the first time. My father didn't do anything, ANYTHING to my sister. He has always had a huge preference for that snake than me. My mother instead is my rock, she's very loving but is heavily influenced by my sister. She has convinced her that I'm the bad one and that she should outcast me. Since that moment all of my life went to hell. I left one year to study abroad and it went HORRIBLE. When I came back home cause of COVID, everything had changed. I wasn't a child anymore. These two years have been very tough but I ve been able to tackle them somehow and I ve had good grades. 

The problem comes that now my ""sister"" (I don't consider her to be that) is in a very expensive university and has decided that my parents must kick me out. For like 6 months she has done everything as possible so my parents hate me. Inventing things, making up stories, re telling the past... She's so ambitious she wants , the few things I ve got, I can't take anymore. I ve stopped talking with her and my father but it still goes on. My mother suffers a lot.

F23 and have severe social anxiety. I'm afraid to speak to people and I don't know how to make friends. I have a very bad relationship w/ my family. My mom openly hates me and my father refuses to speak to me. 
Almost 2 years ago I moved for my masters degree. I don't know anyone, accept for 1 person, but later on that. That was my first in person semester and even so I didn't manage to learn anyone. I don't even a single persons name. Everyone else seems fine, they all have their friends circle at college and can communicate with other students, accept me. I don't know how to start speaking with anyone and no one seems to ever notice me anyways. It's even harder for me because it seems they have great time without me and they would be happier not knowing me.

I have a job. At work I'm the youngest person by far. The only other student at my office ist 28. Because everyone is much older i can't find a topic to speak about. They speak only about spouses, kids, sometimes about weddings and vacations. It also seems to me that they not really interested to speak to a much younger person. I'm looking much younger, so everyone, who doesn't know me assumes I'm an intern from highschool, which I'm not. The other student just fucking hates me. He always says to me and other coworkers how blank, uninteresting i am,like it's my job to entertain me. He tries to bully me every chance he gets. During break i try to eat alone so I don't need to deal with him and other people don't seem to care if I'm not there. It even worse because that student is bad doing his task and so I always need to make my and his tasks. I get everything done on time somehow and usually better than him. He got so used to that that he even blames on me that I didn't do some of his tasks, which he said he would do on his own.

My dating/love life just sucks. I never got asked out or something. I never been on a single date. If I try to do the first step i always get rejected, sometimes even before I managed to do something i got rejected. Guys often tell me the reason why they never would date me. It comes often to not being feminine enough or being just ugly. It's very painful for me to hear, because I usually don't ask. They just come up to me and say how ugly i am and gonna die alone because of it. 
For several years i even avoided my crushes because I knew I never had a chance and that that would just hate me. When the pandemic started i was even glad , because now no one needed to deal with seeing me. 
When I was 22 an guy in his late 20 tried to rape me. Luckily we didn't ended up having sex, but he sexually assaulted me by kissing and inappropriately touching me. Sadly that's how I had my first kiss. It was very gross for me and I couldn't sleep or eat for a few days and puked even a few times.
A half years after this incident i somehow got an online friend it turned out he was attaining the same university and was living near me. After knowing each other for a few months he suggested to be fwb.  I thought that no one ever would be interested in me. I actually had some feelings for him and I thought it was my only chance to get with someone I like. At first it was nice. But later it developed into a very big mess. Im madly in love with him, but he has no feelings for me at all. He started seeing other people and started bragging about it. I could deal with it so I confessed my feelings for him. He said nothing at first. A week later he decided to have a talk with me. He said something upon that it's more than just fwb, but he doesn't want to label it and that anyway Im just someone to have fun until he graduates and moves into a bigger city, where he ""could meet more ppl and have more sex partners"". I was very sad. I understood that it's not a relationship, but I didn't think that I meant so little to him. After that he sometimes would treat me nice and say that he likes me, but it feels very forced, especially if considering that 2 weeks ago he said he doesn't like me and doesn't see a future with me. We are still ""together"". It's convenient for him and I can't really go because I'm so afraid of loneliness. I still wonder how it went so far, considering my anxiety. 

A month ago there were a few events at my college and I decided to go to one of them. I could do it. I went to it and right before entering I saw a couple people having a good time and got scared. I immediately run away and started crying. For some reason it stressed me out a lot, so I cried all night. 

I'm in therapy for few months. I have a reccuring depression for a very long time with suicide attempts. My last attempts where because I'm feeling very lonely and useless as a human being and everyone would be happier if I never existed in the first place. Therapy doesn't help me with anything. But at least I can speak sometimes to someone.

Sorry this one is very long, but in short i don't manage to get to know ppl at school, i don't get along with my coworkers and even get bullied at work. The only person I know and could speak to (accept my therapist) is someone who doesn't care about me and just uses me for sex.",lonely,I'm socially incapable,2022-07-22 22:04:53

1723,wizards_fix_pls,1658488117,1,"May 2019, I was in highschool, I was socially awkward and isolated, and deeply connected with a girl who had similar feelings. We talked every day for, spent multiple days a week with each other, and we started dating September on the day year of university. I was not fit to handle a relationship, so she broke up with me, but continued to text me every day venting about her life from early January to early March. I cannot understate how constant and ridiculous that was. For example, one day I woke up at 3 am to hear this girl ramble about her favourite TV series for an hour, or I was there when she brought home her beloved cat as an outlet for excitement. When Covid-19 hit and I pulled a plug on that “friendship” for being toxic to me. I did not respond to being in isolation and the end of that well, and I don’t know how I was supposed to.

Years passed. I have changed a lot, but I still remember both the person I spent a summer intimately and pure from the pursuit of romantic relationships with, and the girl that HAD to be in my dms every night post-relationship until I pulled the plug on that. I attempted to reconnect with her this year (I’m intensely socially deprived), and had 2 deeply 2-hour long conversations with her this year - ones I thought meant we were still intimate though distant. But yesterday, after receiving consent for me to ask something of her, I told the prevailing circumstance that led me to being deeply isolated and unmotivated, and asked her to give me a bit extra consideration for someone she spends her free time with. I was immediately regarded as “new connection” she doesn’t have time for, and “someone she’d only do that out of pity for,” to which she doesn’t have the energy for.

Hiding the tears and brushing away my past

Lying to myself that itll be alright

Playing league all night to prevent the mirrors sight

Making no friends to help me on my journey

What is the reason? I'm not a shrink by any means but for the past years I had to do a lot of hard digging in my fucking ugly self... And I probably think that I got it... I think , not sure though... I feel extremely... EXTREMELY , there you go , i wrote it in capital letters so you know that I very much mean it... Extremely Unworthy... Unworthy of love ( I never had a girlfriend who hanged out with me for free ), Unworthy of someone's friendship, just not a pleasant human being, physically and mentally. When I go to the gym, I never say hello to anyone, especially if they are groups of friends working out together... I feel like I bother them, I feel like I'm in the way... There's this girl who's working there as a receptionist, we salute each other have a small chit chat, but tonight, she was out for a cigarette , talking with some other dude, so I didn't said anything to her, because I felt like I was in the way, I felt like it would bother them... When I finished my work out, she gave me a rude look and it was perfectly understandable. I hate myself, I hate the way I am most of the times... I tried to talk with my elders about this,but... They are folk from other generation... Their advice? Just not be that ! Ok, how ? How am I suppose to go about it ? I love my parents, but sometimes they piss me off with their ''encouragement'' they always tell me that I have potential... STOP Saying that ! I don't have any potential and if I did had a bit... Fuck knows how am I suppose to use it! Do I want a change ? Well, here comes the trouble... I don't think I want to change, there's something in love and friendships that scares the shit out of me... I don't know, since young age I always thought that I would struggle alone and die alone. Yes, those were the thoughts of an 4 year old kid... Live and die alone, why should someone give a shit about me ? I don't have nothing to offer... In regard of women... Well, there are plenty of gorgeous men,smart men, rich men... I'm nothing of that, never will I be either... I fucking accepted it long time ago, I can't even be mad at this point... for potential guy friends? Why would you hang out with me ? You got a nice car , you got a nice wife a great life, you pull your weight splendidly in business and everything else you set your mind to... I think you should hang out with people your caliber. So yeah , love and friendship... Why am I so terrified of these things? Normal people would love to have, I sure had few of those before fucking everything up... I don't know, is just... Just... Solitude is comfortable. Not having to answer to anyone, not having to worry that your loved one may replace you, not having the pressure to think you might let someone down ( I should burn in hell in agony forever and ever for how many people I let down ). Solitude is just... Easy. Easy to do, easy to understand and sticks with you, sticks with you till' the end, with this approach? No one ever will knock on your door to make friends... And even if they do, I will probably won't answer. There are remarkable people out there who broke away from it... Broke the vicious cycle, but I don't own such a beautiful mind, total opposite. Yes there been rejections over the years... Yes, I had plenty of people saying '' You ain't worth a shit ! '' , but that's not an excuse... You should never allow bad experiences to influence the outcome of your life. But me? I'm just so comfortable with it. Ok, so what the fuck is this exactly ? You would probably asking yourself right now... It is NOT a cry for help. I'm not depressed. I just needed to write down my thoughts and feelings... I am 200% responsable for my loneliness, I deserve it and... And I love it, as fucked up as that is. Change is never easy... But you need to wan't that change sincerely for that to happen. I say this because maybe there are people stuck in such place as I am but they are most definitely better than me and wan't to improve their life. I wish you a good luck from all my heart, and If you want that change... You really have to mean it !",lonely,A life of solitude,2022-07-22 13:21:07

I do believe her on this because since getting to know her I’ve learned that if she wants to say something on her mind she will.

But since cutting her out I’ve been missing her more than I thought possible and I’m fighting the urge to start talking again but I feel like I’m losing massively. Since having to cut her out my family life has gotten worse along with other problems that keep cropping up and I feel like I’m struggling. All I want is to bring her back into my life because I genuinely do care about her and she made me feel like being myself wasn’t such a bad thing. Seeing her made me happy and she told me that she liked me for who I was.

Looking back I never had friends until high school, I was to “weird” or to “noisy” or to “crazy”, from kinder to maybe the first half of high school when I choose to suppress my self and become someone I wasn’t to make friends.

All that for nothing, I don’t speak with none of my high school “friends” no more, and maybe better this way, we didn’t have much in common anyways and when I let out the real me by accident they always found the way to make me feel bad and shame me.

After high school I tried collage for I while and I tried to start fresh and be myself, I made a few friends but after I left we didn’t keep track.

Is right after that that I joined a choir and I felt truly happy, I was finally with people that were like me and we had things in common and made good friends, and a girlfriend that I love, she is the love of my life.

After a few problems with the administration the choir was done for and we all parted ways, I tried to keep in touch but some left the country and others live really far away from my and I’m not a big text guy.

I talk everyday with my girlfriend but sometimes we get angry at each other and then I have no one to talk to about it Or she gets invited to her friend’s and it is in those times when I feel truly like I’m not worthy of friendship.

She even try to invite me to her friends reunions but I guess they don’t really like me cause they say no.

I just go to work and then to my house and sometimes I go to private singing classes but other than that I don’t do anything that can help me meet people and try to make friends nor I have the time to.

I’m not suicidal but I fear that if this keeps on going my mind is going to suffer and then I’ll be jumping off a building or something (thats a little on the paranoid side but I’m paranoid so yeah).

I’m no perfect but I’m not a bad person, I try to be kind with others, I just want to have friends to do stuff or do stuff or speak about stuff or anything. I don’t want to be lonely anymore.

Is it just me or is it really that hard to find people that are not judgemental or is it that hard to find people who dont thi ks the internet is full of creeps? There are some weird people online for sure... but some just want to feel less alone... like me.

As a 25 year old guy I always struggled finding people I click with... to be fair I never really went looking.. but lately i really felt alone and not accepted in society as I imagined I was ... I try to talk to people. Make new contacts but one way or another I'm not good enough.. may it be my looks or where i come from. That fact my english is not always as good as i wish it to be..

Sometimes you start the wonder... Am I not good enough for others? Or am I i to chubby or to skinny ??.  Is it because i have a disorder.. or because i look funny..?

Man... when i hear my parents talk about hoe life was back in their time... they made friends on the fly... and people of my age don't seem to be able to do it anymore... ... its frustrating:/ All i want is to make friend.

They always say there is someone for for everyone other there.... maybe the other person didnt receive the directions pointing to me... hella sucks
What i really try to say is that i try so hard making new people and actively chat with others just to be forgotten 1 week later... its not fun.



Is it just me or can everyone relate?



I know people feel the same and i want you to know that you are not the only one who feels that. Alot of us feel like it. All of you people deserve to find nice people to hang out with...

I'm tired. I'm sure you are too. After all, loneliness is the most terrible poverty there is. But, hey! I wanted you to know you're appreciated. It is important to hear it, even if I'm just a stranger.. I've had countless restless nights where I wished someone hit up my phone and told me those words, so I hope it helps. Know that I'm proud of you.   


On another note, my mind won't stop spiraling.. it hurts. The thoughts, the emotions, the numbness.. existence. I know it does, and I know that whomever you are reading this have felt this too. You're not alone.   


My DM's are open to anyone who wants to talk. I don't imagine I'll be able to sleep tonight, so don't hesitate to reach out to me. You may even pretend you've known me for years if that brings you comfort. :)

Yesterday, I had a date with a lovely girl. She seemed great, we had lots of things in common, and a similar view of life. She seemed to enjoy our time spent together! And, I got ghosted when asking for a second date in the end. I understand that nobody owes me anything, but, it hurts a lot. The thing is that I can't cry. My body doesn't seem to allow me. I am just dull now. I guess I just wanted to say this out loud. I tend to keep everything to myself(I am a guy) since, from experience, people don't seem to care about your problems and they even distance themselves from you when you have them...Anyway, I hope you have a good day at least!

1897,ladylavenderrrr,1658407437,1,"This has been going on since elementary school it seems. I remember it all started in about first grade when I tried making friends. I was successful in doing so, but I had two separate friend groups. One was a group of preppy girly girls who liked talking about girly things like makeup and perfume, that kind of thing. The other group of girls (3 or 4 in each group) were nerdy and liked books and science and stuff, and I remember one of them pretended to be a horse at recess. Yes, horse girl lol. This lasted from 1st-6th grade.

Anyway, I would teeter-totter back and forth between these two groups, not knowing which to hang out with at lunch and recess. I would always lean more towards the nerdy girls, but the ""popular girls"" would beg me to come to play with them or eat with them because I suppose they liked me? I never felt like I fit in with them though and always felt like an outsider, but they still wanted to be my friend. I never understood why because I wasn't anything like them at the time. Yes, I like makeup and perfume now, but I wasn't obsessed with them as a kid. I liked video games, reading, and other ""nerdy"" stuff way more. I also remember when I had a Myspace, I put a song on my profile by the Strokes and one of my ""popular"" friends was like ""ew what is this? here I'll change it to Chris Brown."" I didn't like nor like Chris Brown. 

I drifted apart from the other group of girls who actually liked me and probably would have stayed wonderful friends with me. One is a veterinarian, and the other is a math professor. Go figure. The other girls I'm not sure what happened to. But it makes me sad because here I am, at 27, and still don't have a solid friend group or people I can truly call my best friends. I have two close friends and they don't know each other so it's definitely not a group. I see people online all the time in huge friend groups and it makes me sort of jealous that I don't have that and never have. I've had several friends here and there throughout my life, but none that really stuck with me. I sometimes wish I could reach out to my old friends (nerdy group) and see what they're up to. They were true friends at the time and never made fun of me for what I liked because we liked the same stuff.

I go everywhere alone. Shopping, bars, the beach, walking around new cities, concerts, etc. I don't mind most of the time, but I get so fucking lonely, and I always wonder what is wrong with me to where people can't stay my friend. I'm always being used as well. I had this one friend who only hit me up so I could bring her places in my car, and she literally never hit me up unless she needed something. It sucks to be treated so disposably and I don't think I'll ever have that ""group"" that I fit in with for the rest of my life. Doesn't seem to be in my cards.

I've been lonely my entire life. Well I had a lot of friends in middle and high school. Even might've been considered somewhat popular in those days. They dropped off one by one after graduation. I'm sure a lot of you know how that goes. I've never really had a relationship, not a serious one anyways. When I was 20 I went to a jobs training program called Job Corps. There was this girl there who I thought was one of the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen but she started dating one of my friends in there. They stayed dating until graduation. I saw they broke up on FB a couple of years later.

About a year and a half ago, maybe a little more, I just gave up on life and started doing drugs. A lot of drugs. Whatever I could get my hands on. I've done hard drugs since high school but this was absolutely suicidal amounts of drug use. I genuinely don't know how I'm still alive, maybe I'm cursed. Maybe one or more of my organs are fucked and I am dying. I couldn't bear being alone all the time anymore. I was wanted to die but wanted to try having some ""fun"" before hand. About 6mo later (or however long it was, I've been fucked up this entire time) the aforementioned girl gets ahold of me on FB. Guess who's town she had just moved to? Out of nowhere. From the other side of the state. Mine.

We start talking on FB. Then we start hanging out. She says things to me I never would've thought I'd hear come out of someone else's mouth. Things that were like I said them. I've never felt like I related to someone else so much in my life. She's everything I ever waned but never thought I could have. Everything. In the body of what might be the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. And she's interested in me for some bizarre reason. And this all happens when I am literally at the lowest point in my life. Cause I'm cursed 🤣. I say that hyperbolicly, but really, what are the odds?

On top of being totally hooked on at least two things at this point, of course, I also have really bad social anxiety. So I up my drug use even more due to that. I'm somehow able to keep shit together for the first 2-3mo. We get closer. Really close. Closer then I've ever been with anyone in my life. She starts implying that we could have a relationship. For those 2-3mo, or maybe even more, I was truly happy. I even spent a handful of days willfully sober. I felt like I was finally happy to be alive. But there was still the anxiety. I tried spending time with her sober once but I could barely carry a conversation. So I decided I needed to stay on the drugs
 In fact, I needed more of them.

And then I fucked everything up. And then I fucked it all up again. And again. And probably another time or two that I forgot about. I'm too embarrassed to say the things that I did but let's just say drug amplified anger and depression were the causes. It was nothing illegal like assault or anything mind you. Just other kinds of things that would make you want to get as far away from someone as possible. And she is. She's moving back to where she came from in October. I know, I'm not really cursed, all these problems are my fault. But, even without the drugs, how long would she have kept talking to me if I couldn't even bring myself to say me than a few words around her? Now I'm back to being alone, in silence and darkness. But now with the knowledge that I could've had this. I could've had the person I wanted more than anything in the world, virtually perfect to me, but I fucked everything up.

I know a lot of people are gonna tell me I should pull myself out of this hole and work on myself. But I don't see the point. I know who I am and I know how my mind works. This ugly, horrible regret will never leave me. I've been This way for 27 years. If I could change, how long would it take? Another 27? More? It's harder to fix something than it is to break it and my entire life has been spent either being broken or breaking myself. Maybe I get better when I'm 54? After another 27 years of loneliness? Of feeling empty inside? 🤣🤣🤣 Nah man, I think I'm probably good on that. How do you even get better while living like that? When I feel like my jaw is wired shut cause I never have anyone to talk to and I start talking to my apartment walls just so I can say something. Or having conversations with my old friends from high school in my head about how my day went or things that are going on. Which, now that I think about it, are probably gonna turn into imaginary conversations with her from now on. 🤣🤣🤣 This shit is bleak. 

The only reason I haven't done anything stupid is because I don't want it to hurt her. Idk how long that will last.",lonely,I don't know how to live with this. (27m),2022-07-21 18:31:57

as that why should i be trusted to do anything else. and in all honesty my life isnt even that bad but i just have nothing to do and for some reason the only thing that i think will make me feel better is crying but i cant so im just stuck in this melancholic state. i just need summer to end and then maybe i can find purpose again and have a good crying session.",lonely,i just need to say stuff,2022-07-21 18:07:34

She was a very negative depressed person and eventually I had enough and my ego took control and fucked up whatever was left of our relationship. Despite all her faults she’d comfort me in my worst of times and I failed to comfort her in hers. The last time I reached out to her she told me she wasn’t interested in talking to me as it hadn’t been enough time since our split. It’s a really long story but I believe her father has had a heavy influence on her leaving me. Her father decided she was important after 15 years of neglect. Had her move 1000 miles away so it’s safe to say it’s been over. I guess that feeling of loneliness is truly terrible. I feel like true intimacy is something that’s such a foreign concept to me. Previous relationships I’d bounce back by now but I don’t know if she left me with mental scars or if I’m just depressed because she was the first genuine person I lost in my life.

This loneliness is present everywhere,
don't have any close friends to talk to, I’ve never had any friends,
never talked to a girl in a romantic
manner and I don't feel loved by parents.
It's been eating me alive especially
whenever I talk to someone, I start to recognise that I never had a childhood. I was the guy that never had a girlfriend, was never in school group chats, never noticed by others unless I ask for other people to acknowledge my existence. In my household I wasn't allowed to leave the house to do anything so as a result I was never invited to anything, I also wasn't allowed to purchase game consoles for a long time - so even online friends wasn’t an option. For a while I spent time endlessly binging one tv show to the next but recently it’s been harder to engage in one because I feel this looming jealousy- especially when there are romantic subplots. I’m aware of how silly it sounds, but it doesn’t just apply to film/tv even in real life it’s seems my insecurities have formed some form jealously that is triggered whenever I see another couple or a group of friends. I can’t help it.

It’s also getting really hard to hide my loneliness because I try to never mention it and I’ll even lie about it something but when I’m questioned by others they’re able to work it out and start looking at me weird thinking that if  he’s  so lonely he must be a shitty person, I don’t blame them because I understand their thought process.

I’ve been writing as a hobby to keep myself distracted but my work doesn’t seem genuine - I can’t draw from any experiences in my life. I’m even surprised myself how someone can go 18 years without any human connection or intimacy.

I sometimes get suicidal thoughts but they’re all a bluff because I could never do it, I’m curious to see if I really am destined to loneliness.

I'm a 20 year old male with autism and while I do not like to blame all of my issues on an illness I feel that it is safe to say that many of my problems can be traced back to it. Even posting here makes me feel anxious, I have issues when it comes to irrational fears as well, so anytime I post something online for people to see it worries me, for very irrational and stupid reasons I don't really want to divulge. I don't know if I am making any sense, but I'll try to improve as I go along. I feel like most of the time when I try to say anything, especially as a post or in paragraph form it turns into word soup.

Recently, I have been estranged from all of my previous connections due to my worsening mental health situation and I feel very ashamed, however many people I knew were also quite harmful to my health as well. I did have one good friend but I lashed out at him for some stupid reason and now he won't talk to me. My only friend I have right now has an issue with isolating herself whenever she is dealing with her own problems and it hurts me a lot, because she is my only friend and I really appreciate her company, but it feels like she never wants to be around me, and I worry that I did something wrong.

Most of my past friends have either become extremely mentally ill as we started to grow up, turned out to be awful people, or just hate me or they regard me very coldly. I am terrified of making new friends online, and the last time I did, I could not connect at all, or I end up feeling very drained. I am also a NEET which contributes to the shame and embarrassment I feel all the time.

I am terrified of going outside, for the longest time I have only begrudgingly gone outside as well, because whenever I do, I get people that look at me as if I am some kind of predator or serial killer, or people just treat me very rude for no reason. Sometimes I worry that it's just me... but then I try again to leave my house and it happens again. I hate sounding whiny and ""woe is me"", but this is very difficult and it makes me want to die. I don't hate anyone, I don't even hate the people who have wronged me. I just want to be appreciated for who I am.

Yet somehow the loneliness is what hurts most. 

Like I think I am alone since I was taught to hate myself. I think I look normal on paper but looking at my reflection I feel contempt. 

I fear trying to reach out. Once forced to talk I am alright at it. I’m weird but not to an alarming degree. I’ve dated before but with the depression being the worse its ever been I don’t see how it was possible anyone thought they loved me. How anyone was my friend. 

I work from home so I see literally no one on a regular basis. 

I enjoy none of my hobbies anymore. 

It’s hard to want to try a dating app or anything because of insecurities. 

I honestly don’t care about sex. Due to work haven’t done it much. I just want someone to care about me and for me to dote on. To enjoy things with. 

I can’t explain how hard it is to do that when with every action my inner voice goes, “why try? You’re afraid to talk to them. Shut up. You’re intruding.”

I’m , and I have no one. I have nothing.

I recently graduated high school. All of my friends from my days back in school ended up stabbing me in the back and they stopped being my friends. 

I don’t have a partner, (I have a medical condition that causes me to have acne and be overweight), So obviously I wouldn’t be able to find someone to be romantically interested in me. 

I have no friends, no romantic partner, I have no one. All I do is work and come home and sit in my room. Thankfully, I love my job and I’m super happy when Im there but, the second I get home, the reality sets in. 

I have no one that cares about me. I could literally disappear and no one would notice. I just want to have people that care about me. 

I know I’m a good person, and an even better friend. But everyone always ends up leaving. Every. single. time. I just want to be loved. I’ve never had anyone that truly cared unconditionally about me like I have cared about others. 

I have severe anxiety disorder and my interests are rather on the quirky side. So I have little to no chance to just find myself into another friendship. 

It’s heartbreaking knowing that i’ll probably never have a romantic partner or a best friend in my life. 

I just want to me happy and cared for, because i know that I will care unconditionally for someone and be there for them whenever they need me. 

I’ve just been used my whole life. I just want someone to want to be friends with me for me. Not because they have no other friends, or because I will give them money. I just want a pure relationship with someone.

1986,sinn333,1658365176,1,"I lost my heart when I was very young.
I fell in love with a girl at school and never told anyone.
We were in the same classes all throughout grade and middle school and when we both graduated we had grown to be good friends.
Even after finishing school we spend much time together and we shared many intimate thoughts and dreams.
I was a friend to her and she was a love to me.
The years passed as we both grew older.
While she often told me about dates and her ever changing relationships, I didn’t have similar stories to tell.
She never rejected me, I tell myself, and still I’m a broken man. It’s a stupid way of thinking about my life, nevertheless I’ve gotten used to it.
After all my heart wasn’t taken from me, I gave it up willingly and it disappeared.
Nowadays I don’t know what to do with myself.
Of course I have an intense longing for Love, having never experienced it, but the idea of being loved also feels distant and impossible.
No girls have ever shown their interest or much friendliness towards me.
My isolation leads me down a path of self destruction and I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to change course.
It’s a shameful thing to admit, but on New Years, my birthdays and when I see shooting stars I always wish for love, as I’m quite desperate and hopeless.
A wonder would be a welcome solution.
I’ve seen such wonders happen: on a long bus ride to Italy a girl approached a friend of mine and within a couple moments they fell in love. 
I’m scared and rejection would kill me, as I have already been rejected by my father.
This must have left marks.
Never being able to open up to my childhood love must have left scars too.

Typically after the 2nd date i start to notice the texts taking longer. Getting one word responses like lol nice or lmao. Just took a girl out on our second date. We were really vibing for weeks now then at the date I started to feel that “this isnt going to go like you want it” feeling. Honestly im just waiting for the ghosting. It happens every time. Its starting to eat away at my soul. Ive always been taught to respect women and treat them like i would someone to treat my mother or sister and i do but i guess its just not meant to be. The pain of putting myself out there just be thrown away like trash is hurting less and less with each girl. I started working a job i hate because the hours are long so that means less time to be alone with myself and breaking down because i feel like I’ll never escape. I know my problems start from my childhood when i was bullied so badly i never made any friends until high school. And late high school like junior year. And now im a junior in college. I played football as a kicker and would stay after school and kick for hours just to decompress and let the pain out. It hurt so much being all by myself. I trained for so long i got a scholarship to kick in college which im so blessed to have happened. I thought the loneliness and single life was behind me. I was so wrong. My freshman year was no different then high school but i wasnt going to let being lonely hurt me anymore. Then it happened. Met a great Christian girl with great priorities was on multiple scholarships for community service and she took me I thought my pain wad being rewarded finally. Then after what I thought was an amazing date and the perfect and most romantic way possible to ask this girl to be my girlfriend, took her to a wildlife refuge, her favorite thing to do, we walked around on the trail cracked jokes held hands then I decided to ask her out officially. 
I never thought this level of emotional pain was real. Worse than any other ive felt before
She told me that she wanted to break it easy to me that she found a better guy than me, im not perfect far from it but that hurt to my very soul. She told me i didnt have to take her home. Her new boyfriend was on his way to pick her up. 
When i got back in my car i drove off just out of visual distance and just stayed there in my car. I was so heart broken i could feel some tension in my chest. Felt like something was ripping in my chest near my heart. I stayed there crying, i couldnt tell you what was hurting worse my chest or my self esteem. I wanted to get even with her. But i cant hurt a friend or someone i used to call friend. I decided to go back to what i did in high school. Find something thatll take all my time so i dont have to think about being lonely 
I changed my major to chemical engineering with a minor in petroleum engineering industrial engineering and chemistry. All that to not feel alone. It was working great but then i met a new girl. Just transferred in. Knew noone and was looking for someone to sit next too in class. We ended up hitting it off really well went on a date and about a week later she invited me to her house for a party with some of her friends. It was fantastic loved every second. After the party we just laid outside feeling the cold 2am breeze as we watched the sky taking about the james webb telescope and betting on what they would discover next. She crawled on me and finally we kissed. She kept pulling me in and it one of the happiest moments for me. Went on the 2nd date. Where things always go wrong. I thought it could’ve gone better on my part but she assured me I was doing fine. After the date she went home to study so did i.
Im getting the feeling again that im going to get hurt soon. I want to fight this feeling but its never been wrong.

None of them like me. My old friends from back where i used to live have all completely forgetten about me. They come to visit the city where i live every few months but none of them have ever asked to see me even tho they know i live here. Im so lonely. Im so fucking lonely. I have no one to talk to. I bottle all my emotions up and cry before sleeping. Im on summer break right now and it hurts. Everything hurts so much. Seeing others have fun with eachother, going out, hanging out, makes me feel like such a loser. I’ve tried to approach people but it never works. God i just feel like such a fucking loser.

2022,happy-alone03,1658351755,1,"I'm a 19 year old (almost 20) male from Brazil.

From the age of 13/14-16, I had only a goal in my mind: to get a girlfriend.

I talked to a lot of girls but all of them rejected me. I thought my physical flaws were the problem (I'm a short guy and I don't like the way I look so much), so I decided to forget about getting a gf and I started a ""self-improvement"" journey. It was exactly when the pandemic started.

I started to read useful books, started exercising (running and started going to the gym when they opened back), start learning how to code, started training my communication skills (on Discord groups focused on that, they are really useful), started taking care of my appereance the best as I could, learned english (the only thing I could say was ""Hi my name is X, how are you?"" - and now I can write this full text without a translator - it's not perfect, but WAY better than what I knew), got into a good university and this year I got a really good job at a good company etc.

If you compare me to who I was before the pandemic, I'm almost another person - and I'm way happier. I'm really satisfied with my life, I like the person I'm and my life in general, and, to be honest, **that need to get into a relationship is 100% gone - not only that, but I think if I was in a relationship rn, it would only bring me problems.** Me being single wasn't the problem. The problem was that I didn't took care of myself and didn't have a good self-esteem.

I even was approached by girls 2 times last year (both at my friend's brithday party), but I just didn't feel like it, I just wanted to stay there and celebrate it with him and other friends. My friends when they discovered started asking if I was gay or what was my problem.

And here comes the problem: everyone now is trying to push me into some relationship. Here, around the age of 16, everyone has a partner already - and I'm turning 20 and never had one. 

My parents never talked about this, but this last month I heard they talking about it. They were asking themselves ""when is he going to turn himself into a man and get a girlfriend?"", my friends (all of them have gfs) make jokes about me being single all the time, my aunt was shocked last week when my mom said to her that I never had a gf, and the funniest situation: my grandmother in the nursing home, when I went to visit her in March, asked if I had already found a girlfriend. When I said I wasn't into it now, she looked disappointed and called an employee there who was my age. She said ""look OP, she's your age and she's single! Ask her her phone number!!"" - It was pretty awkward lol.

I have so many things going on in my life, so many projects (I'm making app with a friend, studying/working a lot, preparing to run my 1st marathon in november etc) and goals that honestly, I don't think that right now it's a good time to add a ""relationship"" into this whole situation. Maybe next year, but not right now - at the same time, this pressure from EVERYONE is really annoying me, and, to be honest, I'm starting to feel embarrassed.

Never do they even notice me forget about them talking to me or etc. I have tried talking to them but i refrain myself from talking to them anymore because i can see the amount of difference between their way of talking to me and other guys. I can see their total lack of interest when i talk to them.

I used to be an ex-incel in high school. I stopped hating them when i realized that it's totally not their fault. Everyone wants to be with the best person they want to be with. I also saw how my mother married to my dad who abused me physically, emotionally and did not even help our family to become atleast upper middle class. I realized that it's better that women don't get attracted to loser guys like my father since their children would have to suffer (i did).

I'm trying everything that i can. I've been going to the gym but i know gym can grow muscles, it ain't giving you a handsome face. I actually used to be a good looking guy when i was young but as i told, with the constant abuse from my family i fell into depression, anxiety and so had to take psychiatric meds which altered my physical appearance drastically. Such is my luck lol. My luck has failed me so many times that i never view anything optimistically anymore, which also further strengthens my belief that i can never attract women that i like.

Hypothetically speaking, even if i became good looking after training at the gym, i would neither have the confidence to approach them nor the money to keep them happy (I will have 0 inheritance since i'm thinking of cutting ties with my father once i get a job). So i've accepted that the cosmos has not given me the women card and as such i should really forget them. Realizing this has also made me feel more hate towards women (since i feel that i can never experience that love and experience that other guys get) despite realizing that it's 100% not their fault.

Went from 450 lbs to 300 in about 9 months since I got put on suboxone and Cymbalta, been doing great mentally, no relapse, no cravings, and I'm going to university this fall. I'll have my own apartment, nice place, truck, and I've got my confidence and outgoing personality back I used to have prior to when I started to use.   


I'm not too worried about finding someone at college, it will be a bit strange being 22 around a bunch of 18 year olds, as I'll be a freshman too, but I'm sure it'll be fine.   


but since getting sober, I've just felt this overwhelming loneliness, like I've a hole in my heart because I don't have a relationship. I've had a few chances, but they wouldn't have been healthy relationships so I didn't pursue. But since getting sober, man, it's been rough, real rough.   


I find it strange, too, because when I was using fentanyl / heroin / pills, I never wanted a relationship and never wanted kids, in fact I was ""anti having kids."" Few months after getting into MAT (medicated assited treatment), I started to want a family, find a woman who is good for me,  me good for her, and to enjoy life together and maybe have a kid. White picket fence type thing.   


Strange because I've always been more of a rambler, but now that I'm sober I feel the desire to find a woman, get a job, and settle down with her. It's been eating me up. Not in a bad way, I still enjoy my day and hav eplenty of things I'm doing and people I'm hanging with, it's just this urge.

Basically, I feel like I'm just a straight-up failure at life. I had so much potential. Such gifts.
I was in the gifted program in elementary school.
One of the most attractive girls in my grade asked Me to prom.

Now I'm a 27 year old virgin who's been in one relationship that lasted 2 days and one other that lasted maybe a month or so. I've gone on about 5 dates outside of those relationships. Ever.

I don't know how to meet/talk to those I'm interested in. How a relationship is really even supposed to work. I waste all my time on video games and my porn addiction and can never get myself to do things I know I need to or things I used to enjoy. (Maybe I'm just lazy. My psychiatrist indicated I may have ADHD to go along with my depression and anxiety, but how much difference does it make?)

I didn't get  accepted to pretty much and college I wanted so I chose a college because it was Cheap. Now I work a stupid boring office job. At one point I thought by now I'd have a place and situation where I could dress and behave how I wanted, but I'm living with my parents (partially because I get too anxious to function when dropped into a new setting with people I don't already know.)

I'm one of the submissive creeps who basically want a partner who will be their mommy, so the number of people I'd be happy in a relationship is even less (though I'm aware the perfect person doesn't exist and I need to make compromises and commit to someone real).

I have this stupid Idea stuck in my head that if I want a more dominant partner I need to let them make the first move and ask me out, but even that might have had some success by now if I was willing to (or even knew how to) meet people and/or flirt.

I used to hate myself, but it's gotten to a point where I'm too numb for emotions as strong as hate.

My  reasoning was 'I must not be trying hard enough - I'll double down'.  When you double down enough times you end up in a hole you can't crawl  out of.

I am trying to let you go,  as much as I can. But I still can't. Your messages brighten my days,  and the lack of them darken my nights. And cutting off completely seems  too painful right now. Maybe tomorrow, or the next day. Or the next day.

However, I occured to be in a group (or perhaps more like an association) based on the ideal of a friendship that was so true and genuine that it was almost impossible to find anywhere else. Honestly, some of theme were actually pretty good friends, but with most of them I tried to take the most care possible with those friendships, despite not always receiving something back. 

Time passed, in 2020 I also managed to bind with my current best friend, who wasn't actually in that group, and also kept advising me to leave, but whatever. By the way, I feel like I've chosen to be friend with him: he's two years older than me, we don't attend the same school. I could and still can end the friendship with him at any moment, but I don't, and that's what gives value to this relationship. 

Flash forward to January 2022, I was 18, my best friend got COVID. He eventually was good, but that meant that during his quarantine I couldn't rely on him. I was alone. I also stopped eating for more than a week (for the first time in my life I wasn't overweight). All those friends, my relatives, all those relationship that, in the end, I've never chosen, were a lie. I've basically never had a real friend but him, and now I'm alone. I promptly left that group, just to see how almost no one asked me where I was.

2064,-Living-Dead-Girl-,1658323579,1,"today i told my only friend to get the fuck out of my life. 

he treats me like a joke.

 i'm intensely lonely, and very open with him about my struggles with it. yet he spends all his time hanging out at cool parties with loads of his other friends, always at some kind of event, always with people. he hangs out with me a lot too, but he wont ever invite me anywhere with anyone else, he wont introduce me to people. 

he's not only entitled (never been told no, gets childish and loud when something doesnt go his way) but he's constantly yelling at me because he expects that everyone gets things as easily handed to them as he does. he's gone on multiple capital letter rants at me about how i ""wont"" get help and ""wont"" go to therapy, since for him it's as easy as walking into the hospital and asking for it. he wont listen at all when i explain to him that i've literally been trying to get help for 7 years and that not everyones mother works in the mental health ward. 

he's constantly getting involved with different social groups whenever he gets into a new thing. uni, diving lessons, stripping, music school, wrestling. every time he gets involved with a new group, he literally just ditches me for them. i stop seeing him, and he spends all his time with his cool new friends. then when he leaves the group or things fall apart, he's back hanging out with me. 

he always ignores the things i say, rolls his eyes at me and ignores me. but then if he hears the same thing from someone else, suddenly he's telling me about it like he didnt ignore me saying the same thing a few days before. my suggestions are stupid, my opinions are stupid, until someone else says them, then theyre great. he has a habit of copying what others do and think, he becomes extremely into the hobbies of all of his other friends. but if i even suggest doing something or attempt to so much as speak about anything i'm into, i'm either ignored or stared at like i'm the cringiest loser in the world. his other friends have even told me they see this about the way he talks to me compared to everyone else.

he's always literally insulting me and then glossing over it when i point it out. for example: sometimes i tell him something, like something i do or think or have. and he'll laugh, tell me how dumb it is, give a reason for why, and then literally low key insult me by telling me something like ""that's what you get for not finishing school"" or something else insulting my intelligence. i'll then send him either a screenshot or a link to an article, explaining how his reasoning wasnt correct and i'm actually right. and he will literally just not respond to it. like, ever. he goes dead then pops back up with something completely unrelated, like he didnt just literally insult me for something he was then proved wrong about??

a few months ago, after a particularly hurtful insult aimed at my intelligence, i told him i don't like being insulted, and then just stopped responding. he made multiple posts on snapchat and facebook about me being a bitch and ignoring him for ""no reason"" and then blocked me everywhere. i wasnt bothered and just left it like that for a while. then i started to feel bad, and started thinking that maybe he really didnt realize he was being so hurtful. so i sent him a very calm, well worded message, just detailing how i feel. i made extra effort to not word it in a way that could come off as an attack. this started a very slow back and forth messaging for a while, where it became apparent that he doesnt see anything wrong with how he treats me. he literally admitted to treating me different than his other friends, but tried to make out like it's a good thing? like he called me his ""anchor friend"" which to me just sounds like justifying treating me badly? i dont want to be a backup friend, i dont want to be treated differently than everyone else. ive had enough of that my whole life im fucking done with it. 

so my last message was just saying how i don't want to be thought of as different than everyone else or used as some kind of ""anchor"", and that i wasnt interested in continuing a friendship where i didnt feel valued. i said goodbye.

would you put up with this treatment if it meant having a friend?",lonely,is having a friend worth giving up self respect? (long),2022-07-20 23:26:19

In fact, through solitude we can discover many wonderful issues about ourselves!  We don't have to go through some silly and childish drama for no reason.  We can do all those issues that we supposedly do with friends or acquaintances by ourselves! You want to go to the cinema? You go by yourself and you can experience a cool game by yourself. You want to go for a walk? You go with headphones on or a book in your hand to read in the park.  Want to go to a café? Go ahead!  Of course, someone might say that spending time this way with another person would be much better! But would it? No one will be able to understand you more than you yourself. We can be lonely in a certain way with a feeling of a certain emptiness, but deep down be happy and go through life as an observer to a certain extent. To experience everything in our own way. Some people prefer a life of solitude, while others just want to find one or two people who can understand us.  Many people supposedly have a lot of friends, acquaintances and boast in those on social media, but are they actually always with them? In the tougher moments when things are not ok? Or are they only there when you need to go to a party and everything is ok?  

&amp;#x200B;

If you are comfortable with loneliness then ok! If you want to find someone who understands you then I wish you meet someone on your path who will not superficially judge you, but will understand who you actually are.

So, i've always had a really big fear of being abandoned which has brought me to the point of not wanting to make friends because they've always abandoned me in the past.

Anyways, i had a best friend, which has now abandoned me to stay with someone else and now we barely do anything together and he probably knows me better than anyone in this world, but he still decided to abandon me without saying anything.

I had another friend, which i thought would never abandon me, but apparently to him i was just someone to take from since i always offered myself to help him in any way possible, and now that he can't take anything from me, he has abandoned me.

I also had a third friend, for some time i thought she was the first person that really was my friend and that could be one for the rest of my life. She has love bombed me for a month and a half, then she stopped.
But now i feel like she barely texts me if i'm not the one texting her. And the little she texts me i think she feels forced to do so because she knows how lonely i am. I feel like i'm such a burden and that she just got bored of me.

I think i have to come to terms that i'll be better off by myself for the rest of my days, but it's so hard not to have anyone when you once had people you thought loved you.",lonely,i feel abandoned,2022-07-20 17:00:47

She was able to stay a night at my house before a party and we made the most of that day. We baked, we watched movies, and I got to watch her try Skyrim for the first time. I'm admittedly on the shy-er side of being social but she's someone I'm really comfortable with and so I was able to ask for a few hugs. One of them sticks with me. It was one of the goodbye hugs before we went to bed. It felt personal to me and that night I cried at the thought of having to say goodbye for potentially years. I miss her. I miss her hugs.

I am 41, never had a regular job. only day labor jobs that destroyed my back, knees, from 10 years homeless and working on farms and ranches doing manual labor. 

I am 41, last girlfriend i had gave me a bad yeast infection I can't get rid of because of health reasons. and that lasted a month in person. before that it was 5 years prior to her, the woman before her faked her death on me twice and would call me while having sex with her husband and turned out to be married. the woman prior to that was back when I was 27. spent 9 months skyping, talking sending messages and emails and actual letters in the mail to one another and i moved to iowa to be with her and in a week she cheated on me with her ex and dumped me at the local town fair. 

I am sitting here listening to music trying to get lost in the music but getting lost in my own head/thoughts. idk what to do anymore. I tried getting my GED but because of my learning issues and such I struggle really bad in getting it. have to work from the 3rd grade up to 12th in every subject. and I struggle remembering things because of my mental issues and illnesses like my ptsd. 

People don't want to hire me because of my weight, women won't date me because of my weight or the fact im on disability. I just dunno what to do anymore. I have no real purpose in life anymore, no drive, no energy to do anything or go anywhere. just no real purpose in life anymore or drive. all online jobs I find require experience or skills I don't have or proof of, or require high school or ged. and they won't hire me. im slow at learning. needing to be told the same thing about 15 or so times to understand it and do it consistently for a month to remember it. most online jobs won't put up with that. and i applied to many and my resume is blank and empty. nothing to put on it now for like 15 years now. so idk. 

Also doesn't help I live in a very small town with no public transport and no way to get anywhere and haven't left the house in almost 9 years because of it. 

feeling like ending it tonight is the best and only way out of this life. as of right now, just laying here listening to knocking on heavens door by bob dylan and remembering the 4th of july with that woman in iowa when we hung out all day on fourth of july, then that night went to the lake with her family, hung out all night, walked hand in hand around the lake and then had our first kiss that night. which just felt so right. just making me think i will never have that again with another woman ever....

im seeing so many people who have partners and their partners treat them horrible and its like how do they find women and then treat the woman badly and the woman stays and here I am a decent guy and get called a piece of trash or worse because of my issues and get abused hard by women or rejected hard or put in the category of being a *nice guy* just because when they treat me horrible I call them out on it or called an incel. 

I just don't get it anymore. im to the point that this is what my life is meant to be and im not meant to exist anymore. lost my parents when I was in my early 20s have no other siblings or family. just don't see a reason to keep going. what little friends I had were streamers i met when I would stream and because I stepped away from them they turned on me quickly and acting like im a monster. only stepped away because I got tired of the drama that was always floating around with them. 

I have never been loved or wanted by anyone. last time I was touched or hugged by anyone was that woman who gave me the stuff I can't get rid of. might as well have herpes at this point or aids. been tested thousands of times all come back clean but the yeast.  last time I was hugged before her, was when i was 27 before that i was 15. what is the point in living anymore when I don't even love myself anymore after everything.

I had to start working at a young age to help provide groceries since my father didn’t want to help support my family. He was either off cheating, doing pills, smashing things, and yelling. Sometimes he would throw knives at me and sharp objects. Threatened to kick out my mom sister and I to out to start a new family. But he tried to act like father of the year to his family and everyone believed him or excused his behavior. Even when he would force us to family events and my mom would have a black eye. 
I had to act like my moms husband and be her emotional and financial support. Also for my sister. I was ashamed of my life and grew up in a suburb with the normal families. Which fathers cared for their children, didn’t abuse them, and could just be kids. I had to grow up fast. I was bullied in high school and had really bad anxiety and depression with home and social life. Studying and grades were my only saving grace. I worked hard to get a good scholarship and leave for college out of state. Before I left for college, my father smashed everything in the house because the tv wasn’t working and called me a dumb bitch because I didn’t call the cable company fast enough. Even though it was maintenance going on. He was always very sexist and would belittle me because I was a girl. I then ran to the next train and haven’t spoken to him since. I still had to help give money to my mom and sister. It was taking a toll on my providing for myself and two other people. We had a big fight and didn’t talk for a month. During that time, she reconnected with a childhood friend that was also veing abused by his wife. They bonded and soon started to date. I don’t blame her. I always wanted my mother to leave my father to find a man that actually cares for her. I then found out my father began trying to choke my mother in her sleep and she knew one day he was going to kill her. My sister had to intervene and go on his back and stop him. Finally after another morning of abusive, she had the courage to call the cops and they arrested him. She now has a restraining order against him and he is facing a criminal trial soon for assault and battery. My sister is living at my aunt and uncles which she is happy with since she always liked my cousins better than me. She always put me down and the only thing that made her like me was money. We don’t talk now either. The only two people I have left in my life are my mom and her new boyfriend. I’ve know him my whole life and he’s very sweet. He’s been more of a dad to me than my sperm donor ever was. But sometimes I get treated like a third wheel with them. I do have my maternal grandmother but she is very sick and is more hostile since she’s gotten older. I have done well academically and financially. I have a good paying job and made some cool friends. I’ve also been trying to get into the dating scene. But I get scared because of my past. No one would want to be with a girl like me and my baggage :( my depression and axienty has been even worse. I feel inferior to people with normal parents. Like I’m the kid people don’t want their children hanging around because I’m from a poor and abusive household. I still carry that mentality. I do have one friend who knows the truth about my life and can relate since her parents are the same way. 
My problem is that I told another really close friend of mine about my past and I don’t want them to look at me any differently now. I regret it so much. I really hate myself.

Because of that I slowly drifted away from the people who I was close to, and have become more introverted. I just want people who I can laugh, cry, vent, and mess around with again. I can’t remember the last time I had a normal ass conversation with someone. 

My parents were always strict so even if I ever got invited to things I could never go. Eventually watched the people who I considered my best friends(not sure if we’re even friends anymore) move on from me.

My friend has issues with alcohol and she promised me she had a handle on it. Her mom took her daughter and told us to enjoy the day. So we went out eat dinner walked around and she told me she wanted to go bar hopping. That was my first and last mistake. By the first bar she was already cut off. She started running away from me she hit me and told me I was nothing which I can handle fine. The last straw was when she got 2 separate people to hit me because you told them I WAS ABUSING her!! The person that has stuck through all her bullshit, all her mood swings and everything else abused her! I never ever raised my hand at her. She knows more about me than my own family more than anyone!! I opened up to her to have fuck me over constantly. Not to mention the fact that she never even apologize. I gave up and called her mom to help find her because she had ran away again, once we found I drove her car because she was still to intoxicated to drive. When we got to her moms house she ran to her room. My luggage was i her room and I had decided to getting a hotel room would be best. When I went upstairs to collect my things I saw her slumped over with red covering her. I knew what it was she cut herself with a knife. I jumped on top of her throw the knife away. Her mom and her refused to go to the hospital because she of her daughter so I stitched her up and bandaged her wound. And even after everything  she fucking cut herself and she blamed me for that too.

My family are awful to me, not in a directly cruel or intentional way but they just say these little things that whittle down any self respect or confidence I may have.

I live in a rural nowhere town with people that are so foreign to me culturally that there’s very little chance of making any kind of connection. There aren’t group or hobby events to attend, no library’s to visit, no coffee shops to go to. Nothing. Just nothing. 

And I’m trapped here. Trapped in a place I hate with people I can’t relate to. Trapped in my mind that seems to seek to destroy me in spite of its own self preservation. Trapped in a family whom I’ve never really felt loved by, only seen as a pariah. 

I want to cry. I want to to scream. I want to pull apart my flesh and dig for a piece worth saving so I can hold it up and say “look! I did it! I’m not a waste after all. Do you love me now?”

I’ve noticed it’s getting even harder to find someone these days, I’ve tried dating apps, approaching women in shops, cafes, parks, libraries. I’m not ugly, but not really a stud either. I’m not too short either (169cm). Not full of muscle, but not too skinny either. What’s the problem? Is it me? Am I a turn off? Or is it women’s expectations? 

I dress fairly well, have good hygiene, I’m polite and respectful, I’m also confident approaching women.

I don’t go out much anymore because I hate seeing couples laughing and having a good time. It just really hurts. It feels like I wasn’t destined to be in a relationship. It’s done a real number on my self esteem. I see ugly guys with girlfriends and it angers me so much. Or assholes who don’t deserve to be in a relationship.

2166,NoCrazy2045,1658275569,1,So I am almost 16 and when I tell people that I feel lonely and that I want someone they normally say something like “you are too young to be worrying about that” which I partially agree with but there comes an age where you need another human affection. I’ve never had a girlfriend or had my first kiss or even hugged a girl before so my friends make fun of me for that so that makes me feel worse about it and I start to blame myself and ask why am I so ugly or like why am I so annoying so no wonder people wouldn’t date me. So like a normal teenager I would compress those feelings until I’m crying at night and then try to drown out the feeling of loneliness by playing video games. Instagram and Snapchat don’t help it  especially hurts when you see your friends with their girlfriends and you just feel jealous and then the loop continues of trying to drown the feeling out and then going on snap and feeling jealous again so I just end up listening to sad songs while in the pitch black in my room. It’s frustrating I want someone to hug and make memories with and feel comfortable around so I can be my real self and she will like the fact that I’ll be myself I mean obviously I want to have sex but it’s not like my main priority I just want human touch.sorry for the venting.,lonely,Almost 16 yay :/,2022-07-20 10:06:09

i don’t really mind that too much but it’s the making friends in person that is weird. i don’t ever go anywhere one would find friends at. bars and stuff aren’t my thing anymore since i sobered up, and sobering up has also stopped me from using alcohol to get past my shyness. i’m now just a raw unfiltered version of myself that’s still scared of exposure except i’m looking for real people instead of just company. i’m rambling at this point but i guess i tend to get into my own head a lot during the summer, and i’ve been spending an awful amount of time alone. i really should be sharpening up some hobbies and skills with this spare time. but getting to know people seems more fun. my biggest problem has just been maintaining relationships, god knows i’m awful with housekeeping.

Some are unrelatable, have a bad understanding of mental health, not very empathetic, and expect way too much of me in the conversation. They are extremely active in their hobbies and interests, they cannot believe how uneventful my life is.. They cannot believe that I have nobody to talk to.

2190,TheAverageSpaceTroll,1658266492,1,"Hey everyone just joined this subreddit, and since I can't sleep I might put my thoughts in writing on here

Little background, I am 22 year old neurodivergent guy with my baggage never really had a relationship and the one I had I was emotionally abused and sexually assoulted. This was 4 years ago ish, and now 4 years later I have tried getting back in the game

Now to me trying to get back into dating, I know some are gonna suggest therapy and shift but not really an option due to some reasons I won't disclose. But I also know I need it in some ways, but I have managed until this point so I think I will be fine as I worked through the most of it. Trying to get back in the game is hard wherever I go I never seem to find anything, and the times I try to open up cause I feel like it's time to start building something deeper due to them feeling right they leave. And yes it might seem like a pattern when they leave as I open up, but I am have never really gotten to a point of very deep. It's more like I have just started scratching the surface an nothing more, but yes there is a possibility that it is me and not them but I worked through most of my encounters and I feel like I haven't done anything that should warrant them leaving. 

Either way it feels like no one my age is ready for for an emotional connection and everytime they leave when I try to open up they leave. And it hurts and gives me this massive hole of loneliness and every time it gets harder to open the massive steel gates to my heart as after every encounter end with me picking up the pieces of my heart. Like what happend to romantics what happend to people wanting something real, what happend with people wanting to get to know the other person without having to jump to bed first. I view the issue of jumping to bed right away as a reason alot of relationships end quite fast as they let their brain do most of the work with hormones until it works it doesn't work anymore. And the then relationship either lives or dies with that, and yes I could probably do this but it leaves me open to world of hurt as it could go both ways. 

Well either way sorry for my rant, just needed to get some shit off my brain. Hopefully one day all of the people in here will find that someone that makes them not feel as lonely anymore.

2204,S1fat,1658259781,1,"So this happened a while back, and honestly everytime I go back home from college, being in the city reminds me of the good times and amazing conversations i had with her. I met her for the first time in ninth grade. She got quite popular in school cause she's an all star military cadet who even took part in my country's republic day. Honestly till date, i pray that she gets what she wants, despite the shit that's happened between us. 

After ninth grade, she moved to another city, but that actually got us to know each other better and get closer. It really was beautiful. Then we didn't talk for two years because her mom kinda took her phone and monitored every aspect of her social life. Fast forward two years ahead, i get a message one fine day""Hey"". And well guess what? She came back to my city! I honestly missed talking to her so much. Although she was dating atm, and i didn't really bother much, we met up a few times and had a great time being in each other's company. Everytime i see her smile, it makes me feel good about myself. And it's odd because I'm really not that kind of a person.

Eventually she broke up. We used to talk here and there but one fine night, she asked me "" Do you wanna video call?"" I was like sure. We were talking about realtionships and stuff and it came to a point where I asked ""Did you ever have feelings for me?"" And she said yeah she really liked me back when we used to talk in ninth before her mom took her phone, and said she missed talking to me. It became such a natural moment that I asked her out. And she said yes.


Day of the Date

God she looked absolutely breathtaking despite all the tear drop marks on her face. All i felt like doing at that time was to give her a hug and tell her it's okay, I'm here. We kept walking in the mall, I asked her what she wanted to do. Eventually we decided on eating Chinese. We sat at the table next to each other. At that moment, all I wanted was her. I asked her if i can hold her hand, and she gave a smile and held mine. Just being in that warmth was a feeling I never felt before. I asked her how many dates have you went on? She was like this is my fourth. Then I told her this was my first date. She said this is the happiest she's been in a long time and told me I'm really special to her. After that it was just pure Netflix/Hollywood romance, holding hands in the mall, doing crazy shit in a toy store, seeing a side of her I've never seen in a baby cloth store. It was just magical. We smoked cigs after that, and sat alone in a park. She opened up to me about all the things that happened to her, the trauma and shit that could've been avoided, but told me she's happy to be with me right now. I honestly just wanted to kiss her at that moment but I thought it'd be too soon cause she'd just broken up and I wanted it to be natural. 

Her mom is simply adorable and she loves having me around. She's honestly more like a best friend than a friend's mother. You can talk about anything with her, she's a very kind and jolly personality. And it's probably one of the most beautiful mother daughter relationships I've seen. 

I started to cook noodles for the two of us, and she got her camera out and started to record me, it was kinda cute. Then she started playing music. The first song she played, Like my Father by Jax. I had kept my guard up all evening but at that moment, I knew I had started to fall for her. If there's one thing I wanted at that moment, it was just you dxeee. 

We decided to go on another date next week, but then i had to leave early for college. A week later, i see her Instagram, an adorable picture with a guy she was dating earlier. And guess what? The dream was just over :) 



TBH, it was hard for me, has been hard for me and everytime I'm back home, i think about it. About what could've been and how much I wanted it. But life has its ways to make us learn. I just hope she's happy with the guy today.

I’m not really socially awkward or even introverted really though I can be terse if I feel too disconnected. Anyways, without a life, I noticed people I do meet seem to find me all the more peculiar. Sometimes it’s with intrigue but like I’m a total enigma, like I don’t make sense somehow or it’s obvious I have “no life” . There are basic small talk questions I can no longer answer without them seeming complicated : 

“What do you do on the weekends?”
“What do you do for fun?”
“Have you been to xyz club?” 
“Can I get your IG?”
Even a fucking “what do you do for a living?” gives me an existential dread because I feel so disconnected from the life I’ve lived. 

Sometimes I feel like the only solution is to continue meeting fellow aneurotypical “weirdos” like myself as we might be able to understand each other’s alienation because at this point, being around people who have active lives , regardless of how generic and superficial they might be, have become to strange for me to talk to . 

I hope it gets better y’all but damn this loneliness feels like an abyss. Can’t make friends with guys because most just either explicitly or secretly want to fuck ; can’t make friends with females because they all have their lives established and aren’t desperate for friends like I am.

2227,duskywired,1658251165,1,"I live in a South America country, in a city with \~ 180k population but I just don't have anyone I'd want to be/hang around with. There's a friend of mine who lives in the same building and who I've known since childhood but I don't really like to talk to him because he's homophobic and sexist and has a religious and capitalist view of the world.

As a matter of fact, most people here is either sexist, homophobic, transphobic or racist or all of them, since it's a relatively small town in a predominantly christian country. There might be other kinds of people who are as diverse and as respectful as I would like but how to find them? Most people seem only interested in showing themselves off in social media and everyone's already got their group.

Considering I enjoy being around other people, laughing with them, having a good time, that is, I'm a social being just as much as anyone else, and that I need to take care of myself first, finding a group and interacting with others is part of that process. But I don't know where to start, what to do.

Anyway, I feel I have to prioritize myself above all right now. I'm still struggling dealing with my own thoughts, feelings and my identity, since I was deeply psychologically abused/censored just about my entire life.

I just can't stand people who don't respect others for being/expressing who they are.

And well, I'm in my late 20s which makes it all even more difficult as almost everyone that age (at least here) is having kids and you know, following the scripted life they've been programmed to. And even if I looked for younger people to be around with, I would just come out as a creepy dude (due to my clumsy ways and the way I look and talk) and thus would be rejected.

There's also this: online interaction is not what I'm looking for. I've been trying to use internet sparingly because I've had online addictions my whole life (in fact that's one of my main issues).

So, it feels like I'm in a tight corner, with no one and nowhere to turn to. And I feel really really lonely...",lonely,I don't have anyone to be around,2022-07-20 03:19:25

I now suffer from suicidal thoughts and have a history with self harm. My mum left that house after I turned 18, I still lived with her and did not recognise her abuse as abuse as well as believing that she was my only way to escape. 

After we left she made it apparent that she was leaving because of mum saying that as well as telling me that me cutting him him off was ""destroying the family"". I've always been scapegoated for everything wrong with my house. My defence mechanism was rebellion and anger issues. 
When she left she went through a variety of mental health crisises and I had to support her through them like her Councillor. 
Recently I've been uncovering what she did to me, I have no support, my family is pressuring me to play pretend and my grandmother is actively communicating with this abuser to get them back together again. Now because I cannot forgive my mother she is planning to go back. I've been trying to protect her, doing anything I could to stop her, she has been told by mental health professionals not to go back. 
I can't play councillor anymore, I'm dying, I feel like I am just barely alive, I've escaped that house but everyone is trying to drag me back. I keep researching narcissism to see if I'm just responsible, for everything. I feel so betrayed by her, she kept telling me she was on my side, that she believed it was abuse now she is victim blaming me again. 
He has a history of violence, he was arrested for assaulting a police officer when they came to question him about his abuse, I was manipulated to take back the charges because I expressed to my mother that I thought I ruined his life when he returned I was made to apologise to him, I was 16. I was treated like a monster, like the worst human to live, could I be a narcissist? Is my anger and my reaction to her actions over the top?

For me I often... very often feel like the place i'm in is worth leaving behind, I don't have much tying me here, and all i have is old memories of youthful failures, I hate the area, its all so empty here, I own a small house which I don't care for and could sell, there are only 2 people that I consider close to me, My dad and brother so in essence I know I could take the plunge and be quite content but... its the feeling of being alone, I don't wanna just be alone all the time and if my adventure ends up in more loneliness I don't think I could take it, but if I don't get out of here I feel I will be here like this forever.

Where as If i took the chance for adventure, I fantasize that I might just meet ""Hopefully"" my future partner who is all about the adventure and escaping the loneliness also... lol it's a pipe dream I know, knowing my luck, i'd sell up and set out to find myself rouging it in a field alone mid winter lol...

But what do you do to escape, I need out of this place, not just get out and walk around and enjoy the outdoors, I need out of this area! but to do so is to throw myself into potentially worse isolation and loneliness, and while I can talk to people openly, I can be outgoing and seem happy, inside It's always a fight, I need companionship I know but true and honest companionship.. does that even exist anymore?, i'm sure it does but how do you find that when you're locked away?

2287,praisetheshore,1658214360,1,"This will get lost in the sea of the internet but it's nice to get it out. 

I'm actually really good at making friends thanks to my extroverted tendencies but that massively clashes with my need for a few close friends instead of many distant friends. I've never really had a close bond that time and experiences make. I have friends but they all have closer/better friends than me and we all interact through dm or text. It's honestly worse than when I didn't have anyone because I have to keep up these hollowed out relationships of trying to find an interesting enough topic to get someone to respond to my texts. 

So I tried to befriend people who are directly in my life but I can't stand them? It's not their fault at all and they like me as a friend but... our lifestyles and personalities just don't work. It feels like more of the same ""friends"" I have right now. I find myself putting on a persona to try and be the person they want, not who I am, which isn't worth it. So I mostly distanced myself away and made them into acquaintances. 

I guess it is kind of my fault for being so picky, but all of my ""friendships"" have been so one-sided and I don't deserve that. I think I'm great! Not perfect, but, I'm loyal, caring, have an interesting view on life, am funny (my mom thinks so lmao), am an explorer, and I think true friendship is one of the most important things in life. A person you chose and who chooses you is what life is about. I just want to share experiences and the world with someone. Not interested in romance at all though. 

I guess I'm waiting for someone who may or may not come. I'm 19 so it could be days or years or never. I'm ok with being alone kind of. I've seen so many failed relationships of the people around me and sometimes I'm thankful for the peace I have. It's crushingly lonely at times, though.

2289,snivy10123,1658212881,1,"hey everyone, this is my first post on reddit ever and its gonna be quite big.   


firstly, some info about my self: im a guy who was home schooled all my life and never had any IRL friends. because of this, i am severely socially inept/awkward. the only friends ive made were online through gaming and stuff like that. i also am quite vulnerable due to being in too many toxic friend groups, i never really was socially active and always liked keeping to my self, yet i really hate being lonely because im scared to be my self. i also suffer from extremely bad anxiety (this is important for later)  


i never liked the thought of being lonely. it always scared me and as of late that has been somewhat becoming the truth.  
i used to have tons of friends., at one point i had 3 different friend groups! (yeah it was pure hell to manage.) these groups were always sort of connected but not at the same time (my friend circle was so convoluted and weird it deserves a post of its own lol) but over the course of 5 years all of these groups split up. due to it being toxic, life getting in the way, or just being forgotten about. in the end over course of 5 years ive lost every single one of my friends (except for my oldest friend who ive known for 5 and a half years, and my cousin, who i am very close to.)  


and for about a year or so now ive been living that lonely depressing life ive always dreaded. besides talking to my last friend and cousin. **until recently.**  


back in april i met a girl who is a artist. (AKA one of my hobbies that i plan on getting into soon) on twitter and idk.. something about her really drew me in. so i decided to ditch keeping to myself for a bit and we started talking and the more and more we talked.. i realized that i am madly in love with her, we have tons of things in common, to the point where we are almost exact copies of eachother. and i really care about her with every inch of my soul and want nothing more but to be by her side for eternity. we are also only 2 and a half hours away from eachother (which is the closest person ive ever met on the internet) we aren't together yet however, we have never confessed our love to eachother and are currently just friends.  


now you may be reading this post so far and are wondering: ""**well to me it sounds like everything is starting to get better after having a bad fall! you found somebody your in love with and things seem to be going great! so why are you so scared?**""  


and to answer that question we now get to the more sadder or ""deep"" part of the post. as mentioned earlier i have severe anxiety and people with anxiety tend to dwell on the worst case scenarios, and i am no exception. i worry about how my life will be if things with the girl i like dont go right. im terrified about being alone for the rest of my life and never having anyone to spend every day with making memories and being happy together, and its really mentally taxing. its not like im just overreacting either. there is a very real chance that she may not feel the same way about me romantically as i feel for her and im scared of that happening because idk how ill be able to live the rest of my life knowing that my soulmate doesn't feel the same way, and we will be forever separated and it terrifies me to my very core. shes like the other half of my soul that ive been missing for a while. when we do things together i feel the happiest ive ever felt and i never want that feeling to end, i truly do love her with every single ounce of my body.  


she made me realize how beautiful love is and truly is my only chance at not being alone forever. i hate dating/dating apps. (no offense to anyone who dates or uses dating apps, i just personally feel they never create long lasting love but thats just me. no shame to anyone who thinks otherwise, infact more power to you!) and i also hate the act of ""looking"" for love. i feel its something that falls into your lap,  and i refuse to break my social boundaries and standards just to find another person, as mentioned earlier i like keeping to my self and caring for those i am close to. so if i end up getting a social life just to find love? all that will happen is me finding someone i wont be as happy with because they will be super social and outgoing and love making friends, while theres me who much rather prefers just doing things together as a couple and only that, and its not something i want. i also dont know how id be able to find someone who is better then the girl i currently like. (as ive stated earlier in the post were basically like unrelated twins with how similar we are in terms of interests, hobbies, looks, etc.) so the thought of having to live my entire life knowing that id never have one of the most amazing and special people in my life is disturbing to me and has not been good to think about. and i have no idea how im gonna do it if things go south.  


and with that is the conclusion of my first post on reddit. do any of you guys have advice to give me so i can stress about all this stuff less? anything is welcomed. and i appreciate you for reading if you have made it this far! have a great rest of your day/night everyone! :)  


TL:DR i am a very socially awkward guy who lost a ton of friends, lived the lonely lifestyle for about a year, found my soulmate and am worried about the outcome if things dont go according to plan. and refuse to just ""find another person"" due to my strict social boundaries and standards.",lonely,i dont wanna be lonely forever and im terrified (first post on reddit and its a long one.),2022-07-19 16:41:21
2290,sidd_111,1658212808,1,"For the first time in years, I got talking to a girl who was actually interested in talking with me. She was genuinely curious about me and my life. She is shy, introverted and asocial just like me, but she has way more opportunities to be social. She gets asked out every other day and gets invited to events and places. Yet she took an interest in me. 

She asked me about my day and I said my day usually goes like work, chores, learning to code, workout/reading/movies/anime/cooking. Then I saw the regret in her eyes, she said ""you must like being alone"", I felt her attitude towards me changed entirely. She became cold. All over conversations have been very short since then.
 I don't think she is going to want to talk to me anymore.

To have a group or to have someone that I can trust and be myself and be comfortable with, who knows me and wants me to be around and cares about me.

I want so badly to be in those cartoon or family movies where a kid or teen has a loving family or a strong social group that's supporting him and making him feel like someone cares. 

It's so cold being an adult. I think about trying to make a friend or join social groups and I just can't believe it could ever develop into a welcoming social group or a friend who would care about me. What's the point... I talk to someone and they either have strong friends from college or high school or I'm too weird or shy or awkward for them to want to keep talking to me.

2296,alxrd77,1658210638,1," 

I have a twin brother who is better than me in everything. He always stands out among the two of us. He is more gifted talent wise ,appearance wise and even personality. He is much better at sports . During our school days. he was in the sports team. Because of this, he got a so much attention from the ladies, while I got none ( I was bad at sports). We both are in our late 20s now. He's had many girlfriends till now while I've had none till now. He is physically fit while I have a lot of belly fat and double chin. While we have a normal relationship, here's why I am bringing this up:

1. Most of our friends are common. These “friends” have discriminated against me so much. They have sidelined me and made fun of me on multiple occasions. They have treated me inferior to my brother. The reason why their words have affected me so much is that I have grown up with these people. Had they been some random guys, it wouldn’t have affected me as much.
2. I have also felt that sometimes my parents also look upon me as someone below my brother. My mom has been more strict with me since our schooling. Whenever I try to do something new, they do not “look at me” happily but with some anger and confusion. My brother has been given more freedom to do anything he wants regarding his career. My mom sometimes also seeks validation from him for me.

These experiences have affected me so much. I lead a life full of frustration and humiliation. I'm not good at anything, have no focus, have no friend to count on, have so many mental insecurities. My self esteem, confidence, ability to express myself - all are almost 0. I feel like I'm being judged constantly. I lose so much of my mental energy being stuck in loop of thoughts.

I am 41, never had a regular job. only day labor jobs that destroyed my back, knees, from 10 years homeless and working on farms and ranches doing manual labor. 

I am 41, last girlfriend i had gave me a bad yeast infection I can't get rid of because of health reasons. and that lasted a month in person. before that it was 5 years prior to her, the woman before her faked her death on me twice and would call me while having sex with her husband and turned out to be married. the woman prior to that was back when I was 27. spent 9 months skyping, talking sending messages and emails and actual letters in the mail to one another and i moved to iowa to be with her and in a week she cheated on me with her ex and dumped me at the local town fair. 

I am sitting here listening to music trying to get lost in the music but getting lost in my own head/thoughts. idk what to do anymore. I tried getting my GED but because of my learning issues and such I struggle really bad in getting it. have to work from the 3rd grade up to 12th in every subject. and I struggle remembering things because of my mental issues and illnesses like my ptsd. 

People don't want to hire me because of my weight, women won't date me because of my weight or the fact im on disability. I just dunno what to do anymore. I have no real purpose in life anymore, no drive, no energy to do anything or go anywhere. just no real purpose in life anymore or drive. all online jobs I find require experience or skills I don't have or proof of, or require high school or ged. and they won't hire me. im slow at learning. needing to be told the same thing about 15 or so times to understand it and do it consistently for a month to remember it. most online jobs won't put up with that. and i applied to many and my resume is blank and empty. nothing to put on it now for like 15 years now. so idk. 

Also doesn't help I live in a very small town with no public transport and no way to get anywhere and haven't left the house in almost 9 years because of it. 

feeling like ending it tonight is the best and only way out of this life. as of right now, just laying here listening to knocking on heavens door by bob dylan and remembering the 4th of july with that woman in iowa when we hung out all day on fourth of july, then that night went to the lake with her family, hung out all night, walked hand in hand around the lake and then had our first kiss that night. which just felt so right. just making me think i will never have that again with another woman ever....

im seeing so many people who have partners and their partners treat them horrible and its like how do they find women and then treat the woman badly and the woman stays and here I am a decent guy and get called a piece of trash or worse because of my issues and get abused hard by women or rejected hard or put in the category of being a *nice guy* just because when they treat me horrible I call them out on it or called an incel. 

I just don't get it anymore. im to the point that this is what my life is meant to be and im not meant to exist anymore. lost my parents when I was in my early 20s have no other siblings or family. just don't see a reason to keep going. what little friends I had were streamers i met when I would stream and because I stepped away from them they turned on me quickly and acting like im a monster. only stepped away because I got tired of the drama that was always floating around with them.

OK in the past I understand why some of my friendships have failed. I stopped reaching out. But this isn’t the case this time. 
 
I have been friends with this lady for about 18 months. 
For the past little while, it seems like she doesn’t want much to do with me. I can’t think of anything I’ve done wrong. Did she just get sick of me or something?  

Without going too much off-topic in addition to being friends we volunteer as admin’s in a group. A while ago the owner wanted to her to stop doing a post she makes every Wednesday. I volunteered to tell her as he had to run out. It was around that time that she started being distant towards me.

I really hope this is a coincidence, if she’s gonna stop talking to me over something so ridiculous, I guess she wasn’t as good as a friend as I thought she was. But in the long run it doesn’t even matter . A  failing friendship is  a  failing friendship no matter the reason. We also have a small group chat with us and another lady. She doesn’t talk in that either, but I know her and the other lady message each other. I am also friends with the other lady. But now I wonder how much longer I have her friendship.",lonely,"Another friend is slowly walking away for me, you’d think I’d be used to it by now.",2022-07-19 12:05:43
2328,Prometheusatitangod,1658196282,1,"I do everything in my power to sleep little as possible, I could give you the numbers, if you live to be really old you will have spent a quarter of your entire life basically in a willing state of unconscious . Talking 20 to 25 years of your life.  When you been lonely for as long as myself and you get to my age of 51 . It basically means that you're life is 75- 85% over . to waste a single minute is horrific. But spending it alone or striking out for the millionth time.  Isn't easy.  But my odds are still better than the toucherous dreams and nightmares that always await me in sleep 
I know people say you need 8 hours of sleep I am 51 I sleep 2-3 hours a night and 1.5 to zero at least 3 times a month.  Been doing this since I was 19 or 20 . My nightmares aren't your typical kind.  I actually feel things I shouldn't.  I once had a dream I was beaten to death infront of every one I know and they didn't do a single thing to help me.  I felt every single blow felt my bones break the blood pouring out this person caved in my skull.  I fist went blind then my sinus made a sound like air coming out of a slashed tire under water.  The ring in my ears when into a buzzing humm . I felt my exposed nerves like rusty hot nails screaming in pain. The weird part my teeth hurt the most.  More like where they used to be. With the final blow my head came apart like a jack-o-lantern in November.  I had an out of body experience saw the carnage my twitching body my head looked like a pealed crushed banana I even saw the steam raising from the neck hole.  As I floated around I saw my friends and people I knew just looking.  I remember thinking.  It was just one dude a really strong dude. But they had numbers on there's side why didn't they help me.  
The traumatic after effects from this dream scared me for life it was just a dream representation of my loneliness and it destroyed me as the people in my life do little to nothing.  When I know if the all tryed the could have saved me. 
Another one I was starving to deth and dehydrated . Close to death the I found every single person I knew sitting at a huge table filled with all kinds of food the where eating like pigs I ran over to eat I was stopped buy an invisible chain that just kept me from reaching the table. I could smell it . S yelled out to several people I knew they looked at me then turned away engnoring me . I say Mr best friend and I said please help I dying give me just a little bit.  My friend looked at me sadly and said I can't.  I'm not allowed.  I said not allowed why who said.  Friend said I don't know no one said it specially.  So you can please I dying I feel to the ground took my last breath smelling the very thing I needed to live seeing the people in my life totally able to get it to me yet refusing to without even having a reason.  I felt the hunger the weakness.

This might be my saving grace from loneliness. The thought that every women I come into contact with has probably had sex with any number of dudes I may run into at the gas station and in this day and are very possibly on camera. I put in so much work into my mental state and my physical fitness.

I’d rather be alone then feel disgusted by what I’ve done and who I did it with. 

I use to think it wouldn’t matter if I just slept with more women. I never did but at least now I understand that I don’t want to because the number of dudes who were there before me is just…. Insanely gross to me. 

Am I the only one like this or are there others? Is it wrong to think like this? I hope so and I’d love to hear someone say I’m wrong.

Was a completely virtual thing but the human mind cannot understand difference between real and imaginary, so talking in psychological therms even virtual was real, so…

We never real met up by my fault but, all the time we passed together was like the love of our most beautiful dreams - and for her too because all things she told me during our entire time together.

I have my failures and she’s her failures, but use to understand each other, accept and never real break-up or fight - and even when we fight, we used to come back mutually better.

When I was with her company (even virtual), I really felt me someone, I felt me loved, important, stronger.

All I wanted is to show her that she’s didn’t choose a looser, but I didn’t.

I never dream about really live a love but if it could happening so the person have to be exactly what I want and she was this person, exactly what one day I dreamed about.

I’m dream about her a lot of times and I always feel good when it’s happen, but I remember that I’m alone now and don’t wanna me anymore. I mean, I’m no one to her - only girl who I had something real, intense and truly by a time, so why someone more will consider me something?

I could Mary her but we can’t obligated someone to nothing and, people would consider me “toxic”, but they don’t understand what really is love someone, but if aí can’t get her so at least I hope someone like her or… better if exists.",lonely,I miss my ex,2022-07-19 07:28:12
2376,platypus_18,1658176764,1,"Today is my birthday. Should I write? Should I play my guitar? Synth? Read that book I've been meaning to for years? It’s right there, less than a foot from me. Or should I drive over to Barnes and Noble to pick up a new book I’ve been meaning to read for a considerably smaller amount of time? I might do none of these, in all honesty I’ll probably just sit here at my desk and scroll on my phone, or watch some youtube videos I couldn't really care less about. Continue to drink the coffee I got this morning that I know I shouldn't be drinking. I have a sleep schedule to fix, I just got back from being in California for a month and they’re three hours behind. I have work tomorrow and the ice melted hours ago. I just took a sip even after acknowledging I shouldn’t be drinking it. That's how I do things though. Life on the edge, one step at a time. If I want it I’ll do it… unless I can find a reason not to. I can’t play guitar, my roomates asleep. I could play my synth and finish that pretty song I started a month and a half ago. I even have a name for it “The Slow and Quiet Death of a Garden Mouse” nice right? It’s an ambient song so keep that in mind if you think the name is weird. I found a couple cool stock photos of what I’d want the cover art to be like. I couldn’t use those though I don’t own the rights to them and they aren’t exactly what I’m looking for anyway. I was thinking about going on reddit and finding an artist I like on r/doodles or something, and having them draw me something similar I could use. But I don't know how that works. When I’m a famous ambient composer will that small artist sue me for using their intellectual property as cover art for a single most of my fans haven’t even heard? I paid them for it of course but I didn’t hire a lawyer to write a contract. My first mistake. How could this small artist be so vindictive of me? But I won't play my synth. My roommate will wake up and see me playing it and have some strange idea in his head of what I’m doing. Will he think it’s a piano? Will he think I’m dumb for playing the piano? I would have to explain that it’s a synthesizer not a piano, and that “Ya I guess it's sort of similar to a piano but it makes weird noises. You watched Stranger Things right? Ya the main theme was made on one of these” he probably wouldn't understand though and only view it as a piano. I can't have that. I’m playing a synthesizer! I’m bohemian! That book I’ve been meaning to read sounds good though. Blood Meridian, a classic of the 20th century. It will go down as one of the greatest books ever written, or so I’ve seen people say online. I don’t remember when I first heard about it it was over 4 years ago and I didn't read then. Me and one of my buddies in basic training talked about it briefly. It was his favorite book, it must be good. I don't even remember his name now. But I can see his face, I can see his face in the exact moment the title came out of my mouth. Ah yes, Blood Meridian, a classic of 20th century literature. I’m actually quite smart for having read it as you can see by my facial expression. That's what I imagine was going through his head. “That book is so fucking good…” is probably what came out of his mouth though. But I heard that it’s hard to read. People smarter than me have said that so it must be true. I bought it back in January, when I was at my moms house, and it was snowing and I wasn't sure if I could drive back to Georgia the next day. I read the first chapter and it was kind of strange to read. Not hard but I imagine it would get harder as I read more and I dont want to feel stupid. Page 16, that's as far as I got that day. That other book I want to read though, Notes from the Underground by Dostoyevsky, would be good though. It sounds interesting and it's only 176 pages. Easy enough. How will the bookstore be though? Will there be people in there my age? Will I look cool to them? Will I come off as approachable? Will they think I look stupid? The way I walk looks dumb maybe. I swing my arms too much when I walk, or so I’ve been told by friends I don't speak to anymore. Perhaps the love of my life will be there. That cute girl that checked me out that one time when I bought a copy of The Stranger. She picked it up and looked at both sides while I was nervously swiping my card and trying to navigate the options on the card reader. I didn’t speak to her of course. After all, I couldn’t find true love right now. I get out of the Army in 9 months and I have to leave this town as soon as possible. We’ll say we’ll make it work, I would stay here after I get out and work until she finishes school next summer. Or we’ll be long distance and she would meet me in Washington once she finishes school. It would be love. But I’m not doing that again. I wanted to start taking yoga classes as well. I told myself I would once I got back from California. I was going to take my fitness more seriously. Calisthenics, because I want to be a master of my body and because I’m scared of the gym. Running and yoga on off days because that's good for you. Good for me. I could meet friends at these yoga classes, cool like minded people my age who also hate it here. Who want to move out west and work cool jobs. Maybe seasonal in the summer and part time during the school year. A Cobbler, I’ve wanted to be a Cobbler’s apprentice for years. Would he take me in? Surely he would because he can see I have such a good work ethic by the way I carry myself. I would strut in the shop and demand he let me take him to lunch and he would be wowed by my forthrightness and the job would be mine, just as everyone's Grandfather got their job all those years ago. It worked for them so it must work for me. I could take time off as I please, after all he’s an understanding man who appreciates how hard I work. I could take time off to go and work on the land I bought, right by the coast. In the summers I would work seasonal jobs and he would hold my position for me. I could find love in my off time working as a cobbler's apprentice. Not like the last time. She wouldn’t have to leave, she would be there. If she did I would simply follow her to wherever she went. Quit my job in the name of love. The old Cobbler would be understanding after all. I wouldn’t have the burden of school like the last time. If I was in college I’d simply leave, transfer to wherever me and my love had landed. It would be great. My insecurities wouldn’t bother her, the burden I put on her would be as light as that old down pillow I used to have. The baggage I brought with me wouldn’t matter to her, she would sort it out and put it all away. She’s squared away, any problems she had I would instantly know how to fix, all past trauma and setbacks she had faced would be no struggle for me. Simply taking her in my arms and telling her not to worry would be enough right? I’m a good man and that's what good men do, help those around us. Our kids will be the most beautiful and smartest on the street of course. All of my best qualities and all of my cool interests will take hold in them and they’ll be just like me, just as my Father had hoped would happen to him. Half the days already gone and all I’ve done is write whatever this is, but that's ok because I did something I said I wanted to. I was productive with my time, surely it couldn’t have been spent somewhere else. Maybe I will go buy that book, but I’ll have to wait until tonight. If I go now the store would be full of people and I’ve already decided how they would feel about me. Going late is the right option. 30 minutes before close when they’re sweeping the floors and hoping no one comes in. That’s where it starts",lonely,Today is my birthday,2022-07-19 06:39:24

2379,Mymelodykoala,1658176387,1,"Friends, lovers, whatever it may be. 
I've always been the type to desperately desire to be around others, I don't do well on my own. I have awful anxiety and, if I'm going to be honest, depression. I used to be the kind of person that was a chameleon and would do or say whatever it took to fit in with others so I wouldn't be alone. 
I've done some growing up, maybe from realizing that being around the wrong people makes me feel more alone, but perhaps it's because I seek more meaningful relationships. I'm married, and if you do your sleuthing, you'll realize that's not exactly where I want it either. I've been the kind of person in the past to put the blame entirely on him and that's not fair. We both have our faults and have slowly began to resolve them. 
Anyway, I realize, I am more alone than I would like lately and am seeking a friend. Maybe one who lives close, I am in DFW, Texas. I am also open to others that are further away. 

I'm 33, female, married, all that jazz.

2380,leozaur1808,1658176271,1,"You would probably consider this problem unimportant, and yeah, that is exactly what I am trying to take this problem as, but I haven’t got rid of this yet. Probably you have any methods that would make me forget about this problem completely or escape it. This is exactly what I am asking for, because solving the problem seems impossible.

This story must be started from a bit far away, when I was 14 years old. It was when I started noticing indifferent attitude towards be from the opposite sex. Maybe, you think, I shouldn’t have been concerned about it back then, and I would definitely agree with you. However it had proceeded when I was 16. That was when it started to kick me really hard, I hadn’t had any female friends whatsoever and got various examples of this kind of indifferent attitude to me. For instance, the most common situation was: the girl gives a hug to everyone except for me, she doesn’t talk to me at all and so on. It was kicking me hard, so I tried to evade this situations, and I was pretty successful in it, I have found people who seemed to experience the same problem, and I nearly forgot about this. I even had got a first female friend and after some time we started dating. I think you have already predicted what had happened after. The girl said that she likes another guy, and many of those described earlier started to have female friends, so I couldn’t evade this problem with them anymore.

Bearing this in mind, I have develope a strange attitude to life, which was completely dreaming only about the future. It is described with cite “to be something”, so I had been hoping to get rich and was working towards it. I hadn’t had any other dreams except this. And that had been helping me all over my life since I first developed it in my brain. But, unfortunately, it is completely unimaginable without the bright future itself. If you read the news, then you probably understand what happened after. My country invaded the neighbour and so has been imposed to unprecedented economic sanctions and the future now seems to be the worst thing you can think of. I still have a hope to immigrate from it, and that is the only light at the end of the tunnel.

Fortunately, I don’t have any extra problems, which makes my mental health sustainable and haven’t lead to any disastrous thoughts yet.

1. Intention: It's when one don't want to chat with anyone. One feel depressed or demotivated when one see someone better than you. Or one have some inborn attitude from your childhood that one find hard to get rid of. Or even if one have any abnormality like being weak, he/she don't want other people to see him/her.
2. Compulsion: If someone is orphan, if he/she was left alone by his family, due to his own mental physical capabilities, he is compelled to live alone, or he/she is aged. Or He/she can't find anyone whom to share feelings with.

2412,abomination_boy,1658155904,1,"I was cut off from everything socially during quarantine. I couldn't even leave my house and I was also stuck living in the middle of nowhere with no internet access or access to cable.

I lost all of my friends because during that time I was stuck living with someone who intentionally destroyed all of my friendships out of possessiveness because they wanted me to be too afraid to leave them. They wanted me to have nothing if I tried to get away. Which, ironically, is the everything they did that made me want to leave. But when they're dirty work was done they left me.

I was completely friendless for about a year until I moved. The neighborhood I have moved into is pretty ghetto but people are a lot more down to earth and easier to talk to. There's a higher crime rate and there's more assholes, but it's not a bunch of Rich rednecks who looked down on the disabled in minority groups so it's easier for me to blend in here.

I have a couple of friends now but we're not really close. They've all got their own lives to live and I'm only a small part of that. Some have kids, some have roommates, some have relationships. And of course everyone has a job. I've got a physical disability that prevents me from working full time so I feel like I'm this lifeless loser. TBH I feel more like a dog than a person. You know how humans get to go out and live these big exciting lives but your dog is stuck at home and is always waiting for you to come back? That's me. That's how I felt ever since I became disabled because I can't live a big exciting life. 

I haven't really had any close friends since spinal fusion surgery that crippled me. It really destroyed all of my friendships and kind of ruined my place in my family. I had a lot going for me back then - my dad had a savings account for when I grew up that would be for driving lessons and my college education (which my mom dipped into and pissed away after he died), straight A's in everything, 12 years old and already working part-time, involved in almost every extracurricular you could think of, part of a scout troop, I was really involved. And then my spinal fusion didn't go as planned. I never recovered fully. I can walk and don't technically need a wheelchair but not more than maybe around the block before I get worn out. And I'm in pain all the time. All of my friends distanced themselves from me because I wasn't fun to play with anymore. And my family became irritated with me and started seeing me as just a burden because there were a lot of things that I needed help with now like lifting heavy loads and needing a certain mobility aids.

Ever since that surgery I've had a couple of friends, I've even been in relationships later on in life but it wasn't really close. That close-knit friend group I had back then with the scouts, all the people from my swim team, and everybody in the science club was something I really miss. And I don't think that I can have anything like that anymore. All of my friendships since the operation have been distant and surface level. Even the ones who stuck around kept their distance with me and would snap at me if I mentioned that I needed to take a break or that I couldn't keep up with them. They would say I wasn't trying hard enough or something.

And I guess I just feel like unless there's a miracle surgery that can correct the damage done from that failed spinal fusion that I'm never going to have any close friends again. What I have now is closer to buddies I guess - people I hang out with maybe a couple of times a month but not really someone you could call on in a pinch or asked to walk out to the grocery store with you because you live in a bad neighborhood and it's kind of a bad idea to go out alone. I don't have anyone like that in my life. And at this point I think that I never will.",lonely,"no longer friendless, but lacking close friends",2022-07-19 00:51:44

I’m the one that doesn’t reach out and it’s been so long that i’m not close to anyone anymore. I don’t think people that used to know me know that I truly don’t have anyone anymore. I think they just assume that I’ve found new people just like they did. Besides that I’ve been to scared to reach out to people cause I made some mistakes recently and it feels like everyone judges me for it and doesn’t want anything to do with me.

They don’t text back, they don’t ask me how I am, how is my life, and if they do, they take like a month to reply.

My partner and I have been together for 4 years. My partner got a new job this year, that has the potential to involve a lot of travel, and I am still a student, graduating in 6 months’ time.

Currently I’m having vacation. I have previously had part-time jobs in my related field, but this is the first summer I have nothing. My partner just went back to work after their vacation, and was offered to go on a trip to a sister location in a different country sometime next week. 

For context, I started my degree during covid. Everything has been online, and so I haven’t made really any friends from my degree. My partner is really happy in their new job, and gets along with their colleagues super well… and that makes me feel like a failure, and like I’m being left behind. 

I have so much anxiety about my partner potentially leaving to go to that sister location, because I’d be on my own for the duration, with nobody to go to or hang out with in the meantime. It’s not necessarily a problem of not being around my partner, but it’s a problem of not having anyone to talk to or go see, if I wanted to or needed to. I have over a month left of lonely, nothing-to-do vacation, before I go to finish my degree, and I feel like my partner is acing their life, getting to do fun stuff, while I’m stuck at home with nothing to do and no people to see.

Now it's the same thing again. I had found so much joy in those daily conversations where we shared ideas with each other. Now, I have to go back to journal everything. To talk to myself. To read expecting to hear something relatable from authors who died a long time ago. To watch movies just to feel something.

2478,ohcowboyy,1658122094,1,"So I (NB17) had been dating a girl (F17) for about 2 months, from early April until early June. We had been best friends for over three years. I will call her L because that is her first initial. She texted me apologizing if she had been a bit short with me lately and said that she feels like her mental health isn’t in a good spot and she wanted a break from dating so that she didn’t hurt me. Sounds fine right? Well, it turns out this would be a load of bullshit. Anyway I get upset and whatnot because I am an emotional wreck and don’t like containing emotions and got mad, which I will say was inappropriate for the way I reacted.

So a couple days later I apologize and L says it’s cool, and we don’t talk for a few days, but before then we were having a conversation and she just straight up left in the middle of it when I was talking about something important regarding her, and I texted her days later asking why it felt like she was ignoring me. I told her she had been active on discord and was even posting memes in the same channel I was talking in the previous day and ignored me. L gets mad at me telling me that it’s a shitty reason to get mad at her for not acknowledging my existence in a discord server when she doesn’t even want to talk to people. Would be an okay argument but she had literally been talking to people on discord, lmao.

So I decide to take a break from social media for a couple weeks to try and clear my mind, and when I came back I told L I wanted to have a serious conversation about us, and we planned it to be a few days from then. Well I pussied out, scared that she would react negatively towards me, so I told her I was scared and backed out and L said she didn’t mind since she didn’t even want to talk in the first place.

In the days leading up to that, I had noticed that she constantly updated her status to be something somewhat targeted towards me, with one of them being “the freedoms of being single are both relieving and suffocating”, as well as a few others. Well, I’m venting to my friend about the entire situation and her dumb ass decided to take screenshots of our conversation and send them to her, which obviously caused issues because I said stuff that I didn’t want L knowing yet. L simply just texts me with “the statues weren’t about you they were about my mom” which I immediately knew was somewhat bullshit but whatever, go ahead and lie. Friend adds both of us to a chat and we both leave as she keeps spam adding us saying to fix it ourselves since she’s tired of being a messenger so I block her since literally none of us asked her to do any of this and she’s acting like we’re treating her like shit.

So the next morning I tell L that I want to actually save our bond since it’s clear that she’s not even trying to, and she says “well I don’t see why we would need to save our bond since I’m not even mad at you at all and still see you as a friend”. So I told her that I felt neglected since she’s my best friend and she wasn’t talking to me, and since I have attachment issues I felt like she was distancing herself from me to leave me. I asked if she’s doing okay, and she said yes. Awesome! Well, not for me, I’ll get to that in a minute. I also asked if she’s wanting to stay single because I wanted to know if I should just move on, and she said yes. What she said next set me off so hard:

“Also, I’m distancing myself from in person friends for the summer because I’ve seen them on loop every day for months on end and got bored of them and I wanted to catch up with my online friends.”

Excuse me? You’ve still spoke to your online friends, I was with you pretty much the entire school year and I remember you texting them. Also, BORED?! What so you are shutting out all of your friends, even your BEST FRIEND that you had plans to do things with over the summer, because you are BORED OF SEEING THEM?! So I went off on her, calling her out on all her bullshit and asking for a further elaboration since k felt like I was missing something, and L says:

“My adhd will make me stop talking to them all together if I’m bored. Also, I don’t need a reason because I’m my own person and can do what I want. I still see you as a friend, I don’t need to talk to friends often to still see them as friends. I don’t know why you can’t understand that and have to go around telling everyone that! Don’t tell me I need a good explanation for this like you fucking own me.”

Lol first of all, don’t use adhd as an excuse, I know people with adhd who don’t act like this. You know I have attachment problems so obviously I won’t see someone as a friend if I’m ignored. Also, am I not allowed to fucking vent to my friends about how I may lose my bestie? Sorry that I called out on your bullshit logic! IS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY, but that would’ve caused more issues.

So I apologized, even though I meant none of it, because I wasn’t ready to lose my best friend over me calling L out on her bullshit. Well, she ghosted me, and she hasn’t said anything to me since. I woke up this morning and looked at her bio, and the hoe added “taken” to it. Later found out that it was the same boy she was dating online in the months leading up to us.

Yeah.

I immediately blocked her on everything. You don’t tell someone you wanna be single because of mental health and need a break, when you are actually fine and just want to avoid all your in person friends and give up a partner who did everything they could to make you loved in the worst way possible. At least if you just straight up broke up with me and we’re honest I’d just be heartbroken and I wouldn’t feel like a fucking toy.

My only other in person friends aren’t in my every day life anymore as well, with one of them moving states and the other one graduating and moving cities. I don’t know what to do, I’m starting to enter a darker state of mind with each passing day. I don’t know how I’m going to find a new best friend easily once school starts and I don’t know how my future with L will go, considering that I don’t even think I can look at her the same until she gives me a reasonable explanation.

everytime i tried to change it or make it better, it never worked, i ended up in the same place over and over again, and you know what? im tired of it all

i planned and tried everything for years, and i still couldnt do it, im still here, im still alone, still, nobody even cares a little bit about me, and no matter how much i try to change it, its always the same over and over

out of everything that's happened, at least i thought by now i wouldnt have to go through everything alone...i thought i would've finally found that person that'd make me feel alice again, happy, someone that made me understand that maybe life isnt so bad, and that maybe there is a good future ahead of me, a future where someone finally understands me and just, loves me for who i am

you know? i think i needed someone like that the most when i was in school...not being alone in there would've just fixed almost everything

i always wanted a high school sweetheart, i'd see my classmates have their own love stories and i'd just, hope that mine would come soon too...instead i just lost two of my best friends and felt horrible all year

For most of my life I always had the unhealthy belief that I was just meant to be alone. So, I just accepted going day in and day out not talking to anyone. Occasionally I would try to talk to someone or make a friend. Always we'd just stop talking. And eventually I figured I'm the common denominator, so it has to be something about me.   
I know the whole ""you only fail if you give up"" but I isolated myself. Which I knew wouldn't make me feel better. But feeling better wasn't the point. I truly believe it would be better if I'm around as few people as possible. I just feel I've become insufferable. It's almost funny, younger me I feel like didn't have a personality. And as soon as I try to figure out my own personality of course it's insufferable. And now the last few days I'm stuck in a loop of maybe I should try to make friends again. Maybe join a site or app or something. But then it's right back to it would be better if no one has to deal with me.   
I tried posting a bit in a fandom and I already wish I'd just kept my mouth shut because I hate everything that comes out of my mouth ever. The feeling is even there about family.

It’s been like this since I was a kid. Somehow I never learned social skills, idk. Never went to anyone’s house, didn’t have anyone over. I never hung out with someone outside of school basically, and I could never do extra curriculars because my parents were busy. People used to say that I was too quiet and boring, or that since I was always alone, I preferred to be left alone. Which ok, I know it was my behavior that repelled others, but I couldn’t figure out how to fix it. 

So I just turned to online to meet my social needs, watching YouTubers and listening to podcasts and stuff. Theoretically I know how to connect with others, it was just way harder to put it into practice. I’m even scared of talking on the phone or ordering food, it’s sad. 

I’m going to college in just over a month and I’m terrified. It’s a big adjustment I’ll have to make. I’ve been preparing for it though, kind of.

2502,Previous_Resident367,1658114897,1,"**It was the summer of 2021. I was 21 at the time and solo vacationing in San Jose, Costa Rica for two weeks (from the USA).**

5 days into the vacation, I decided to open Grindr. When traveling, I learned to become extremely careful about meeting people and inviting them over to my AirBnb. I remember it was midnight, and a guy in his early 20s hit me up. He shared a single photo of himself, as I did, and after a short talk, I decided that he seemed sane enough to invite over. Prior to his arrival, I hid my laptop, passport, IDs, credit cards, SS Card, and cash in different places across the apartment.

He arrived in a car, I went downstairs to greet him (he was the same guy as the photo), and then we went upstairs. We put some music, started chatting, and then he proposed we order a couple of beers through delivery. He orders the drinks from his phone, and I cover the tip. Once the delivery arrives, he goes downstairs to pick it up and then comes back.

We spend the next 20 minutes chatting, making out, and drinking. Shortly after, I start feeling tired. It's almost 3am at this point, and he tells me we should just lay in the bed. I go lay in the bed, and the last thing I remember is falling asleep.

I wake up at around 4am. The music is still playing, but the guy is no longer there. I see that my entrance door is slightly open. It takes me a while to get fully awake. His car is no longer outside, and because I'm tired, I decide to just close the door and go back to bed.

I wake up again at 11am and decide I want to go get some breakfast. I look for my wallet and can't seem to find it. *After 20 mins of searching, it hits me: I cannot find my laptop. I cannot find my credit cards. I cannot find my cash. I cannot find my SS card. I cannot find my IDs. And I cannot find my passport.*

I search again and again, asking myself if this is a dream. 10 mins later, I receive a notification from my bank that one of my cards was declined at a nearby pharmacy. I decide to lock all of my cards and report my passport as stolen.

At this point, the only thing I have is my phone. I have no form of identification, no cards, and no cash on me. The next days are some of the darkest days I've experienced in my life. I tried wiring myself money, but couldn't because I needed to show proof of identity. That same day, I went to the US Embassy in Costa Rica to try to get an emergency passport, but they told me I needed two forms of identification, a passport photo, and cash/card to pay for the fee. The only way I was able to feed myself was through a delivery app. I would unblock my card, order something, and then block it again. Other than that, I couldn't go anywhere because I couldn't pay for anything.

I return back to my AirBnb crying in disbelief. After calming myself down, I open my book bag, and discover something that honestly made me believe in God again at that moment: somehow there was a certified birth certificate, a copy of the passport that had been stolen, a copy of my state ID, and a passport photo in a manilla folder. I somehow was traveling with these things.

At this point, I need to get access to cash. After other failed attempts, I call my parents crying to explain my situation. In a matter of a couple of hours, they wire money to one of their friends who just happens to live in San Jose, and she and I meet up so I can receive the cash. When we meet up, she gives me the cash, I hug her, and just sob in her arms.

The next day, I arrive to the embassy again with my documents, the passport photo, and the cash. My application is processed and in two hours I get an emergency passport valid for 1 month.

With passport in hand, and extra cash, I grab all of my things, pack them, and move my departure flight for the next day so I can leave the country.

**Till this day, I feel ashamed that this happened to me. I don't wish this upon anyone and it is the most traumatizing thing to happen to me. But somehow, it made me regain back my belief that a high power exists out there and was protecting me. I don't know if I would have been able attain a passport if I didn't have those documents with me.**",lonely,The loneliest I ever felt,2022-07-18 13:28:17

I was molested by my moms bf and I haven’t really dealt with that trauma until 2 years ago so it’s definitely been a hard time in my life. I finished community college in 2018 and I was also in a very toxic relationship at that time. When that relationship ended in 2020 I also was dealing with my childhood trauma so it was a lot for me mentally, I’ve also become depressed thinking about a childhood and teenage years I was deprived off because of sexual abuse. I’m 25 now and I don’t even leave my house unless I need to run errands. I’m not sure if it’s my depression stopping me or if I don’t really care to leave the house. I’d say I have maybe 4 people that I actually can call friends but they don’t invite me to hang out and if I don’t initiate a conversation they won’t start one. I’m not in college nor do I have a job rn so it’s tough just being in the House all day. My sister in law and her cousins even make fun of me and calls me lame and a bore for not having a social life and friends. Well they think I have no friends because I don’t hang out with them.

I feel like I trapped myself and now there's no hope of ever repairing the gap I created between us. No one to lean on, make jokes with or talk about things that no one but the two of us would care about. I thought I could fix things but now she's going away and she won't even have a reason to think of me anymore. Like I was never there at all.

The saddest part is I've always been afraid of growing apart, even when we saw eachother every week I would cry wondering if she saw me as an obligation. If she spent time with me because she wanted to or because its what she had always done. One day she left while spending the night at my house to go a mural friend's birthday party at an amusement park. She needed money on a gift card to go, so I gave her mine even though I wanted her to stay more then anything.

I know this isn't how she acts, she's never been the type to do something just because it's what's expected of her, but a nagging whisper in my head keeps telling me she only answers my texts to spare my feelings. Because she feels bad for me acting like a lost puppy dog that doesn't know its not wanted anymore.

Everything I do seems to be only to survive: have a job, eat, sleep. I'm a very lonely person, living by myself with no nearby friends, no pet and just recently started a relationship that just threw me more into this dark place.

Can't say I've got much love when I was a kid and definitely didn't get much or any until now either so I know my problem and what I desire the most: feeling genuinely loved by other people. I just want to feel appreciated and loved for who I am, not what I own or my skills. I'm at most needed. I wonder if I would cease to exist tomorrow if people would really care.

Yes, I've read everywhere you should be happy by yourself, only give and not expect anything in return. Theory sounds amazing but I can't be like that. I can give a lot of love and care but there's a limit, I'm not some infinite spring of happiness. That was just how all my relationships have been so far. I did my best to offer my attention, to be affectionate, but I got nothing in return. I was the one initiating everything: hugging, kissing, anything. If I did nothing, I would probably be a bad partner and get dumped immediately. I really envy those guys who have amazing girlfriends who care about them. This time with the new gf seems to be no different. It's true we are into this for only 3 days but she seems to be the same. If I don't text her, she never does, if I don't hug or kiss her, she never initiates herself. I'm just tired of being the only one actively trying.

the days of talking to someone back on icq or msn messenger when we were teens is long gone and right now i have nobody to turn to anymore.

i have some 'friends' in real life, but not the kind of friends that actually care to hear about or help with my being lonely.

i'm not depressed - i dont think i can really get depressed as such because i objectively check my feelings - but i am over 35 and have been lonely all my life.
i have been wanting kids for over 20 years (yeah, when other kids were learning what a d*ck could do i was fantasizing about the whole house, yard, kids, dog thing)

i look like crap, i feel like crap, and i don't really see myself ever being happy for more than a few minutes a day, max...

only thing that makes me happy is seeing and talking with kids about whatever makes them happy, because it just feels so innocent and simple - you can hear they don't really have any of the scars or worries adults have.
they are less back-stabbing, more honest and open, and when a kid asks you what the matter is, they don't automatically assume you will say you're doing fine.... because they haven't learned yet that ""that is what a normal person does""

but... ofcourse, as a single, adult male... liking kids is ""not normal"" either, so :(

i honestly don't know if i want to die or not.
part of me is scared of death (either it is worse, or there is just nothing), but another part of me is wondering if it really is worth the effort to just go on like this another x years until i die.

I use to vent my issues to any people who were just nice to me and that created problems in the group chat so I stopped. 

Along with journaling, I would have a more proactive mindset instead of being negative. Being positive, happy, and a funny person with no self-deprecating jokes. I have lots of flaws and a shitty personality. I wanted people to know me in good light so I can get more connections and hopefully, this would in turn make me a naturally positive person. Others have told me that people are attracted to positivity. The one thing that couldn't go away was my trust issues so I hid them behind an “if I get to know you More I'll tell more about myself”. It would be my first step in creating a boundary- or an illusion of one. There were ups and downs like struggling to jump into conversations without being rude or desperate but I kept on going because this was training my perseverance as I'm known to give up at a slight issue seen. I even went back to the rp scene to get comfortable talking and writing with people again with a new mindset. 

But it went downhill from there. I joined a lit rp server.

I found myself journaling every day or even on the same day because what someone did or said to me pissed me off. I found myself angry all the time because I became the butt of the joke. But I didn't want to ruin the dynamics because I didn't want to cause drama and it was a rule in the server that if there's drama you'll be kicked with no warning cause the owner has little to no patience. At the time I didn't have anyone else to trust with these thoughts so I kept journaling and treat a day like a new one. I've known to hold grudges so I try not to take things personally. Any topic I brought up about my interests, someone (most likely the owner) would talk about the bad side of it and it made me uncomfortable and I told them to stop. Another person would have a “know it” personality and would dominate the calls and chats on a topic I brought up. 

Not only that but whenever I stayed up, they would tell me to go to sleep when they stayed up at the same time. It was infantilizing and they have been doing it since I joined. I told them to stop and that they were treating me like a child. Then the owner comes in and tells me my comment was uncalled for and I should communicate like a adult when I just did. Then I got a strike. I would take the time to cool down and when it was appropriate to talk about the situation. A few days later I get put into a “timeout” corner because I didn’t tell the owner about my issues in two weeks and they had low patience. So I was forced to tell everything  there even when I wasn’t ready to talk about the situation. According to her people have been having issues with me since June that I wasn’t aware of and knew until now. They claim to have defended me in the background. So it took them a month to tell me people had issues with me (that I know nothing of or the reason why) but they expected me to tell them everything in a timed manner despite me having high intense emotions. So, I said fuck it and left. Currently, I'm falling back to the same things I did before because this experience left me more broken than I ever was.

“Now you can say, oh but that's your side of the story and we don't know theirs” if you did that would be doxing and I'm framing this story unbiased to the best of my ability. 

I don't expect any sympathy~empathy from this post and you're free to say I'm lying to get attention but I've been trying to change my life around. I didn't want to be lonely, depressed, or negative anymore. I didn't want to rely on video games or sleep throughout the day to cope with problems. I'm an HSP with autism and it's torturous to go through with little to no support system. I was friendly, I allowed people to run over me if it meant I could socialize, improve myself, build connections, and my resistance. I always struggled with who to trust because that's when you are your most vulnerable. Maybe everything I did was “masking”, being fake, and calling that progress. I wanted to change and now I'm just hurt.",lonely,Tried to change my life and it only went downhill (long post),2022-07-18 02:01:19

I’m feeling extremely conflicted because of the pressures I put on myself. Long story short, I got out of a 2 1/2 year relationship, for the better, but now I don’t know what to do with myself. I have a pattern of behavior that can be traced back to high school and even now being 23. I can’t help but judge myself and I struggle knowing if it’s worth it to download dating or chat apps to fill this boredom? Hell I don’t even know if it’s boredom or what to call it. I just want conversation with people, but I have this belief I shouldn’t download apps because it’s what I would do in the past and makes me feel like I haven’t grown or changed. I tried some apps for a month or so and it led back into undesirable behavior and I think I could avoid that, but I still have the belief chat apps are desperate, or at least make me feel desperate.

But the summer break started and my brother and I went to visit my grandma and there was my cousin and she often criticised me.I talk enough and she kept making comments such as you never open your mouth,you are quiet and even she said NO WONDER NOBODY LIKES YOU and my grandma ans brother were laughing and agreeing with her.

2619,pvals_4life,1658068972,1,"It's not like I have any reason to complain about. I think objectively things are ok, probably more than ok. In fact what more could I ask for? I'm studying abroad. 

I have a loving family. I just don't want to burden my mom anymore. She does so much more than I do and it's not like she can help me anymore than just telling me it'll be ok and giving me a checklist. That's a lot more than everyone else gets. So why aren't I grateful? 

My roommates were lecturing me about religion yesterday. They said it helped them have a purpose. I think I believe there's nothing after death. That the world isn't fair and there is no forever and that we have to accept such things. Maybe I'm paralysed by fear of fucking up. I thought religious people would use the existence of an afterlife to find peace and be satisfied with what they have--to live a smaller unambitious life. Why can't I believe in God? I have no faith in things I've never experienced that lack sufficient explainatoin or appear arbitrary. They asked me what I would do if I died and God exists... I don't know. Burn in Hell I guess. I've never thought it was real for a second, but if it is? 

I think what's bothering me is how I waste my life online. On YouTube or Netflix or some other entertainment whatever dopamine is readily availible. At least I'm not playing videogames anymore but I just replaced it with something else. 

I get joy when people are vulnerable with me and when I overshare. Can I change? Is it ok for me to say such statements about myself? Is it a reflection of my self-knowledge or self-limiting beliefs. 

I have no drive and yet i still convince myself I could change the world if i gave something my best effort. It's pathetic. I think I'm afraid to try. Or I convince myslef that I don't want anything. I think I really dont. 

I have a test tomorrow that if I fail, my parents may pay for another semester of college. I have barely studied and I'm reasonably confident I'll make the cut. But I hate myself for not preparing. For what? to watch another episode of a soap opera and learn spanish? 

I wish I had a purpose. I wish I were afraid of something. I wish someone forced me into I don't know. I don't want anything. My life is destined to get worse from here. I miss confiding in my girlfriend. I wasnt there when she needed me and well. It wasnt a happy relationship anyway so... For the better still I guess. My childhood was great and I'll have to actually support myself sorta. I'll get a job I'm not passionate about so I can binge watch anime on the weekends till I die and game over. Black screen. Whats the point? 

Jordan Peterson mentioned finding a perception of time that works. That keeping your perspective limited to the next couple days might be better. 

Maybe it would be fun to get into a fight. I've never really done that. I enjoyd the kickboxing class I took that one time. What is there? What am I doing? Why can't I just shutup about it? Why do I have to vomit my sour thoughts onto the internet? 

I used to think I wanted to learn to figure out how to socially engineer humanity to prevent climate change. I barely have the patients to do my math homework.   
I think if no one had expectations of me, I'd bake desserts in the kitchen all day. That's not quite true. I have phases, hobbies, things to procrastinate with. Language learning, guitar, drawing, reading (if I can concentrate). It's all just vanity. No matter what I bake or draw or what language I could speak or what guitar song I learn I'll feel the same. 

Sometimes I get chills of excitement if I play guitar in a pretty way or when there's an excellent plot twist in any anime or I don't know occassionally when I'd write essays in highschool. 

I don't think there's a place for me. I don't think people want my whining privileged apathetic ass. I've lost all my friends just by not keeping up with them or ignoring their messages. I rarely plan social events because i'm scared. i can only stan to be around friends if I think I'm better than them in some way. 

How did I get so fucked up? It's overwhelming. I don't think I'm at risk of killing myself but somehow that makes me feel worse. And I know no one will take me seriously. I guess I'm supposed to be my own parent and help myself out of this situation. How? One step at a time? Will it be worth it? Why do all the anime characters have so much drive? Where do they get the energy? 

I'm supposed to rewrite my story so I don't feel so sorry for myself, without lying. I'm not so creative. And I don't trust myself at all because I always find out the right thing to do and never follow through. 

Maybe someone on reddit can save me lol from my thoughts. Maybe I should just spend my life meditating and not thinking about anything to enjoy the moment whatever that means.

2656,Used_To_Being_Used,1658043503,1,"It's been about a month and a half since I deactivated my social media accounts that had any of my friends attached to them. I did it for a mental health break because I was sick of seeing all of my friends getting engaged, married, announcing pregnancy, getting a great new job that pays well, completing a project that's been years in the making, moving along with their lives, etc, while I'm over here extremely lonely, touch starved due to a recent break up, feeling completely stagnant, and lacking just about everything that they're sharing. While it's been great for my mental health because I stopped comparing myself to what I saw, it's been awful for my already established loneliness. I used to consider myself a person who could confidently say that I have friends, or at least people that would make an attempt to keep me in their lives. Not anymore. 

I've had exactly one person reach out to me asking if I was okay. That person has since not contacted me. I'm in frequent contact with yet again, exactly one person. A friend I made back in high school 13 years ago. The friends I made in elementary/middle school, that I thought I was closer to than this high school friend, don't bother talking to me unless they need me to work on a car, borrow a tool, help them clean up a backyard, etc. All circumstances where my value as a friend is based on my ability to perform a task, not because we're supposed to be friends. I'm not invited to just hang out, party, go out to dinner, anything that friends would typically do. I'm only summoned when I need to be used. I try to make a point to contact the people I would like to include in my life but more often than not, calls aren't answered and messages aren't responded to.

It really fucking puts it into perspective.

If it's any insight, I have a history of depression, suicide attempts, hospitalization, treatment, and therapy. Sitting at home alone every night is weighing really fucking heavy on my mind. It feels like this constant, extreme loneliness nullifies any progress I've made through my journey of trying to get better. The only thing that I know works to keep me somewhat satiated is to keep my brain occupied. Because of that, starting next week, I'm going to be working 7 days a week between two jobs.

2673,uuniversal,1658038874,1,"I graduated from college last year and I'm already doing pretty well in my career. I've already gotten a raise and a promotion in a field I really enjoy. I've always been someone who is career-oriented, but I feel like it's affecting my ability to feel connected with people. In high school and college, I was always pretty popular and well-known. However, after graduating, I realized how many of my relationships were surface level and based on my proximity to them. Part of me feels like people don't reach out to me as much because they assume I'm always busy-- I've confronted my friends on why they left me out of things before and it was because they felt like I was super occupied with school and interning-- a misunderstanding that we resolved so I'm pretty sure they know now that I'll always want to make time for them.

I work from home so I spend most of my days alone. I keep myself busy with work and the gym, where I can only have small talk with people. At the end of the day, I really just crave a real conversation with someone. I used to have deep conversations with my friends all the time. All of my friends are in relationships except for me so I always feel like they're already occupied with their partners. My friends don't go to me with their problems anymore because they have their partner. And when they have relationship problems, I'm not the go-to person because I'm not in a relationship. Whenever we've hung out recently, they always bring their partners too so the dynamic is not the same. They'll go on double dates together which I'm not obviously not invited to.

I secretly envy people with friend groups where everyone is single because since I'm still in my early 20s, I still want to go clubbing and party. I haven't had a night out where it was just me and my friends having fun because they always bring their partners. I already feel like my youth is being wasted especially because of the pandemic. I just want to have fun with my friends again but they respond more in the group chat with their partners than the group chat with just us! When I ask them to hang out, they'll tell me they were already planning to do that with their partner and still invite me but a part of me feels like it's also out of pity.

I'm on dating apps, but I haven't met someone I could see myself with so far. It still doesn't fill my need to actually talk to someone since dating app conversations are all texting. I also don't want to jump into just any relationship because I just got out of a toxic one. And yes, I've done the self love journey, I still take myself out on dates, and I do love myself but.... I'm an extrovert by nature and want to feel connected to people. I guess I'd rather be alone than be around the wrong energy but it still gets lonely.

Although I have some friends who could relate to my life, it's hard to make plans with them now because everyone is so busy. There's still no one I can talk to while my emotions are still fresh at the end of each day. No one to share my highs or my lows with. When I tell my immigrant parents my accomplishments, they don't seem to understand it or seem to recognize how hard I work when I just want them to celebrate with me. I feel myself getting more disconnected and falling into depression. I used to be a really happy, extroverted person but now I feel like I seem more emotionless and empty. When I talk, there's less enthusiasm in my voice and I'm less invested in other people's lives. When I spend time with my friends, they love to gossip so I basically have to listen to it even though I don't care. No one really asks me about my feelings. And if they do, it's in front of their partners so I don't feel comfortable being open. They probably don't ask because they don't think I'm secretly depressed. A lot of my friends say they live vicariously through my social media updates. They only see that I'm doing well at work, hitting PRs in the gym, and traveling every month.

I also feel like everyone in my life is in such different phases. It's really hard to find people who can relate to the things I'm happy about, stressed about, or the things I'm going through in general. I also don't like being as open with people anymore because I don't see them as often. Maybe the same way I find gossip to be boring, they find my talking about work to be boring. 

Regardless, I still have a lot of people in my life and I am grateful for that. I'm grateful that I'm doing well in many aspects of my life. It's just been a while since I've felt connected and understood by someone. When one of my friends hugged me I realized that I haven't been embraced so long, I forgot how good it felt.

i joined an adult league that starts up here in september so i’m extremely excited abt that and making new friendships. the things i do to surround myself with people are go to community church which ive been doing for the past year and it’s great but i always go alone which sucks but the people are amazing, go to costco cause you get a lot of social interaction there (great deals to) anddd that’s it, it’s been wash rinse repeat every week for the past year. i try the whole tinder bullshit but i think it’s stupid and i believe something natural is the absolute best way. inside of all that i get super depressed and only once have i had a moment of time where i didn’t think i was worth it anymore but god pulled me out of that and hope not to return but i just don’t know if i’m bound to the lonely life forever cause it damn well seems that way (yes i plan on doing a good amount of time active). i don’t have anyone not even a pet to spend time with and even talk to on a real note not the military me but the personal me. i do still live in the barracks sadly and i have never had a roommate that i have actually genuinely liked so hopefully soon i get bah lol. ANYONE have any advice on making friends ? (idc if you are mil or not anything helps😁)",lonely,Help (military life sucks),2022-07-17 15:23:37
2678,kingcrawly,1658034097,1,"Hello everyone. I’m 20F, I go to college and work a pretty decent job, and have a pretty amazing boyfriend who i spend most of my time with.

I had a decent amount of people i went out with in highschool but only about 3 actual friends i spent most my time with throughout my highschool career. Ever since covid happened and i’ve been working this job since i was 18 and found a partner, i feel like a shriveled up old woman. My best friend moved across the country a little bit ago and my other “friend” is actually a pretty terrible person and doesn’t ever include me in the off chance she does leave the house. 

I feel like a shell of the person I once was and i struggle to make friends. I feel like a loser and it doesn’t help seeing people I used to know go out and party all the time. I want to feel like partying isn’t the only thing that can lead to w fulfilling life. I would like to go out and party sometimes but have no where to go and no one to go with. i do enjoy my free time because i do love to be home and hangout with my boyfriend and pets and play video games. But sometimes i feel like i need social interaction outside of him and work.

I feel like a loser because i’m not gonna have a 21st birthday party like everyone else, i’m wasting my good years being like a grandma. I just want to feel like there’s more to life than going out and getting drunk and seemingly having fun like everyone else is doing because i feel like i’m missing out and possibly wish in the future thst i tried harder to fulfilling this unrealistic idea of mine.",lonely,Feels like i’m wasting my “good years”.

2679,SiberianPureHerbs,1658033274,1,"So I was supposed to get a job abroad. I was extremely stressed for almost the entire month, thinking about how I would have to share a room and possibly a house with strangers, in strange place for a few months. I didn't want to leave friends I could at least play, talk or watch something with. I was afraid if I'd make enough money for it to be worth it going. I could only hope to get hired by a company or go back with enough money to invest it in better living, maybe finding a place to live on my own. But I don't have to worry about that, they said they're full and I'm back at what it was. I don't need to say goodbye to my friends, I don't need to meet any strangers and live with them. But I also feel like all my perspectives just closed. Yet again I'm stuck with no job, a lot of pressure, a lot of stress. Maybe they will call me again and I'll be double, if not triple, stressed about going abroad again. I don't even know if I want it, I hate everything related to strangers and losing my internet life. I only wish I'd have someone close to talk about it. Someone I'd not be afraid to open to. As I like my friends, and they're great, I don't feel like opening to them. I'm afraid of breaking our relations, of being hurt, of making them feel uncomfortable. I'm just so lost and stressed, if I could, I'd move to the forest, disappear, become a hermit.

Was a completely virtual thing but the human mind cannot understand difference between real and imaginary, so talking in psychological therms even virtual was real, so…

We never real met up by my fault but, all the time we passed together was like the love of our most beautiful dreams - and for her too because all things she told me during our entire time together.

I have my failures and she’s her failures, but use to understand each other, accept and never real break-up or fight - and even when we fight, we used to come back mutually better.

When I was with her company (even virtual), I really felt me someone, I felt me loved, important, stronger.

All I wanted is to show her that she’s didn’t choose a looser, but I didn’t.

I never dream about really live a love but if it could happening so the person have to be exactly what I want and she was this person, exactly what one day I dreamed about.

I’m no one to her - only girl who I had something real, intense and truly by a time, so why someone more will consider me something?

During one of the times that we saw each other I was very pushy about certain sexual things, I begged and pleaded to touch her and she said no but I did it anyways, I'm very ashamed and hate myself for what I did, all I wanted to do was give her pleasure but she said no and I didn't respect that, I'm a horrible humanbing for what I did, and on top of that I wasn't  able to show up for things like here 18th B-day and graduation big life events that will never happen again. I thought things were ok because every time I would ask her if she was ok she said that she was and smiled and laughed, but after she graduated she changed. She told me about everything, that I wasn't trying hard enough and about what I did, so then I tried as hard as I could, I did everything that she wanted me to do, I found different ways to show her that I love her over long distance, but during that I didn't do one thing and that was give her space, the one thing that she really wanted and I didn't give it to her and I again didn't realize that I was doing something that was hurting her.

I physically tic when I feel or think about them. It’s the only way I can stay moving 

It’s so much harder when I’m alone. I’m so thankful to have my boyfriend but recently he’s been busy and hasn’t been able to see me after my work a few days out of the week and those days, when I come home to nothing, I find myself swallowed in my own feelings of pain and intrusive thoughts 

When I spent some time in rehab I would write in detail the horrible things in my mind and read them to my therapist but I don’t think that is going to help me anymore 

I cannot shake the thought out of my mind that I would trade anything I have now up to not have ever existed. 

I don’t know what to do to fill the void. Recently no games have been fun so all I do is try to start conversations in Instagram comment sections and watch YouTube videos about cars

We became good work buddies, shared plenty of personal stories with each other. We were great partners.  
We both left the job to pursue higher education at the same time. She's in Canada. I'm in the US.  
Before leaving, I confessed and asked her out although I knew she was taken. Was shooting my shot.  
She just laughed it off and continued being friends with me.

Out of the blue, I stopped talking to her. She noticed that and asked why. Told her I don't wanna be in the friendzone. She said she really admires me and likes talking to me and insisted on staying connected instead of letting go off the friendship.

But she doesn't reciprocate anything. Doesn't lend a ear to my issues like I do for hers. None of the basic friendship stuff.  
I'm just getting hurt staying in contact with her and having this constant reminder that I can never have her.

2714,plycuda71,1658019225,1,"So for some context I am 23 and have been living a hermit lifestyle for the past 3 years or so. I was suffering badly from lonliness before that (no friends, not close with family) and eventually something snapped and I decided to stop trying to change my situation and just accept it. And this kinda worked. I became happy/content in my life. I didn't have to worry about trying to impress people or put on a fake persona. Dark days became very few.

Anyway long story short a new person has come into my life. They have a very positive and energetic vibe which is something I'm missing so I guess that's why I feel drawn to them. She just moved here and I was basically the first person her age that she met. Anyway we've hung out a few times since then despite a part of my brain telling me it's a bad idea and that I should just go back to hermit lifestyle. 

This point of this post is because I don't know what to do about this situation and I need help. I feel like we have a decent enough time together, however despite the fact that she's more outgoing and talkative than socially anxious me, I'm the one who is always trying to start conversation to avoid awkwardly sitting there in silence. It's as if she has no interest in getting to know me but then why hang out with me in the first place? She seems fine making conversation with other people. I just don't know. Im beginning to think I'm just being used as temporary company until she makes some real friends. But for me this is the first 'friend' I've been able to make in several years and I can't stop thinking about it. I can't get it out of my head. This is why i cut myself off a few years ago. I can't deal with all these thoughts and confusion. I don't want to be thinking about her/the friendship all the time but I don't know how to stop it.

This is the second time I've left for some time to collect myself, the first time we were apart for 8 months and he reached out to me when he noticed I was back because he was waiting for me. However I unfortunately was still not in the best mental state during that time either, so we talked for one last time. 


This time I had said that I don't want to make anyone wait (referring to him) as I made it clear that I maybe not returning again and that this is something I had to do alone, he was very understanding, he stated that he'll unfortunately be fine if we never speak again but as long as I got better and then said he'll miss me. 


I've been missing him a lot today, our friendship was a really kind one that I hold dear, but I don't want to let my traumas and toxic traits ruin what we have, I don't want to hurt him or myself in the process. It makes me scared. I told him I would get better but I find myself just repeating that to myself without making any actual healing. I'm still a trainwreck mentally and emotionally, and I really don't want to burden that onto him, my traumas only appear when I'm getting close to someone, and the fear and anxiety of it overwhelms me that I have to distance myself from them. 


I would love to have him in my life still, but I guess I'm just too afraid of what can happen if I reach out and what may become of our friendship.

Have you ever felt like all the conversations and connections you ever made were meaningless.
with friends, work friends, sexual partners, Ex's and even famly. 
makes you feel like you never fully open with them and it shows, and that is why all of those connections fade away so quickly.

I recently broke up from my 3 year GF(long story)
she was the world to me,
after we've lived together and talked to each other everyday(before the breakup).
it went from once a week to once a month and now to not at all in just 3 months.

feels like most of my friends and people in general that i made contact with never actually stood around for long, a big part of it is my fault, Because i dont like to go out asmuch as everyone.

but still that makes me wonder if i'll marry someone will those so called friends will even come to the wedding? or we've lost connection for so long that everyone will think I dont really want them to come because we have'nt stayed in contact

and oviously the famly will come but its the same here is it only because they are supposed to? because i've been losting connection with them too. (i live in a diffrent city)
and we cant communicate that well because my weak foreign language, It became really bad after  19 years living in a diffrent country.

I know four languages. I write prose in my native language, and I am constantly praised for my “excellent writer skills and author potential”. I am what people usually refer to as “smart”, but what does intelligence mean, when no one wants you? 

I consider myself attractive, and some have said that I am cute. Still, no one wants to be with me. No one loves me in a romantic way: as a matter of fact, no one has ever loved me in a romantic way. I have been on dates, and I have had countless of conversations with all sorts of guys. This spring, I was on the very verge of entering into a relationship with a guy I had dated for several months - or so I thought, for it turned out that he was not attracted to me. I discovered that he had went out dancing with some other guy, and it broke my heart: shattered it into millions of pieces I still have not completely managed to pick up. For weeks, I felt so incredibly worthless and profoundly depressed. Turns out I was not worthy of his love. 

My Achilles' heel is my “clinginess”, which most likely stems from an emotionally neglected upbringing with a narcissistic mother. In this world, clinginess is looked down upon. One should not be clingy, but rather “independent” and “self-confident”. This is a symptom of an individualistic society, in which the independent, self-realised individual is worshipped as some sort of god: an idol.

I absolutely hate reading about “self-love” and “comfort food” and “love yourself before you love someone else”. That sort of mentality sounds so incredibly narcissistic to me. I want to give love, and I want to be loved; I do not want to live in an egoistic bubble of “self-love”. I refuse to adhere to the egocentric, narcissistic mindset of “Me, Myself, and I”.

I just want someone to kiss me good morning while making me a cup of coffee, someone who brings me flowers, someone who declares his love for me. I want someone who truly loves me for who I am, and yes, that includes my clinginess.

I like to think I’m very charming and I can make people laugh and I’m decent looking but maybe I’m only good on the surface and when someone gets to know me I’m scared and don’t think they’ll like me so I just end things. My longest relationship has only ever lasted a few months and then I found it to just be stale. On top of that every time I’ve had sex I honestly did not like it. I’m not sure if it’s been because of the people or it was just me. I’ve only ever really liked one girl(H) but fucked it up way too early and hate myself because of it. I haven’t dated anyone in about 2 years and honestly think I’m just doomed to not be in a relationship. I have very low self-everything and I just think I’ve come to the conclusion that I won’t really ever find someone and I think I just have to come to terms with it.

If that could have been achieved i wonder how many people might have been helped. 

 Doesn't it kind of suck that we cant even get that right ? The men hating on women and the women hating men. The men sexually harassing the women even online and the women cutting them down saying they cant be lonely its just their dick. Idk it just makes me sad the division is not worth it.

Then I later found out he cheated on me while we were together with his tutor who I’ve warned him to stay away from since I can clearly tell she have a crush on him. I caught him and her together dining in our favourite restaurant just a week after our breakup and had a public meltdown. He confessed that he reached out to her while he ghosted me. After our so called breakup, he been seeing me sleeping with me behind his gf back, told me he is 
coming back to me multiple times, called and ended things with that girl via phone call in front of me, and then disappeared and went back to her afterwards.

2803,itaukeimushroom,1657975203,1,"I lost my best friend a few months ago and I feel like I died with that relationship. 

I’m in limbo between teen and adult right now, and they say that these years are usually the hardest. 

This summer would have been a year since we first met. She was like a sister to me, and I can’t stop thinking about all of the memories we made together this time last year. I wasn’t allowed to have friends growing up, and for the first time, I found someone who seemed at the time to genuinely care, even though it turned out otherwise.

Ever since she left I’ve been frantically running around trying to make friends. I’ve been taking care of myself, working my behind off, focusing on school, going to therapy, etc., going out to social events, but nothing seems to work.

This crippling emptiness that I feel in my chest where she once was can’t be filled with “self care” or “therapy” or “medication.” It just feels so empty.

I don’t miss her because I know she wasn’t a good person, but I miss the feeling of having someone there. Someone to go places with. Spend time with. Someone to care for.

When she left me, she had other friends to turn to. People who call her every day, multiple times a day, people who care about her well-being, go out with her, send her gifts, or text her. I see her almost every day. She seems to be doing well without me. 

But I don’t have any of that. Not a single person checks up on me, and all of my efforts to socialize have been in vain. I take myself out to events in the city in hopes of meeting new people. Nothing. I volunteer. Nothing. I work, but still nothing. I’m in school, but nothing there either. 

I don’t even see what’s the point of having a phone anymore, other than to tune out the loudness of my painful thoughts. No one texts me, calls me, or checks up on me. No one really cares about me. 

It’s hard not to feel worthless when people could care less whether you live or die. It’s hard to keep trying when the only results you see are in your head. I have friends there, but I can’t touch them, and I miss the feeling of hugs. 

I know if I keep going, one day I will reach happiness and find a friend. But this in between is so agonizing, and I’ve never felt more alone before. 

I was conditioned to see people as bad and stay to myself when I was younger, and I did. I was happy then, by myself. I tried doing that again as a teen, but it’s not the same anymore. Once I got a taste of friendship and it was taken away from me, it was like a drug. The physical and emotional pain I feel every day I spend alone is like a withdrawal symptom. I can barely function. 

Therapy isn’t helping. Seeking help isn’t helping. I have a job but no friends there. I volunteer but I have no friends there. I have no friends in school, but I’m hoping this year will be different. I’ve tried so hard. Harder than you could even imagine.

I feel like I’m destined to be this way forever, and if I am, this isn’t a life that I want to complete. Maybe if I go now, I can get a better chance in another life. A chance to finally be worthy enough of someone’s time.

I just really wish I had someone who genuinely cared. Not because they have to because it’s their job, not because they want my money or they feel sorry for me, but because they see me as someone worthy enough of love. Because they care somewhere deep in their heart, about someone as worthless as me.",lonely,"I just want someone to care, genuinely.",2022-07-16 22:40:03

2807,SincerelyJackson,1657970425,1,"So I’m entering my senior year after summer break, and to give some background I’ve always been pretty lonely. I would only really ever have 1 main friend and sometimes just none, and it never really bothered me. I’ve never had a girlfriend or been really close to it, I’ve had girls at school ask for my number but I usually end up ignoring them at some point, honestly I’m not sure why. But the main point is I feel like a complete failure, this has never annoyed me up until recently and I’ve realized how much I’ve missed out on and how much of a loser I feel like. Why am I like this? I create this emptiness in myself. It’s my fault, i don’t think I’m ugly, I think I got decent style and stuff. I don’t really struggle with social skills, at least like small talk or whatever because I’ve never gone deeper than that. Maybe I just find the loneliness easy. Now, I feel it is too late to try to create a ton of friends and make these high school memories and enjoy my ending teenage years as I should have. I just feel like a loser no memories, no first kisses, no stories to tell, just a damn loop of everyday being the same. I’m also just a boring person. Deep conversation would go no where with me, I haven’t really experienced a whole lot. I don’t really have hobbies, maybe playing games but I have grown tired and bored of that as I’ve grown up. I’ve been playing basketball and hitting the gym every once in a while but at the end of the day I still feel unaccomplished, behind, lost and alone. I’m worried this will never change; that I will live life like this forever and it’s starting to hurt me as I grow because I should be having these experience or should have already had them. I don’t want to live like this, but I feel as it is too late to escape. Unless I go to college and maybe have more opportunities there, what will I do? I guess I will see where life takes me, but the emptiness is slowly catching up to me and I’m starting to question what I value, and my meaning",lonely,"17M, alone and lost",2022-07-16 21:20:25

I did get a job cleaning hospitals during covid but that was stressful.

I relied on alcohol for social situations and after getting cheated on, but I managed to quit that by becoming a workaholic, working full time and part time without any days off. This kept my mind busy, but I did not get any time to socialize. I now realize that I haven't addressed my past issues. When my family member passed away, I couldn't even cry, I just felt numb.

Most of my close friends moved out of this country and I haven't made any friends since then. I struggle with social anxiety and loneliness. My social anxiety was so bad that it took me several months to attend a meetup. I can talk to strangers now and regularly attend meetups, but the biggest problem I'm facing now is that I just don't know how to connect with people, form friendships and bond. I tend to only talk about formal and introductory topics, but not personal ones. I can sense that people around me don't feel at ease. I suppose it's my fault since I'm not comfortable with myself.

I took advice from posts about making new friends, so I started to attend meetups. I have met several people from meetups and gone on hikes repeatedly with the same people, but couldn't make a single friend. I did not ask for anyone's phone number either. I just felt they would say no and wouldn't be comfortable around me. I wasn't always like this though. I loved to talk, have conversations, share stories, ideas, and life experiences, but when I'm with people, I just feel blank.

I've realized and reflected the past few days that everything she's been saying was right and that I haven't been hearing or listening to her.

When we first started talking I jumped right in and as I always do I had mistook my crush as love and I looked through rose tinted glasses. 

What's worse is that I had been wearing a few metaphorical masks without realizing it. 

The past few days have been spent reflecting on everything and trying to remember who I used to be before I wore masks to protect myself from reality.

I've been reaching out to people for advice and listening to them for once, and I have been internalizing it all too.

The more I realize she was right, the worse I feel about how I've been to her and others around me. 

I've been selfish and impulsive.

Change isn't easy, especially when you're already an adult, and it takes someone seriously special to get someone to want to change let alone see their own red flags.

I'm ashamed of myself and I really have been working over the past few days to change myself.

The only social activity I look forward to all year is Anime Iowa, and I haven't missed it in 16 years, aside from the year they didn't have it because of the pandemic. This year though, I had it all planned out, including the fancy hotel to make up for the trash hotel I stayed at last year. The price tag on the fancy place seemed like a good idea at the time, as I wanted to splurge, but the closer it got, the less confident I was in dumping that kind of money on the con for just me. After a while I essentially talked myself out of going at all and cancelled the room reservation. I have my cosplay ready, and I still have a week, I could potentially find someone to stay with, but I can't get myself to ask anyone. It would have to be an acquaintance at best since my usual crew has dwindled to nothing, so that doesn't help.

I know to not come off too strong, but also friendships do take some effort on both sides. I put my effort in, and I never get the same returned to me. Many have just fallen through, but tonight another one did. He and I have been talking a bit more lately since we've been very lonely and depressed. Come this weekend he hits me with ""Oh I'm going to go head out and see the girl I was talking to this weekend"" and proceeds to rant about how he won't be single after this weekend and how he'll get to do all the things I want to do with someone. He invited me over to his place, for it to be a safe haven. So I could be held by someone and cry before watching a show with pizza to stuff our faces with. But now that he has a girl, that's not gonna happen. I'm not going to exist in his world anymore. I was simply someone he could talk to while trying to find someone to date. I never liked him more than a friend, but I seriously want my person to find me. All around I see people meeting their person and their life falling into place, and then there's me. The complete opposite. I'm honestly really doing well mentally, emotionally. I'm at a bump in the road currently, but I'm doing well. I told myself don't date until you're to this point. Now I just want someone to share life with. Those spontaneous adventures you take before getting ice cream or food on the way home to cuddle and watch a movie before taking a nap together. Staying in on rainy or snowy days, baking something together, doing hobbies. It might sound cheesy, but I just want to build a genuine connection with someone. And it to mean something. Not something someone could throw away in seconds. I want a bond that grows and grows and only strengthens with time. I want something real. I want love. I thought I've experienced what true love feels like, but it turns out I really haven't. All my past relationships have not been the greatest. I always feel super happy and lovey dovey, before the red flags start to really shine and show themselves. And then I'm the bad guy for ending things when in reality, I know it's better for the both of us. I don't regret any of my past relationships. But I wish I could find one that lasts for years, that's safe, comfortable, healthy, real. I feel like that's all we want. But there's a part of me that's just longing so badly for that connection with someone.... It's all too much to ask for isn't it? We all have our standards and expectations. And I feel like mine are too much, even though I've been told countless times it's just the bare minimum. I'm not used to common human decency. See, I'm someone who used to bend over backwards to help people as much as I could. People like us never get the love and care we give, back in return. We don't know what it's like to be cared for, feel worthy, loved, wanted. But that's what I want more than anything right now.

The average demographic of these events were boomers that completely look down on me and make stupid insulting remarks about my appearance.

Sometimes, this is about big things in which I’m really different — e.g. I think the concepts of marriage and family are wrong, that they just discriminate against women and poor people (keeping people down because their parents were poor) and those things should be deconstructed (but I wouldn’t refuse to be friends with someone who disagrees, has a family… my one twitter mutual is always tweeting about her baby and I don’t hate her for it, she knows I feel this way and apparently doesn’t hate me for it) — and sometimes I get beaten up for opinions I would have thought would be the majority — e.g. the fandom of a book I like hated me for not liking this one character when that character’s defining trait is that he’s racist, and he kills someone and frames someone else in order to trick another character into joining his genocidal campaign. 


I mean, I guess I should be grateful that I do have one twitter mutual, even though we never really talk. I translate for a fandom event, but no one ever participates in English.

Art/writing links are in my profile if you’re interested (because I’m sick of getting comments like “where’s your art?” so I send a link and then they’re just like “ew”.)",lonely,I’m going to die of loneliness today if I don’t find a friend.,2022-07-16 13:17:27

Hi. I read a lot of people's stories so, here's mine!

I'm 48F and I live close to Sacramento, California. I don't have any friends, except for maybe the girls I work with at my job. I have 2 kids and I'm married to a man I should never have married. He's emotionally abusive at times, controlling and has horrible anger issues. I can't talk to him without him getting angry over something. I can never share my feelings without him calling me a baby or turning everything around on me! I'm miserable, depressed, lonely and it's excruciating. I drink a lot because it makes me feel better, even though I usually end up crying. I've felt like this for years. Never happy, never satisfied with life. Always wanting someone and something i can never have. I just want to fall in love and be LOVED in return. I want Someone who i can talk to, someone who wants to do things with me and put me first for once. When I was young and naive, all I wanted was to find that guy, fall in love, get married and have a couple of kids. All I ended up doing was getting married to an abusive man and having a couple of kids.  Can anyone relate to me? I would love to talk to someone who feels like I do.

2901,AWeeBae,1657929087,1,"Ever since I moved into high school 3 years ago I had no friends. (British high school ) In high school there forms a hierarchy where the popular people are those which are confident and are suitable in being a mate. Looks do matter but it doesn’t mean everything. 
If you aren’t in the popular group, you are in the other friend-groups, which is on decided by which class you’re in. If you aren’t in the popular group from any of the classes, then you are friends with the remaining members from your class. Typically, all of these people are unconfident and are not suitable for being an ideal mate. 
Or you’re a loner.
I was part of the non popular group, and they don’t like me. Being in that friend group is a toxic environment where everyone is being fake to try to be liked. In the popular group, there are a lot of fake people too, but I do know good people in it. 
So I want to become part of the popular group, but the issue is is that I have no friends, and in order to become part of the popular group you need to have self respect and confidence, but currently I don’t have much right now as I have never had anyone who’s cared for me to make myself feel valued and loved. So everyday I try my hardest in school to get people to like me. I work out to make sure my testosterone levels are high, I shower everyday and have skincare, I have improved my posture, I eat high protein foods, I have improve tongue positioning and nose breathing, I have abandoned discord where I waged time talking to people online, I give people compliments, I try to think positively, I am no longer a pushover and exert confidence and talk to people I don’t even know. But I believe my true self past of being a loser has tainted my image so badly everyone perceives what I say with no value at all, as no matter all of this I still have no friends as I had no self respect. My self respect was so low to the point my perception of right and wrong was so obscured that I had no clue what I was saying was right and I second guessed myself every second and I still do, but I’m getting better. This also happened because of school drama where people made lies of me saying death threats because they either misinterpreted what I said or they said it because it would make them look like a victim and it would raise their popularity because people feel sorry for them. This happened 1 1/2 years ago and I still feel the consequences.
Despite this, I still try to be positive, but I won’t give up. Please give me motivation. 

Also, i have realised humans are evil, every kind action they do isn’t genuine and simply an action to raise their popularity, it’s literally a form of Stockholm syndrome where they end up genuinely feel like they’re doing a good action as they want to hide from the truth, which is the fact they’re doing it for their own goals. This is from personal experience and science, as humans were like this as in Hunter gatherer days as to join the tribe they had to lie to make others perception of them more positive if they wanted them to be accepted.

However, I realised I can’t change human biology and they can’t control it, neither can I, so I don’t judge them for it. This is also why world peace is not achievable.

Also I assume a few male people will be seeking a partner, so I’ll give you some info I gathered on women and this may help you. Women demand self respect. You need to be confident in your abilities, and you can’t take any bs. They don’t want weakness. That’s why they see ugly people as creeps, as if you’re ugly you're biologically likely to be weaker as being hot or ugly is loosely dependent upon how strong you are. If you’re weak, they feel uneasy and scared as they feel vulnerable. This again comes from Hunter gatherer days. Because of this, your confidence plunges which makes you even less likely to find a mate. These two factors makes you unable to land a mate or even a friend in my case, so, what you need to do is to find brothers who support you and who you support and you need to grow with them and gain self respect and confidence, then once it’s gained finding women will be a breeze from what I’ve absorbed, that’s what I’m trying to do right now but I don’t have the confidence to ask one of the nicest, confident popular people I know to be more friend. I hope this helps.

2907,Silver_Party_3554,1657927633,1,"I'm going to be alone forever because I can't get close to anyone. I feel so many things and all of them are painful. Apparently I've been broken from the start, I was the weird loud tall annoying kid who was never taught good hygiene and always had on clothes that were falling apart. So I was well and truly shunned by the rest of the kids in school. In elementary school the only kid that talked to me was the one who got made fun of for pulling his pants and underwear all the way down at the urinal. Not only did no clothes ever fit but I always had disgustingly long hair. Not only did I blame myself for all these things, but whenever I brought them up to my parents they got angry at me for being spoiled or for not wanting a haircut before now. And I internalized and believed their excuses. No one wanted to be around me because I was actual human trash with no redeeming qualities, and I didn't even realize why people seemed to look down on me. And I haven't even gone into the abusive but never home and nothing is ever good enough dad or the hoarder mentally abusive/manipulative and suicide threatening mom, who I still just want the love and approval of. So after realizing just how fucked up my brain is due to its inherent flaws and its developmental stimuli, I've decided that it would be unrealistically unfair and unjust to burden someone with... Me. 
My existence seems to be endless self induced mental pain and anguish that I am, as of yet, powerless to stop. I don't want to offload that suffering onto anyone else like I know I have a tendency to do. So I think I'll remain single forever, even though I love people pretty hard. And I don't want to live like that, so I think I won't. 

I don't blame women for not wanting a relationship with me at all, if it were me. I'd swipe left on myself every single time. At this point though I'm so far behind in the ""curriculum"" that I might as well just quit. 

My brain is broken and can't be fixed, and i can't abide by that.",lonely,"I'm so lonely, I can't do this anymore.",2022-07-16 09:27:13

They were just feeding an addiction I have come to terms with. But I'm just realizing how lonely healing is. I mean I have a boyfriend who I live with, he's great. But he is a gamer and has gamer friends. So when he plays I'm kinda left by myself, since I'm not really a gamer myself. I'm not upset at my boyfriend for gaming, I mean that's his hobby and it makes him happy. 
I just want to know how to make friends? Because I am putting myself out there, I have almost all socials. I even have bumble BFF lol but ik it takes time. I just want someone at least. Everyone eventually ghosts me, idk why. The 2 friends I do have are extremely busy and are almost never available and again not upset at them. Just more of I guess upset with myself. It's beginning to feel like it's my fault. Like somethings wrong with me. I'd like to believe I'm a good friend, but I guess we're all villains in someone's story.

My personality type is ISFJ and Google says I am compatible with ESFP, ISFP, and ISTJ , however, there is always an exception right so I am not limited to those personality types. My goal in life is: teaching people the three languages that I know; earning as much money as I can and have my own house.

I have been working and working and working without realizing that I am also as lonely as hell. Been depressed for a long time but I am still struggling and moving forward although I know life is hard.

I have been dreaming of meeting a man who can accompany me for the rest of my life; someone there for me when I am sick; someone who kisses me whenever Im sad; someone who plays games with me whenever we have free time; someone who enjoys food with me whenever we have the chance; I miss the warm feelings I had back in 2004, when my family and I, though poor, still laughed and enjoy each other's company. I miss the smell, the taste of it and I cried every time I think of those precious memories. Can you help me replay those memories?

I believe that LDR works if both people communicate.

I am looking for someone who:

\-Expressive of himself, of how he feels, values communication and loves his girlfriend

\-Not easily lose interest

\-Have a good job so later I can move to your country. Otherwise, you can come here. -Be responsible for your life and know how to value yourself and others

\-Proactive in most of the things.

\-Can spend time for me, at least 30 min per day.

\-Preferably older or the same age as me (24-37)

Everything seems so bleak and everyday nothing seems to change. Just about 2 years ago, I started senior year and nearly everyone I knew for 4 years left for some other school. I ended up talking, meeting, and being acquainted with other people but that's all I ever was.  An acquaintance. Growing up, I began resenting ""family"". Home is mostly always so problematic so I keep to myself. Usually in my room 24/7, it's why I feel so ecstatic when a friend of mine agrees to go somewhere with me. I REALLY don't like  who I'm supposed to be related to, I know it might have a negative impact on myself, but I'm aware enough of what happens in my life that I know isn't healthy, so I know I'm mentally capable enough to deal with it. The only form of love I know that I can get from somewhere else isn't platonic or sexual, just romance. I hate almost every waking moment of my life. It's probably why I get easily attached to any girl that shows me the slightest bit of attention. I fail every relationship I try to get into. I also know I'm not exactly desirable. Currently, there's someone who I thought could be a friend if nothing more, but even she started ignoring me most of the time. EVERYONE who I thought was a friend or could spare a second to talk to me isn't really there when I need it. For the past school years I try to do well on whatever work I was given and would pride myself when discussing something I was slightly good at whenever talking to my friends. Regardless of what you're discussing, who wouldn't want to look good or better, right? I never say this openly for obvious reasons, but I'm SO pathetic. I believe it's a virtue to not be insecure, but I crave attention and as much as I want to, I can't make the changes I want in my life. I cry myself to sleep at some points during these past months and whenever someone I liked strayed away from me I'd cry too. I can't help but hold on to the idea that they might be busy or something, but deep  down I know they're just not interested, but I keep pushing it, hoping they'd start caring about me. I hate this about myself. Not a single day goes by where I'm not mad or wish I lived a better life. Not a single day goes by where I'm confused if I even have a chance. She told me she already is interested in someone else, which is funny because she used to tell me that relationships are poison. I put too much faith in her words, I guess. Despite this, I seek her attention above everyone else's. It's pointless, but I can't help myself. I wonder if she already knows because of how obvious I make it. I like her, but I never really told her. It's probably best that I do soon just so she can finally reject me and distance herself. It's bound to happen so at least it'll be over. Personally, I don't believe much of the stuff I see on the internet. I thought posts like these are mostly empty made-up sentiments. Yet here I am, making one.

Up until two years ago, I thought it was normal for people to just talk at me instead of having a conversation. The other outcasts did it, even my father and sister did and still do.

This is problematic since the other day one of my friends got annoyed with me that I don't seem to ask questions or respond to things he says.

Are you overweight? Go to the gym, get a 6 pack, and come back and tell me you're depressed. Oh wait, you can't!

No matter if you are male or female we don’t give the people who may be good for us a chance and at the same time society is also likely skewing people to behave in a way that makes them a poor candidate for dating 

I’ve crushed on people of different social statuses in terms of wealth though maybe they all came from the same poor ish background. My biology hardwired me to look for attractiveness and society sold it and fed it to me

My standards for marriage may be high but not unreasonably so. I’m not looking for anything in terms of appearances, it’s ok if someone is a little ugly or fat. I myself score decently for attractiveness 


We put a cap on relationships 
There is a limit to how close you can get to friends and family
A cap based on whether someone is within you league or beyond it
A cap on whether we could consider someone a lover someday or not based on if we see them as a fiend or romantically
And we don’t ask or teach me  and women to grow and develop te skills needed to lift their marriage ability or databilty number

I get discouraged. I go from the one with a open heart to shutting everyone out because I can’t get close enough to anyone. I know the theory behind choosing and finding a good partner, but I can’t latch onto it. Nobody sees me the same way even though I’ve been told I am attractive.

I was a minor so an adult had to be present to claim them and attend too. I made arrangements with the girls father who I asked to go. I would meet at their house. Get the tickets. Have fun I was really into music. 
 
The concert was only about 3 miles away. But I was riding my BMX 20' bike to meet up. As I was crossing the intersection in the crosswalk a car driver paying more attention to adjusting the radio dial ran the stop sign hitting me a cause me to be flung at a centrifugal force of 65 mph head/face first into the windshield. I awoke in the hospital 6 days later watching the concert replay on MTV. Trying to understand what happened. 

I sustain massive head trauma and post traumatic amnesia, that was starting to regain. Forehead and face looking like raw hamburger meat. Recovered over the summer. Because of my elementary grades and what scores for What little 8th grade I attended there they passed me to 9th grade high school  and gave me the Pre SAT placement test. Telling me I am in some subjects college level and 12 grade. But due to math being low and PE required I will not be promoted remain in 9th but attend 2 classes at Cal State University. The reminder will be at the high school almost next door to the college. 

When I got home and told Mom the news, she informed me that she had already arranged to move back to the city of my Jr high school. In that district Jr high is 7th, 8th and 9th so I have to go back to the same school. Her friends live there and we are returning to the restaurant to work.  I return to Sequoya Jr high where they say they know me better and disregard the high school recommendations. I need to take another year in 8th grade. 
I was pissed but had no say in that case. Start to work, got promoted to cook more money, but had to go to the graveyard shift. I didn't care they cheated me out of a great education opportunity so  I rather work a good paying job then put up with their BS. They didn't like that I found a way I could legally ride my motorcycle underage obtaining a learner permit only to JR high. And there was nothing they could do. The vice principal of the school was a former police detective of 25 years and had a problem with me being smart Mouth long haired punk.  And I dropped out, Working. 

Not being able to hang out with people my own age, I hung out with the older crowd. Reunited with my former baby sitter. Mom beat friends daughter. And we kinda became attached. We married 3 days after I turned 18. 3 months later she's diagnosed with ovarian cancer. They said it was due to a botched abortion,  at 14 she was a victim sexual assault.  3 months after that we buried her. 

Another young lady I had met earlier that year at a Bon Jovi concert and kinda friended started spending time to console me. And keep me on track focusing on my musical dream of being lead vocalist and guitarist of my in the works Big Hair Heavy Metal/ 70's-80's cover band. She got my affection and became my GF.  6 months into our relationship we get into an argument. She leaves mad heading to her dad's in the mountains. At the steepest Cliff about 200 yard straight shear wall. She attempting to pass a 18 wheeler on the right lane. Realizing his position was wrong attempting to get in the correct lane, not seeing her. Pushes and forced her over the side. Police say she must have rolled over more than 100 times before landing on the roof and crushing her. But she was probably already gone before hitting bottom. I was devastated, dead from the inside. Started to drink whiskey heavily, meth, cocaine, smoking, plus screaming lyrics I blew out my vocal cords. Ending my music dreams.

This is a long story but for the sake of you readers, I’ll shorten it. I grew up around the same people my whole life, we each knew each other in different ways (met at school, since childhood, through another friend) and we’re all great friends. We did everything together and one day I was thrown out of the group. I was only told that it was because I was selfish and heartless. This destroyed me for a while because I couldn’t figure out where this had come from. Fast forward about two years, I had made friends with two new people, they had also been thrown out of the previous group. We bonded over this unfortunately. We had so much hatred for the previous group, it was unbelievable. But eventually, I realized I was wrong. I ended up making up with the previous group who admitted that they had been wrong. The group then merged again and we became whole but it didn’t last long. I ended up being thrown out again, this time though they couldn’t think of a genuine reason. They did it just because. It didn’t hurt as much this time, I have no idea why. I grew accustomed to being alone, it was actually very nice at some points and at others I felt horrible. Until recently they decided they had been wrong again and reached out to me. Apparently I forgive too easily because I told them it was alright and that I held no grudges. And I honestly don’t. But now that things have progressed and I’m actually hanging out with them, I feel horrible. Like my social battery instantly drains the second I say hello. I just don’t feel like I’m actually there. Like it’s a dream in some ways, or more like a nightmare since I always feel uneasy. I do still care about these people despite everything and some of them have shown genuine remorse but it isn’t the same anymore and it just makes me uncomfortable. I hate how lonely it feels to be in a group that has shown they’ll leave when or if it conveniences them.

Like I say in nearly every single one of these posts, I've been alone my entire life. The only time I haven't was a LDR that lasted five years, and even that I'd never consider a real thing seeing as she never wanted to meet -- yet somehow we did. That story's neither here nor there, though. 



Time and time again I've met women. There's always been that special girl in my life that I've never been able to seal the deal with. I attribute it mostly to extenuating circumstances like she's already seeing someone, but there's always a reason why things simply **CAN'T** work out. Without fail. 


Last girl I just met was through work. She's feckin awesome -- we hung out an entire one time and she hasn't wanted to make time to do it again. She'll tell me how busy she is because she's going into the army and has a full-time job that she's about to leave and this and that and yadda yadda... But I just think it's cruel for me to be placed in this situation in the first place.

3053,Tobeastrife,1657850779,1,"Men, especially straight men, are so often expected to wholeheartedly seek out, accept, and cherish sexual relationships with women; to take what they can get, essentially. Meanwhile, women are so often expected to remain virginal, chaste, ""pure""; to resist the predatory hands and gaze of the lust-driven men who wish to corrupt them.

Both of these expectations are attempts to control human sexuality.

I'm male. I feel lonely just about every day. It's a hollow, aching feeling, and I don't think I've ever truly escaped it. Ironically, I feel the least lonely when I'm alone, maybe because then there is no reminder of how inescapably *different* I am, how *incompatible* I am with the people around me.

But this loneliness does not come from a yearning for sex. While I am mostly a virgin, my sex drive has always been lower than that of my peers, possibly due to my anxiety(?), and the antidepressants I am on (and have recently reduced the dose of) which made me basically asexual over the period I was taking the higher dose. I felt no drive for sex. I was in bed with someone who I was previously attracted to and who wanted to have sex with me. I felt no pull. In that moment I felt lonelier than I ever had before. Sex is the most extreme and obvious symbol for human connection. It is a literal connection, a melding of bodies. I couldn't even do that. How am I supposed to ever feel truly connected to others if I cannot even do that?

The truth is, sex is irrelevant when it comes to loneliness, at least for me. My loneliness is a feeling of division, separation from the rest of not just society, but the human race. I don't want sex, I just want to know someone, and I want that someone to know me. And I mean *truly* know. I want to be understood. And, I suppose, by extension, I want to be loved. Not even necessarily in a romantic way. Just *loved*, by someone who looks at me, sees me for everything that I am, and for whatever strange and wonderful reason enjoys that sight.

I suppose the reason why I felt motivated to make this post was seeing the number of discussions on here about virginity; how to lose it, fear of losing it, fear of not losing, remorse that you have lost it, etc etc. And the stereotype of lonely men as virgins, ""incels"" even, bitter at the world for not showing them the sexual attention they're looking for, envious of women who they perceive as being guaranteed sex, and by this (hopefully) mostly-fictional stereotypes own extension, a cure for any potential loneliness they may feel. Which is, of course, nonsense, as sex is certainly not a cure for loneliness, in fact it can intensify the feeling by quite a bit, going off my own experience I mentioned early. (Not that this hypothetical person would know that, of course.) It feels isolating, as a lonely and rather sexually inexperienced male, to see this narrative perpetuated. I couldn't care less about getting my dick hard; I just want to be seen.

So I guess my point, if I even have one, is... Loneliness goes deeper than a simple yearning for sexual, or romantic, attention. Everyone is lonely to different extents, the promiscuous and the pure, the celibate and the salacious. And yes, the man and the woman and the variations thereupon. All of these equally wonderful genres of human have the potential to feel the pain that we all feel.

So, have sex. Don't have sex. Want sex. Don't want sex. Whatever. It doesn't matter, and should never divide us. We're all in this same, awful boat. Maybe one day we'll reach the shore. :)

I live with 3 guys. They're great but two of them are with the girlfriends 90% of the time and the other spends a lot of time with his boyfriend. I'm left alone in our apartment often. The two with girlfriends just graduated and got ""adult"" jobs that pay well. I'm kind of jealous. I still have 2-3 years of school left and I'm constantly worrying I won't be able to get a job. they're also moving out soon, but it's not like it really matters since they're not around much anyway.

3071,dwgilbert007,1657839638,1,"I'm 54 this month. My mother was social slut, had her first at 16 the 3 son of 4. I was conceived in 1967. You know free love and all. I was not a wanted child. Father bailed out before I was born, mom didn't want me just another financial burden and slowed her social life. 1st half brother 8 year gap had no time for baby. But second half brother 3 year gap was no longer getting all the attention anymore and I did better than him so he was jealous ( the Kane and Abel syndrome) type of hate. So he would beat me up, punching, kicking, using thing to hit me with. As far back as I remember, I was still wearing diapers. At age 5 she hooked up with her 4th son father, for 2 years he would beat me twice a day. Along with big Bros beating. 

At age 7 I am walking home from school and am Run down bY a drunk driver, breaking both legs and almost completely bleeding to death ( Left leg was compound fracture and the bone (tibia) ripped through the flesh about 6 inches. So now I have to learn how to walk again after recovering and additional injuries from hospital incompetence and falls during rehab. But thankfully I got a break from the beatings. Pardon the pun. That was maybe a year. I had recovered so the beatings started again. Mom left him by my 8th birthday, so now she has tO go to work and didn't have day care, leaving the older in charge, ha all he did was hit me and belittle me, then leave. Leaving me alone with a 1year old. She worked 8 hours, granted I was in school most of the day. But she's still going out after work to play, spending time with friends and look for the next man. So I was home alone all night watching after baby. 
  
Well big Bro was hitting puberty so he started molesting me, him and some of his friends. Then beating and belittling. That last until I was about 11 years old and got big enough to make him regret me learning to defend myself. But I still had to not only fight him almost daily I no had bullies because I am intelligent (since birth) but the fact I went to a primarily black population elementary school, and I had to wear clothes that were originally my 2 older brothers handed down, or home made by my grandmother who grew up in the 1920's so I looked like BoB Hope and Bing Crosby actors from the 30's and 40'. So I was probably fight for my life everyday to go home and sit alone. 

I hit puberty technically at 13 but because of the abuse both Physical and sexual I developed a mental condition known as hypersexuality. Ok let's take stock.. never really been shown love, only violence. Never had a positive male roll model to show me how to be a man, nobody to give advice on the opposite sex- dating, spent most of the time alone or on the battlefield, and had a strange urge to masturbate often. Plus social anxiety, poor self esteem, and severe PTSD depression.  And a big brother bully, now Everytime he saw me talking to a girl, he would bully and belittle me, while trying to get her to have sex. So of course she would not talk to me anymore
 
I had a few girls that wanted to experience with me but I had no clue what so ever about what I was supposed to do. And the only guidelines I had to go by was a bunch of sluts (mom and her friends) complaining about how the men they dated treated like crap and them telling me to be nice to women treat them like fragile queens to be worshipped. Be the nice guy and everyone knows that Nice Guys finish last. so I had to figure that part out myself Too.

I can never get myself attached to people and don’t ever open up either and I know that it’s a part of why I can’t seem to create strong relationships.

When I see others in like beautiful and fusional relationships, it makes me profoundly sad. Why not me ? Why am I always the 2nd choice ? Why can’t I be someone’s favorite person like because they like me for who I am and not only my looks. And like almost every time the conversation revolves around my looks because I’m a model, like the person telling me I look hot or beautiful but they’re not interested in me, the real me. 

But I always hope that one day I would simply find someone that would make me feel like I can be loved. I hope that somebody will love me as much as I love them. I want to feel like there are no other worlds possible without this person. And I don’t know if it’s toxic but having bdp, I have to feel every single emotions 100%. Wether it is loneliness or love.

3107,Ohokayigetit94,1657824125,1,"I just want to vent about my experience around people pleasing as loneliness. Apologies in advance for the rambling

I’m learning I’ve been a people pleaser for a long time. So much so that sometimes it takes me a minute to process when I was doing it vs being myself. Sometimes I feel like idk who I am outside of that behavior. Then that gets me down sometimes and has me feeling lonely. 

I’m starting to understand that it’s difficult for me to build strong and genuine connections with people as a people pleaser, which also has me feeling lonely and disconnected. But at the same time, trying to figure out where I am underneath of all of that has been pretty heavy and confusing. 

I’m 27 and feel like I used to have a lot of friends, but now pretty much all of those friendships fizzed out. (I wonder if that’s because we didn’t genuinely connect or what the reasons for the friendships not lasting may be). I’m not close with my family that lives here just because it’s not healthy for me to maintain a consistent relationship with them. 

Idk I’ve never had an experience where I felt so alone so often and when I to try to fight feeling alone, I end up people pleasing and not actually connecting with people.

It’s a vicious cycle that I badly want to be out of but some days I feel so lost and fearful that I can’t get out of the cycle. 

One thing that’s also difficult in this cycle is the shame. Sometimes I am in situations where I feel I am connecting with people, but then the shame monster comes in and I think about how I must be the only person (Ik it’s not actually true but the feeling feels real) who doesn’t really have friends and what if the people I am potentially connecting with find that out and think I’m weird or something is wrong with me. Every time I see someone my age that I know, they have solid friendships that have lasted years and the fact that I don’t makes the connection process with new people feel more shameful if that makes sense. People will reference their friends and families and ask about mine and that’s when it hits me. 

I do have my good days when I’m more hopeful, but lately it’s just felt so hard. Sometimes I can’t escape the feeling that things may be like this for a long time.

3111,Adameyooo,1657822639,1,"What the hell I'm doing wrong?

Hi. I'm a 17 year old boy and I have nobody, and I'm starting to lose myself. Literally nobody but my family. There's some people at school that I'm talking with but not in a friend way. I tried to talk to girls but I don't know where I fucked up. Last time I met a girl at a park. (Before we go on I must tell that I know I'm not an ugly dude, I don't really consider myself attractive or hot but I'm an athlete, I work out a lot, and I have a decent face.) So I met a girl. In a more accurate way she started to stare at me. Constantly. I first thought it was just a coincidence but I was wrong. Me and my brother played at a Teqball table for 2 hours when this girl and her friend showed up at the table. They sat on a bench and watched us play. They just sat there, laughed and joking around for hours straight, sometimes I exchanged words with this girl I'm talking about. She's beautiful. She has dark hair, green eyes and freckles all over her face. So when It started to get late they started talking about quiet loudly about that they were going to head home. I thought now or never and I asked for her Instagram and she was shocked. She's started to smile but not in a weird way, it was the purest, most beautiful smile I ever seen. She said of course and i handed my phone to her. 

Later when i got home I thought I text her. She replied quiet fast and I asked her to go out tomorrow. She said yes and she added that she was about to ask for my instagram but she didn't know if she was symphatetic to me. (Ofc she was). We talked for hours we even talked about deep stuff. She said that she was taken advantage of many times and cause of it, she's got little self confidence I tried to comfort her in a polite way. She said that I'm not like other guys she used to talk, but in a good way. It really meant a lot to me. We texted each other goodnight about 1 am. 

So later that day we went out. Everything went fine, we talked about a lot of things. I mentioned that I'm living somewhere else, not far but somewhere else. She was a little dissapointed but i reassured her that if it comes to that I can catch a train and I'm here in 1 and a half hour. We planned an another date tomorrow and we were both excited about it. 

When we said goodbye it was a little awkward. She just stood there and looked In my eyes. I could help but stare in her emerald gems and because i found the situation awkward i hugged her. Then we parted. 

About 2 hours later I texted her if she was okay, and got home safe. She ignored me for hours. Long-long hours.

Tomorrow morning i texted her that I'll be available from 1 PM to the evening. She said she can't make it. She used periods. A couple hours ago I replied that it's fine, tell me when will her want to meet. When I write this reddit post, she's still not replied but hours went by. I don't want to fuck up again. I know her for about 3 days but I feel she's special. She's kind, really smart, and she has the most beautiful eyes in the world.

3120,abomination_boy,1657818454,1,"I'm 30 years old because I want something I can't have. I want a male partner who is not only okay with me being trans but more importantly their affectionate without being authoritarian / violence/controlling. That balance right there seems like something very hard to find.

It might be because I was sent to a special school that was supposed to be for kids with learning disabilities but was actually for disabled kids and juvenile delinquent to like. And then I was sent to a college for similar young adults. All my life I've been hanging with a really rough crowd. But I've never been able to find somebody who strikes that perfect balance. It feels like if I want to get with a partner who's actually affectionate and gives a shit about me then I have to accept that he's going to act really controlling and authoritarian, almost like he thinks he's my parent which I don't like. Every affectionate partner I had was also super overbearing. They wouldn't let me speak to any of my friends, they wouldn't let me have any time alone because they thought that I would cheat if I was left unsupervised for even a minute, and they tried to control everything I did like how I dress, how I did my hair, monitoring all of my online activity, demanding passwords to all of my social media accounts, demanding that I get rid of my cat (I only have one) demanding that I not eat certain things, listen to certain kinds of music, or watch certain TV shows. It's like I was looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend but instead I ended up with a jailer. It makes me wonder if maybe I'm just not cut out for a relationship if I'm not willing to put up with the constant accusations, micromanagement of my life, violence if I dare disobey, and being treated like a fucking toddler.

On the flip side you have safe men. Men who don't have violent tendencies, guys who aren't controlling, guys who are perfectly fine with me occasionally talking to my friends and hanging out with them as long as he gets invited. But at the same time those guys aren't affectionate at all. They're ice cold and really will only show any sign of getting a shit about me if they're bored. So it's like you can't have love and a healthy respect for the other person's autonomy in a relationship.

I know that someone being controlling and even violently jealous is just a sign that they care. But because I grew up with authoritarian parents that spells d a n g e r for me. When someone treats me like they already own me before I've even agreed to go out with them, it frightens me. If they're being pushy it scares me too. Same with lashing out violently towards anybody I hang out with as a friend. But if they don't do that it means they don't give a shit about me. But all of these signs that say that this person cares - acting controlling, not letting me talk to certain people, insisting on watching me like a hawk 24/7 so I don't cheat, threats of violence both towards me and anybody I interact with because they're that possessive over me, following me everywhere before we're even together, calling me 12 times a day while I'm at work and then getting angry if I don't answer - are frightening to me. I've brought this up to my therapist and she says it's because what I want from a relationship is unrealistic and I have to accept that if someone loves me this is how they're going to act. Is it even possible to have a significant other who cares about you without treating you like a disobedient child?

I'm not comfortable cutting off everybody just because I'm dating somebody. Because what happens if that relationship falls through? Or if they turn violent on me like they have in the past? I'll be fucked over with nobody to turn to but then again isn't that how relationships are supposed to work? Maybe it is too much to ask for a partner who is affectionate but not controlling. It's like my mom said. If your partner isn't controlling, they're just not into you.",lonely,I have unrealistic relationship expectations,2022-07-15 03:07:34

3143,Wayne_the_philosophr,1657796753,1,"Have you encountered any scenarios where someone showed interest but had no clue wtf was going? I've had plenty. There was this one time where I was a sophomore in highschool sitting on a concrete divider across a what seemed to be a worn down soccer field. I was sitting perpendicular to it facing the cafeteria, alone. This was back when I didn't give a single crap on how I looked. I was just minding my own business, swimming in my thoughts. I was looking to the side occasionally...but then I noticed 2 petite girls facing my area from across the field. I didn't pay any mind to it all. I just sat there, enjoying the peace and then a few minutes later I was taken by surprise. One of the two girls walked all the way across the fucking soccer field and said ""Hi, how come I haven't seen you around here?"". We exchanged words for 3-5mins. I can't accurately remember what I said but I remember thinking Wtf! Who? What? When? Where? Why? It just seemed so odd to me haha. Then I stood up cuz I got uncomfortable and I think she said like ""am I making you uncomfortable?"" I said I was fine but then she walked away ""I was like noo...wait"" She didn't hear me 🤦🏽‍♂️. Everytime I rethink that memory the song ""Baby come back"" always plays and by now I would've had experienced a relationship already lmaoo.

3145,ThatOneAussieRamen,1657792342,1,So basically I (m16) had a crush on this girl in my English class. I always tried to keep my distance and avoid eye contact but I always failed in the end. I noticed she began staring at me during class and I took this as a sign of hope. So one day in class I decided to sit next to her (it was a small class and teacher didn’t care where we sat) and try to talk to her before class started. I waited for her to arrive to class but she never did. I later found out she wasn’t at school that day. So I said no worries I’ll just talk to her tomorrow at lunch. The next day I saw her at lunch alone so I went and sat with her and we began talking. We talked about our classes and how the school year was ending and our plans for the summer. I actually felt like I had a chance with her but before I could ask for her number the bell rang for the end of lunch and she got up and left. I decided to catch her at the end of the day maybe since I knew she had the class next to my that day. So end of the day comes and I see her but I just chickened out and couldn’t do it so I just walked away and went home. Weekend goes by and on Monday I learned from my English teacher that she moved schools. I was heartbroken by this and blamed myself for not asking her when I had the chance. I became depressed as it was the only time I felt where my crush was actually interested in me. I started failing classes and just became a wreak in general and now school is close to beginning again and idk what to do with myself anymore.,lonely,Ruined my chance with my crush,2022-07-14 19:52:22

I’m still in contact with some of the friends but they all have their own lives and we don’t talk as much anymore. I just miss the old times we had messing around and having fun.

She’s passed a few words to me in person a couple of times and we’ve helped each other over social media with class work, one time up until 2am lol. I was never sure if she was being very friendly or showing a little interest with me, although I’m relatively confident she was just being super friendly.

We never spoke much in person because of where we were sat, because she was not in often and because I have really bad social anxiety. I eventually found out she had a boyfriend so I’ve tried to just move on but still haven’t. After some social media stalking between then and now I’m wondering if she has a boyfriend still.

My worry is that I’ll end up making her uncomfortable messaging her, someone I hardly know, about something not related to our class. I have no idea what I would even say either, maybe reply to one of her stories? To add to this, my classes all seem to know me as the quiet kid.

3175,Xoroshego,1657772894,1,"I often feel very lonely, so much it hurts my chest, in the moments before and when I get into bed. It's not exclusive to that time of day, though it feels more hopeless at those times of day. I often desperately crave cuddling, kissing (and yes sometimes more than that too, let's be frank) or like playful tickling when I lay down in bed. These are things that you can't really give yourself. 

I feel like most advice on how to deal with loneliness centres around making your life better as a whole, which could then lead to meeting new people. I agree with this, though it doesn't help late at night or 'in the moment'. It address the bigger picture, though not the smaller picture. 

I often get as comfy and cosy as I can with my weighted blanket, pillows and do my breathing exercises etc. though it doesn't provide too much consolation. 

I don't want to play any more games, or do any more gym workouts or read any more books, I want that compassionate touch from another person that can't be emulated by my own hands.

I suppose I should say that I sometimes masturbate, obviously, though often it doesn't scratch the itch as I don't really feel horny.... it's that I'm lonely instead. 

Doing all of these things in an attempt to cope is a bit like learning Spanish and then going to Portugal. Similar, yet not the same.

3226,No-Caterpillar-1384,1657753948,1,"Rant
I’m 21 years old and I live in the UK. I’ve had quite a large group of friends through out my teen years and they’re still around today. They’ve been very kind to me, looked after me in ways and have had a lot of laughs. Im not exactly treated as well as I’d like to be at times especially in certain situations I can feel that I don’t have needs met and I’ll question if they are true friends. I believe most of them could drop me in a second and forget about me. but they’re great in a way and I am quite lucky to have people in my life in general as I know a lot of people my age can not have such a luxury. 

However, over the last few years it’s faded slightly. I don’t think it’s them entirely. My ambitions in life have changed greatly, I guess is the way to put it. I wanna do a lot of things that they don’t seem very interested in and because of that I can’t live the life I want to live especially in my young years. I’m also done with questioning if they like me (which Ik could be my own self doubt) or not and if I really have a firm, strong place in this group. 

I love them though (some more than others :/ ) and I don’t want a sudden and sour goodbye but I really do want people in my life that have similar interests as me and are actually willing to go out there and do them. The main ones are being traveling skateboarding, nights out and making terrific exciting memories that I can boast about when I’m older and genuinely living life to its fullest. Now I can’t say what there ambitions are at life but I can feel that they don’t match up with mine and they show very little interest in the above. 

I feel extremely lonely because of this and I feel like I’m wasting my life and missing out on a life that I know I could be living.

I’ve self harmed a lot ( I don’t often now to avoid scarring but the urge is there all the time) and I constantly fantasise about committing suicide.

I feel extremely lonely, depressed and feel as though my ambitions and myself are not welcome to others. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe I don’t deserve it or try hard enough. I’m lost someone plz give me advice. Sorry for the rant.",lonely,Friendship/ Life advice,2022-07-14 09:12:28

But I have the feeling that I would never have one. I could never find anyone who wanted me. No girl will ever be able to care about a piece of trash, a being as miserable as me. I would rather disappear now than have to live alone, but I don’t even have the strength to put an end to my miserable existence that no longer makes any sense, I breathe, because my body does it mechanically, I have no intention of staying alive.

3273,Any-Gene2894,1657729845,1,"Hey, thanks for stopping by, I feel sorry that you feel bad enough to be here

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcXtpzm3HY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcXtpzm3HY)

I'll share to you the person I am deep inside, without caring too much of being corny or edgy, so in advance, sorry if I sometimes sound that way 

I always felt rejected for as long as I could tell, but ironically I always had a sort of vicious pleasure to destroy my own life to see if I had what it takes to grind my way back up

Already in elementary school, I kept trying to piss off the other kids just to get into a fight with them, and came back home with bruises and stuff. I already was really weird, but who cares, I was just a kid.

Bullied through most of highschool. I always was that ugly guy, with glasses and braces the girls would rarely talk to, while the boys would try to mock so they can get themselves look good.

Managed to make myself a few friends, though. We played call of duty zombies at night. In retrospect, maybe these nights really were the time of my life. I did not realize it straight ahead, but I was just a teenager having fun without having to care of anything else, and that's what feels good to think of nowadays

But I remember that around 14, me and my friends also were mean to a kid in my class who wanted to be friends with us, and I'll never forgive myself for that.

I was already a bad student, though. It started to get really bad from high school. I enjoyed playing video games so much, they were so much of a comforting zone, that I honestly rarely did my homework.

I won't detail everything about my early years because no one would care that much, but to summarize, I get my highschool degree or whatever it's called in your country, then I start my life as an adult. I was feeling really suicidal by then. Made some sort of an attempt, but didn't have the balls to do it, if you can this courage.

I decided to take a year before going to college. That's when I fell into porn and all its degeneracies. I hate myself so much for it, because it's still affecting me today.

But I managed to work and make a little money before attacking college the year after. 

However, I still had no fucking clue of what I wanted to achieve in my life, so I went for studies a bit by default. It was (more or a less) interesting, but I was still that socially awkward guy, and I still had these deviant porn images stuck in my head, so I wasn't feeling too good. Plus, I was still finding trouble to study outside of school. I lacked motivation and hadn't talked to anyone in the three weeks I did over there, that's why I quit very rapidly. Maybe studies weren't made for me after all. I didn't have what it takes.

Then started my life as a dropout, I began to become a league of legends addict and was still jerking off to deviant stuff really frequently. Was really feeling bad

My dad (did I mention my parents, they're two great people, I'm really thankful about that) got me a job after 2 years of doing absolutely nothing but play league (and a bit of chess) on my computer all day

It's a job I held for 3 years ! I quit on the end of june, last month. I met a couple of good friends there, but my life wasn't getting any better. Always this addiction to videogames and weird shitty porn. Of course, still no girlfriend, despite some efforts to put myself on dating apps (which I hate because of the way society revolves, but oh well)

I managed to get clean of porn for 2 months in the beginning of 2022, and for 3 months in april, but I relapsed yesterday and I feel freaking bad. In the end, I'm now 24, and I haven't evolved even a bit and failed to become an accomplished adult.

Still these unhealthy addictions. Still this loser mindset. Still no clear goal in life but mindlessly going forward.

I fear for my future. I just wanted to know if some people could relate or resonate with my story. Maybe we could become friends and encourage each others to become better persons. You can always reach me in DMs

I absolutely couldn't enjoy a minute of it bc I felt so lonely watching families and people with their friends chilling, laughing and having fun at the beach together. Everyday I cried my eyes out at the hotel. So even if I try having quality time by myself my loneliness destroys everything. I can't take it no more.

3277,calcmae,1657728367,1,"I feel like my loneliness is mostly the fault of my parents. They had their own issues that they never worked on and in turn raised two kids that are messed up today. 

My dad has bad anxiety that he never got treated for. He was physically abusive and emotionally neglectful. He is the reason my brother and I both have zero self confidence since he would constantly put us down and compare us to others. We were and are not good enough. My mother scared us from the world and people. She instilled in me that everyone was fake and bad. She raised me to not trust anyone and to never show emotions to anyone else because it is weak. She also didn’t let me be sad about things and would tell me to move on or get over it. I couldn’t tell her about being bullied at school because it would upset her. Both my parents never talked about mental health or therapy so as a kid anything that could have been a red flag for having a mental illness or even learning disability was ignored and I was just called lazy, stupid, immature, shy and rebellious. Their neglect of me probably having ADHD has fucked me up a lot. As a result when I was a teen I created a fake personality to hide my true self and in order to be liked. I basically lived a double life for years until I no longer could be the fake person. I ended up loosing all my friends and unable to make lasting new ones since I didn’t know who I was anymore. 

Now at 22 years old I feel like I can never form relationships with others. I’m so guarded and have many trust issues. I’m so quick to cut people off as well. Not to mention that I have major self esteem issues and feel behind my peers. I don’t know who I am. I have no friends, no acquaintances, don’t go out to socialize and have never dated. Now I have bad anger issues because I never felt like I had any support system as a kid, always feel misunderstood and never learned how to deal with emotions. I don’t even know how I will ever make friends or date because I fear people getting close to me.",lonely,Parents messed me up,2022-07-14 02:06:07

What happened was that she blocked him out of intimidation. He wasn't happy about that and continued to send more messages with insults. In the end he blocked her because he was ultimately in the wrong and had nothing to add. But then resorted to doxxing her and making up lies on this subreddit.

They listen to my problems, comfort me when I cry, and reassure me that things will get better. They are amazing people.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same about my mental health. I thought I had hit ""rock bottom"" about six months ago, but I've reached far below this level and I don't know what's up or down anymore - it just blends together. I don't have any structure to my day - I'm crashing on one of my friend's couches (bless her soul) and everyday is me feeling a cocktail of negative emotions, most prominently regret and disgust. I'm trying my best to help my friend's parents with whatever they need in order to help compensate them (cleaning, washing cars, mowing lawn, etc.), along with paying some money for rent here and there. I managed to hold onto my savings account which had a good amount of savings, but It's slowly seeping away since I don't have a job. 

Everytime I think I've ""recovered"" I just sink further into the dusty couch which I lay on most of the day. I discuss my emotions with my friend, here and there, but I just feel an overwhelming sense of disgust for myself whenever I see her - I am nothing like my younger self, and I feel like a huge burden to her and her family. Because of this, I feel like just leaving and living on the streets - it pains me so much to be in this situation. I don't think I can keep going much longer.

I will be 32 in September. I'm an only child, lost my dad nearly a year ago. If he'd have just taken the vaccine or not gone on that stupid trip, he'd likely still be here... I'm still angry, but I miss him so much. I only have my mom, who is 65 &amp; smokes far too much &amp; has for at least 40 years. She has her family, but we've never been close. My 2 cousins &amp; I get along, we're just different people. They're more ""get a degree, work in insurance, marry, have kids, go hunting on the weekends"" type of people. I'm more ""I don't remember my 20s because I enjoyed experimenting &amp; wound up an IV coke &amp; heroin addict"" type of person. Fortunately I'm getting my shit together now, but it's never a guarantee I won't hit the self-destruct button for the umpteenth time. I digress...


I can't help but wonder what would happen to me if I don't find another lasting relationship? Y'know, to have someone that actually gives a fuck when I die &amp; that would take care of my cremation &amp; store me on a real high shelf facing the TV... I've been having a TON of dreams about ex girlfriends &amp; female friends I've had feelings for in the past. I've had different dreams about different people several times in the past month &amp; it has me wondering if I'm actually lonely or not. Since my last relationship 4 years ago, I felt like I was ok with not being in a relationship. I've never been the guy that had to be with someone in order to be happy. In fact, I feel like I'm more comfortable single, without having to deal with all the bullshit that comes along with dating. I can't even take care of myself, let alone another person... but these dreams have me feeling otherwise. Maybe I'm ok now, but I *absolutely* worry about the future.


Long before dad passed but especially after, I often think about killing myself just so I won't have to deal with being alone later in life. Just so I know I have someone who still loves me after I'm gone. And suicide has always been a comforting thought for as long as I can remember. I've had a couple attempts in my mid to late 20s, but I haven't really been as depressed as I've been years prior... I just don't want to be found bloated &amp; decomposing in my house after the neighbors inquire about why I haven't mowed the grass. The sight &amp; smell of rotting flesh is something I'd prefer to spare everyone. Then what would happen? The government cremates you &amp; throws you away?

3309,popsiclebaby,1657710746,1,"I'm a girl, 20, I've been abandoned and tossed to the side by so many friends that I know can't connect with anyone.

I grew up in a cult, and long story short, I lost my big group of friends when I left, the girls I loved the most, who I spent nights talking about nothing, playing, etc. They left me and ignored me like I didn't exist after I left their cult. 

 I had 2 non-cult friends growing up, one was my best friend since we were 5, the other eventually became my partner. We broke up two years ago and remained friends until last year.

I never got an answer as to why we broke up, but after hanging out I just got a message saying ""You don't make me feel good"" and got blocked. No explanation, no goodbye, no anything, we ate ice cream in the day and they blocked me in the night. 

I still had my best friend, but after a conversation she accused me of doing things I didn't do to our friend in common (the one who blocked me), she then ghosted me, again, no explanation, no communication or talking our issues, nothing. Just like that I lost my best friend who always said she'd love me no matter.

So I was alone, I started meeting people and now I have a group of three ""friends"", but I feel distanced, I don't like some jokes they do, we have different humor, they do some stuff I'm not particularly okay with, but I don't say anything because I'm scared I'll loose everyone again. 

I'm so lonely, I had everything, I'd hang out with my friends and laugh, have sleepovers, text until 4am, talk about feelings, listen to them, etc. 

Now I have no connection to anyone, I'm just going through life, hanging out and laughing with people on the weekends, sometimes going to their house, watch a movie, act like we are the best of friends, but they don't feel real, I'm afraid if I start truly loving them they'll too leave.",lonely,I have horrible abandonment issues and feel so lonely at 20,2022-07-13 21:12:26

I understand my life could be way worse I live in the US and have never had to deal with severe poverty or illness although ive been close. My life compared to most tho hasn't been great no dad poor got beat by my step dad from 4-9 years old I was also heavily bullied at school for not having a dad being poor Mexican and for being a nerdy kid then by my older brother until recently where we had a huge fight and it felt like fighting my only father figure he is now dead to me. I miss my two nephews very much though but knowing him he probably painted me as the bad guy compared him. That night i stopped him from raping and beating his gf he is 9 years older and way stronger than her it wasn't right. But even though I tried doing a good deed I ended up being hurt and its not the first time it's happened. I constantly fail and im also just alone. I know i have my little brother mom and my beat friend but thats the thing im in love with my best friend. She means the world to me and shes told me she feels the same but due to her own mental health issues (depression and anxiety) she feels like us being more than friends will end up bad. It sucks seeing her being happy that shes my friend but in the end sad she's just that. But also I think im just sad of being alone in general. Cause I grew up without a father its been my life goal in life to have a family especially since mine is so broken. I dont care about being rich or famous or anything like that I just want a wife and kids someday. But im so alone and no matter what i do i just never seem to meet anyone it always ends up at casual sex or just stops after a few dates. Im sick of it and the only way i ever do get girls to show interest in me i end up having to hide my true self and be more of a typical ""cool"" guy and i hate doing that but for some reason thats just what girls want from me. Anyways i just feel like my life goal is unattainable im unlovable and im just breaking down. Everything seems shit now I don't eat or sleep much and im just not motivated at all. I hate my job school is overwhelming and im done. I literally feel my body giving up I work with old people and when they enter hospice or active passing jts similar to how i feel now. Im young tho I want to live just not the life i have now and it feels like the life im destined to have which id a lonely one.

I may only be 30 but I have a medical condition that will likely result in me be coming fully crippled and eventually dying in about 5 years. When I was 25 I decided I was going to really live it up. But I got into a relationship with the wrong person who turned all of my friends against me. And now I'm alone and I'm estranged from my family because I'm the wrong sexual orientation and I'm the wrong gender.

I also am unable to work because my condition has been worsening recently. I can barely walk anymore and they can't operate to fix it. I have two cats who are my only company and I'm considering giving them away because it won't be long before I can't take care of them anymore. I don't qualify for assisted living.

I did want to experience one thing before I left this world. I wanted to know what it was like for someone to actually care about me. It didn't even have to be a relationship just someone who cared enough about me to stick by me even while this medical condition kills me little by little. I've had online friends but it's not enough. I need someone who's physically present. I've never had a real friend who was irl. I've actually had a couple of my online friends visit me but they cut off contact once they learned just how much this disability hampers me. I'm tired constantly. I limp around. Some days I can't move at all. And I don't blame them for not wanting to be around me. I'm not entitled to anyone's kindness or compassion

I've always had something that helped me back from making friends aside from having really weird interests that I can't share with anyone. I'm extremely shy and nervous. To a lot of people this comes off as creepy and threatening. Which in turn makes me even more shy and nervous. And now there's someone who's been friendly, possibly even seems to like me but I can't bring myself to approach this person at all. I've been burned so many times that I don't think I can psychologically handle it if they told me to fuck off. I don't know for sure if they'll say that, it's just what I'm used to.

3330,RedApollo23,1657690630,1,"Hello guys,

Cutting straight to the chase, one tip that helped me tremendously was shadow work. Illuminating my core wounds, childhood trauma, and limiting beliefs allowed me to transcend my destructive (and limiting) thoughts, and move to a better headspace and start attracting more (and most importantly the right) people in my life. 

For example, one limiting belief that I had developed after years of loneliness was me thinking I was unworthy of putting myself out there to meet new people. I would constantly have the thoughts that people would not accept me for who I am, or see me in a vulnerable state, etc.

It is once you start the shadow work, you can start attracting the friends (and romantic partner) in your life!

3342,ysra9,1657684298,1,"Right, so, my family and me moved to Spain two years ago, more or less, and as every migrant process, it has been (and it's being) something hard to deal with. I came from Chile, where I was an immigrant as well, but there I actually felt comfortable and in peace, I didn't have a big group of friends nor had many acquaintances, but I had a few of really close friends who helped me to make it through. I would like to point out one of my relationships with one friend, which was, certainly, something life-changing to me and her. We were both naive preteen who had to face things we shouldn't have at that age. In our friendship, we found a secure and familiar place to share our fears, questions and insecurities, something that we never had before. She was my first close friend, with whom I reached to levels of trust and intimacy that I have never reached before with someone else. 

Things like that is what I've been looking for ever since I leaved Chile, and I can't seem to find it. Here I have met many people, but none of them has made me feel again the same level of security and comfortability my other friends gave me. I have a group of friends here, but most of the times I feel out place when I'm hanging out with them. Also, they tend to make things without me, and I don't know how to feel about it. People in school cherish me, and lately I've been getting more in touch with them, but I feel like I can't connect with any of them to a more familiar level. I feel like I can't be the best friend of someone, or someone's first option. That when the weekend or summer arrives, I'll probably be by myself or that I'll never have anyone to be my confident.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about all this since I got here, so everything is pretty condensated. I have come with many conclusions; cultural differences, the fact that I don't love people as I used 3 years ago or problems of mine that I've been dragging throughout the years and I haven't found a way to solve them. 

I'd really appreciate your advices and thanks for taking the time to read this venting.",lonely,I'm a immigrant teenager (15M) and I have a hard time finding close friends,2022-07-13 13:51:38
3343,KratomFiendx3,1657682700,1,"Today is my birthday and I'd say it was incredible for the most part. I went out with my 2 closest friends and had a great time. I turned 18 today, I wanted to go to a few of my favorite places as a child, and it was all fantastic. No complaints, I'm eternally thankful for my 2 friends and the experiences I've had with them.

The feels started when I came back home and my friends left. I was tired, but I wanted to continue to wonder around my city listening to Tool. I went to an arcade that I frequented quite often as a child, just to reminisce. 

My god was every person there hand in hand with another. There was a very very attractive goth girl there that I was about to talk to, but then she went to hug her very large boyfriend, and she looked happy. Just to be clear, I'm not, nor will I ever be some incel who has a problem with that.

I'm kinda severely physically disabled, I am wheelchair bound and have many medical problems to deal with on a daily basis. My 2 closest friends are in a relationship together, I couldn't be happier that they found eachother and are so happy together. Holy fucking shit are they constantly all over eachother though.

I've been so excruciatingly lonely for as long as I can remember, having next to no one to relate to ever. Lately, it's been especially rough for me. Every single person in my life is in a relationship and I truly am happy for all of them, but god fucking damnit is it hard for me to watch. 

I know that I must continue to be patient, and the right person will come into my life when I least expect it and most need it. I know that the loneliness I'm feeling now will make whatever relationship I find myself in that much more satisfying and pleasurable, but it doesn't make this feeling any easier.

I've been in very sever pain every single day I've been alive, and I know how to deal with physical and emotional pain well. I'm telling you now, this loneliness hurts more than any amount of physical pain I've ever experienced. 

I really do love my life, and I want so desperately to share it with someone. As a wheelchair bound guy, I'm accustomed to people and children staring at me then averting their eyes when I look back. I know for a fact that people go out of their way to avoid talking and interacting with me, even though I do my absolute best to treat every living creature I come accross with the highest love and respect. 

I do everything I can to make people smile and laugh. I do everything in my power to spread the highest love and light with every living thing. I do not intend to stop being the best version of myself, but my fucking god is it painful to go without physical touch for so long. My god is it hard for me to watch everyone to be all over eachother all the time.

TLDR : I'm disabled and my loneliness is more painful than all of my chronic pain and problems put together. I love my life, all I want is to share it with someone who thinks I'm worth some energy and time. I will continue to be patient and as good as I can be, I know all of this is leading to something beautiful.

Thank you so very much for reading my thoughts and feelings. I honestly do feel better now that I've typed them out. I give you absolutely nothing but the highest light and love possible. I know this is all simply a symptom of duality.",lonely,This is the most painful thing I've ever experienced,2022-07-13 13:25:00

The screams


The pain of her Is hidden by the wicked world 
The anger she felt is taken,
Masked by those who scream. “Oh pls, poor me”
Her only pain, not even acknowledged 
But laughed upon
The distant screams in her head, trying to escape,playing games of her only dread.
Her pain, masked no more.
Her pain will soon be  felt by all those around her 
The screams coming back but filled with glee 
After the joyous time she will be free 
Far from society 
The screams are almost out 
So close that she almost screams 
“Oh dear, poor you”
Itching her throat suffocating thee
She almost can’t breathe she begs to be set free 
But something holds it back far deep in the abyss 
Because she knows once it’s out there will be no one left for her to kiss
But too late the screams are back this time so overcoming 
Even she is surprised  by what is a coming 
The screams are close their already here 
Oh no that’s it her time of reckoning.
She wants to go back but it’s what it’s meant to be. 
They should’ve tooken her so seriously.",lonely,Why does feeling alone feel so bad?,2022-07-13 12:28:10

3362,BEANandCHEE,1657675459,1,"I’ve had a rough few years.  I have been a lifelong single person and been depressed for years.  For the first time ever I thought I found someone who I was starting to fall in love with after a couple years of friendship and a brief sexual relationship.  Then it abruptly ended and she immediately moved on.   I gained a ton of weight and started drinking heavier than I ever had before.  

Flash forward to last year I began intermittent fasting and so far lost about 60lbs give or take.  I’ve never been this low of a weight in my adult life and that part feels good I guess.  I also recently tried therapy, had a bad first experience and switched therapists and then had a bad second session and will need to switch again.  I’ve also started being more physically active and trying to do more activities.  

I had an awful birthday recently partially due to the person from the brief relationship and mostly because of my own jealousy and attachment etc..  I stopped drinking on June 15th, but had a few on the 25th,(didn’t get drunk but just enough to feel guilty for breaking my streak).  I haven’t had a drink since the 25th and have been really trying to motivate myself to be and do better.  


My overall mood has improved and I think I may be gaining a little confidence back.  I don’t feel as depressed as usual but I know this is going to take some time.   Either way I can’t escape my feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness.  I don’t know what to do.  I’ve been trying to do all the right things but I can’t help but feel like I’m destined to be alone.  I’ve already accepted I’ll never really fall in love,(at least not real love where they love me back).  I know I will never have children or get married, I’m 37.    Being sober is ok I guess, the feelings aren’t as overwhelming but I’ve been feeling like this since I was 13 and I was sober then too.  

Is the answer that it’s just ok to not have or do any of that and that’s supposed to be ok to me?  I want to be loved I want to feel that feeling again of having someone.  I don’t know that I ever will have someone but I will keep trying to improve myself and hope that one day I can be happy.

Because of this, It’s always been hard for me to make friends at school. I would spend most of my time by myself. I’m a junior in college now (19F) and I’ve grew in terms of socializing. I’m not as introverted and can speak up at times. However, it’s still hard for me to make friends. I think growing up, all Ive ever known was me. myself. Im most comfortable by myself. It’s what Im used to. Im not used to other people, Im not used to socializing. Im not even used to friendships and what it entails for me to maintain it. Sometimes (rarely), I can make a friend. But I can never maintain/keep this friend or keep a strong connection with them. In the end, it fades out. Or they always have people that are a higher tier friend than me and I’m just an occasional after thought.

In that post, I had the last segment about my life getting slowly on track, all that because of my boyfriend. He is the blessing, which has been in my life after a lot of troubles and bad people, I have run into before. Never felt so sure and warm before, which is not the case now. I am having a good relationship. I got a few friends online, with whom I share my experience. 

I had the belief that one day, one day I will have a partner who will make me forget the world. And will give me what I need. I am hopelessly romantic, clumsy, and whatnot. But forever grateful to God that I met him. His family, omg. They are so supportive. I wish the way his mom supports me, mine did that to me. I would have been so better. It's all about the right time and continuous efforts which we make, they pay off guys. They do pay off, slowly but eventually. 


The sole purpose to write this post and making every guy and girl see it and read it was to tell you that you my friend, deserve all the happiness in life. And if you will make continuous efforts for your life to be better, the destiny will lead you to something better. If that happened to me, it can happen to everyone.

3377,BittenThrice,1657670833,1,"Here's a little rant.

I can't be honest with anyone about my situation, day-to-day life or the full extent of the abuse i have endured. 

When i look at people in my ~social circle~ all i can think about is how lucky they are. They have parent(s) that try their best, they have a family, a bed, a safe home, they have choices, someone who looks out for them. They have never felt such hurt, betrayal, hopeless or loneliness that i have as a child and as a result have a completely different outlook on life. 

Because of this i feel alone and deeply disconnected when i'm with friends and acquaintances. They have lives, i have survival. All i can think of when i look at someone is how different our everyday must be and how they don't  have the slightest clue what mine entails because i wear my mask too well.  

I don't want to put up a front any longer but i can never be completely honest. Im so ashamed and they won't ever fully understand or even have the emotional capacity to understand.

All my autonomy and my choices have been ripped away from me while i was trying my best to survive. All i have left is complete burnout and a sense of alienation. 

I don't have the energy, motivation or support i need to help myself. Just enough to barely survive. And here i am completely alone on my bday. I don't want to have to fake emotions and there is no one i can feel a connection with. I choose to be alone, it's the better option.

I have sought out so much help in the past when i still had hope and didn't have the full picture of past events. Now i know that this has been inevitable from the beginning, there's nothing i could have done. I wasn't supposed to even make it so far, there's nothing waiting for me here. I cannot dig myself out of this situation.

3379,SnooRobots7877,1657668522,1,"Hello, everyone, when someone thinks about suicide but most likely wont do it. Its not normal for someone to think about that. But I've gotten to that point but I don't ever think I will do it, I have things I'm looking forward too in my future. But if I reach 30 and still feel like this It might happen. So backstory time. 7 years ago I found out that I had OCD and had it pretty badly. So I went to a psychiatrist and therapist, I got prescribed Zoloft. And I had to increase my dose until I found out what mg was good for me. I thought about suicide during this time period. Then a few years later starting my 8th grade and my mom got diagnosed with lymphoma. And that made me really scared, months of visiting her in the hospital, she finally got home. And I thought it was over, a few months later I came home from school and we had to call an ambulance for her and she went to the hospital near us. And I somewhat watched her die in front of me and I was only 13 at the time. Fast-forward to highshool and  now trying to make friends and hopefully find a girlfriend. Going through my first couple of years pretty normally, then my junior year and now I really want to find a girlfriend but their was only 300 kids in my highschool and I found this one girl very attractive but she had a boyfriend. I also was the first person she met when she moved to this town years before that. But they broke up a few times and got back to gether. And I also went to this other school part time for a trade and saw this one girl, that I found really attractive but she had a boyfriend. So I made friends with some of the kids in my class, and their was this other girl that I found attractive and he gave me her snap, and I snapped her but nothing ever really happened with that. I added some girls from the town over from me and was talking to this one girl, but she would always talk about other boys and ask for advice. Then I asked her is she knew any girls that were single and she did. So She gave me those girls snaps. and only one went any where for a long time. Then that got lost. The summer comes up going into my senior year of highschool and finally thought this is my year to find a girlfriend or loose my virginity. But nothing happened that whole year and even that summer. Going to College and turning 18 so I decided to go on dating apps and try to find someone. For months of trying nothing ever happened, but my one friend got many matches and dates and even fucked a few.  I'm going to a community college so theirs not too many people, but theirs been only 3 girls that I found attractive but never did anything about it and I really should've. Now I'm in my summer going into my second year of highschool. No matches on dating apps never talked to a girl, almost a whole year.  I had this one girl on snap that I never met or didn't even know who she is. Its going into 400 day streak and we sent a lot of snaps, a lot of faces and she made a lot of cute faces. But I went to go visit my friend at the real college hes going to. And After that visit I decided I'm transferring about my two years at community college and I have one year left. But this girl I'm still snapping sent a photo of herself in a hoodie with the name of the college that I'm going to transfer to. So I thought maybe I actually have real chance to find someone, but also I'm a virgin, never kissed or hugged a girl before. So obviously found her insta and it was public and she had the school name in her profile bio. But she never told me she's going. So Idk how to tell her that I'm going, but I'm also visiting my friend during this upcoming year and she will be their but I shouldn't know that's she's going their. And don't forget we never talked for all of this time. And I really find her attractive one of the prettiest girls I have on snap or even know. But Idk how to tell her I'm going without being weird. I have imagined what my life would be like if this worked out for once. And I would like to date her hopefully is her personality is nice. But I don't think it will work out. So I'm probably going to have to find another girl to try to date.  So this is a very tricky situation. So we'll se what happens but I really want to find someone in College that, actually likes me and wont cheat, but to make memories with and go late night stargazing with. And I realized that if I don't find someone at college or loose my virginity, I probably wont for a very long time. And I'm most likely moving to an area by my self with no family, if my family that currently lives near the city I'm going to. But if they do I will be very lonely and single with no girl to come home after work. And I also lost most of my other friends. Besides the one I will be going to college with. And I really don't want to be alone for that much longer. Especially after college and have a full time job just to come home with nothing their or waiting for me to come home. SO IDK what to do. But also 6 other family members have died in the last 5 years. And know I'm very numb to certain pain, but once in awhile it will hit me and I cry about it.",lonely,Feeling lonely I hope you can read it all. Sorry for it being too long.,2022-07-13 09:28:42

for example, im really into true crime. i told one of my best friends about this podcast that i really like, and that they were having a live show in our city in a couple months time. she seemed down to go with me so i bought two tickets.

the show is tomorrow and my friend bailed, claiming she forgot, never listened to the podcast, and didn’t plan for other childcare arrangements. so now i’m going completely alone because i have no other friends who can be free on a whim.

i just wish i was dating someone or had a best friend who actually cared about MY interests. i have so many video games i’d recommend, so many music artists, so many podcasts, but nobody cares. it feels like it boils down to the fact that nobody cares about ME enough to even want to. even all my exes never really got into my hobbies whereas i would always adapt and induct myself into theirs. it’s not fucking fair. i hate being such a loving person. i wish i was cold and selfish. i’m sure life would be a lot easier.",lonely,wish i had someone to share special things with,2022-07-13 04:58:00

I then tried to make friends online, and after being ghosted and ignored as usual I met a really cool person. Then a few days after having pleasant conversations, they said goodmoring to me today and said I was ""amazing"" then said they'd be busy with studying so would talk later. I said okay and I hope they had a good day. Then I check after an hour or 2 too see if they messages yet and see that I'm blocked. It feels worse because it felt like that got me well and had some of the same situations in the past. They said how they hated people who ghost, were always direct if something was wrong, and would never leave without having a conversation to sort any problems out first.

Seems typical to find hypocrites, liars, and cheats these days.
Also just noticed before I started this, some posts now have statistics, so I can feel extra unwanted as when I checked my old dating posts I can see that not only did I get a downvots so it currently reads 0 likes, but it was also read by over 1,400 people and not a single person messaged me. Meanwhile I read a post the other day saying how she gets flooded with messages so couldn't reply to everyone. I can well believe it, I've tried talking first before and often get ignored or they say they've already found someone and apologise for taking a week to reply due to the amount of messages they got.

I'm at my wits end. I just don't know what to do anymore. Is it something about me that's inherently wrong, am I looking in the wrong places, or am I just exceptionally unlucky. I can't list everything in the past, but this current situation isn't new to me what so ever.
Also I appreciate people saying lets talk here, but whenever people here have they ghost. Some even right away. They say Hi wanna talk. Then never reply after. It's the same when I offered to help people here, they want to talk then ghost even half way through a conversation while also saying they hate people who ghost. I just don't get it.
Still feel free to if you actually will talk, as I'm  told to be optimistic always maybe I'll even get a relationship from this, though pigs my fly first.

I’ve never had many friends, but I did have people that I could hang out with. But I think that it all started in 8th grade. I had friends only at school. The Corona pandemic didn’t help the situation. Two years of home. Well, then a normal year – the 10th grade. It started not nicely but got better and better. And still I had friends only at school. In this year my best friendship ended. He was my best friend since 4th grade, but we just split up because of a very stupid story that happened. Now my only friends are net-friends, and even there I have only two. One is a girl that I had not the best past with her, but we’re trying to work it up. I feel needy and afraid that she’ll leave me too, but she also doesn’t have many friends, so I hope it’ll work.
My relationship with my parents isn’t good, especially with my dad. So not nice that I barely talk to him and don’t call him ‘dad’ but by a nickname (his name, kind of). My relationship with my mum is way better though.
I feel that I shall stay lonely for the rest of my life. Even if I get married or have a girlfriend, she’ll probably cheat on me or use me for money. I mean, I do believe that a girl might fall in love with me, but it seems highly unlikely to happen. I’m not afraid of loneliness.

I'd love to go on dates and be really affectionate towards someone, but I know I'd be stunted at the emotional aspect. My fear of being vulnerable mixed with trauma and trust issues would result in faltered communication. Not that I don't want communicate, I'm working on it, it's just that I believe I need to work on my issues as much as I can before loving someone fully again. It's especially been getting to me lately because all of my friends are in relationships. It's not that I want what they have with their partners, I just want to feel okay, not feel so lonely. 

So I've gotten back into playing Valorant and I've made a couple new friends on there. But I'm a huge flirt and I've definitely thrown out a pickup line or 10. For as long as I can remember I've been like this, but lately I've been more aware of it. Throwing this out there now, I would absolutely stop if someone was upset or uncomfortable and I usually let them know they need to let me know if they do feel that way.

I think I'm really just projecting all of things I want. I go on about kissing, hugging, fucking, dates, hand holding, and things of the sort. Some people acknowledge and indulge me, we laugh and move on, but sometimes I really wish they were serious when they respond in the affirmative to ""let's kiss."" I remember one guy I played with told me something along the lines of: ""you must not get a lot of affection IRL."" He was so right that it didn't hurt, I just felt... seen.

What's on my mind that's gotten me writing this whole thing was when I blurted out ""cuddle me, idiot"" to someone I met yesterday (in game) and how genuinely taken aback they were. I just don't know how to get rid of these feelings of longing. How do I distraction myself from wanting love when it's always surrounding me?

3468,SprayTanBabe,1657610320,1,"This is my first ever post on Reddit, so please be kind. (I have been a lurker for many years, but I've always been too timid to post anything) 

I used to cry from loneliness. Besides grieving loved ones passing, it is the worst feeling in the world.  

I made it my only mission to figure out how to make friends and be interesting and to be like someone that others would want to connect with. Literally my only mission, at the cost of grades and opportunities. 

Looks wise, I was a late bloomer, but when I had my “bloom”, that’s when I started receiving attention. This made me really suspicious. Suspicious of men, who heretofore wouldn’t give me the time of day, or would make fun of my appearance…. And suspicious of women, since before I “bloomed”, they had no interest in being associated with me. 

This felt worse in some ways. The feeling of loneliness has never left me, despite having opportunities to connect with other humans. This is why I prefer animal companions. Unconditional love, no judgement, no ulterior motives. 

I’ve been thinking of becoming like an emotional support friend. Would anyone actually pay for platonic companionship, though? I would be worried about unwanted sexual attention. I’ve been reading this sub, and it seems like the women get plenty of that when they post. Assuming there was a way to fix that issue, do you think people would pay for that kind of thing, even if it were just texting a couple hours a day? 

I feel I could actually make people's lives better, in an area that I feel I truly understand, and I would feel these connections would be made with people who genuinely want a shared human connection. Maybe it’s too weird a concept? And then, is it wrong for me to have the motive of making money through this? Even if it’s not a concealed motive? There seems to be something very bizarre about paying for friendship. 

But then I think, I need to work (student debt isn’t going to pay off itself!) and will I truly be helping people by getting some boring office job working for a company that doesn’t care about me, nor I it? People pay for all kinds of support. Therapy, massages, assistants, childcare … etc. Is this kind of service any weirder than hiring someone who take care of your baby?

In May my two year old ferret passed away.  He seemed fine the day of, I just noticed that he was laying around alot more than normal.  Then about 4 hours before he passed, he went to the bathroom and I could tell something was wrong, I Googled what it meant and it told me that he had a stomach ulcer.  My parents left me and went to the pet store and bought medicine.

They were gone for about an hour and I could tell he was in pain, he was laying on my bed with me, heavily breathing.  But I thought I knew he would be okay, I just assumed because he's had medical scares before and came out okay.  I was just sitting next to him watching fuckinh YouTube while he was in pain.  I know there isn't much I could have done but he was in so much pain he probably felt so scared and alone and I could have atleast comforted him rather than petting him every few minutes. 

I don't know what took my parents so long at the store but when they got back they had the medicine, they mixed it with pedialite so that it would hydrate him, he didn't want to drink, he took a few licks and layed back down, my mom told me to just offer it to him every couple minutes.  

Later it was dinner time and I left him laying on my bed, when we were finished my mom asked to hold him.  While she was holding him on the couch I was sitting on another couch doing something online, I don't even remember.  I remember my mom saying "" come here ayva"" I got up and took a few steps but I knew by the look on her face he was gone. I can still feel my self collapsing to the floor.

My love life is akin to feeding a stray, at first they are always loving and compassionate towards me but over time they get tired of feeding and eventually they kick me in the ass so that I don't return.

3490,TurnipIntelligent,1657603063,1,"It took me 4 mo ths of putting in more than 2 dozen applications to finally get a job and I thought I'd finally feek happy again after that stress was lifted off my shoulders and could help with rent, but I had 2 shifts where I was doing online training and an hour or so of bagging to finish off my second shift to fill in my remaining hours, and I have my first hands on training day in thw bakery tomorrow but I still feel numb

I got excited about looking at my wishlists and power point of things to make my house look and work nicer for me and my family, but maybe it's the fact since I'm not used to constantly being on my feet and talking to people for hours making me tired for 2 days after my first 2 shifts and drowsy my 3rd, but I still feel sad. I have everything I needed even if it's not the perfect job, but I'm still sad

It could be that my first 2 shifts were stressful and I had problems with my first full weeks and almost didn't get scheduled at all, or how I have to do paper work to set up auto pay and don't know when their insurance will kick in or who to ask about it so I'm in limbo about how I was gonna make an eye appointment soon, but do I need to wait for their insurance? Or no cause I've heard before it takes 2 months at most places to qualify?

I don't even know who to ask cause the hiring managers last day was my second so I have no ones contact info and only know the store managers amd her name! I have to hope my bakery manager won't mind helping me figure out who to talk to, amd that she's nice! Cause I only met the assistant balery manager cause when I got hired the bakery manager was in a meeting I think.

I'm panicing over my colleges not liking me, or being horrible at my first job since the one I had for a month when I was 15, my mom just keeps telling me it'll be fine and not to over think it, but I'm between therapist and have no one to talk to other than my one friend, who doesn't need to hear me talk about my life problems more than I do!

3491,Sudden-Emotion-2993,1657602738,1,"I don't know if this post is in the right place, I apologize. I'm just writing what's on my mind, sorry if it is messy.

I'm 25 years old male in Toronto.

I never had any friends in my life, only colleagues and the only thing they and I say to each other is ""How are you? I'm good."" I tried asking about their lives but they seem to have a barrier around them, but when I see my colleagues talk to each other I see their more cheerful and more talkative, so I gave up trying to know them.

I don't think I know how to talk to people. I tend to practice smiling in the mirror to seem friendly.

I don't talk to my mom as well, I just have nothing to say to her and I don't want her to worry.

I'm either working or at home in the comfort of my room watching Netflix or playing games, but I'm not very interested in it anymore.

I tried therapy and all she did was ask me questions and say ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."" and just told me to write a diary of how I feel each day. It didn't help, just makes me realize how pointless my life is.

I told my doctor I think of suicide sometimes and he told me ""Is okay, everybody thinks that sometimes, just get some exercise and go out more"". I started exercising and felt nothing.

Sometimes I would stare at the incoming train and move closely to see what it would feel like. I sometimes hope those assaults happening in subway stations happen to me.

Suicide seems much more easier then to live. I want to live but I don't know how.

I know I probably need help but I have no idea what else to do. It feels like I'm crawling in life instead of walking like a normal person.

I used to crave attention and affection, but recently I lost those desires, and it seems like my loneliness has developed into a sort of cold hatred for everyone. I don't want friends because I've convinced myself that other people are useless when it comes to providing emotional support, and humans have no value to me beyond basic, transactional interactions.

 I'm no longer willing to trust people or let anyone in. I have no patience for anyone anymore and I end relationships over the smallest things. I don't even want to interact with my family, so I've avoided going to holiday gatherings and other family events.

Time passes by and me and my cousin went to prepare to go to sleep and she said that she will be picked up by 5 am since her grandmother (her dad's side) wants to be home by the following day since she will be enrolling to her school so we went to sleep. aunty came at the house exactly by 5 i was surprised and woke her up after shes gone i felt anxious sleeping alone i said to myself relax theres already a little bit of sun light theres nothing to worry about. it took me time to fall asleep i never felt so lonely in my life the vibe of the house and how quiet it is i just like the feeling of the presence someone's actually beside me i did not know that it feels so lonely here i used to sleep in this house all by myself.

For the past 5 years I’ve been living in an emotionally abusive household. Yknow those very hot and cold adults who like making you feel small and second guess all your decisions. Parentification as well as infantilisation the whole works. It has really made me disassociate from myself and just throw myself into my studies. Now that I’m done with my Exams and I have nothing to throw myself into, I think I’m just realising how truly alone I am. And the abuse has really done a lot of damage to my sense of self. I’m constantly having self-deprecating thoughts and I have a huge amount of self-loathing.  
So I’m particularly struggling cause I like being alone but I hate feeling lonely. It’s insane cause  being lonely isn’t the problem. The problem is  that I’m by myself. I’m left with this irrational, indecisive,worthless over sensitive, over thinker. 
And I don’t think I need to know explain to the people on this sub how much I hate that. I’m starved of touch, affection, warmth and anytime someone is nice to me I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
I go off to uni in a bit and I’m going to try very hard to change all of this when I get there.

I... I personally broke something that meant the world to me, so I'm sorry you watched my cry, I'm sorry you got somehow stuck in the middle... but my emotions tonight, however unrightfully there (because it likely was my actions that broke that world) are still valid. And I'm going to be sad. 

Asking for that key was acknowledging all of it - my faults, the problems, who I am and how I made it untenable for them. 

Honestly, I don't think you'll read that much into it - i get the 'fuck you' model of the world... it's a nice haven... but I do own my mistakes and how I fuck up my own life - it's not fun, but it's necessary. 

I know, I'm not supposed to be thinking anymore, but my brain does not stop. I don't know what this message was supposed to share, but sometimes I feel like I get overshadowed by those trying to make me feel better - I am me.  I fuck up. I own my life, even when I fuck up.

Even when I cry, I don't need someone to fix it - I just need someone to listen. I'll grieve this loss for a long time - I thought I had my shit maybe together when I met them - but no, different mistakes, same ending point.

3536,Happiness_2_Success,1657591289,1,"Hi guys-

So I'm very moody when it comes to feeling lonely and wanting to be alone, however, it's been bad lately. My new job has been hiring more people, making my hours cut back and me working less and my parents are clearly frustrated. I didn't want to work in the first place due to trauma at my last job (basically a p\*rv worked with me and I was one of his victims with other girls who were 16 and some adults). I never told my parents, but it was super hard to start working after that fact. Not to mention, I worked a job when I was 14 and got bullied a lot for it in school and harassed by popular kids during my shift and when I left. (I also dealt with s\*xual harassment with 3 other girls by a volunteer at my summer job last year and decided to leave on the spot because it was total bs. They also told us we were overreacting and never fired him due to the threat he placed on us all. Not to mention, we were getting paid minimum wage to deal with the job we were given, sh\*tty gossipy coworkers, annoying/lazy volunteers, etc. It was a total Hell).

Anyways, I've been fighting with my family recently and just cannot get over how toxic these freaking people are. I also have no siblings to share the experience with and my dog is super anti-social and I've lost interest in him. I also have no friends so I'm kinda screwed. 

It's not like I can help that my shift hours are being cut back, but I can't stand them getting pissed at me. 

OH, I'd also like to add that I was attacked by teenagers when I left my house 2 weeks ago, called slurs, and haven't left for walks since and my parents still act like it's odd I don't leave the house.

3538,ryan77999,1657589842,1,"Let me just make a disclaimer that I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, (which has recently been renamed “high-functioning autism”) when I was around 3 years old. That said, I’d prefer not to get answers like ***“It’s normal to have social shortcomings if you’re autistic, OP! Just give up and accept your fate!”*** . I just want to live a normal life like a normal person. Also, I’ve heard of many people on the spectrum being able to form platonic and/or romantic connections during their youth, so the problem must be something else - my condition can’t be the only thing to blame.

So, here’s the deal: as the title suggests, I was my high school’s resident Quiet Kid™; before you ask, I did have a few relatively close friends in elementary school, but one moved away and the rest slowly drifted apart (there was no dramatic ""falling out"" or anything). I did have a couple of acquaintances I would chat with during lunch for the first couple of years of high school, but even we drifted apart around the last year or so. The last time a classmate actively invited me somewhere was to one of those acquaintances’ houses during the summer between 9th and 10th grade, and even then all we did was talk and watch one of the group play video games - I never went to one of those famed high school parties. I decided to change this around February of 2020, halfway into my final year, when I started going to the gym hoping that exercise would give me the confidence to approach people. As if almost on cue, COVID-19 hit a couple of weeks later and my last day of high school, which we assumed to be the last day before a three-week break at the time, ended up being on my 18th birthday (03/13/2020). I have yet to see any of my classmates since, and I can’t stop pondering how things could have gone different; without Covid, I would have gone on the graduation trip to the beach, to prom, and an in-person graduation ceremony; all opportunities to form last-minute connections. Speaking of Covid, it feels as if the past two years were “skipped” almost, like I’m still mentally eighteen. Granted, I still sometimes post photography on Instagram with the hopes of seeing notifications saying *”[former classmate] liked your post!”*, which I do occasionally get, but I wonder if it’s more out of the “be nice to the special needs kid” kind of social obligation rather than genuinely trying to reach out to me. TL;DR: Even though I technically did attend high school, I never really experienced it. I just took it for granted and let it pass me by. I’ll be remembered as “that creepy, quiet background extra” when I could’ve been remembered as “that guy who used to be quiet and creepy but turned things around at the last second and became part of the group”.

***“Maybe it was your off-putting wardrobe/hygiene/physical features/posture/etc.?”***

It’s probably worth mentioning that I have a noticeable slouch, facial acne, and a fairly large nose, as well as an extremely thin and delicate build for my sex. I would and still do brush my teeth twice a day and wash my hair with shampoo; all the general necessities. As for my wardrobe, it would depend on the weather (which has a wide range in Canada); usually a T-shirt and athletic shorts in the summer and a hoodie with jeans or track pants for the rest of the year. I didn’t exactly dress up fashionably but I can’t think of anything “off-putting” about that, although I will admit in hindsight that I would’ve benefitted from a belt. My parents would advise me to look at what others were wearing for ideas when I would hit up the clothing store, but I would always forget because when I see people in public, what they’re wearing is one of the *last things I pay attention to* unless they’re wearing something particularly outrageous. If I did those above things were “wrong”, like if I stank, or if my clothes were indeed uncool, or if my posture was unnerving, *then how come no one ever called me out on it?* I was never what you’d call “bullied” in high school, but at this point, I would’ve taken that over practically not existing. Speaking of which, all these self-help subreddits have said things like “You need to work on yourself first before getting friends”, but they also say things like “Just stay yourself and wait for the friends that suit you to come along eventually”. Which one is true?

***""Did you do anything embarrassing that could've turned people off from you?""***

I rarely interacted with people I didn’t know well other than for group projects, and even then I didn’t speak much. I usually spent time between classes sitting in the hallway on my phone, hoping that the giggle of a passerby wasn’t directed at me. One notable thing that may have turned people off from me would be my piss-poor performance in team sports during gym class. Whenever I would often make a ridiculous blunder during a team sports game my teammates would act reassuring and motivative to my face but the gossip I would overhear from them in the changeroom was anything but, confirming my “acting nice solely out of social obligation” point from above.

***“Did you try joining clubs?”***

Ah, see, there’s the funny part - joining clubs requires having actual interests other than consuming media. Speaking of those “interests” of mine, I *did* join a cinema club in 9th grade with only a few members, the others being all in 12th grade. I also joined a “games” club that never really took off; the first meeting only had one person (myself) show up, and the following meetings only had people I barely knew playing chess, Jenga, and the like. Plus I joined a science club in which people did experiments, but that never really got me anywhere either. I was also part of the junior band in 9th grade but didn't rejoin the next year so I wouldn't have to attend practice after school anymore.

***“Did you try just being yourself?”***

I don’t even know who “myself” is. And besides, for all I know, my true “self”  is now buried behind two decades’ worth of social masking and could be unretrievable at this point.

***“Of course you never made friends - you never put yourself out there and approached anybody.”***

If that’s the case, then why have I seen posts on the internet about being “adopted by an extrovert”? And besides, if the “put yourself out there and approach people” lesson is given to more people than just me, then why didn’t another person put that into practice and approach *me*? As for *why* I never approached anyone, I guess I was just too empathetic for my own good; I put myself in their shoes and imagined another me (the school’s Creepy Quiet Kid™) shuffling towards me and figured any person with taste would make a run for it - I merely didn’t want to bother anyone or ruin anyone’s day with my presence because I assumed everyone hated me. After all, I assumed I deserved it for some reason. I basically subscribed to [this mindset](https://old.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/usbcpx/my_mama_told_me_stop_smiling_in_everybody_face/), and look where it got me.

***”Maybe it’s because you don’t have a personality?”***

Well, then how do I *get* a “personality”? Like I said, my only interests are consuming media; TV and video games and the like.

***”Maybe it’s because you were coming across as trying to evoke pity from people, which is a huge turn-off, like you’re doing now by posting this.”***

How was I “trying to evoke pity” by not interacting with anyone? It’s not like I was going up to people and saying things like “Please be my friend! I don’t have any.”.

***”So if you didn’t excel socially, that means you must’ve done very well academically as a trade-off, right?”***

………

***”You said you still have your classmates’ contacts on Instagram; why not contact them on there and arrange something?”***

I shan’t do that because I just picture a former classmate receiving a message from me and thinking something like *”Eww, it’s that weird quiet kid from high school. Why is he messaging me? Blocked. I should let everyone else know that they should block him too.”*. More than a couple have rejected my follow requests, so my theories about them not wanting me to contact them can’t be *that* far-fetched. Also, most of my former classmates have moved across the province to attend various universities, and since I can’t drive nor have a car (even at 20 years old) visiting them would be hard anyway. Plus, I’m not sure if I *want* them to see me and find out that even at this age I still don’t have a job, residence, car, friends, purpose in life, or my own residence like they do; I don’t imagine a friendless, unemployed virgin living in his parents’ basement would be an interesting person to hang out with.

***”What about making friends at university?”***

My university currently has around 50,000 students. Compare that to the less than 1,000 in my high school, in which a lot of my classes had a lot of the same people. Even though I’ve technically been a university student since last spring, the first time I actually set foot on campus was this February due to Covid, and in between lectures I was killing time the same way I did in high school; sitting in the hallway on my phone, hoping the giggle of a passerby wasn’t directed at me. It was then that I realized that nothing has changed. Nothing will ever change. Besides, I feel like if I didn’t have any connections during high school, which to me is all that matters, then there’s no point in trying in the future, partially because potential friends could perceive my lack of social experience even at this age as a red flag, and partially because if I change things now then I wouldn’t be able to stop thinking about what could have been had I changed things around earlier - I’m a sucker for consistency. Also, I’ve heard many times that making friends is astronomically more difficult as an adult.

***“Why do you even care?”***

Because I can’t even think of people younger than me participating in things like friendship, drama, violence, romance, sex, etc. without seething with envy. Any time I see teenagers hanging out together in public or in a video on social media all I can think is *“That should’ve been me.”*, as pathetic as that may sound. I even feel that way watching/reading any sort of fictional story that involves teenage characters interacting with each other, so much so that it affects my enjoyment of the stories.

***“Can’t you just let the past be the past?”***

No. I need closure. I need to know exactly what they thought of me.

***“You sound in desperate need of medication.”***

For the record, I *am* currently taking Effexor and Abilify, and switched to those after being on Prozac for several years since I was around 12. Whether they’re actually working or not is arguable, though.

***“You sound in desperate need of therapy.”***

Also for the record, I *am* scheduled to see a psychologist in a few days for the first time in over a decade. But my question is this: I’ve seen so many replies on these self-help subs saying things along the lines of “Whining to other people and feeling sorry for yourself won’t solve your problems, you can only rely on yourself to be happy, learn to never rely on anyone else, take the initiative and responsibility to fix your own problems instead of complaining to others, etc.“ . How is therapy any different? Would going to therapy not just be me whining to someone else and expecting them to solve my problems for me? What if I accidentally pull a Rorschach and make the therapist depressed instead? Not to mention the fact that it’s far from cheap. Sorry if it’s painfully obvious I’ve never seen a psychologist before so it might be a stupid question. Then again, I don't know *how* to fix my problems so even just being told what exactly I'm supposed to do wouldn't hurt.

Man in his late 20’s here to put my sense in, I’m here to vent so don’t tear me too hard to pieces 

I hope I don’t sound arrogant but i was always attractive growing up. I was always the kid my mothers and sisters friends unironically always said “I want to marry him when he’s 18” (disturbing in its own way cause i was a child but that’s for another subreddit) My ugliest physical flaw is that I’m 5’5 in height. In my area, there’s a specific image of what’s “attractive” that I don’t fit into. My background and culture is stereotypes here for being ugly to the point where I’ve gotten a lot of “you’re really attractive for a (insert background here) person.” 

Growing up, I had a lot of people whom were considered “attractive” by my local standards to be mean spirited to me. They were upset someone who’s suppose to be considered “ugly” was attracting the female attention they deem they deserved only for themselves and themselves only. I also looked “cute” until my early 20’s and a lot of dudes who looked like grown men since they’re 12 didn’t like sharing female attention w someone that “looks like a child” despite being a late bloomer I was having a lot of sexual attention regardless. I’m one of those that ages very slowly and at this age I finally look like a grown man despite being one for a good decade. I also don’t “behave like a hot man” I don’t care about expensive clothes, weekly haircuts or jewelry. I like being hygienic but im a simple tee shirt and sweats type of guy. I’m the guy who will take a camping trip over a weekend bender at the club.


My dating life was full of women sleeping with me in secret cause it was rather shameful to bring someone “like me” to their parents or to be seen in public w me despite their attraction to me. That’s where my loneliness sets in. I connect w women here in my area but because I don’t act like what’s considered to be “cool” where I’m from, I feel alienated and alone. Not trying to bad mouth women.

Between the ages of 14-19, The only relationship I had with a local person poisoned by these local standards was someone from a background that was considered to be “hot.” To Said culture and background consider being attractive to be the ultimate accomplishment. she herself was average looking but such a sweet person. However, she would always suggest I behave more like her background culture as that is what most people do here to be deemed “more attractive” I refused and it made me grow so resented that I started having sex with her cousins to get back at her and get back at her family for always suggesting I was “really attractive for a _____ person” 

I explored more parts of the country and saw people don’t all think the way they do in my local area in regards to what is “suppose to be attractive” so I found out more of what I had going on as an adult 


Here in 2022, my look is acceptable to be attracted to now and I get even more attention than before

Yet I feel so lonely cause I feel like I have to act a specific way in order to be shown affection and acting that way directly goes against my personal beliefs as a person. It feels like people want me to be a caricature of what “cool” is considered here and I refuse to do so which results in feeling of loneliness.

I feel like I have to either play the character people want here for me to feel connected to them or just be flat out refused.

What I’m trying to say here is I feel super lonely despite having female attention because attention is not a connection. I have a hard time connecting to people where I’m from because I don’t behave in the stereotype that is considered to be “hot” and I feel like it’s so hard to connect with others because they are disappointed to see Im not the stereotype they want me to be

I feel so alone because It feels like others want this version of myself that just doesn’t go with who I truly love to be

3556,randtime78,1657584706,1,"First time venting on the internet.

I  am a 21 years old male. In school, I was the weird kid, always picked  last in school sports, made fun of by the majority and asked for answers  during tests. I was the class nerd, always fixing school computers and  talking to my IT teacher. My grades were high all around. I had a group  of friends who liked me but I often degraded myself in order to make  them laugh. For whatever reason, I also was the odd one out in the group  and not often invited on nights out.

My  parents do not (try to?) understand me and leave me to my own thing. We  never talked much. I was afraid of them, to their eyes I was not  enough.

My interest has always  been programming and tech. I did not care that my social connections  were few and poor because my focus was on something else.

I  moved country to attend uni a couple years ago. I lived my first year  abroad in complete solitude, a very dark period of my life. One day I  decided to go out for a walk, I wanted to finally give myself the chance  to restart my life but me being me is the stopping factor. Started  trying new things and social events. I found out I can only  superficially connect with very few people but that's about it. I often  take solo walks (I have no one to invite) and see friend groups and  couples and often wonder how did they end up there. What were the  actions and decisions they made in order to be there with a group of  people willing to talk and listen.

I  always felt unhappy, even got a few suicide attempts on my belt, but  still here. Often I go to sleep and hope to never wake up, as the next  day will just be as dull as the previous one.

In  some ways, I hoped that writing this post would make me feel something  but that's not the case. Maybe some replies will do, if I receive any.",lonely,Life for me is dull,2022-07-12 10:11:46

**---------WHY BEING ALONE IS NOT SUCH A BAD THING ---------**

**A lot of people are not worth your time:** When you're lonely, it can be tempting to try to jump on the bandwagon of whoever gives you attention. Sometimes this works and you can make friends, or even find a partner. But I advise you to be cautious, people are rarely selfless and if they approach you without you trying to interact with them first, there are chances they want something from you.

**Sometimes going out sucks:** I tried for the longest time to try to go out with other people, party and do whatever was considered normal at my age. If you had asked me back then, I'd very much have preferred to stay home but I was afraid of ""wasting my youth"" or missing out. I hated parties, alcohol and drunk people. Why did I keep doing the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome? 

**Dating won't fix your problems:** I feel like this comes up frequently in this subreddit but it looks like a lot of young redditors think that all they need to be happy is to have a relationship. For those who've never been in a relationship, it will not only not fix your loneliness but it will also generate a wide range of problems. And you'll need a good deal of mental energy to deal with those problems. If you suffer from anxiety or depression, you're at risk of becoming emotionally dependent on your partner. If you think being partnered is an infinite source of joy, I invite you to check out these subreddits: r/dating_advice r/relationship_advice r/marriageadvice r/DeadBedrooms

Does that mean you shouldn't date unless you have your entire life figured out and a perfect mental health? Not at all, but as cliche as it sounds you should be happy by yourself before seeking a long-term relationship, otherwise, you'll risk your entire happiness depending on the status of said relationship, and if for whatever reason the relationship fails you'll feel miserable, lonely and like you've been stripped of your life purpose. Please treat a relationship as a nice to have in life, not an absolute requirement to feel complete.

**---------WHY BEING ALONE CAN BE WONDERFUL ---------**

**The wonders of boredom:** I grew up as an only child without an internet connection, whenever I got bored I was forced to come up with ideas to entertain myself, so I drew, played videogames and read a lot. Fast forward, all that drawing paid off and now I make a living off art. If I had been more social and outgoing I probably wouldn't have developed as much interest in art. Perhaps all that alone time wasn't such a bad thing.

**Self-awareness:** Imagine a hamster running on a hamster wheel, that's how our brains are supposed to work. Now imagine that hamster on coke, in an overpopulated cage with techno music blasting through the speakers, that's more of how our brain works nowadays.

Descartes said  “I think; therefore I am,” but Descartes didn't have the internet, social media, Netflix, Youtube and a zillion more distractions we deal with every day. Don't let me get started on social media...That wonderful place where we let other people determine what we are, our self-worth. Where some people literally pay for likes.

If you don't care at all about it: the likes, what other people are up to, etc. you'll stop comparing yourself to other people and worrying so much about missing out on life experiences. If you mix this with boredom, you might even discover some interests you didn't know you had. The more time you spend *with* yourself (note how I didn't say by yourself), the more you'll get to know your own wants and needs.

**If you're not miserable, you'll become interesting as f\*ck:** Okay, a bit of a weird title but I swear this is important. It has a bit to do with dating (wink wink) and the two above-mentioned points. 

I'm a bit of a picky lady when it comes to who I date, not because I only date sexy models and ""Chads"" - I don't care about looks at all - But because I feel an innate attraction towards interesting AND smart people. And the most interesting people I've ever met are loners who very much like me, had to find a way to entertain themselves and found a passion for it. 

There's nothing sexier than someone who's passionate about something and them willing to share their passion with *you*. And you don't even need to have fancy hobbies to be interesting! I met my ex while we were fighting over the last copy of a signed comic (dating as a comic nerd can be very tough).

Guys, if you're lonely and you're not particularly passionate about anything try to make the effort and try new things. It won't only give you entertainment but it's also a great way to find a community, meet people and make friends.

**Do you really need other people? Attach. Detach:** Maybe you don't agree with this. I've had times in my life where I've been very lonely and affection starved and times where I've been surrounded by people and still as lonely. The friends I have today, are still going to be my friends when I'm 60? Ask someone around that age how many childhood friends they're still friends, or even in touch with. 

I've seen couples who've been together for up to 80 years, but that takes a lot of respect, sacrifice and love. 

Can you love someone else for 80 years when you can't love yourself for a day? The only person you'll always have *without any exception*s is yourself.",lonely,And that's why I find comfort in loneliness,2022-07-12 07:38:35

3587,Strong-Document-7368,1657570161,1,"Hi guys I wanted to share with you my experience and ask you for suggestions
I started to like this girl 6 months ago since we started working together.
After 6 months I decided to shoot my shot, but only after being sure she was interested too.
So after getting clear(?) signs of interest I asked her out.
Well the night I Asked her out we stood outside her home  for 2 hours straight talking (and It already happened once or twice) then I procedeed with the big request.
She said yes, she said she was sure and she asked me when we were gonna meet.
So I went home all happy and excited.
After a week she texted me she should have never said yes, that she was probably tired that night etc...

Well we still work together and I started ignoring her (maybe on purpose but also because I really don't know how to behave towards her, I always try to be myself but it seems to me that I am not able to do it anymore when I Am with her)
So after two weeks of ignoring her at work she went to me, also in a little angry mood, and told me that she can't go to work with that negative atmosphere, that she does not want me to behave like this, that she had good fun with me when I did not ignore her and so on...
She also said that she expected me to ask her out that night indeed she told me that she was seeing me thinkfully, and asked me If I had to say something. And after this happened I asked her out.

So after this conversation I tried to be softer towards her and tried to talk to her, I managed to do it pretty well when there was all our group of friends.
However today I met her again in the gym and I could not talk to her, I didn't even wave her but I actually don't do it on purpose. I don't know why I am blocked. I feel betrayed, I feel sad I really feel that my heart is hurt yet I still ""simp"" for her and with her behaviour she keeps hurting me even more even though she probably does not it on purpose

So I am not understanding why, despite rejecting me, she  keeps showing this kind of toxic interest towards me. from my pov It's like I MUST consider her.

3593,AnEntirePeach,1657567610,1,"He was my best friend, we played a lot of video games together during lockdown, but things took a turn for the worse around 2021. He began treating me like crap, and I obviously tried to do the same to him.

2022, yay ig. It’s now the time I should say I am very introverted and have hanged out with friends no more than 2 times. And I’m 13 as well. Both times were in May 2022, and were absolutely horrible. Just like the online interactions with my friends. I couldn’t figure out why they were so horrible, until recently, when a combination of that “best friend” taking a few-days hiatus from the group chat and him even leaving it for a day when I realised - I actually enjoyed talking to people. Oh my god! But only when that guy isn’t there.

The SECOND he joins a social interaction, the atmosphere switches - against me. 

He was brought back into the group again. I have no idea how I’m going to survive not talking on that group until he leaves (if he leaves - probably never), because that’s the ONLY place I ever talk.

In fact, I had to create this new account because he tried STALKING me on my old account.

I have not went out with anyone for 50 days. I have nobody I can go out with, because that guy would get invited as well. 

And it’s not like I haven’t tried joining other friends groups - they were TOXIC AS.

And it’s not like there are any more friend groups I can joins until I go to high school next year (after the year after this summer). 1 more year with THAT TOXIC GUY. AND I’LL PROBABLY HAVE TO STAY IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM IN SUMMER CAMP. *FOR 7 NIGHTS*

AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, I’m unskillful. I do not have ANY skills, I have no idea how to cook, or how to do a lot of things for myself.

TL;DR Whenever this former best friend enters a social interaction the whole vibe changes against me - can’t hang out with the only group of friends I have because of this. Have tried finding new groups, but they’re toxic, can’t find any new groups for over a year to come. Unskilful, lonely, depressed, shy, and so on.

**Right now I'm 28(m)**
- Essentially I had tons of suicidal thoughts during HS, before my senior year started I was sure I was going to hang myself in a forest. Surprisingly I had a great senior year and did things I never thought I would have the courage to do.
-Got my first real relationship at the age of 23 and did all the fun things within a relationship that only lasted about 10 months. Sadly I ended the relationship because I'm sure my ex was cheating.

I don't really want to describe myselfy, I don't want to write all that long. I've been working 2 jobs for almost a year now, bounced between many new jobs. I just don't know why I exist anymore.  I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of failing in dating apps, in dating in real life, in trying to make friends, in trying to develop new skills for a better job,  I'm tired of bettering myself overall because I feel like it's not working. 

I tried my best to take good care of myself, my diet, my body, workout, I read psychology books, listened to a lot of useful and helpful podcasts.  But I'm growing very tired mentally and spiritually.  I don't like the US culture at all, I think it's gotten bad, hook up culture, we're all plugged into our devices. Everything is become superficial,  I deleted almost all my social media apps. 

Almost every day I think about killing myself. I believe in Jesus Christ, and that's the only thing really keeping me alive (long story). I have very bad sexual desires ( I think due to the fact that since the age of 4 or 5, my godmother son showed me videos of porn of woman getting penetraded analy and I grew up with a very perverted mindset which I know wasn't my fault, and later in life realized it was not normal and tried fixing it, which I still struggle with today. 

Idk, I guess I'll take any words of encouragement,  I know one person that killed themselves in one of my jobs, he had 2 kids, his wife left him and he was devastated,  I try to fight my hardest to not show my sadness to people because I don't want to be a downer. But it's hard a lot of the times, every day is a fight to move, to smile, to walk, to eat, to just try and have an inch of motivation that quickly dissappears and I have to try something new all over again to stimulate some kind of positive response within myself.

3635,Prehistoric_Lama,1657549829,1,"When I first got to university, I only knew one dude who was in the same high school I went to, we never talked much before but as we didn't know anyone else we started hanging out, he wasn't really trying to make new friends, but I did and I met 4 other students who I became really good friends with, therefore, I decided to get him in the group.

Progressively, the group got bigger as we added 3 other people, who formed a subgroup but who still spent time with us. At first it was alright, we all spent time together, laughed, etc... unfortunately, after about 3 months, they started ignoring me more and more every single day, by this I mean that they wouldn't listen to whatever I had to say, they wouldn't invite me when they had something planned, they hanged out together and avoided me, and whenever I joined them I could feel some kind of tension and discomfort from their part.

What started it was the addition of that old friend in the group, since day one something felt odd, but it took 3 months to be inevitably noticeable. It felt like I wasn't needed or wanted anymore, I got replaced by someone cooler and more interesting.

During summer break, I got no DM or call whatsoever, like I didn't exist, and when we returned to classes, it was clear I wasn't a part of the group anymore. I don't know why it happened, I'm not the coolest dude it's true, but it's not a reason to get cast out so abruptly. 

What I found the most hurtful thing in all of this, is that I didn't get any kind of explanation, and since then I've spent endless days thinking about it. It's been more than a year already and I never felt this lonely, I tried making new friends but everyone is already in a group and they made it clear I couldn't join any, so I spend all my time alone both in and outside college, to a point where my older cousin, who's in the same college asked me last month why I'm always alone when he sees me.

It's hard to be rejected by everyone, there's no one I can open up to or even just have a chat with, so I stay alone in campus listening to alternative rock and grunge, which I've discovered during my lowest days and are the only things that give me some kind of solace.

Needless to say, I don't approach women that much anymore because of that. Dating apps are my only option to meet women and predictably they don't work no matter which ones I use or how much money I spend on subscriptions/extra features. Whenever I do get a match, I usually get ghosted after a couple of days.

The closest I came to finding a partner was a Russian-American girl I met on a pen pal website. She emotionally manipulated me when I was suicidal and vulnerable, then she ghosts me for another man because (in her words) he had more money. Fuck that bitch! I fucking hate her and I hope she burns in Hell forever for what she did to me! I wish all kinds of horrible things upon her! Fuck that stupid whore! 

Then, there was a stupid Bible thumping bitch I met at my community college who only befriended me just so she could proselytize. She literally believes that LGBT people live sinful lifestyles and that abortion should still be illegal so fuck her! I hate that Bible-thumping slut too! If I ever see her again, I'll wipe my ass with the Bible in front of her. Fuck that bitch!

3641,shadowlarvitar,1657544972,1,"I just need to get this off my chest. I've always been on the spectrum, Asperger syndrome to be precise so I always acted weird and was also rather shy on account of my anxiety(Which has worsened over the years). I never tried hanging out with kids during school and also hid away in my room after playing games.

I really regret it but there were a good four to five years where I just didn't have a job as I was terrified and my mom was a bit too overprotective, eventually an employment program helped me get a job at a warehouse but that's just it... a warehouse, not exactly sociable and people are forbidden to talk on hours(Not to mention the age difference; I'm 27 and most everyone else is over 40. There is a boy and girl close to my age but they're dating, I feel like a third wheel just thinking about trying to talk to one of them)

A few years have passed since I had this job and my anxiety is worsening, along with depression. I know it's not far from when my great grandparents pass, and both sets of my grandparents are nearing 80. I've never gotten to know my uncles so at this point all I really have would be my parents. That thought as been scaring me as I know they won't be around forever... my sister moved all the way across the country and my brother's a bit of a shut in. And it's pretty obvious that I don't have a girlfriend/wife... and I don't mean to disrespect my dogs but they can't exactly talk back, they do help some but not to completion

I don't even know where to start making friends... ""Oh just go to a bar"" I don't drink and I won't, not when addiction runs in the family. And I can't exactly bond over sports as I've always found them rather boring... Videogames, TV and movies are my hobbies though I'd like to try and find more physical ones now that things are opening up again.

And don't get me started on dating apps, I've looked at them and a good amount of people are looking for something quick and instant(Which is overwhelming for me...) and doesn't exactly bode well for my fear. I worry that in a few years I'll be past the chance at finding somebody as most the people my age that wanted somebody would have likely found them. :/

I recently bought a gaming headset(For my Xbox) and a computer mic/webcam as I'm trying to open up and put myself out there to make more friends but I can't fight seem to fight the fear that I'll die alone.

I haven't even thought about 'offing myself' so please don't worry about that. I just needed to get this off my chest, I'm going to try and see a therapist soon to see if that helps.",lonely,"Lonely, scared and trying to open up",2022-07-11 23:09:32

Maybe I can't tell them all my feelings and emotions, maybe I can't enjoy all my interests and hobbies with them. But maybe that's okay because they are there for me and that means everything. They are selfless. They help me without expecting gain. They care. They want good things for me and are happy when I succeed. They want to be on my side. They look out for me. They care. 

I've realized that a lot of people on this world don't care. They don't care about you. You're a transaction for them. They get something from you and when they are no longer satisfied with what they get, or when they obtain something they feel is better, they move on to the next.

So this is really complicated guys, but I’ll explain as best as I can.

I had a mixed childhood, I had good best friends at primary (elementary) school but moved to a private school my rich grandad paid for for high school and got bullied as a poor kid. I also was pathetically shy and didn’t reach out to make friends. I spent time in the bathroom trying not to be seen as a loser on my own. Looking back I did crazy shit and was very depressed although some people were very nice to me and if I had self confidence and the knowledge I have now high school could have been amazing.

In the summer after GCSEs I got anorexia at 16 and nearly died due to how bad it was. I attended the hospital everyday but wasn’t admitted due to covid. I had to leave school for a year to heal. Thankfully I got healthy and moved to a sixth form college but my mindset was still fucked up and I never mentally recovered and didn’t make effort to make friends.

Then to make things worse during lockdown my depression got even worse and I read stuff online and began to think I was trans, as well as getting obsessed with my hobby of lifting (i am an amateur powerlifter) I became erratic and ordered steroid drugs online. I took them for 6 months and hid it from my family but something clicked in my mind back in March, I thought what the fuck am I doing, wasting my life like this and stopped cold turkey. I then told my family who were extremely supportive as they knew I was going through shit during lockdown and after years of no friends and the anorexia, it messed with my mind and made me do something crazy. I was using the trans thing as an excuse to do something ‘forbidden/exciting’ and take drugs.

We went to the doctor and my blood tests came back normal now for a woman but the lasting effects are my voice is way deeper like androgynous and I’ve got a lot more body hair. I’ve been getting it lasered off and am getting voice surgery in 2 weeks using all my Uni savings. This experience made me break out of a depressive spell I’ve been in for 3 years since the anorexia , it changed me from wanting to stay in my room all day alone to wanting to party and be social and get a boyfriend. I’ve changed from being a tomboy  to wanting to go out and get dressed up on nights out. I also cut my hair during lockdown which looks terrible but it’s long enough to get extensions now which I’m getting before Uni in September. I just feel like now I’ve finally got the mindset and good mental health but not the physicality yet and will be judged. Everyone my age wants to look good but I’m lacking so much confidence due to what I did, even if none of it is permanent.

The thing is now with my new mindset I feel I’m wasting my youth and life and summer. I also am too self conscious to go out until my voice surgery is done but everyone sees me as a normal woman right now, it might just be in my head. I have no friends to spend the summer with and am so sad just sitting here whilst the weather is beautiful and watch movies about teenagers having fun. My younger sister is extremely disabled and can’t talk so my parents can’t spend time with me as one works and one is a full time carer for her, but I kind of don’t want to spend time with them anyway, I want to be around people my own age.

I do have discord and join a lot of servers but I always have a hard time just joining into the conversation because I know I'd eventually leave, and me leaving would let others ponder about what's wrong with me and that I would have no clear answer to their question.

Two years ago, I was in a group chat with some online friends I've talked to a few times and I haven't joined in on the conversation for a few days.

3664,idkguesssumminrandom,1657528875,1,"It's how I feel often. I feel unalive despite my heart beating, I feel like I am simply an observer of others who are the actual actors in the play of life, and I am merely an audience member. Other people have relationships where they're deeply connected to the other person, while I feel like I am only ever appreciated for the facades I put up.

Only when I play the version of me that's not ""creepy"", or is more ""understanding"" do I start getting more respected. But what do I really feel inside? Not much. Am I a sociopath? I've never thought so, although a lot of my desires for romantic relationships are inherently selfish, but I do believe that it is only ethical to reciprocate what you are given.

Still, on an emotional level I feel a lot of pain. Constantly chasing internally what I don't have. Dreaming too much. In a broad sense, just spending too much time inside of my head instead of just being alive like the rest of the people out there. It truly makes me feel invisible.

Maybe they're dead inside too but just better at hiding it. Maybe I am the one who is more in touch with my feelings. Maybe this, maybe that. I don't know what it is, but if this post made sense to you, I hope it made feel more comfortable knowing another individual out there feels the same way you do.",lonely,Invisible,2022-07-11 18:41:15

3667,5hade2,1657526553,1,"1. You state a requirement with vague possibilities and due to past experiences they will likely have self doubt refusing to elaborate further and just reinforcing your intent emotionally only causes them more stress and emotional harm, you're not helping them to understand what you want or expect as a boundary if you refuse to elaborate you're leaving them with a social puzzle that will cause stress
2. Treating them like an abusive person who isn't trying. This is way more common than it used to be in the modern day.
3.Refusal to work with them when they don't have free health care or would barely be able to afford therapy of any kind. I get it the system should work but it doesn't that is the reality if you call them a friend let them know what you can't or won't be able to help them with so they know and deal with what you are willing to and they will do the same for you

Those are three ways I've had people be a dick to me or just straight call me abusive because the American Healthcare system is broken and more doctors only go into the field for money not to help people and it's not setup as a basic service for everyone to be able to use it all costs money or is only partially subsidized and still if you are receiving treatment those records can and will often be used against you in ways you cannot prove they are without an investigation or lawsuit which you can't do because you don't have the financial resources so how about we stop talking in ideals and address reality as unpleasant as it is if everyone could they would more often than not seek outside help instead of dumping onto the people they care about and they don't want to have to have someone manage their problems for them just with them whether fair or not that's the reality I'm tired of being told to shut the hell up about it you don't get to ignore the full picture and make yourself out as morally superior for abiding by a fabricated and unrealized ideal you treat as reality when it's just not a thing.",lonely,How you may be being a dick to someone with autism and anxiety,2022-07-11 18:02:33

I feel like I don’t even fit in anymore because they’re all really into soccer(they’re all on the soccer team and watch/go to games). Whenever they talk about it I can never contribute to the conversation because I lost the passion for it a while ago. And during lunch they all play in the field while I sit by the goal nets and wait for class to start. 

For a while I’ve felt like the side friend and less important to the group. I’ve noticed that we never really go out as a group if certain people cancel. I understand wanting to postpone plans for someone, but it’s always the same few people that we all wait on. But when I cancel or cant go they make plans regardless. Sometimes I even feel used because in school whenever we have to get into groups I get left out but they always ask for my help or to copy my work. 

Just the other day I made plans with one of them for tomorrow but he just texted me a shitty excuse and bailed. I’ve been on my own this entire summer and haven’t heard from many of them since the last day of school so I was honestly excited to hangout with someone but this kinda made me feel like shit.",lonely,Lately I’ve been questioning my friendships,2022-07-11 17:59:52

Honestly I’m not entirely lonely, I have one or two good friends but even then sometimes we go weeks without talking. What really fucking sucks is that even though im in this group chat with some school “friends” it always feels like whenever I try to make a joke or fit in everyone just dogpiles on me and they make me feel like an outcast when I know that if anyone else made the same joke they’d all laugh and have a good time, it’s the fact that the joke came from ME that makes it not funny, they take what I say and act like I’m being serious even though they know I’m fucking with them. Everyone in that group chat has these back and forth moments of banter and whenever I try to join in I’m just an outcast. I don’t know if it’s me or them but I just want some real friends. I don’t think I’m a total fucking loser, I’ve made people laugh in the past and I even had a girlfriend but my phone is always dry and no one reaches out. I might not be totally hated by everyone but I know that no one actively seeks out my company. I’m just not wanted nor am I important in anyones life.

3679,Nualia2020,1657523786,1,"It's been 3 years since college and I had a network of IRL friends and a support group. Once I left, I went back to online friend hangouts being it.


This year a lot hit the fan within my social circle and I realized that being nothing but online so much was toxic for me and not helping my life or career. I love those guys dearly still but it's currently best if I focus on me and my life... Or so I thought. 


I have immediate family in town and an decent paying job. But I work weekends (better pay) and more and more, for longer periods of time, I don't get to see or talk to that family. Making friends outside work has been real difficult since moving back to Michigan. 


The one friend I did make hits me up often for work stuff and advice all the time. Sometimes real late, and if I'm up I'll always help out. At some point she was having a rough night and tried to reach me, but my phone mutes after midnight.

So the next day, I felt real bad and made it so she can always get through that mute. I told her that I did so, and that if she ever needed to reach me, call at any hour, I'll be there.


She is not a very good friend at all, and reciprocates almost nothing let alone that. 


So now, here I am after one of the most stressful work weekends of my life at 3am (a rather ungodly time for my current life) wanting nothing more than to reach out to someone to just talk and debrief... 


But my family is there for emergencies and lead their own lives. Back in college I had about 3 different people I could hit up. Plus or minus depending on the time of year and day.


But now? No one but my roommates, both part family and men. It's hitting especially hard tonight. It's frustrating because I feel like I can't reach out to those 2 that I could, because we're men and we aren't supposed to need to talk to people like this. But that 1 girl I know, I feel like I'm definitely not the only one she could and does rely on to get through tough times...


This world is rough sometimes. I'll get through it, but dang does it feel like the odds are nothing against me during times like these, and it genuinely hits me how socially unacceptable it feels for me to even be in this position. 


I know I'm not the only one though.

So I (35m) have been with my partner (45m) for a bit over a year. Prior to that I was in a very bad (10 year) relationship. In that old relationship I was confined. I couldn’t go places do things talk to people. No friends no social media. 

I met my new partner during that nasty divorce. He helped me and I helped him in a similar situation as he was going through a divorce as well. 

Fast forward a few months and our friendship became more. We developed feelings. Strong ones. Ones I didn’t know I was still capable of. 

I was moving to an unknown location just somewhere far enough to get away from the ex. One of the options was my location if my new close friend. Long story short I moved here and started a life here with him. 

That life has been great. I have never been happier but something still isn’t right. I can’t put my finger on it but something is off. 

This weekend is my first weekend ever where I am alone. I won’t see him again till next weekend. 

I guess I didn’t realize I had become quite codependent and that scares me. I thought I had moved beyond this. 

Anyways I am very sad and very blah about the whole thing. I don’t know why I feel this way I shouldn’t. I shouldn’t have to spend every moment together to be ok…

3714,Secure-Panic692,1657510404,1,"i’m a teenage girl, and i absolutely hate myself. i have a boyfriend whose the sweetest guy alive, sometimes. whenever were together he’s perfect and all over me constantly telling me i’m pretty and how much he loves me etc. but he wasn’t always like this. (TW EATING DISORDER) last summer i have a severe eating disorder and had to pull myself out of it alone which my bf knows about. he also knows i still struggle with just insecurities in general as well asa lot of pressure from people in my family to look perfect all the time. anyways, back when we first got together he used to pick on me and i looked a lot in a jaoking way and i told gim i didnt likw it but he comtinued until i relapsed and finaally told him i had an ed. he responded really well and iuat told me he lived me and that he was sorry. but throughout our relationship since then he’s had zero problems talking about other girls in front of me and while I’m not ther which has been really hard for me and uncomfortable since he knows I’m constantly comparing myself to others around him anyways. After talking about this he says he gets where I’m coming from and he will talk about that type of stuff around me anymore but I know he still says stuff when I’m not around even though he also said he wouldn’t do that. And after a little while I still just felt ugly because I knew he was saying all the stuff about all these other girls and he’s never complement me so eventually I just felt pretty shitty about it and I talk to him and he like apologized and promised like it would be different and all this stuff and then all the sudden he was just like all over me and like complimenting me and I was like OK well this is good but recently I found out that he was like getting other nudes from like other girls which is something I’ve never sent to him or anyone and like watching porn and like all that stuff and I felt like shit about it and I talked to him about it and he said he’d stop watching that stuff and he thought where I was coming from and he promised he’d stop but I feel like he promises to stop doing a lot of things that he just does anyways under the impression that I’m not gonna know. I also know that he’s giving a snap out to other girls and done stuff like that while him and I were together and it really confuses me because I feel like when him and I are alone together things are so perfect and he’s like do you like things with him and I are perfect and he’s perfect and then it’s like I find out all the stuff he does like behind my back and like lies to me about and I don’t know what to do because I feel like I’m just looking at all these other girls he has all this stuff to say about unprompted because it’s just what he’s thinking and then I have to ask him to give me just a little bit of reassurance and he probably doesn’t even mean it. And with summer starting again I’ve been able to feel myself drifting back into the things I was doing last year like throwing up skipping meals etc. and I really do just need someone to talk to but he’s not there he’s never there anymore, I mean at least when we first started dating he was like my best friend I used to tell him everything but now he’s never there to listen he just wants to make out or not do anything at all and when we do hang out and I’m not in the mood to do anything with him he just wants to go hang out with his friends instead and since we have the same friend group usually I go with him and they always tell me and show me all the stuff you were saying when he’s not there when you think I’m not there and I don’t know what to do because I’m so sick of hearing myself and I feel like I would’ve been able to make it through the summer without relapsing if it weren’t for the way that he makes me feel but I also know that if I tell him that he’s gonna feel like shit and I don’t wanna hurt his feelings. But it just feels like I’m always running in circles around other people trying to pretend that I’m OK and it’s like I know that he says he loves me and he cares about me and that he thinks I’m like the prettiest well blah but it doesn’t feel like it and he doesn’t act like it and it just confuses me because I only have eyes for him I don’t look at any other guys like that ever and he looks at every other girl around him like that all the time even when I’m here and it just hurts my feelings a lot. And I don’t know if I’m over reacting because I’ve already had problems with this before but even guy friends that I talk to of told me that it’s weird and kind of fucked up and they don’t even know about my eating disorder so I don’t know what to do but I just I keep looking at myself and comparing myself to all the other girls and I hate myself and my body and I’ve been trying to work out and trying to eat less and trying to throw up what I do eat but even then I look at myself and I look nothing like the girls he wants so I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if there’s something wrong with me and there is but I don’t know if that’s what’s causing the Problem. also sorry for any bad grammar or English and this I do voice type it because the keyboard on my phone is broken",lonely,i feel disgusting and ugly,2022-07-11 13:33:24

Don’t get me wrong, my boyfriend spoils me rotten with his love and my family are always there when I need an ear. But that’s not what I’m referring too. 

A couple days ago while I was working I saw a group of friends walking down the street all laughing and giggling and I felt something hurt inside me. But I just ignored it and kept on with my day. 

Another time my boyfriend went on discord and hung out with his friends for like 8 hours straight. And listening to him laugh and joke and just have fun with guy friends made me happy…but lonely. 

I realized that I didn’t have any friends to do that with. My last friend cut me off because I was dating my boyfriend (who is white) during black live matter movement. And she said I wasn’t supporting the movement. She also told me I was turning white (I’m Mexican) and that I was joining the wrong side. But my bf and I supported it all the way, I didn’t understand why she cut me off and she never gave me a real reason. 3 years of friendship down the drain all because i was dating a white guy during BLM. I just don’t think she liked my boyfriend and my sisters said she had feelings for me and when I started dating my boyfriend because that’s when she starting acting up.

People just seemed to come towards me for my grades (the typical “be friends with the clever ones” trope). So basically even if i was surrounded i always fell alone so i’ll continue acting sad for the most part and at some point it became a character trait i couldn’t break. Even when i’ll feel happy i’ll just dive into negativity (often insulting myself in my head) just to get back in the state of sadness i should be i guess

i’ve dated this girl last year. I’ve never loved someone other than her but things got sour very fast. with her i was faking (i don’t even know if i wanna be anymore) happiness just so she could stay with me and not be a burden for her. But at the end of the day i started feeling more insecure about petty stuff to the point where i fell back on my old habits. We broke up peacefully enough (she ended up depressed because of me and i had to help her later with that as well) and i fell into the deepest state of depression i ever felt.

i stopped believing in every thing i believed in. My entire vision of the world changed. I have severe social anxiety to the point where i struggle to get to the corner store. i’m an awkward and very negative (i’ve been told) person.

In my freshman year of college, I got really depressed, and in the subsequent years, shut down the idea of making friends or meeting new people. I focused solely on doing well in school and making money. 

I now am 25 years old, have a great job that I enjoy and pays me well. But I still feel extremely empty inside. And realizing it’s due to my lack of relationships. I have just one or two “friends,” whom aren’t that reliable. I haven’t gone on a date in years, and feel that I have no way to meet new people (tried every app).  

I feel constant regret for isolating myself for such a long time, causing me to miss out on so many relationships and experiences. Even though I was/am depressed, and It’s not right to be mad at myself, I can’t blame anything else for my loneliness. 

I’ve tried going out to concerts and restaurants alone, but am naturally an introvert so don’t find myself making many connections, and anxiety sometimes takes over, preventing me from being in the moment. There are things I enjoyed doing alone over the years, but at some point, I need people to enjoy things with. 

I have tons of interests and hobbies, and am a genuinely nice person. Every therapist I have spoken to tells me that I deserve all the relationships I desire. But here I am, sitting alone in my room every weekend.

I had a bright future ahead of me, but I fucked it all up. I used to have passions and love for my hobbies but now I'm dead inside. I've lost all my friends but one: my best friend. At least he knows I'm not a complete asshole. 

The only people I talk are him, my therapist, and family. I talk to my coworkers, but nothing beyond work. 

My life is work, home (my parents house), and every now and then I'll go to the theater or museum or concert to have people around me and make me feel like I'm part of something.

I know I'll probably be lonely for the rest of my life. I do everything pretty much alone. Honestly, even before my arrest I've always been a loner. Most of the time I'm used to the pain of loneliness, but every once in a while it hits me hard (like today).

All the friendships I’ve had were either toxic in one way or another, or just faded out over time. I have one friend now. We’ve been friends since high school although we didn’t become very close until 2 years ago. To be completely honest, if she wasn’t literally my only friend I probably wouldn’t talk to her anymore because she never respects any of my boundaries. I have a boyfriend but he’s always working or busy doing other stuff he makes as much time for me as he can but I do everything by myself, I go to the gym by myself, I run errands by myself, I eat mostly every meal by myself etc. I enjoy my own company compared to a lot of other people but I think that’s because I just don’t have anyone I connect with. When I hangout around people usually my one friend or my boyfriends friends I know that they aren’t people that would ever want to hangout with me if I wasn’t their tag along. I wish I had genuine girl friends. I feel like such a loser when I see groups of girls going out together and posting cute pictures. I’ve never had a real friendship and I wish I did. I feel lonely spending every day alone unless i’m with my boyfriend and I feel bad for him that he has a girlfriend with no friends. I’ve tried making friends too I guess, I go to yoga at the same studio regularly hoping to make a friend, I go to the park, I go to the book store, all hoping a random interaction with a stranger with similar interests will turn into a friend but it never happens. Just venting I guess. I was reading posts on this sub and it’s nice to know I’m not alone feeling this way.

3764,pockets2tight,1657492842,1,"My entire life I battled with extreme anxiety.  This held me back in so many ways and eventually in my mid 20s, August of 2014 to be precise, I realized I was never going to be able to change and I would always be afraid to talk to women, take any sort of risk, and as a result, never be able to be happy and go after the things I wanted.

This led to a severe depression that's lasted the past 8 years.  Nearly daily thoughts of suicide, and not ""oh I wish I was dead"" thoughts. That was 2013 and before.  This was researching methods, thinking about how I wanted to do, who I should write letters to.  

Fast forward to now, 2022.  33 years old and never been more miserable.  Mired in smoking addiction, porn addiction, cam girl addiction, i've never been lonelier and more hopeless.

I've made so many poor decisions in my life, and if any single one of them was different, who knows where I'd be, how my brain would be.  But no, instead I have to live like this - depressed, anxious, neurotic, and probably some degree of psychotic. 

Every single moment of every single day is torturous.  I've tried explaining it, but my family just doesn't get it and just feels hopeless.  My friends essentially abandoned me, and I get it, but it just hurts.

So I’ve always been a “loner” for most of my life. Grew up in a broken home where I had to hide my feelings and become dependent on myself. Instead of going out and hanging out with friends (which I did sometimes) I would spend most of my time with myself or maybe one friend playing video games and making music. At 13, I started to have big dreams of being an artist and the dream had never died. I’m now 23, but around 18 I started going through a spiritual awakening (not just a small one, but now it’s apparent that this is a Kundalini awakening) and I’ve spent the last 6 years in isolation and solitude, and that’s not really an understatement. Yes I’ve hung out with people, I’ve met people, talked to people at work, but deep down and in my company I’ve been alone. In this time I’ve wrote, recorded, and put out A LOT of music to the world on all streaming platforms and have done everything needed to gain an image, take pictures, promote myself, etc etc all on my own. For real. Just me. Mixing my own music, taking my own pictures, being my own cheerleader, support, love. The thing is though, yes I do have a couple people in my life, but they don’t support me like that. It’s like they can see that I very well will achieve fame but they sleep on me and don’t show any love or support even when I am beaming with love and high positive energy. It’s like something in the universe blocks me from the world which might happen with this post and I’m just trying to figure it out. So the main question is, do you think some people are meant to achieve, work towards, and gain success completely on their own? Without the help of ANYONE around, because they’ve been counted out and treated like a ghost?

3785,gearsboxvti,1657487030,1,"This month is the anniversary of Srebrenica Genocide, an unthinkable  tragedy happened in 1995, where more than 8000 people were slaughtered  during the Bosnia War, although I think it was more of an aggression against civilians than a civil  war, from 1992 to 1995. It wasn't the only massacre. During this four  years other atrocities happened like concentration camps, mass rape of  women, shelling against civilians, siege, deprivation of food, water and  health care. Even hospitals with patients dying from cancer were  shelled.

I won't mention of who harmed whom, this is very well  documented. With a persistent, extensive patient research in Youtube we  can find documentaries, news clips and more important testemonies from  survivals what the Bosnia civilians has been through. All I can say is  that some politicians, media and more important intellectuals from a reputed university revived the dangerous nationalism, turning people against citizens of the other republics of Yoguslavia. 

I  was a kid and then teenager during the Croatia and Bosnia Wars. I  remember watching the news and everyday there was something reported  about the war. At some point I was bothered because cease fires were  being broken all the time. Four episodes stuck in my mind about Bosnia  all these decades: a news report about people eating flowers and plants  due to lack of food, a market being bombed with lots of people dead, the  Mostar bridge being destroyed, a concentration camp in some school and a  mass grave discovered by sattelite photos or airplane photos. 

I was a kid from a country totally apart from the Balkans and I remember this well. 

Something  that is keeping in my mind is how ordinary people are capable of such  atrocities but I can't find the answer the proper answer, just some  possibilities. I look at some of Youtube videos taken from the war, and I  note that many of that were kids just a little bit older than me. Not  that older just a little bit, like one year or two older than me. There are some videos where we see young soldiers, of 16 or 17 years old,  holding rifles, fighting and rejoycing the killings and the small  victories. Wasn't they aware the harming they were inflicting in others  that maybe at some point of their lives were their neighbors, school  mates or even friends?  


I realize that their morality and  compassion for mankind was very fragile, and reminds me my high school  years, where I was constantly ethnically slurred and being demoralized  due to my race or religion. Many times I felt alone, and if I had ""good  relationship"" with my collegues was to due my effort of getting along as  best as I could. I still remember one day being uninvited to my  friend's house in the middle of the road, saying to me that ""I decided  to not let enter black people in my house. You will not come with us  because you're black"". I was already 18 years old at that time, so I experienced how fragile their moral were.

3801,ExpensiveVictory2410,1657481984,1,"I'm a 21 year old male, graduated from college just last week. Did most of my degree online due to COVID. On one hand, it feels like coming out of an abusive relationship. I don't think I was ready to make the decision to go to college when I did, and for years I was stuck with a course I had no interest in doing. But after its all done, I'm hit with the reality that I always knew: nothing changes. I always expected college to present me with the opportunity to build my adult social network, but its over before I could even figure it out. Even before COVID, nothing helped. Never could make a friend at class, clubs, whatever. I don't have a license, never had a job, didn't even try to get a gf (want to stabilise myself a little first). Even the slightest awkward transgression like dropping my wallet at the supermarket would make me conscious about my surrounding, I'm on ""social defence mode"" at all times. And a slight social error like my voice breaking while making convo might haunt me for weeks.

I can't even believe how it comes naturally to most people. Spending an unholy amount of time online has left me with so much noise in my head. I know its not real life, but my head has been conditioned to view everything as an online caricature of itself. I like most things geek culture, but now its not even making me happy anymore. I can't think of anything that does. I'm deprived of all sentiment to feel anything good. Every day, every week is just fog. I know the clock is ticking, but I'm too exhausted to do anything. I fear getting old like this, but I'm also overwhelmed by failures. I know my health is bad, but just eating feels like a herculean task. Most times, I don't even finish half my meal. Let alone working out. I need human interaction, but I seldom manage to connect meaningfully even if I do meet someone. Meetups didn't help, literally no app helped. At this point, my life seems like pathetic caricature of everyone else's. I moved out of my country for college, the only friend circle I had is no longer with me. I don't like the mental noise, but my room is also my comfort zone. I don't even know what's gonna happen now. I had the excuse of being a student to keep me going so far, now it just looks like I'll be some deadbeat whose parents spent their entire savings to send him to college only to have him come back and keep mooching off of them. Lots of nights, I have dreams of school, arguably the last time I was ever happy.

I know my life's literally just begun, but I already feel defeated. Its that ""I'm not suicidal but I wish I was never born"" thing for me right now. If 4 damn years of college has just been this noise, then I'm not convinced that life will just turn around if I just ""keep going"". I'm tired of ""trying new things"", its the same outcome over and over again.

In all this, I cannot even believe I managed to complete my degree without burning out midway through. Don't even know what to do next besides slog day in and day out applying for a job.",lonely,Is there even a point now?,2022-07-11 05:39:44

Im 21F, have been in an 3 year online relationship with a guy who ghosted me 6 times. Told me all this stuff about how he wanted to marry me. I stopped talking to him because I couldnt deal with the pain anymore. He still tries contacting me.

Then met another guy online, everything seemed fine, asked me about my day every day, said i looked beautiful, that he enjoys talking to me, even sends video of him partying with friends.

Then a guy at school asks me on a date, I didnt think I could invest in him emotionally since I was talking to this guy online. I told this to him while rejecting him. I instantly regretted my decision. I felt this was a bad decision because I realised im talking to guys online and chance is always small it becomes something real. My ultimate goal is marriage with dating.

I sticked with the guy online because I started getting confused in my mind. A while later I found out on social media he has a girlfriend. I felt really bad and sad. He stopped initiating convos with me after. I stopped talking to him

So I went to the guy at school and asked if hes still open for a date. I texted him about it. He was quite unresponsive and I sent him then a text about that I feel hes mad at me and that hes distant.
He then said I shouldnt worry, he said he likes me but at the moment cant date because of finals. He told me lets stay friends for now and build on that. He was always nice to me and at school too and called me babe and put his arm around my shoulder. After school I walked with him and his friend to the metro and we parted ways.

After that he texted me a meme and we had a conversation about it. Then the next day i sent him a youtube video which reminded me of him, its about his home country. He is online but its been 2 day and he still didnt respond. I know he often text his best friend. Its now summer holidays. Im getting the feeling he lost interest. Or am I overthinking? Im so sad. I just want to marry ssomeone and be in relationship and have love, it truly gives me more happiness. I cant get it somehow. I dont want to go on dating sites, it feels unnatural.

The funniest thing is that she maybe love me. She is very sweet to me, she is always happy, she likes texting to me (she told me that many times). She send me her pics and I send her mine. I think we got great, even amazing connection. 

But I cant feel love. Maybe its some yk trauma of being the oldest brother and of that, that my parents havent care about me. I feel i love her, but I cant feel that anyone love me. If I say to someone i love her then I know its truth I can feel it, but when someone would say to me that (no one ever did that lmao) I wouldnt believe it, for me it would be just dumb words that someone just said not knowing what they mean.

I apologized to her for it and she unblocked me. Ever since then, she started treating me like shit. She was cold and she would always tell me that she doesnt want to be friends anymore. At first, I thought she was pushing me away. After awhile I would occasionally send her memes, stories,rants until one day. She said ""were not friends"" as a reply to a story I was telling her. I snapped and i told her that shes been treating me like shit.  This was her reply ""Ur the one that cant take a hint ive said it countless of times that i didnt want to be your friend im not like this to everyone because they’re not like you that just does whatever. thinking they’re doing smth right when they clearly aren’t so its not my fault anymore ive made it perfectly clear that i didnt want to talk to you and how uncomfortable i feel but u disregarded that cause “we are friends” if i were u id just shut tf up lmao u ruin things for me if i ruin ur day u ruin things that i hold special that i want to think of as a good memory but i cant cause ur there ik its harsh but apparently u dont know how to understand unless i dont say it like this"".

I am a 18 year old guy who will attend the last year of high school in a couple of months and I genuinely don't have a single friend. I kinda have a bad relationship with my parents, no siblings or any relatives near me and I have no friends since I joined high school. I am the kind of person who is very shy and Introverted at first and takes time to open up to others. I would consider myself an interesting and funny person but at first I'm just boring, unintersting and very insecure. Due to this bad attitude I always struggled to meet and know new people, since I was a kid.  In middle schools, thanks to an old friend know in elementary school, I managed to join a group and making a few friends. I was happy with them and i hanged out pretty frequently. But for various reason I stopped meeting with them. I started high school alone and in 4 years I didn't really make any friend or open up with my classmates at all. In the last year and half I think I started talking ""more"" with 3 or 4 classmates but I do not enjoy talking with them and I am sure that tey don't have fun talking to me either. We talk about school stuff, nothing interesting, just to pass time at school. We have nothing in common except going in the same school, different hobbies and different homur. I think a person like me  could never really open up in this situation and right now I actually don't want to since I want to meet new people outside school. Also the covid lockdown period has worsened the situation ( I don't want to blame external factors, since it's just my fault if I'm in this situation but the covid thing surely didn't help me). During lockdown I was appartelty okay, I spent more time online but after all it was not so different from my regular life. But when everyone came back to regular life I felt very bad for several weeks. Everyone was happy because they could see again their loved ones and friends and hang out with them again. I felt lonely than ever. Last year when I turned 17 I was having a hard time for various reasons and as you can imagine I was alone so I promised myself that I would killed myself if I was still lonely by the time I would turn 18. My 18th birthday was two months ago, and as you can imagine I didn't kill myself, I decided that no matter how thing could get bad I will keep going forward. But still, nothing changed, my 18th birhtday was one of the worst day in my life and I cried for the whole week. I am very young but I wasted and I'm still wasting the best time of my life probably. Some people may think that's better staying alone istead of having bad people around but honestly at this point I am just tired of being alone. I feel like my entire existence is pointless and I would like to restart everything. I hate my attitude, now I'm not just shy and introverted. I have low self-esteem, I'm scared of people's opinion and I'm socially akward. I need love, I don't care if it's the love of my life or just ""friendship"", I just want to be considered because right now I feel like I don't exist. The goal for this summer was to know new people and hang out with them. But honeslty I don't know how to start and I already wasted more than a month. I also considered to know people near me online and then meet them but I don't know if it's a good idea. I am not into sport and my hobbies are kinda  ""sedentary"" (idk how to tell it in english), but I actually don't like staying at home and I would love going out with someone. Anyways I live near a big city so the possibilities are endless, but I don't know how to start.I am scared of wasting another summer but I really want to change myself and this situation by the end of the summer.  

I would like to get some advice from someone who has gone through a similar experience (or anyone to be honest). If you read all of this thank you again. Sorry if I was repetitive or confused but english is not my first language and as I said its the first time I spoke about it to anyone, I actually feel ashemed of this situation and myself",lonely,"18 and completely alone, I'm reaching my limit and I don't know how to get out of this situation",2022-07-11 03:28:46

Over the years.
I forgot who you kept trying to make me change.
Now I don't even remember who it was where I wasn't good enough.
So now silence as the days grow long.
Like the distant memory of a long forgotten song.
Where the melody remains.
But the voice is gone.
But see I didn't need you to prove you wrong.
You said I used you for a house to live.
When I sit in a house.
This house isn't a home.
Still this prison walls.
Sand in the stone.
A mark on the grave.

Loneliness and being alone makes me incredibly sad. I feel like I have so much love in me and I would love to share it with someone. I couldn’t be more grateful for my mother and sister and my two closest friends, but I still long for a romantic relationship with someone. 

I’ve had two brief romantic encounters in my life. The first one when I was 20yo, I dated someone for 2 months before he ended it because he got back together with his ex. The next one when I was 24yo for 4 months and it ended because of his messy and unstable life situation. I started to fall for him and I tried to help him, but in the end he needed to prioritize his situation. I’ve had many many crushes, I’ve been on-and-off tinder and a few other dating sites, I’ve been socializing at work (lots of customer service too) and at my university, but nothing.

I get along with almost everyone, I’m fairly good at social situations and I’ve tried going places, concentrating on myself and actively asking people out. At best I talk to someone for a week and then they disappear.

I want to have someone and have a family. I think I look okay, I dress well, regular weight/height, so in a way those shouldn’t be too big of a problem. If I have a chance to talk to someone, I talk to them in a regular/friendly manner: as if getting to know a new friend with an occasional flirt if it fits the situation. I’m never rude or ill-mannered to anyone. But I feel like there’s usually this unsaid mood that I’m on a different wave-length or something…

I don’t often share these feelings of mine with my loved ones, because it would probably sound ungrateful and desperate… My classmates are starting to get married and having kids and the ache in my soul grows. I’m more than happy for my friends but I wish for that too.

Last night I mentioned this to my mother and she said that maybe I’m not meant to be in a relationship/loved and that broke my heart. I don’t know if I should try to forget these feelings and accept the situation like my mother said because trying and failing all the time just hurts too much. What more can I do? Is there a point believing the situation will change?

After some certain incidents, I feel exceptionally lonely &amp; I am having passive suicidal thoughts. Honestly, I have been feeling this type of way since winter 2021. They say it gets better, but does it really? I'm still pretty sour about COVID happening because I blame that for ruining many things for myself &amp; for others.

Ever since I was little, I could not wait to grow up &amp; be able to do whatever I wanted to do, but I remember telling adults this at a young age &amp; they would hit me back with, ""trust me, you don't want to grow up.""

It doesn't help that I am also not great at maintaining friendships &amp; relationships which also puts me in this pickle.

It doesn't help that my hobbies &amp; interests are geared more towards the older community since I am trying to meet people closer to my age (I know that this comment sounds ageist &amp; I have met great older people, but I do think it would be nice to meet others that are closer to my age). It also doesn't help that I am emotionally unavailable hence why another reason it is hard for me to maintain friendships &amp; relationships or getting past the acquaintance level.

I really do question whether I am a good person because looking at others my age seems to be in great friendships &amp; relationships &amp; then I'm just trying to get by.

It hit me today that this time last year I was happily getting to know my fwb without a care in the world. I was braving the new frontier of deep friendship for the first time ever, and we became far closer than I imagined possible. She was a little needy; there was a guaranteed text every hour and I felt smothered at times. But it was better than the absolute nothingness I'm experiencing. Again.

She found a serious partner which is fair-play, I can't criticise that. But her colossal presence in my life reduced to nothing in the blink of an eye, and it feels like my whole life progress has reset to zero; I'm in exactly the same position as before we'd met: Work, come home, speak to nobody, yet see everyone else happily hanging out together.

The worst part - by a fucking lightyear - is getting a taste of how good life can be, before falling back into this endless void. I honestly have no idea how I even managed to escape it - luck had smiled at me for the second time in my 29 years of life. The last time it did that, I was 21. I don't think I can wait 8 more years; I need it now. The nothingness is so much worse after you've managed to escape.

I'm putting myself out there and meeting swathes of new people - I've joined a running group with over 100 people, not with the intent of meeting people, but embracing that as a possibility. I've chatted to several people, but I don't know what to actually ""do."" The fwb thing just seemed to happen by itself; I literally just showed up. I suppose part of me is chasing that and hoping I'll find it again.

I’m 21 and so behind other people my age, I’ve never even had my first kiss. In school and stuff, I mean I noted quite a few people having crushes on me. Mostly boys but even some girls were open about it, and I never did anything with it even if I was interested. Scared they were joking. I was really insecure back then. I don’t really care now, I kinda like the things that make me me. My crooked nose, uneven eyelids, frizzy curly hair, i was a tiny bit chubby and thought i was huge, but looking back gosh I was so stupid. Anyway i like these things now. The same way I would like someone else for the things that make them them. Like their handwriting, I want someone to like my terrible handwriting just because it comes from me. I cherish these things in other people.

 Anyway i ended up dropping out of school because i couldn’t handle it socially and skipped almost every day. I haven’t really had a friend since, but it’s not like I had any then either. I don’t put myself out there, I wouldn’t even know where to start. I am just sorta… the oldest daughter who does everything for everyone in my family and my life doesn’t belong to me anymore and no one really even tries to pretend to care about it. I’m holding onto even family members who emotionally abused me my entire life because I am terrified to be all alone. Im just stuck and alone and i have no one irl to talk to or be held by, it’s getting to the point where I feel too exhausted to ever even try. I never even was a person who liked to be touched but that has completely flipped, im feeling touch depravation like a burn now. And my mental health is the worst it’s ever been, and I am literally below the poverty line and in the worst state in the world now so I can’t get therapy because I am way wayyy too poor and have no insurance, and im terrified to sleep alone. Im just wishing I could connect with just one person, anyone. Sorry this is so long.

3852,MilitaryHistoryMan44,1657461870,1,"Howdy folks, 

Despite using the app for a few years, this is my first full post. I’ve only ever commented on others before.

So I broke up with a girlfriend of 9 years last September, which was awful but I strangely never wanted her back. It wasn’t right and I do think it’s a good thing that it happened. I’m 28 now and starting to panic at the idea of reaching 30 alone.

However, I made the mistake of jumping into dating fairly quickly because I couldn’t stand being on my own. Anytime I start to properly date someone, I suddenly panic and become withdrawn and end up breaking it off. The problem with this is I end up feeling worse because I just can’t stand to think I’ve upset someone. 

I was just wondering if there’s anyone in similar situations and how you cope?

I sometimes feel like I might struggle to find someone who’s right for me down to the fact I’m quite different to most people I meet. It’s strange because I get a lot of compliments and people seem to like me, but my self esteem is non existent and I will often be quite upset when someone says nice things about me because I don’t believe them myself.

I do have college friends but they aren't really the type to hang out outside of college, I tried. My gf dumped me after 6 years together, and she is part of the reason why I don't have friends now, she made it very difficult for me to hang out. 
So anyway since the breakup I live alone. Over summer I work a night job, so thats pretty lonely too. I'd like to get into another relationship but the breakup has left me with deep trust issues and cynicism + dating feels near impossible at this age as women have so many options and nobody is willing to commit.

I tried therapy but didn't like it at all so I decided to stop wasting my money.

You could argue what I've seen isn't true or that I'm ""not seeing the full story"", but when I walk out of my house, when I go and be around other people, there is a 6th sense that I feel which just immediately isolates me from everyone else, and it's ""you're different, and not in the cool way"".

I can see it, it's in the way I talk, I move, I interact with others. It's in our posture, our body language, our facial expressions. It's in our lifestyles, our abilities, our weaknesses. The only difference between me and you? We simply have different privileges and deficits. And my deficits kill me emotionally. My social anxiety, my (likely) Asperger's, my laziness, my feelings. All of them destroy me, and I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel that is supposed to encourage me to keep going.

I’ve gotten more and more unstable since watching my dad die in March after being on a vent for a month in a half. I cannot take it. I fell into a state of isolation. My own family turned their backs on me. The past two weeks have been just as bad or even worse than March. My mom called the cops on me for a suicidal comment despite years of it happening on and off and knowing how it would effect me. Three days in a row of them being at our house. My brother mocked my mental illness and breakdowns in my face. I punched him in the shoulder because I couldn’t take it. He called my mom she called my uncle and they both had me arrested and put in jail. I still feel the handcuffs on my wrists and the cold hard bed breaking down in front of the inmates. The mugshot. All of it. Since being let out I cannot see my brother or family. Despite the provoking and despite that he’s hit me too even recently. I cannot see my dog the only things that’s brought me happiness since my dad died. I have no friends left no family and no support. I cannot be home and have very little savings. I’ve been in a dark hotel room breaking down every day non stop for two weeks now since then. I have to go to court in august. What was already the worst year of my life has gotten worse than I could ever imagine. I’m so close to death and feel that it’s coming this coming week. If not sooner. I’ve been abandoned and betrayed by the only family I had left and the only people who understood and had my side are gone. I haven’t seen our dog in weeks and never will again. Goodbye.

I don’t think my parents think I’m a disappointment, in fact they are very supportive, but that is what I label myself as. I can’t make friends anymore, I’ve grown to think that everyone around me despises my presence, and I don’t know what I did wrong. Everyone that thinks I know what I go through, like my parents, don’t. They’ll never know, no one will.

People will always lie to you and say you're pretty or attractive because they don't want to be mean but I wish people would just be honest so I could move on. I know that they're lying because if these things were true I wouldn't feel so overwhelmingly lonely

I don't believe any man has ever truly been attracted to me and that just makes me feel awful. I'm almost 22 and painfully inexperienced. It hurts to see everyone around you get so much attention when you're always overlooked, not even romantically, just in all aspects of life. 

It's not like I don't try. I go to a HUGE university and I joined clubs and one time even sat out in the grass w a ""random convo welcome"" sign as I worked. I'm kind to everyone I meet. I'm an introvert, but still talkative enough. I try to dress up and wear makeup, which isn't me acting out of character because I genuinely enjoy those things. I have many hobbies that I think are really unique. But those things just never work for me. I feel like I have to work 20x harder than the normal person to even be seen and it's still never enough

My friends say it's because I don't put myself out there or I'm too judgemental but they don't know the truth about everything. I'm never with anyone because nobody ever likes me and that's as simple as it gets. They act like it's so easy and maybe it is for them but I need them to be realistic.

Its a decently cold night in winter, and me and him have just gotten back from work.

Its light and fluffy reading, but visually beautiful and lovingly put together as far as technical reading goes. We flip to one of the nicer examples, where they show a GPU kernel that plots a cool fractal. We are sharing headphones, listening to something calming without lyrics. Alone in Kyoto carries with it this beautiful digitize like feeling that leaves a level calm and clarity within me, as it is discrete, crisp, and there is no uncertainty in it; a nice contrast to everything else in life. Except mr. boyfriend. His affection is clear, and I never have to read between the lines to know what he is really thinking. If I do something that annoys him, he tells me immediately, and if I do something that makes him happy, he lets me know, and the same in the other direction.

We are cuddling, holding hands, there is the occasional kiss or peck.

I had not had sex in over 2 years before tonight, I know that it have been harder due to the pandemic but even before that it was very, very rare that I got the attention of a woman. this does kinda sound like some fucked up incel shit but at times I feel like no woman will ever like me.´

In my working life I'm very successful and don't work to access, in a high demand week I might work 45 hours but usually I try to keep it below 40. I make fairly more than most in their early 30s.

I have very briefly dated a girl or two that broke it of with me because they would not believe me that I actually was working out for sports and not just had them as a ""side piece"", I have never had a ""side piece"" I have barely even hade a ""main girl"" in all my life. I mean these two girls would have been two out of three I have ever had more than one date with...

So that leads to that I probably have a shit personality, makes sense to me. but I do have a large friend group that is always up for hanging out. Why do they want to hang out with me if I'm so fucking unattractive to date? They keep praising me but I'm still not worth dating?

it is not uncommon for me to feel like absolute shit like someone people like to use and don't actually like. what is wrong with me? Why do women call me out as a ""player"" while even more often deem me not attractive enough to even go on a date with?

I don't even know what is wrong with me but I just want to be close with someone, I just want to share my life with someone. Friends are good and all but I want something more.

We also have a very similar music taste. So rock, metal, pirate metal, screamo, death metal, indie, folk, alternative, 80s pop, rock and alternative. Vaporwave, doom jazz, instrumental jazz, nightcore and electronic. We also like the same fandoms: nightvale, supernatural, the office, undertale, invader zim, stranger things, RuPaul’s drag race, legendary, etc. We both have same political views(democratic liberal independent) We both care about the environment and animals. We are nerds and a bit creepy. We both dress in one of the alternative subcultures/aesthetics.

I was talking to this guy from tinder a little over a month and we planned so many things from sex, cuddles, our future, etc he would call me baby, tell me how much he likes me and hopes i don't leave. He would get anxious and overthink but I'd always be there to reassure him that i won't leave. He told me I was different cause I made him comfortable to where he could talk about his trauma. He talked about me to his Co workers and friends.  He stopped talking to me yesterday and all day today cause turns out he was talking to his ex the entire time. Should've known since they just broke up like a few months ago. He called me for an explanation and basically just kept saying idk and that I was a rebound that he used and feels bad for.  Everything I overthought was true. His ex was spending the weekend with him and was hanging out with him while on the phone with me. Turns out they were gonna get back together and he didn't know that she would be 100% into it but she is so now they are trying again cause he loves her. Anyway I wish I had more of an explanation but there's no point, I'm always being used and am the rebound. How will I ever trust anyone and get someone to love me. All I can think about is them laughing, cuddling, and fucking all weekend. Guess I'm back to my lonely self per usual. Sorry for the long rant.",lonely,another rebound,2022-07-10 10:49:37

One of the many horrible moments of the day actually began the night before when she is a flash jumped out of a dead sleep grabbed her throat and passed out.  She was dead though. No question. So the only thing I knew to do was cpr, and I did cpr, chest compressions, the whole nine yards and after what seemed time infinite, the cpr worked. It brought us back together. Through a series of unfortunate events, like the extreme till covid began talking at around this time, hospitals are not interested in taking patients in if vitals checked out. So they refused, even though they're was something clearly wrong. But I brought her back and for that I was crushed and grateful and fill of rage and guilt all at once. Fast forward to the next mid morning. She was conscious, although extremely tired and everytime she made sudden movements, I my heart jumped into my throat. But she seemed to be recovering. At 12:02 pm, july 9th, 2020, the same thing happened again, so I got the paramedics on the way while performing cpr, but this time I failed. I failed the absolute loveliest person I've ever known, I failed her cousins, brother, aunt's, grandmother's and sister. The guilt in it was enough that I would of finally had the courage, no question, to take my own life. But she didn't not deserve the man she loved from the top of her heart, from the very tip of the tallest sky scrapers, down to the submarines. She deserved so much I couldn't give her and I don't think I could forgive myself for that. But she definitely didn't deserve to let me taint her memory by being a coward. I am lost without her, no question. And the colors she used to appreciate so much in her paint, in her world, I fight to see those colors, instead of the chill grey that clenches my heart and has overpowered all my senses. I've never felt so alone in a world that no longer makes any sense, a world where my dreams have been snuffed out by that very cold.

3982,boobiesandslit,1657410071,1,"About a year ago I found myself at the end of a relationship that really turned everything upside down for me. I was engaged to a man that I loved but I had seen some signs in his behaviour and conduct that let me to believe he was in a ‘closet’ of some sort. It came to reality when I stumbled across a Reddit account of his for cross dressing and looking to meet other men. Had I not been involved with him to the point I was; I would have wished him all the goodness in the world for finally having the courage to be who he is. However I was consumed with anger and betrayal as we are both in our 40s. The situation caused a mental breakdown of sorts for me. I ended up being sedated for 6 months and on SSRIs. It was a very isolating experience - friends didn’t really want to hear about how things came to dissolve as I think I learned that some of them are bigots towards the LGBT community. I am not, at all. I’ve had a same sex relationship in the past and I feel everyone should be able to be who they are and love who they want without fear. What bothered me was the lying and lengths he went to conceal who he is from me. And so this is how I’ve ended up acknowledging that I’m lonely.  I’m off the medications now and it’s helping me to acknowledge that I need to make changes. However I’m stuck with this one aspect where the loneliness feels suffocating and crippling and then I make terrible decisions like last night. Getting drunk, on my own, and heading out into the bars in the city, on my own. 
I need to stop this. From tomorrow onwards I’m going to start exercising again. But how to deal with this loneliness? It’s so hard to make new friends where I live and I also work from home. Thanks for reading.",lonely,Impulsivity,2022-07-10 09:41:11

There's no need for introduction of my situation, title says it all. I have already spent in Germany several months and I am most depressed and loneliest that I have ever been. At first I was studying most of the time and it didn't matter to me where to sit in front of the pc, but the first thing I have noticed that made me a little uncomfortable was up to 10 times slower internet than at home. Second thing is insane bureaucracy. Just insane amount of papers, a lot of them are not even digital. Applying for universities is also hell, since unlike in Ukraine it's not centralised, you have to fill out shit ton of forms and papers for each university separately. But the main thing here is overwhelming loneliness. And speaking some German doesn't make it any better, its really hard to communicate with these people. In Ukraine I have had everything: family, friends, education, job. Here I have nothing. I don't imply that I didn't have any problems at home, but there everything was so much easier and better.

I didn’t have to worry about having to talk to anyone. It was nice and peaceful. I don’t necessarily feel like I’m fit to be friends with anyone. As of right now I’m taking a break and I’m not talking to anyone really except for maybe like one person but I used to talk to people non stop and I just felt so overwhelmed. I constantly would be there for everyone and they would just be there for me once in a blue moon. I know that I shouldn’t ever count on anyone or heck even vent because for the most part they don’t care. There’s always someone else they care about more or like. I feel slightly bad that I stopped talking to people because while I love to talk to people it also makes me feel bad because I don’t feel like it’s fully me. I’m happy with people not knowing much about me and I guess with people not knowing me at all. No one has to worry or even think about me. I think that’s cool. Cuz you won’t really let anyone done. I honestly just wish everyone would forget me. I’m not very important or memorable as it is. I’m just a typical person. Most people forget me so I know it wouldn’t be hard for anyone else to do so. Also all of this I’m referring to is online friends. My irls could care less. They literally put in no effort. At least my online friends tried some. I feel like it was smart of me to take a break from everything because I needed it mentally. I do have regret though but kinda deep down I feel like others wouldn’t care about me leaving as much as I would for them. Idk I mean I could probably be wrong but that’s just what it feels like. I care so much about everyone but I feel like no one cares about me. Actions always speak louder than words. I have a lot of patience but it’s getting harder and harder for me maintain it. I kinda feel like it’s diminishing in front of my eyes. It’s always this inner conflict going on in my head. Do they care or do they not? Lack of communication is one of the worst things ever. Most people only talk to me if they want or need something but I’m always open to help them 24/7. I wish I could say the same for them. They also text me in the middle of the night and if I don’t answer them until later because I’m asleep then they won’t respond. Idk it’s just strange to me. I don’t think that’s very courteous. I usually have to put in all the work for everyone or the friendship isn’t maintained. I’m just kinda ticked off about it. I may not text anyone again. No I probably will but as of right now I’m not very happy with anyone. It doesn’t feel like anyone treats me right and then I always have to act like everything’s fine. It isn’t. But they’d never see that. They’d never care. They’d just say I’m crazy or blame me for how I feel. So I just stay quiet and hurt. I’ll just pretend like I’m not real because it at least gives me clarity and makes me feel better for some weird reason. Idk why I’m always there for everyone. I deeply care about everybody but idk if I can say the same about them. Sure they may say they like me or whatever but it just doesn’t feel true. Nothing feels true. That’s why I have to take a step back. At least I can count on myself. Almost everybody I’ve ever been friends with has hurt me. They all leave. It’s just a matter of time. For the most part I don’t even see why I bother to try to be friends with anyone. Especially when they don’t care about me at all. I have a big heart and lots of people use it. I love to make others feel better and I look past everyone’s wrongs but everything is getting to me. I don’t know how much more I can take this. I’ve given everything my best. I’ve tried my hardest for everyone. Maybe not everything is meant to be. At least that’s how I feel now. I wish things weren’t so difficult. But that’s all everything is. Everything is a challenge. Everything is so sad and disappointing. I’ve learned to always have extremely low expectations because no one really exceeds my expectations. At least I won’t be disappointed. It’s so sad because it feels like you only matter to an extent and that it. I’m tired of giving my heart away. I most likely won’t be answering anyone because I’m very sad right now. I wish people cared but I know no one does. All I wanted was a genuine friendship but I always fail to make and keep one. Maybe one day I’ll make and be able to keep a friend that actually cares. But I know that’ll probably never happen. I’ve had the hardest time all throughout my life with making friends. It’s a really touchy subject for me. It just makes me sad. It seems easy to make friends but it’s a lot harder than it seems at least it’s that’s way for me. I’m always overlooked, used, and very easily forgotten. I never feel important. I just feel like a nobody. I prefer to be alone because that’s what I’m used to. I’d love to hangout with people but I’m not even comfortable with talking to anyone. I’m very shy and reserved. I’m intimated by literally everyone. I look very young compared to everybody and I feel like no one takes me seriously. Sure this doesn’t really affect online friendships but it affects irl ones.

I just got done with a friend’s vacation and am really quickly realizing that I am so f*cking lonely. As the title says, I have a decent social circle. A couple friend groups - one of which I was on a vacation with. I’m pretty amicable - I get along with a lot of people relatively easy, which I’m thankful for. But no one ever looks at me romantically. They just see me as a friend and it ends there. Which is really disheartening. It’s not a looks or confidence issue, but there’s just something that doesn’t let people see me in a romantic light. I want to be held. Im touch deprived, yet my love language is physical affection. I haven’t had a relationship in years, but I don’t want to settle for something not good. I’m not super high maintenance, either. I just want someone that can cuddle me and I can be in the presence of. Honestly, I think what spurred this on was the recent realization that I really, really have a huge crush on a friend of mine who invited me on this trip. It’s a strong one and it hit me out of nowhere. He’s single, we like a lot of the same stuff, and we never have a lack of things to talk about. There’s even some flirting here and there. There was even some on the trip. I’m also pretty damn intentional with some of my word choices, body language, etc. I just can’t win, y’all. I’m so fucking lonely all the time and it’s killing me.

People are looking to get their needs met quickly in a way that I apparently cannot provide in a short conversation after which they stop talking to me when I refuse to send them a photo 🤣 and I just want a real friend, someone to care about who cares about me. I want someone to like me and my heart and I want to like them and theirs. And that hasn't happened yet and that's alright. If it's not right it's not right. You can't force a genuine connection. You can't force a friendship. And that's okay. What's meant to be will be and what's not will not happen.

I've come to the sad conclusion that it's alright. I'm alone. I'm unhappy. I'm sad. That's not gonna change any time soon. And that's alright.

I'll get over it. I'm an adult. That's what adults do, we trudge on and we get over it. We don't wallow in sadness and self pity. We keep our chin up and we face the world.

4018,iEatPotatoess,1657402328,1,"(This post is mostly just me venting) I don't really know where to start, and i've never really talked to anyone about this but i've been depressed for a couple of years. It's been progressively getting worse. I've always been excellent in school until this year that just passed, I almost failed. A few days ago i fell apart and now i'm at a point where i don't know what to do with my life, i have no motivation to do anything, and i've been stuck thinking about my problems.

This mostly roots from me having terrible social skills, i've never had much luck making friends, even when i was just very young i was bullied in school and had a lot of issues with other kids however it didn't really get to me, I thought it was normal, but then as i got older the bullying started getting worse. I started developing social anxiety and becoming self conscience and insecure about how i look and act as people pointed things out. I never really told anyone though since i didn't have anyone to talk to about it and i didn't want to worry my parents. 

This has all lead me to seclude myself from people and still continue not to have friends at school. I've also grown distant from a lot of my family as well since I usually don't go to any family events, mostly because even though it is my own family i always feel like i'm gonna be judged when i go to them or just go out in general. I feel really shitty about this and i've still gone to a few family events when i've gone too long without seeing some family, but i still wish I wasn't this way. The closest things i have to friends right now are some people that I hang out with online, I would like to call them friends but frankly I don't know what they think of me or if they even care about me at all i mean that with no offense to them I just have no reassurance and I overthink about the subject.

Now ever since I started secondary school (basically a mix between middle school and high school), I don't really have many friends to hang out with. Now don't get me wrong, I did make a lot of friends in secondary, but none I can really hang out during the school holidays. There was this one girl I met, we became great friends, basically we met at art class as she sat opposite me and then we started to become good friends. I did give her my Discord tag so we could stay in touch during the holidays, but she never friended me. She also announced she was leaving the school, I even made her a goodbye card, but she left school a few days earlier than what I thought. 

Now don't get me wrong, I still have most of my primary school friends, but sadly the only one who hates me is my childhood best friend. We shared a lot of common interests, we played after school, and stayed best friends for around 9 years. In 2019, I joined Discord, and in 2020 me and her became friends on it. Then she started to cut ties with me all because of my immaturity back then and she said that she doesn't care if I changed. Sucks.

i've been in my room, isolated, trying to make myself happy and telling myself, ""it's gonna pass"".
i'm angry at everything, i'm so frustrated, i don't even know where i'm going with this post because i have no much to say, but don't know how to express anything.

i've attempted to kill myself multiple times, first time when i was 11. i got sent to the hospital and mum had church people come over to pray for me. thanks, thank you so much, God.

i go to school. i talk with people there. i go home, and i'm in my room alone again. brother comes in intoxicated, we fight, i get a new bruise. i scroll through instagram and i see people's stories, god damn they seem happy. venting about how their crush left them on delivered for 1 minute.

i know one person who gets new stuff everyday. she and her dad were fighting one day, and she got sad so she decided to buy a macbook with his money. she would tell me she doesn't have friends and the next day she'd post selfies of her friend group on a cafe. she goes to therapy and brags about it on her story saying ""my therapist said 'come back tomorrow' LMAO i think i'm mentally okayyy???"" 

all of them have friends, they hangout in the weekends and they wear cool clothes and cool shoes. they seem so happy. my seatmates tell me all their dramas on monday. i don't think i have ever talked about myself to any of them.

i taught myself how to play guitar when i was 10, and i write songs a lot. i have not done it in a while.
my favourite song to play was These Days - Nico. i used to play it everyday and sing to myself.
i have a lot of playlists, and i take good care of all of them. i'm a dumb motherfucker as well.

How this happened: Working weekends makes it hard to socialize IRL so I spend a lot of time online talking to people in different time zones. After covid, I became even more isolated because my favorite coffee shop and bar closed down and my meetup groups dissolved.

I met a couple of these internet friends in person and got close to their extended families. These people are kinder to me than my own family. We talk almost every day, despite the time difference. 

But I still get lonely. I come home from work to an empty apartment. Holidays are spent in my room eating microwaved meals. If I want to do something in my city, I have to go by myself. 

If it was just state borders dividing us, I would have moved the day I got home from my first visit. But you can't move countries without valuable job skills, and my standard of living and safety would likely decrease if I left.

4085,Red_Hood_One,1657371713,1,"I'm not sure where I'm going with this post but I would just like to talk freely to a bunch of strangers.

I'm turning 20 this year (finishing up my second year of national service in a few months), and I have absolutely no idea what im going to do in the time  before university. It feels like my whole life I've only known how to follow the most basic path set. Go to primary school, do PSLE, go secondary school, do O Levels, JC etc etc. I just do whatever everyone else is doing. After A levels i kind of hit a rock. I knew i had to choose a uni course (because thats what everyone does) but i had no actual interests. I secured a decent place in NUS business but not because i liked it or had any interest, it just seemed like a safe and basic thing to choose.

In my time in national service i thought i would grow more and develop more interests as a person in my spare time but nothing really happened. I don't think I developed much as a person and I think I've wasted the 2 years. I'm worried that I'll grow up and just do a meaningless job I don't like forever and just die feeling unfulfilled. But the thing is i genuinely don't know what I like. I am good at one thing, and it's that I can play my chosen instrument decently well and have made some music that I am proud of. However I don't know how to market myself or sell this in any way that can be that profitable so at most it can be some side income.

Onto the second thing I wanted to talk about, which is that I am constantly feeling lonely. I have friends, and I am very lucky to have them. They are good friends and I enjoy their company. But I just can't help feeling like I only enjoy their presence because they are people that everyone gets along with and I'm not special in anyway. I have no group of close friends that I hang out with often. I think this was honestly my own fault.

I didn't really make many close friends in school, mostly just surface level friends and none very meaningful. The few friends I hang around now are always one on one, because I'm bad at interacting with groups. Anytime I hang out in groups I always become very reclusive and feel like I have nothing to contribute to in the conversation. I thought I was a close member of my last class in secondary school, but slowly they just started going out more without me and now I rarely if ever talk to any of them. These past 2 years have constantly just felt like a scramble to find people to hang out with on the weekend. And anytime I do i feel the need to post about it on social media to make myself look less lonely and pathetic. I feel I've drifted apart from many of my school friends and I'm worried my social skills will have degraded more by the time I reach uni.

I know this sounds incredibly juvenile but over the past 2 years my longing for a significant other has become more and more intense. I keep having this terrible mindset that if i manage to get a girlfriend, someone who chooses to like me, and be with me, only then can I be feel fulfilled. Because if someone likes me enough to be with me, it must mean I'm someone worth keeping around. It doesn't help that the few people I hang out with are girls, and they all have boyfriends. Every time I meet them, I enjoy spending time with them, but at the end of the day I always just feel very bitter and lonely. I know thats a really selfish and unhealthy way of thinking but I just find it very difficult to be happy for others sometimes.

I wish I had made better and closer friends in school, because those days are long over, and I have no idea what the next few years will be like. I'm worried that I'll go to uni and continue to be alone, and continue to spend my free time isolated and thinking to myself. I've built my entire self confidence around how much others like me and want to be around me, and being an introverted person who finds it difficult to hang out in groups and has few friends, it's made me feel like somewhat of a failure.

I know that I have a good life, and I'm lucky to have everything I have. But sometimes things just seem kind of bleak.

Then there are the dating apps and I've gotten a few matches but I haven't been able to start any conversations, so I loss self-confidence.

4128,flame22x,1657350208,1,"I(20M) have been chatting with this girl for a whole year during the pandemic (2021), countless nights and midnights watching movies together (most of the times  just the two of us), spend New Years together on a call on discord (cameras , champagne and all that silly stuff), and as time went by it seemed okay to go out since more and more people were getting the vaccine. we live in the same city, study in the same uni, everything seemed alright. 

We met before in a mutual friend's party, but never met just the two of us, so I finally decide to ask her out, it was near her birthday so i decided to get her something a few days earlier, as i didnt know if she was actually going to celebrate it or not, so i made up a story that we should meet up as it was something really important, i was going to surprise her.

The day comes and i wait at the place we agreed on, with the gift on my hand. An hour passes , but it seemed alright since she said she had a fame of being late . 

2 hours, and i start to get worried so i text her to see if shes safe, nothing, i get really anxious so i go and talk with my friends that were on a discord call to see if i could calm down a bit, still no reply from her.

On the third hour i was ready to give up and face reality, she messages me, says she is okay and that she is on her way. I wait a little more, still not there, I call her,  and then she asks me if i could go meet her somewhere else (a place i didnt know how to get to).

I was already so pissed off and upset, but i still found a way to get there and... No one is there... I still try to confirm if i was at the right place, I was.

 I then realised that during that phone call, she was already with someone else, about 3 or more people judging by my impression, so i ask her just to confirm if she was with someone, she confirms. I ran out of patience, then go to back my house, devasted, told her that i had stuff to do, she then asks ""What was so important that you had to tell me ? Can we talk about it on discord ?"" ,i say ""We deal with this later"", as i end the conversation. 

A couple days pass, then i messaged her to wish her ""Happy Birthday"" despite still being upset, as she still meant something to me, even if not romatically. My birthday came a few days later, she didnt remember. No one did actually, even my friends.

She never apologised, she didnt message me once since that day, and i still have that present with me, and i dont know what i will do with it, for now it just seems like a reminder of the day that i got stood up twice in the same day, while trying to make a surprise.

The worst part is, I am not mad anymore, in fact i still want to be friends with that person, we had a lot of fun despite only being through discord. In my head she is not as bad as i made her look through this post.

I dont have many friends, but im well aware that im forgetable, almost invisible. And even if some people, like my friends, treat me like i dont exist sometimes, i forgive them. I do it because i know that without them, i have no one. No love, no friends, nothing.

Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door

Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there

Well, I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately and I think part of why so many guys don’t want to date me is because I won’t have sex unless I’m in a committed relationship. The grooming introduced me to the kink community way too early and for a long time I only associated sex with kinky sex, and now I have a hard time having sex or doing sexual things casually. I’ve even told guys this and they date me but after we have sex they soon end it because thats all they wanted. I just think so many guys just want sex and it’s really frustrating trying to date. My bios all say no hookups but they all ignore it and ask anyways and every time it happens I get more discouraged. One of my exs loved that I was so knowledgeable in kink stuff but I didn’t always want it rough and harsh but thats all he did and it made me feel even more used.

We stopped speaking 3 months after meeting because he spent Valentine’s Day with me and decided it was too overwhelming. I didn’t pry and let him go. A couple months later he eventually apologised for how things ended but nothing came of it, and a few months after that I wished him happy birthday and one thing led to another and we resumed our fwb situation. This time round it was a little more intense, we began to act more like bf/gf and after supporting each other through some rough patches he disappeared on me again with no explanation. Part of me knew he would do this again, but I also wanted to cherish every moment I could have with him and hoped he’d choose to stay with me. He will probably never know this but it was devastating to me, I felt like I’d lost my best friend and completely alone. It took me 6 months and several therapy sessions to accept this situation and start moving on from it because I never had any sort of closure.

For the past few years, I've been ignored, made fun of, laughed or even bullied by the people that I'm surround with. They pick on me for everything that I like, always try to correct wether I'm in the wrong or not and pretty much and pretty much looking down on me 24/7. 

I haven't the slightest clue how to get out of this. I don't have anyone else. Most of my family doesn't know a simple fact about me, I barely know my father and so only my dear Mother is here for me, but I want anything but her to be sad. I don't want her to be stressed, none of that. She is to pure of a soul to be involved in this..

I don't know what to do.. I'm not good at many things, even if I'm, my 'friends' never have a good say about. It doesn't matter how much love I put into my arts ( I love to draw and paint, but mainly in black and white, due to my lack of colorvision), or how hard I work on anything, it doesn't make a difference.

I don't feel appreciated one bit, and I haven't been able to get through a day without having a meltdown at least at one point.

I've come to hate to move out. And honestly, I'd rather live another life sometimes.. most of my happiness is all thanks to my Mom, for accepting me, and trying to make me smile, even if she doesn't know everything.

Do you Girls/Guys/Ladiens/Men have any tips on how to improve my life or simply how to move on? I'd appreciate every tip.. and to those who have gave my definitely not short post a read, I thank you.

however, i don't think that i have felt in a very different way for my whole life, but i have expected more from my twenties. not much has changed though, and the pandemic even made it worse. yes, i am doing my all to enjoy my alone time and i'm pretty okay with it. despite that, i am still a social being. i want to enjoy loving connections which i barely have; have some fun, go to concerts, get drunk, talk about anything, get involved socially. it's making me so sad, especially when i see that most of my peers seem to have it all together. how on earth do i find my people?..",lonely,it's killing me,2022-07-09 04:14:59

Wondering how many of you have this issue, and how you deal with it? 

Like all of you here, I am dealing with feelings of loneliness every day, lack of friends, no close family, etc... but normally  I can kind of deal with this, or over-ride these feelings/dark thoughts by entertaining myself with books, games and/or Netflix, but lately even that isn't helping.

I just spend 35 minutes watching previews of different shows and movies on Netflix, but couldn't settle on something to watch. My 'Watch List' is also growing but I just ignore it...

How do you snap out of this? Or do you just accept it and wait for it to pass?

I had a real bad breakup March 2021 after being in a relationship for 5 years. I had a hand full of friends prior to my break up. 90% of my time was spent with my ex since we went to the same college and worked the same job. Since the break up I became very depressed and got physically sick. 

All the friends I had I pushed away including my best friend of 10 years. I spent my time alone for the past year not talking to anyone at all. It was very hard being alone since I was so use to being with my ex 24/7. I was very angry and didn’t want to talk to anyone at all even tho I at times had the urge to talk to someone.

Fast forward to this past Monday I decided to reactivate my Instagram. One of my old friends texted me and we started having a nice convo until he started updating me on how my ex was “doing crazy shit”. I got angry and just blocked him. I now do not feel like reconnecting with any of my old friends in fear of them talking about my ex.

Then my old best friend decided to reach out to me so we could catch up and get dinner. I agreed even tho I didn’t really feel like going out but, at the same time I did since I would be interacting with someone else.We hung out but I didn’t get the high I was looking for when I hung out with her.

I feel like I'm such a horrible person and I have theses infinite loads of sadness carrying around like atlas carrying the world, and I can't do it Any more.. I just wanna be happy, some one to listen and understand and help me through this.. Please someone help me through this

I actually have a lot of things which I want to share rn but all I just need is someone or some people who can actually listen. I've tried to explain this to my friends but no one cared.

The chains which are holding me from all sides are also the chains causing me excruciating pain and slowly disintegrating and rusting and rotting that they're slowly getting loose.

Ever since 2020 my mental health has been spiralling, not sure why, but I started drinking hard liquor frequently and smoking weed.

I still had a good relationships with my family and close friends I talked to daily but near the end of the year I got into a fistfight with my alcoholic+abusive father and beat him up.

I left home for a couple weeks and when I came back I started distancing myself from my friends and family, stopped going to school and got fired from my job. By mid-2021 I was planning on killing myself and my family was getting very worried.

I ended up getting another job to keep myself occupied and to save up money but I was still directionless and would break down crying on a daily basis.


Fast forward to now: I've lived away from home for 3-4 months now working full time as a dishwasher and saving money up to go travelling. My friends have moved on with there lives and most of family aside from my parents; don't talk to me.

I love my family&amp;friends and want fix what I had but it seems insurmountable haha.. I still have 3 friends who care about me but we don't speak often, I know I could rent an apartment with them next year once they graduate tho.

Anyway...
I think I have 3 options for the future at the moment.

1. Rent with some friends, focus on advancing a career in cooking and dedicate a solid amount of time to powerlifting to get fit.

2. Live with my parents again and focus on finishing the rest of highschool (2 years I would have to repeat) so I could potentially go to university if I wanted.

3. Get a job on a farm as a Shepard, focus on learning how to hunt and possibly live in the forest for a bit.

This past October there was a rift between my best friend and I and it just hasn’t been the same since. She was one of my two close friends and losing her friendship has been such a struggle for me. I mourned the friendship but I was fine because I still had my one other close friend. Well, I did. I met my friend around 2 years ago online but we never got to meet until March. We both shared feelings romantically for each other but I was hesitant to start anything out of fear of harming our friendship, and since he was basically the only friend I had left I didn’t want to risk it. I told him this and he heavily reassured me that if we went on a date and it was weird then we would pretend it never happened, so we met and the date was great! We saw each other around once a week until the week after my birthday. I didn’t think too much of it until he kept dodging my questions when I’d ask when we could see each other again, or when I’d say I missed him he’d just not reply or change the subject. Last month he didn’t text me for hours and when he did it was a simple text saying he didn’t think we should see each other again. I wasn’t completely surprised but what he said next really hurt me. I asked him why the change and he told me I didn’t meet the expectations he had for me and he just didn’t fall for me like he thought he would. This was one of my biggest worries that I expressed to him back in March, and he told me that he had no expectations set for me and it just really broke my heart when he sent me that text. We went from talking every day to no contact in less than 12 hours and I’m just so bummed about it. Now I have no friends and am back on dating apps but I am just so miserable and lonesome. I just want to hide in my room forever at this point. I have a private snapchat story where I sometimes mention how lonely I am in the secret hope someone on it will invite me to do something, but it never happens.

4315,Skullcastgaming,1657269178,1,"I'm from India.
It has been hard throughout my whole life to get believable friends and even if I get some, they will turn their back soon. Few years back, I would have cried my ass out because of having no friends. Nowadays I have matured and don't give a fuck.

So Right now I am going to ask a question.
Hear me out, Thor love and thunder released here in India yesterday. Me and my two friends, Jeswin (a friend I personally know and with whom I was planning to go abroad with) and Pranav (who is a diehard marvel fan like me). I asked both of them few months backs whether we can go together or not. They agreed, until the last week before the movie. Pranav said that he is going to a temple so his mother won't allow him to go but he'll try his best to come. At the same time I asked Jeswin and he straight away said he won't come which didn't surprise me at all. Coz he always changes his decision at the last moment. I was in a huryy, because we were planning to go to PVR which is way more popular theatre and we have to book the tickets early otherwise we won't get a seat. So I asked Pranav again and he said he won't come so don't wait for him. I was really angry but I didn't care. I asked another friend of mine namely Steven and went yesterday to another theatre because all the seats were booked in PVR. Tbh, he is only one who always comes with me to movies and I rarely know him. 

Today I came to know that Pranav and Jeswin has went to PVR with another friend. I don't know what to say, I am not sad but I'm surprised, confused, angry. Like why? I am not asking them to pay for me, I was just asking them to go together. This is not the first time Jeswin has done this shit. Hell, even most of my classmates are like this. Won't even call me when they get together. Now I don't even know whether I should go abroad with Jeswin coz idk when he'll backstab.

So my question is : Why do these so-called friends do these kinds of things to me? Because I am a nerd? Because I love them more than they do? Because I am stupid enough to not understand that they are not my friends? Couldn't they be honest that they don't want to come with me? That is what is hurting me the most.

4331,Pleasant_Cobbler_801,1657262310,1,"I have had 2 rough years, dealing with depression and trying to become happier, it happened and yes I am happy I was over the phase but I still have problems. 

I watched 2 videos online mainly Ankha and Meru. Just typing the named makes me feel bad, they were sex animations and were everywhere, heck even Big content creators had somehow included Them in their videos on YouTube. It got so bad that I had to seek a psychologist and I almost broke up with my girlfriend, because she is an online girlfriend from France whom I have never met or seen, a picture from even tho we have been together for, 1 year actually I have seen 1 picture, but she blurred her face. Idk she is very scared of taking pictures apparently. 

I walk around and read things like, “I met someone cute and had sex with him” or something like that, and I met 2 girls online who was around 20 and asking a friend of mine who was 14 and I’m 19 btw. if he wanted to see nudes, while we played valorant. All of this of course fell into the traumatised part of my mind. 

One of the girls seemed innocent and suddenly went totally sexual. I just can’t anymore, This feeling of being the guy no one wants and being stuck in a relationship that won’t even go anywhere. And being stuck in my mind constantly tearing me apart, is hard. 

Anyways kinda lost at this point, guess I really wanted sex and becoming a guy who is frequently picked and not having trauma, and being able to state my needs does seem to be a dream far away. It’s not even because I’m ugly it’s my mindset or something like that. I mean I can’t even talk to girls wh having a girlfriend, because I don’t want to be the guy who ruins my girlfriend. Btw she ain’t the type of girl who is really sexual, but she is cute and loveable. I just guess I don’t really care that much about love when the only thing I’m constantly feeling is.

Im the loneliest guy in the entire university, i first thought it could be due to my ugliness, but there's people way uglier than me that have lots of friends, including females. I have tried, i have pushed my limits, i greet everyone in the morning, ask them about stuff, say funny things in conversations, i've stretched my personality far beyond my boring self to be worthy of some human affection, but nothing, with every interaction or contribution i make, i can't help but be awkward. No one sits next to me in class, no one bothers to chat with me in the hallway, and the people that i have managed to know a little bit just talk with me about academic stuff and dump me as soon as someone more interesting walks by.  Even things like walking with a couple of dudes on the street, they forget im there with them and leave me behind as im trying to catch up with them, or when theres a group of people talking and form a circle they always leave me out of it. I fluctuate between periods of great social motivation and  hateful bitterness towards my classmates for not wanting me.

Besides the hardships that brings to my life, the loneliness is starting to become overwhelming to the point it is making me sick. I keep trying to remind myself humans weren't meant to be this alone and most people have at least one person to converse with. But I don't. And the few times I get the opportunity, it's almost out of pity. No one really wants to talk to me. 

I do try to date but it sometimes makes it worse. I've been talking to someone and we had a date and it was cool and fine. Some people feel a week of little to no conversation before the next date is fine but for me, it'll have been the one human willing to have spoken to me and I can't be desperate or I ruin future opportunities for conversation and human contact. 

And then I think about all the people they probably have to talk to. And I'm just one of 10 in their day and by the time they get around to me, they're not really looking for a deep conversation. Mostly they're just looking for me to fulfill the romance they're missing in their life because they're not inherently lonely. The same could be said for attempts at making friends - I'm even less of a priority and always someone they've just met so unless the conversation serves a purpose for them, they don't really want to chat either. 

My dream is for someone to truly empathize with this and put into action something that benefits me. That they realize I don't really have anyone and an hour of their time every week or so would be nice, but regular contact would be even better. Someone who really cares and can see the pain of being so alone. I'm tired of giving - I give and it just comes off as desperate. I can't just serve others for the greater good because I still suffer being alone when I'm not serving. 

I've spent the day very anxious, trying to do chores and distract myself and do all the ""right things"" but I still want to cry. I'm still so frustrated. I just want someone to actually care that isn't paid to do so. Just one person.",lonely,its really taking its toll,2022-07-08 10:41:55

I make good money for my age but debt from an old car that I spent way to much fixing and debt from going to college for a semester because I thought it was what I wanted to do has been crushing me and I work my ass off putting in so many hours but it’s never seems to be enough. I don’t buy myself anything not new clothes unless what I have has been worn down so much it’s unwearable, no fancy tech, I don’t go out anywhere but still no saving or getting closer to any goals I have. 
I’ve had relationships in the past but what I thought was the perfect girl always had a way of turning itself around into some form of extreme event in my life that led to being dumped, losing a friend when I had poured my heart and soul and done everything I could to keep them happy.

The one thing I do have and I cherish is my cat I love him more then anything not like there’s much else to love, even if there was I would still cherish his life over mine.",lonely,Why am I even here?,2022-07-08 09:49:30

4377,shuckerjuckel,1657236809,1,"(m24) I need to come clean about something here: why I am lonely. 

I am lonely, because of me.  I never learned how to care for and emotionally support people.  I never learned how to listen, and take my ego out of the scenario.  I always have played it passive, waiting for someone to come talk to me and validate me.  I have never thought of myself as someone who was worthy of talking to the more competent kid and pretty girls.  I go into every social scenario thinking ""no one likes me, I am worthless, I am not worthy of anyones time"".  I listen to those thoughts and then i isolate myself from people.  I feel like I am a burden to people, and i only bring sadness and pain wherever I go.  I am dead inside and aloof when talking to people.  ""why even bother doing any small talk if it's not going to lead to anything"" is what I play over and over in my mind.  I dont give myself any chance ever.  I sometimes think of an alternative me, someone who was outgoing and proactive and reached out and supported people.  I wish i was like that, but I'm the opposite.  So, that is why that has been the case ever since adolescence ended, but, im trying to work on it.",lonely,Why I am lonely: It's mostly because of me,2022-07-08 09:33:29

I just got out of a toxic friendship that lasted 2 to almost 3 years. Seeing these signs made me angry and sad. I met my dream bff on Instagram. We talked and talked a lot (almost everyday for hours on end) on discord and we did an occasional voice call. They were freakishly similar to me and had a lot in common with me. My dream since I was little was to find a person like that and I did. I was beyond happy and couldn’t wait to meet them in person. But that dream turned into a nightmare. I’m all alone now but I’m glad I got out of that friendship. I used to have a group of friends in middle and high-school but we drifted apart. I’m socially awkward so it’s hard making friends.

4396,Which_Albatross_8085,1657225954,1,"Hello everyone, I'm a 37m VERY SINGLE, lonely, depressed, stressed, and have no friends at all. 

I have been trying to figure a few things out over the last 12 years, since my last girlfriend cheated on me with her boss and I found them together in our bed when I came home from work early. 

A little back story. 
Then 
My ex (27f)  and I had been together for 7 years. I (28ml worked a wearhouse job making $18+ Fu benefits for both myself and her. She worked in child care. I gave her everything she needed and most of what she wanted, including a $3k 6karet diamond 4 piece set ( necklace, earrings, bracelet, and engagement ring). I never raised my voice, never hit her, always gave her the D when she wanted it, no matter when or where we were at. I PAID 95% of the bills short of her phone. I even bought her a car for our 2yr anniversary. 

One day I was at work, 4am - 4pm shift. We got done with all orders for that day and most of the next-days so the boss told us we could cut out 2 hours early. Since the next shift was already there. So I grabbed my stuff clocked out, and went home. 

As im pulling to the corner I see my girlfriends car in the driveway and a second car in my spot. Not thinking anything about it , I pull up in front of the neighbors house. I step of my car and hear music blaring from my house. The neighbor comes out and asks me if I could turn the music down and who was  the man the other car belongs to that followed my girlfriend?  I told.him I didn't know. But was about to find out. Before I turned the music down so they don't hear me come in. 

I Walk up to the front door and it's locked both top and bottom. So I unlocked the door and walked in being as quit as I could on tile floors. Thankfully the music was so loud they didn't hear me. So I walk to the back yard thinking they might be out back. Nope, no one there. So I check the basement to see if they where down stairs . I Walk down and no one there either. So at this point only two other places left in the house to look our bedroom and the study.  So I start walking towards the study and I start hearing her moaning as well as a guys voice telling her that her PUSSY was tighter today then it has been before. So I walked up to the bedroom door and it gets louder so being pissed off to hear my girlfriend cheating on me. I KICKED the door open as hard as I could. Walked in and found them both in shock, and to my surprise in was her boss, a short fat dude.  At this point my blood was boiling.... I walked over to the bed grabbed her boss by the hair and pulled him off her, and throw him AGAINST the dresser. They both freaked out, he grabbed his cloths and ran out the house slipping on the tile floor a couple of time. ( Thank God for the hidden cameras in Hall way, living room, and front door area. ) After following him out the front door an making sure he left , I went back to the bedroom and just straight up asked her why would she cheat on me and throw away a relationship of 7 years. Her response was so she could get a promotion at work , and because she wanted to and could. So I responded ok if that's the case then she can pack her shit, call her family to come pick her up , and she was to leave the $3k jewelry set I had just bought her the week before. As we as  the keys to her car that was in my name , as well as the house keys.  I walked out of the room grabbed her set of keys took of the car keys and the house keys , then I grabbed her wallet and took out the bank card and credit cards that had both our names on them as well as the check book. Then as she was getting dressed I called the bank, checked the account to see what in the account then had her removed for the account permanently. Then called the credit card companies and closed the cards . Cancelled the insurance on her car an removed the plates. Then I called her family and told them.they had to come get her and all her clothes and shit. Cause it was over between us, that I just caught her sleeping with her boss in our bed.  An that I was taking the car and the jewelry back so they would have to come get her that day. Because she wouldn't have access to the house when she leaves. 

Question for the women in this group. 

Why do most women cheat on their Boyfriend when the guy they are with gives them everything they could ever want and or need. An he treats you 1000% better than you do him. An he still treats you with respect, dignity, Love , loyalty, passion, and care. Has never raised their voice to you, never hit you. An puts your needs over and above his own an doing with out the things he needs so you can have the things you need and want ??",lonely,"M37, Lonely, depressed, stressed, friendless",2022-07-08 06:32:34

4 1/2 years ago in highschool, I was sitting on a lunch table with my girlfriend at the time. She had her arm rapped around mine. In the distance a boy with a lunchbox was walking over with his head down, then he looked up at us. He stopped walking and stared for awhile, then he walked very fast away. The irritation he felt could be felt a mile away. 

The girl I was with looked in his direction when he was leaving, then looked at the table. 
Well it turns out that boy liked that girl, like alot. I saw him in the hallway even a few days after and he looked depressed, angry, and sad all at the same time.

Fast forward 2 years, I was out of a relationship. I met a girl who absolutely blew my mind. You guys know what love is and what liking someone is so I'll skip explaining too much.
We talked for about 8 months, I was obsessed.
Well it turns out that she didn't like me that much. 
Sparing the details it literally broke me for awhile, sent me to the hospital.

Fast forward another 2 years, to present day. I'm graduated, unemployed and lost, need to work out, recovering from a surgery. me and that sad boy switched places. He's buff now, has a job and a car. He's in a nice relationship. But here's the catch, he's not in a relationship with just any girl. He's with the girl that broke my heart. He of all people, is in a beautiful relationship with the girl that brought me to my knees.

4410,StonerHippieTM,1657220853,1,"I haven’t ever really been a people person. Introvert. F’ed up. Weird. Loner. Those that were ever close to me, few and far between, are no longer in my life for either they left or I pushed them out. It’s hard for me to open up to people and trust is big thing for me, something that’s been broken multiple times. I finally was done trying to connect with others in a meaningful way. Too many bad relationships, broken friendships, or no one really took time to get to me/once they did they realized I was a mess and said “peace out”. Sure, I’ve had wonderful best friends but only one at a time, maybe two at most. Then, they would for some reason leave or we’d drift apart. 

Being lonely is a catch-22 for me. While I don’t want to get hurt again and don’t feel many really know me or stick with me once they finally get to know the real me, I also want a deep strong connection with a person or two.

There are so many lonely souls wondering out there. Especially with the pandemic hitting, social isolation and inability to be with loved ones, made the loneliness even worse. 

I was thinking how rad it would be to find a way to connect all the lonely hearts out there so they’d know they weren’t alone. Most often I can connect with other lonely people very well, there’s similarities in interests, thoughts and feelings. Let’s find a way to gather all the lonely souls and I bet beautiful lasting friendships would be made! After all, humans were mean to connect to one another and have strong relationships. So, who’d be down for a chill but fun getaway to meet other lonely people and perhaps make the connection of a lifetime?!
(Maybe this has already been raised as an idea, if so, I apologize I didn’t intent to “copy” from someone else. 

For today, try to connect with at least one other person, even if it’s just for a few minutes. And then do other activities they keep you calm positive and patient. You’re enough, more than enough. You are loved.",lonely,Lonely Hearts Club - Gathering all lonely souls together,2022-07-08 05:07:33

4413,_hearforit,1657218699,1,"I've been doing a ton of research and recently I came across this study:

[https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tweets-and-Teens.pdf](https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tweets-and-Teens.pdf)

What it shows is that *how* we communicate with the people in our life makes a huge difference on how we end up feeling. In-person communication (when positive) triggers the release of the neurochemical Oxytocin. This has the effect of:

1. strengthening relationships bonds
2. improving mental health
3. lowering stress

Per this study, \*text-based\* communication (texting, email, social media, etc.) has next to no neurochemical benefit. It doesn't trigger the release of Oxytocin. As such, you can text all day long and still feel more alone than you ever have.

Last part: the most interesting part of this study is that \*audio-only\* communication (i.e., like a phone call) can have the exact same neurochemical impact as in-person communication. In other words, talking live with someone can make you feel less alone, build closer relationships, and ultimately feel better about things. That really blew my mind! That simply audio communication can do so much!

Quite frankly I don't have any friends, I've tried, I've ended up in groups of people and felt like an outsider every time. Either it was a bad group of people that on the surface seemed coarse but underneath was terrible and bigotted, or ended up in groups that have all these inside jokes and running references that are hard to feel a part of.

I've never been in a relationship and at this point, I'm fairly afraid to be. I feel like everyone in my age range is going to expect a level of experience with them, but I've got none.

I take steps to put my life together, to lay foundations and move forward. I try to enjoy things and my work and be open to meeting people and things outside of my experience, but honestly, it just feels pointless.

It just feels pointless to do things alone, to go through life simply to go through it. And I don't know what I'm here for exactly, maybe someone has advice, been through it before.

I can't feel that connection. Its absence is devestating, and then the devastation fades away and I'm left with nothing.

4436,ObscureUsername420,1657204090,1,"As per the title - I have many people in my life, in many areas, such as family, friends, people from school and work etc. But I have always felt alone. I've never had someone I've felt super comfortable with and poured all of my trust into - not even my own parents. This is likely an issue stemming from me, not them, which I understand, but over the past couple of months, I've been really struggling. I talk and interact with many people on a regular basis - I text, call, hang out, study and party with people on occasion, but it always feels empty on my part.

When it comes to my inner emotions, however, I've always felt like an outsider. I was always an extroverted and talkative person but in recent years I've essentially done a 180. Everytime I've tried to open up to someone, I've received the same ""you'll be ok dude"" phrase - and I feel like everyone places such a negative tag on being sad or depressed. Everyone in my life acts as though these emotions are absolutely horrible and act like they've never experienced loss or sadness, and it makes me feel terrible. I've had people tell me it's not ok to be sad, and that being depressed is ""a waste of time/not even real/an excuse"".

My emotions and intrusive thoughts are growing more unstable day by day, and I've recently been having some very concerning thoughts and impulses regarding my own safety and well-being. The issue is, I am deathly afraid to reach out to anyone anymore because I feel like I'll just be made fun of or given the same generic lecture again (as selfish as that may sound, sorry). 

I genuinely feel alone. I lost a long time female friend when she moved across the world last year, and I've felt completely isolated since she left, and she was the last person I openly showed my emotions to.

I don’t regret leaving her and I miss her to a degree, but I’ll tell you what I miss the most more than anything is just those feelings associated with being in a relationship with someone. 

I used to have a bad day at work, but would get so excited to come home to my best friend and my dog. It wasn’t much, but it was the start of my little family. I worked hard to provide for that little family and we had plans on buying our first home together. Now I’ve been forced to move back in with my parents until I can get a place on my own and it sucks to come home to nothing. Not even the dog cause she took her too. 

I have had many sleepless nights looking over at the big empty space in my bed that used to be filled. Some nights we would just stay up into the late hours talking and laughing if one of us had trouble sleeping. Now I just lay here in complete silence. 

Everything from eating, watching tv and movies, going out, even taking a shower is done completely alone now. 
 
I don’t think I’ve healed enough from the damage she did to me to be ready for a new relationship, but I can’t lie and say that I don’t literally crave that level of human interaction right now. Because sure I’ve got friends and family I lean on and hangout with a lot, but that special bond you have with someone, sharing those intimate moments together is gone and I gotta be honest I’m scared I won’t find it again. If my best friend could betray me like that, then who wouldn’t? 

I guess for now I just have to keep trying to adjust to the big and empty silence that now fills my life.",lonely,I’ve never felt more alone.,2022-07-07 20:20:16

4514,Snugglehumpikiss,1657162903,1,"There is something called the dead internet theory. I did a bit of a dive on it recently and realized this is something that I have already known I just didn't know other people knew it too. There are so many ways for people to personally gain from creating programs that interact with people. Game developers will release multiplayer games and put bots in the games that pretend to be real people so that players come in and actually play the game because they think there are other people that they are playing with and if those weren't there they would just quit instantly and demand a refund. The dead internet theory proposes that a little over 5 years ago or maybe longer we reached a threshold called the inversion where we are no longer truly communicating with real people almost all the time. These are algorithms. We do this so much that we can no longer tell the difference between real people and bots furthermore when we do encounter real people the interactions are sometimes so off-putting and weird that we tend to believe those are the bots and then communicate with bots who are more predictable and whose interactions are more catered to our liking feeling as if our sense of belonging has returned. So the inversion is that our psyche is conditioned to prefer the unreal over the real thinking that the unreal is true. If it were the matrix we have taken the blue pill and stayed in wonderland. 
I know this to be the case of almost all dating apps. The majority of my right swipes are not real profiles and all of my matches just sit there and never talk back. Tinder is full of mannequin profiles. 

I am sitting here pondering this along with all the other things that people tend to ponder when they are profoundly alone. I was living with someone that I had very strong feelings for. We raised dogs together. If you've ever had a bond and by that I mean a true psychic Bond with a wolf hybrid, that is an incredibly devastating thing to lose. She left and she took our wolf boy with her. I'm now living alone a mile into the woods with nothing but my boomsticks for company. Not even a cat or a dog by my side. But I am real. I am a very real 40-year-old man with a good job, never been married and have no kids. I haven't been this alone for a very long time. Usually I at least have a cat when love and partnership falls apart. This really sucks.

I'm 48F and I live close to Sacramento, California. I don't have any friends, except for maybe the girls I work with at my job. I have 2 kids and I'm married to a man I should never have married. He's emotionally abusive at times, controlling and has horrible anger issues. I can't talk to him without him getting angry over something. I can never share my feelings without him calling me a baby or turning everything around on me! I'm miserable, depressed, lonely and it's excruciating. I drink a lot because it makes me feel better, even though I usually end up crying. I've felt like this for years. Never happy, never satisfied with life. Always wanting someone and something i can never have. I just want to fall in love and be LOVED in return. I want Someone who i can talk to, someone who wants to do things with me and put me first for once. When I was young and naive, all I wanted was to find that guy, fall in love, get married and have a couple of kids.

When I was in grade school a girl my age was my best friend. We shared everything together and wrote notes to each other. It was pure simple and the closest thing to love i will ever know. We got made fun of a lot but we didn’t care and then she moved and it was just me getting made fun of for how my friend was gone and I was alone. This was a feeling I needed get use to.

In high school I was called everything from awkward and weird to a looser. The Truth was I was in the top of my class for most physically fit and best grades. But I was shy and nervous around girls all they had done before was call me names scream at me, cut me down and sometimes hit me. 

I made it through high school and my senior year had a girlfriend. I got scared I was so attached to her and I knew she would feed me my heart because of it. I took a week away from her to gather my thoughts. She cheated on me we worked it out she cheated on me again and is now married to the dude she cheated on me with, they married on my birthday. I never dated another there was never another interested in being around me.

4551,Haunting-Ad-4389,1657149923,1,"So 4 months ago or so, I ask out my best friend (and crush)

Now, I was absolutely sure that she was going to reject me, and I was fine with that because, at least we could keep being friends.

But for my surprise, after 10 days (yes she thought about it for 10 days, which is already a bad sign) she said yes and we started dating.

That moment she said yes I thought ""this isn't going to last too much right, she will probably leave me soon"" and again, I was ok with that too.

But we kept dating for 3 months. 3 freaking months of being together. I was super happy, of course, and I even was starting to think that she truly wanted to be with me...

But then, out of nowhere, she sends me this really long message about how she needs some time because she had ""problems""

But I had been her friend for at least 4 years and I knew that was not true. So I kept telling her to be honest and that if she didn't want to be with me, she should tell me...

After 2 or 3 days of insisting, she finally admitted that she didn't even like me in first place, but said that when she said yes, she thought that she liked me??

Well the point is she was never into me for real, and those 3 months we spent kissing amd going on dates, I went to her house, she came to mine, we talked for hours...

Once I told her ""hey if you feel uncomfortable with kisses and that stuff you can just tell me, I won't get mad or anything"" 

And there she goes ""No really I am ok with that""

Which was obviously a lie.

When I asked her out I really put a LOT of emphasis on how she should not date me out of pity, because I knew that this was going to happen...

But she still did.

And I'm not mad at her for dating me out of pity, because I can understand that...

I'm mad at her because I literally told her one thousand times that she should not kiss me if she didn't want to, and she shouldn't date me if she didn't love me, and still, she endured 3 months of dating someome she didn't like in first place.

And of course I feel like a fool for thinking that we were going to end up together and happy.



And now we're on summer break, so I can avoid her, but when we get to school again, I'll have to see her again...

And EVERY SINGLE TIME I see her I either start to think about how bad I want to punch her face, or how badly I want to get back with her... or both at once...

Like, I hate her for what she did, but I really was, and am, in love... I really love her. And it is so freaking confusing to see her and start feeling like a mess...

The worst part of this is that one day, I will have to see her date any idiot that treats her like shit... I don't really know why some women are into that guys. I really tried to make her comfortable and happy, I did everything I could to make her happy, and there she goes:

""Sorry, but I don't feel comfortable dating you. I see you more as a friend"" 

Then why'd you date me for three months?

Then you stop the cycle, completely; you win.

I have no clue why am I writing, but It feels like my soul needs to let things out. I don't know, maybe someone would relate, as I am sure I'm not the only one. 

I grew up pretty much alone, It feels like I have seen the world through a window and that I have never belonged to it. Even though I tried, It feels like It's a competitive game of who's the loudest, and the prize would be having friends, people to connect with and never to feel alone, sad or empty. 

The only wish becomes too simple, wishing for someone, only one.. To whom I can give everything, loyalty, devotion, and be there whenever needed because I know, I just.. know how much *lonely* can feel like. 

I lay there, holding my phone and going through contacts, looking for anyone with whom I can share, talk. But It just hurts a bit more because I know, there is none. So the only thing left to do is battling the mind and the consciousness not to do anything silly about leaving this world. Even though, I feel like.. I just am not made for it. The aching grows greater than It was yesterday. Dreading the thought of waking up to a day where the only thing I'd feel is emptiness.

I never had any friends in my life, in school I was always alone, I never had any memorable moment of school. I have always been nice to everybody, not for sake of getting anything in return, but doing good for the sake of goodness.

Some peers I talked in school always came to me when their friends left them or they had a break-up or some other emotional problems. I always helped them, but in the end they all leave when their problem is solved by me, when I help them in solving their problems by listening to their problems, giving advice and so on. 

They never tried to start a conversation with me, it was always me who would check up on them, asking them how are you doing and so on. 

I always wished them on their birthday but they never wished me or even care to ask me when is my birthday. Even when in school they acted like I did not exist, never said hello to me, but would immediately come when they needed help.

They would always say that I'm a great person, a person who understands, a person who cares(I'm not boasting about myself). But would never even care to ask me how I'm doing.

I always wondered if they meant what they said, why treat me like a nobody or a ghost or a forgotten one or somebody who is left out.

Because of such experience I have given up on the whole concept of friendship. 

I will always try my best to help people who are going through difficult times because no matter what pains I go through, it is the kindness and sacrifice of unknown people who have made the world a better place.

4583,suelikesfrogs,1657132585,1,"Three nights ago I found myself crying. Crying out of a feeling I haven't felt in quite some time. I feel lonely, not in life, not emotionally by any means. But it's physical my loneliness. And I pause for a minute staring out my window to process my emotions and all the overwhelmingly negative thoughts I have just to catch a shooting star. I've seen many in my lifetime but none out of my room window.

I'm 19, not the most social person but definitely not an introvert, I think I'm average looking but have really bad posture. My personality is okay I'm funny and I've matured a lot in the past two years. I am however stuck with unwanted mental health problems.

Back in late 2021 I had a time where I would cry myself to sleep every night for feeling alone. I had lost some friends, lost connections had nobody to really talk to and was in a very bad place. To my surprise I met someone early 2022 and told him about this. He pitied me. And I fell in love. He left me no two months later. No explanation in fact he promised he'd be back. Oh well, I'm over that and I've gotten better. Made new friends and feel so welcome and stable emotionally. 
One thing though, all my friends have gotten into relationships. And not me. I for the life in me cannot seem to make it work at all. It makes me question why and I try my best all the time to remain positive and hopeful that it is simply the course of the universe.

4585,lapidationpublique,1657131389,1,"Is it possible to be happy and fulfilled without a social life or a SO

I (21M) don't have a friend group and don't like going out. My hobbies are solitary things, such as classical piano and video games. This means I am not going to meet a lot of people. This would be ok if I already had a friend group, but sadly, I made several mistakes that lead to permanent damage in my old friend group and I am not as accepted there as before. All of this will make it very unlikely for me to make a new friend group that will feel real since anyways, friends take a lot of time to become real. This bothers me greatly.

Also, I will never have a girlfriend since I will not have a friend group and am a man. I am extremely emotionally dependent and love women, so this really scares me. Dating apps don't work at all since I am short and not very manly.

Is there a way to be happy without these things? I love my hobbies and love myself, but the stars just didn't align in my social life. I think often about it and it ruins my mood.

Please, no platitudes like ""just go out"" or ""join groups"". As I've just explained, it is not possible. I do not like to go out. Friend groups are already made, I missed that boat.

What advice I have been able to follow has not worked, and the rest of the advice I have been unable to force myself to implement into my life. I am not complaining per se - I know that only I am to blame for my inability to force myself to do things I hate in order to manifest social relationships.  

I just want to know, how do you cope with this shit? I have a couple hobbies: watching movies &amp; TV shows and playing video games mainly. (Board games too but without friends this is difficult to continue doing.) They are good distractions when I am able to focus solely on them (whether it's an intense or exciting film, a TV show where I can manifest parasocial relationships, or a particularly difficult or intensive video game), but often I find myself distracted by the thoughts of loneliness to the point that it detracts from the enjoyment of my hobbies.  

I can't just partake in my hobbies 24/7, though. I have to go to work, for instance. It's gotten to the point where I'm bursting into tears randomly. Only a matter of time before someone notices and things get awkward. Just today I had to run to the bathroom and let some tears flow, luckily no one was in there and I was able to hold them back until I got there (I'm at work, to be clear). Focusing on tasks works sometimes, but I often have to distract myself with reddit in order to cope, which is negatively affecting my output and my co-workers are noticing and reporting me to management. Only a matter of time before I am fired, if I can't get my shit together that is.  

So, how do you guys cope with being alone? Especially for those of you who know you will be alone for the rest of your life?

The title basically sums up how I feel.
I just feel like i'm not able to maintain close or healthy relationships with anyone.
I somehow always end up hurting the people I love the most and I don't know why, as I never have bad intentions but it just somehow always happens.
I'm a quite introverted person - i'm not shy, I just don't like spending time around many people as my social battery is very low.
This makes it hard for me to form actual friendships as I get overstimulated in social situations very easily.
The pandemic hasn't exactly made this easier for me, as I've isolated myself for a long time due to covid and only started going out again recently.
I have friends that I love but as i'm not always available as I struggle with social situations and also mental illness.
All of them have someone they prefer over me, even the person I would consider my best friend.
And thats totally okay, it just hurts knowing I'm no ones first choice even though I try so hard to be a good and caring friend.

I also screw up relationships with people that care about me and I don't know why.
I just do stupid stuff that makes them feel as though I don't care and I cant explain to myself why.
Maybe its because I have horrible commitment issues, i dont have a clue.
I'm so jealous of everyone that has a best friend and a friend group that values them and is able to maintain romantic relationships without fucking things up somehow.
Idk what to say, I just kinda hate myself and feel like I'm never getting better. 
I wish I could go to therapy and work on all that, as I'm scared of ending up alone someday.
As I said, its not like i'm not trying. In fact, i'm trying my best but it just seems like all of these things are so easy for others.
I hate myself for sounding like i pity myself, because all i want is just an explanation for why I am the way I am.

Currently the age range is 17-25, so ideally people around those ages will be fine! Send me a Dm or comment down below if you’re interested :) 
Send a little msg about yourself, I don’t want any weirdos joining lol JAVA ONLY",lonely,Does anyone want to join a Java minecraft realm?,2022-07-06 19:35:36

4631,Jasey_Cones,1657098760,1,"Hello,

I am a white British citizen of mixed ethnicity. I was born in England and when I was 3 my mother and father decided to move to Cyprus (mother is Greek Cypriot, father English).

Growing up I discovered that I was always the odd one out in any social group because everyone was either fully English or fully Cypriot. I cannot count the amount of times at summer camp, school, out with friends where Cypriots would ridicule me for being half English and English kids avoiding me because I was half Cypriot.

I didn't grow up in a good home. Mum and dad always fighting, he was always getting pissed (drunk), there were brief moments of knives being thrown, dad coming home from crashing the car drunk the night before with his entire face smashed up, mum locking me out the house for hours because I was accused of stealing at after-school gym, etc.

Well to cut to it, in 2004 I left cyprus to return to the UK for college and potentially university. The whole time in college I never managed to make any friends. I thought I did because some of us were hanging out at college but there was never any plans for any other interactions outside of college. I tried to initiate stuff like this, and no one was bothered.

I tried to keep in touch with my couple of buddies from Cyprus and all of them quickly started ignoring me online to the point where years passed without contact. I ended up just deleting my Facebook. I looked at the friend list and I just thought you're someone I used to know, but now you're no one... Just a pixel on a screen that doesn't even talk to me. So why bother.

Over the years it's been the same living in England. I've had many jobs / short careers where I've thought I've made friends with some people and when those jobs end or its the weekend... No one cares. It's all just fun and games at the place of work. But everyone always goes home to their friends they made from birth/school and they are not open to mixing with anyone new.

I'm married now with 2 kids and I still feel very isolated. I have literally no friends, no one to spend time with in life other than my wife and children. And there comes a point where enough is enough. Like, I have no one to play any games with either online or coop at home... I have no one to go to the pub with, no one to go fishing with, literally no one.

I spend each day of my life now, ever since 04, with almost no one.

And get this... I'm a white and typical British looking as it comes, but one day doing a delivery job to some estate agents... The owner at the back on his desk leans over and yells at me ""where you from?""

I said ""Bournemouth"".

He then said ""No no I mean where are you originally from?""

I repeated ""Bournemouth"".

""Oh really?"", He said. You just look a bit different...

""The fucks that supposed to mean?"", I said.

I just told him to fuck himself and walked out after that.

I guess since a very young age racism has basically removed any social ability I could ever have as a human to make any friends. I always wonder now in social settings with my Scandinavian wife's family... If someone has some kind of racist thought in their head about me. I sit at dinner tables and everyone is blabbering away in their own language despite knowing fluent English and I'm sat there in silence at the edge of the table wondering what the fuck I did wrong with my life.

And I don't even know why I'm typing this here. I accept I'm loser. Life isn't full of winners. Some people are just undesirable and are losers. That's how it is. I'm one and I accept it.

But is there a way I can be a miserable loser and have some friends / company, without being shot down the moment people look at me?",lonely,I have had almost no friends since 2004,2022-07-06 19:12:40

4649,hollowedbastion,1657092375,1,"&amp;#x200B;

It's been a while since I've felt like I was genuinely happy. I have my moments of sunshine where I'm truly grateful to be alive but they do not last long at all. My mind tells me ""why are you happy? look at yourself"" and then I become self aware and it's over.

I'm 25 and I haven't accomplished anything in life besides graduating high school. That's not so much of a problem for me because it's never too late to go back to school but my issue is that i have no experiences with anything.

I never had a group of friends in highschool. I had people I put myself in with who often just hit me, made fun of me, or just left me out for their own satisfaction. I never went out to sports games with friends. I've never had a girlfriend. Not counting the year long emotionally abusive long distance relationship who never spent time with me and what not. I'm a virgin in ever way possible. Hugless, kissless you name it. It doesn't bother me so much but when you have no experience at 25 as a male I feel like I'm fucked. I don't know how to talk to women romantically at all. I can't flirt and I come off cringey or desperate.

My insecurities are really big. Though over the years I've learned the hard way what not to let people know because it's a turn off they look at you like a freak. Though sometimes I can't help it. it feels as if there's a giant aura around me that just lets everyone know how insecure I really am.

I don't trust people at all. I try and tell myself that people are being honest with me and that I shouldn't doubt my friends but people think I'm stupid and clueless. It hurts alot. I often feel really unlikeable and boring. I've had numerous girls I've been interested in tell me my personality won't match them and their words are constantly appearing in my head. Maybe I'm too quiet? Awkward? I don't know man. I try my hardest to be more outgoing but I feel like I'm never enough and maybe that's why people lie to get out of spending time with me or why no woman wants to commit to a relationship with me.

My social anxiety makes it hard for me to make friends. When I do feel like I get along with someone they never feel the same way about me. I'm left on read by almost everyone. While it's true people have lives especially at this age i don't think it's normal to go 12+ hours without a single text. If I don't double text people they forget I exist. I spend majority of my day alone. Playing games alone constantly alt tabbing into discord to see if someone replied to me only for hours to go by and nothing. I get attached really easy to people. When someone shares a little bit of interest with me I want to talk to them and share things I like. I probably come off as suffocating though and scare people off. When my favorite person doesn't reply back to me it makes me really sad because I enjoy talking to them even if much isn't being said. but they usually have other friends they rather spend time and have more fun being with. It never feels like I'm someones favorite. And I'm well aware that i'm not..sadly

I don't want to sound ungrateful though. I have 2 friends in life I spend time with or talk to sometimes but they both busy and have their own lives and their own friends. I can't have their attention majority of the time and it's not fair for me to expect them to.

I know I'm not the most attractive person. I'm unfit and overweight, I stumble over my world's alot and struggle to speak when I'm nervous, I look away alot when talking and monotone and boring to listen to. But I feel like I'm still a fun person to be around. But the way people treat me and the things they say and do say otherwise. I can forgive people but I can never forget. I feel so disposable. People I'm sad to be without can move on without me as if I never existed to them. I just want to feel important to someone and that I'm not a nuisance to them

I don't know how to start. I'm just your average useless person . I never realised I had feelings for someone and when I did it was too late . Now she's gone . My heart aches every time I hear her name , I breakdown every time I see her in a pic , curse myself at night for being too hesitant . But maybe I was expecting too much. I'm just an ugly looking dude. The type of love I expect is too unreal , it only happens in movies. I often see her in dreams . In those dreams I'm a better person . But these dreams are too perfect to be real . I wake up and realise how hollow my life is. And this cycle goes on .

I often get teary eyed when I realise the one I think about the most doesn't even give a shit about me . And while thinking all this I fall asleep . Depression was really a joke for me but its a daily thing now . Have 0 friends irl and social life is non existent . The sheer loneliness i feel kills me inside . Only if tears were colourful my pillow would be an art piece.

At this point i need someone to "" Take my hand and my life too "" . The love I expect to receive is too unreal as i said before . I know it won't just happen. I should prolly get used to this",lonely,I've lost faith .,2022-07-06 16:30:06

4693,pusillanimous303,1657075172,1,"I see comments regularly on here about how women can’t really be lonely because it’s “so easy” for a woman to find someone. This is blatantly false. I’m not saying being a man provides the same experience as being a woman. I’m saying that women don’t have it as easy as some guys think. 

Since these statements are usually about romance, let’s look at that. Women, much more than men, have to deal with potential partners showing an interest just so they can get laid. They’re no longer human beings. They’re objects. And sometimes when the woman does sleep with a guy, that same guy could, the very next day, act like he doesn’t know who she is. Like their intimacy never happened. Being an especially attractive woman doesn’t fix this problem. Attractive women can be treated like a trophy. Something appreciated only if she can make the man look good. If she isn’t pretty enough or thin enough or outgoing enough, it makes the guy look bad—or so he thinks. Again, that isn’t being treated like a human. It’s being a trophy. Nothing more than an expensive watch. 

If the relationship progresses, she has to be on the look out for signs that the guy is a shitbag. A man-child. I see examples of it all over social media. The guy barely contributes to the household. He works part time and he spends all his free time playing video games. That leaves all the housework and child rearing to the woman who is already keeping the household expenses afloat. He was probably charming early in the relationship, and he has taken advantage of her commitment to treat her like a servant. 

Just because women might have guys pursuing them, that doesn’t mean they can’t be lonely. They can be trapped in a loveless and unappreciative relationship. Or they haven’t settled for just anyone, and they are alone and lonely because they can’t find someone who treats them well.

4694,Reddit_Or_Naw,1657075008,1,"Today was just terrible day. About a week ago I made a post in r4r and had one person reach out. And a surprise to me we hit it off right away. We used Reddit chat the whole time. It started off with the basics of who she was. Then it got into really learning about our opinions on different topics, favorite movies, music, plans for the future. We were sending each other long text messages and really got in depth with our conversation over the days. We’d talk all the way into the night. I opened up about personal things and she was nothing but supportive. This is the first time I really connected with someone and felt like they wanted the same things as me. 

And then out of nowhere she tells me her ex called and she still has feelings for him, and I deserved to know. I just felt so used. My heart has literally been hurting me for 5 hours now. The conversation the entire time was nothing but engaging and now this. Even after being told she’s never known what true love is or her past relationships never made it past 3 months. She had the audacity to tell me “just a heads up I’m deleting me account”. I never asked! 

I don’t mean to sound like I’m complaining the entire time. But I’ve been lonely my whole life. Never had a girlfriend. Only been on 4 dates total that went nowhere. My day consists of going to work, gym, go home, eat, go to bed. I don’t have anyone texting my phone either. The one time someone shows genuine interest in me It made me happy, for once I am happy. Only for them to not be honest that they still had feelings for someone else. A weeks worth of getting to know someone ends in one text. I feel like I’m cursed to be unhappy.

Are there any other groups similar to 12 Step which are secular and not treatment-based, i.e. just groups for normal people to come together and open up to each other for support and visibility? I've tried Awakin, Quaker Meeting, meditation, and other stuff, but I haven't found anything that has created the deep friendships I crave.

P.S. Please no comments about 12 Step, whatever your opinion of it. It was a great experience and helped me a lot and I've moved on.",lonely,Venues for making deep friendships,2022-07-06 11:39:26

I recently turned 19 and since the summer of 2019 I've been alone.

It started off as a result of a manic episode that caused me to act violently and erratically, which created conflicts with my existing friend group.

At the same time as a late teenager most of my friends were starting to direct their interests less towards our typical hangouts and more towards partying and drugs. I've had a lot of issues that prevented me from enjoying big social gatherings all my life so I refused any and all invitations.

These events marked my descent into a depression that made me develop self isolating behaviors and changed my mood, since then I find it hard to joke around or enjoy simple banter.

In the following years I found out all my existing connections were pretty much gone, people had moved on without me, I still had people who I could see, but it was just that, come hangout and never talk until we hangout again in like a month.

Since then things haven't changed much, I know a lot of people superficially, but nobody to talk to.

They said such depraved and sick things to me on voice calls that they almost manipulated me into believing their rapist, pedo, misogynistic beliefs, now I live in constant fear, anxiety, paranoia and distrust of everyone around me, I hardly pass school, I've developed an ED and body dysmorphia, I cut myself, my hands are always shaking, I'm very clumsy, I get nightmares everynight cz one of them got me into watching gore, accidents and suicides on illegal websites and I keep seeing that stuff in my head. And I can't tell anyone at all, I can't get therapy cz I never want my parents to find out, because I feel so much shame about it, I believe its all my fault for enjoying the attention at some points. 

I miss my innocence and pureness before all this. now I don't even like platonic hugs. I can only see men as sexual and evil beings, and women as objects, I'm sorry I don't mean it and don't act on it at all, its just intrusive thoughts when I get flashbacks.

4765,dj000nt,1657048076,1,"I haven't had anyone other than three of my friends and my parents (outside of business stuff) text me since probably around 2016.  I fell into a deep depression and couldn't get out - a friend I was getting very close with was killed in a car accident, my dad who raped me as a kid was diagnosed with cancer, and the only girl I ever got anything close to intimate with threw me away for someone else and told me to kill myself.  Throughout college I mostly just went through the motions, got my degree, and fucked off --- never went to parties, and really only made a couple of friends that I don't talk to anymore.  I did ask a couple LAYDEEEEEEES out though, but both were already seeing people.  Darn.

I'll be honest - I'm still not happy with my life.  I think I'm an above average looking dude nowadays, but I am aware of my flaws (appearance and personality wise) and have come to realize that maybe that's a good thing.  I just need to stop kicking the absolute shit out of myself over them and realize that there are some things I can't change.  Now, when it comes to relationships and wanting to find love; I'll just say it's very tough and confusing for me.

I'm 23 going on 24, so I'm at the age where I should be sexually experienced or at least have been in a couple of relationships.  All I got are three friends that I talk to less lately than ever, one kiss with the girl who told me to woohoo myself, and sexual experience with my dad, which I think we can all agree, is kind of fucked.  I don't even know if I'm a virgin.  Either I am and that'd be a red flag for a lot of girls, or I'm not and my first will always be my own father.  Throughout High School and even a bit of college, I attracted a decent amount of pretty attractive girls, and I was significantly less attractive than I am now (shitty teeth, fat, etc.).  I just didn't give a shit and apparently that worked - but still, I didn't have the confidence to ever close the deal, so to speak.  So I know I am capable of attracting people and that if I don't want to die alone, I could probably make something happen... but here's the thing: I have nowhere to meet people, and I don't really care enough to make the effort to do so anymore.

I'm done with college.  I work a nice job from home that I don't plan on leaving any time soon.  I don't get paid a ton, but the work-life balance is incredible.  I live in New Jersey where there is fuck all to do, especially since I have no one to hang out with.  I like playing/listening to music, hockey, video games, longboarding, and hiking, but how am I going to meet people doing any of those things outside of hiking?  Even then, it's NJ and there is absolutely nowhere to hike worth a damn in the vicinity.  Unless I'm going to concerts all the time, I don't see how I meet people through music.  I love travelling and really kind of found that just about everywhere else I've been has more to do than here and that it's more likely I'll meet someone in another state, but the move my family has been eyeing for a while, doesn't seem to be going anywhere, so I'm kind of stuck.  I don't have any place to meet people.  I'm not nearly confident enough to go up to random girls and ask them out, and I honestly don't even think I'd want to.  I'd rather get to know them first, which might be lame for a lot of peoples' standards, but I'm more interested in an actual relationship than just banging.  I'm also at the point where more often than not, I just don't care to put in the effort to find people and try and form relationships.  It just feels like so much work, and to be quite honest, when looking at everyone's Instagram posts of their dates, I kind of pity them.  Maybe it's jealousy, but I really don't have any desire to go into NYC for the day.  I hate cities.  I also don't have any desire to be eating out constantly at fancy restaurants and shit, which seems to be like 99% of what people do.  I dunno.  I do fear that my lack of desire in this regard will lead to me spending my life alone.  I want to someday have a wife, likely kids, and a whole lot of land in some beautiful place, but nowadays, it just doesn't feel worth it.",lonely,I have been incredibly lonely since 2016 and I'm having some confusing thoughts.,2022-07-06 05:07:56

I know it’s a very misunderstood illness so to simplify, I developed a fear of eating around people by my 4th year with the illness and because of that, plus the psychotic episodes I had from prolonged starvation, I was pretty much abandoned. Nobody wants to be friends with the person who can’t have fun or feel excited about anything because their mind is succumbed to calculate calories every second . Nobody wants to be friends with the person who’s going to have a crying fit at a party. People don’t understand the toll mental illness takes on a person.  It made me a cold, ruthless, shell of a person but now after 10 years of nearly starving myself to death, I’m finally stable and better in recovery for a year.

The only thing I ask myself is “what’s left?”. Because I lost all my friends and spent so much time in isolation, it’s difficult to socialize the same way I used to. I still feel very alien and foreign to people in general. All I’d like is a friend. One single friend to hang out with or talk to. Spending everyday with just a call or text from my mom or husband just convinces me even more that I’m a low life and the cycle of regret that feeds loneliness that feeds more into depression is so hard to break without any change .

People say “join a meet up”, “go out at night to bars or a party”, “go to shows” without acknowledging just how disconnected 7 years of isolation made me become .

I work in the education industry so I spent ten years out of college foolishly trying to get a job here instead of another state or country. Ironically now more than ever I’m considering trying to live abroad but I feel trapped by this long awaited position.

I’m considering living abroad for the summer and ditching a summer position last minute at a different district that didn’t hire me for 7 years. I feel guilty, but they never helped me, and I’m so desperate and I feel like I need a system shock and living away could give it to me. Who knows maybe I’ll even meet a nice woman (which would then present other problems and decisions to make) but I just can’t imagine surviving another lonely summer like this with all of my bad habits and thoughts corroding me further.

4802,Individual_Ask_2931,1657032915,1,"Speaking ones mind and loving oneself is not a cure-all. 

Don’t have friends? Love yourself !

Have a conflict , speak up! 

This isn’t a world that caters to its residents. Outcomes arent guaranteed and these comments can be invalidating to people’s current feelings. 

Even therapist will give quick diagnosis and expect people who struggle with lifelong trauma to take a pill , talk to someone and be fine. This can work for certain individuals, but it’s not a cure-all. 

Yesterday, a Redditor woman posted about being asked to confront her parents by her therapist and the discomfort surrounding the request. Theirs an abundant of post on here  regarding disagreements with therapist , but this one stood out.

When a patient goes to a doctor, their paying for medical advice and diagnostics so In that sense the patient should follow it, but what if the doctor forgets the patient is allergic to penicillin? Should the patient take the medicine or remind the doctor of the  allergy? 

However, with therapy the lines get a bit blurry. In the medical field an injury like a broken wrist can usually be treated the same way, but with therapy .. placing a cast on a broken family wouldn’t have the same outcome.

In the situation with the redditor. They had let’s say an allergy to confronting their parents that wasn’t being respected. They didn’t provide the reasons why they didn’t want to confront the parents in the post and they didn’t specify if they revealed these reasons to the therapist. It is often common in treatment to weigh the pros and the cons of the treatment so the details of this were unclear. However in some cases, it is clear. 

Sometimes confronting ones parents can be dangerous in more ways than psychological and anyone should respect that. It’s easy to forget other people’s limits because it’s not something anyone is ingrained to be consistently mindful of, but it’s important to hold space for others,  accept the lack of space held, or acknowledge wherever one falls on that spectrum. 

Saying a person needs to love themselves first can be useful in certain situations like abusive relationships , but not always for loneliness. It’s okay to want to be cared for and it’s okay if all one’s problems aren’t solved by a conversation. It’s just not okay to invalidate someone’s feelings with cliche and misplaced judgements under the guise of advice.",lonely,"Unpopular opinion, but it shouldn’t be",2022-07-06 00:55:15

4809,res77777,1657029441,1,"The one that ended in a dumpster fire weren't irl friends, it was on Discord. It was quite nice, I was closer to them than I ever have been to any real life friends. Most of them were actually really really nice. But with it being a public server there were shits who actively tried to ruin it and be awful. Some drama ensued and everyone just decided it was best to leave. No use in repairing. 

I don't use social media often, I know people complain of toxicity but I never used it for myself. I never realized how genuinely evil some people are. Man. I've had two friend groups my whole life (and only in the past four years) so that interaction seriously just made me feel quite paranoid about making friends again.

The other guys are real life. Knew them since 9th grade (am graduated). But they don't really like me as much as everyone else. It's sort of like I'm just there cause it would be kinda weird to not invite me but in reality if they would not invite me most probably wouldn't. A few *do* like me.

But there's some who regardless of whether they like me or not, I for the life of me cannot fucking stand them. There's a few of them who are just way too edgy and immature really thin line where you can't tell if they're seriously sexist and racist or just joking. But I decided you know what? That's their sense of humor... I guess. I'll ignore them and me and the ones I like can do our sense of humor. Except those assholes will actively complain about us saying we're too annoying and ruining the group chat.

Those who aren't straight up racist and little shits find the humor funny, which again is their choice but it makes me a minority so speaking up would make everyone be like ""lol it's just a joke"" so I don't even bother. I know this is just high school shitheads being edgy and immature but it sucks cause I really can't just go and leave them. They're the only people I get to talk to. I struggle to make friends ever. Especially since I'm autistic. I went all of middle school without friends and made this friend group by pure luck. Who knows how long I'll go without making friends again?

Especially cause now I'm an adult. No more structured classes. No more structured playtime. No more youth sports. No more YMCA clubs. My therapist recommended autism social classes, but would those even work? I understand how social interactions work, I just fail at the execution. A bet most of those classes are geared towards ""low functioning"" people. There's rarely ever resources for ""high functioning.""

I'm significantly less active in the group chat because of those people now. I understand that if I'm in an uncomfortable situation to remove myself. But I can't completely leave cause then I'll just have literally nobody to talk to. I've tried to join other public Discord servers but it's just so hard for me to make friends. That one dumpster fire, everyone there just clicked. That's probably never going to happen again.

Anyways yeah guess I'll go cry now. Haven't left my room in months. I pretty much only leave to visit family. We're going on a trip soon, which is cool. But all my family is aged 40+, there are basically no kids my age. I do like to take care and babysit the little infants. I think has something to do with me kind of never having a childhood.

I’ve convinced myself over many years that I am a commodity, something to be used, something that once has been used, is thrown out.

Every moment that I am interacting with someone, is a moment in my head where I have to prove to them that I am not the sad, grey, awkward, fearing man that I am. I am petrified of what they see when they look at me, so I hide.

When people look at me a list appears in my head, a list of what they are looking at, because it’s the list I’ve made of myself. Awkward, dull, annoying, flawed, uninteresting, unattractive, undeserving.

So I try to give them reasons to stick around, try to act funny or confident, act like I’m having fun. When in reality I’m just terrified of pushing them away, or giving them a reason to leave.

Usually they end up leaving anyway, whether I pushed them away, or they realize that I am just a sad husk. Probably a mix of both I assume.

I got pretty lucky with my job, I have one I don’t hate, I earn enough money to get by and save too.

As foolish as I am I try giving them money, buying them things, whatever, just to keep giving them reasons to stay around.

Although I know it doesn’t work like that, I do it, because at this point that need to prove to them is more than I can handle.

They are good people too, they do genuinely want what’s best for me, but I have trust issues, and I alway have a fear of them walking away, or me just being too much and giving them a reason to leave.

4814,abomination_boy,1657025007,1,"I've been in three relationships before. But due to being basically crippled and also having ADHD that was probably only because I was sent to both a special needs high school and a special needs college. People like that aren't such snobs when it comes to being on disability. Right now I am, I get about 1800 a month and I work part-time in addition to that but no one's going to date somebody like that. I'm not in my special college anymore, I'm out in the real world and people are going to judge me for it. Because of this I've literally made the decision to not have friends at all because once people find out that I'm on that stuff everybody fucking hates me and they see me as an entitled lazy douchebag even though if I wasn't into debilitating pain every waking minute I would be working three jobs like the rest of them because I hate being at home! Him and I are friends but he probably thinks I'm just a normal person because he hasn't seen me on a bad pain day. I bet if he that I was mainly on disability he looked down on me.

I didn't used to let this shit get in my way until my relationship of 3 years ended and I started putting myself back out there and I realized that everybody is going to look down on me, even resent the fuck out of me. I mean I can easily get hookups and do so on a regular basis because that's the closest I'm ever going to get to human interaction with a person who doesn't resent me but anything long-term feels like it's out of the question. It really seems to me like things such as physical attraction, compatibility, common life goals or common interests really don't matter at all when picking up partner. What it matters is shitloads of money that you earned yourself and didn't get from the government and physical fitness. And by fitness I mean there's nothing wrong with your body - things as small as astigmatism can be huge barriers in the dating world and even when making friends because we're not looking for the most beautiful or handsome partner, subconsciously we are all looking for the healthiest partner. And I might be considered fairly physically attractive, but I could be the most attractive person alive and still no one would want me because I'm in severe pain all the time and I can't walk much. 

Now that I know what the real world is like and that everyone's going to look down on me for being on disability I really don't think there's any hope for me and I haven't bothered approaching him. He seems flirtatious and seems to like me as a person but what are the chances? I'm on *SSDI*, the thing that makes everybody hate and resent you by default. I've been turned down by someone for that before. I'm not viewed as a real adult because of this, everybody thinks I'm so entitled asshole who doesn't really need the shit and I feel like once he knows where my money comes from he's going to look down on me he might even hate me.

This is why I've never really dated a normal person. I stick with people I considered to be in my league. Sadly the only people who are low enough to consider being with me an option tend to ignore me all the time or the incredibly controlling and overbearing because they have severe psychological issues but I have ADHD and scoliosis I can't really be choosy! I can't expect someone doesn't have sociopathic tendencies and severe behavioral issues to like someone like me.",lonely,30M I can't approach the person I like because I'm disabled,2022-07-05 22:43:27

4829,porcelainskull,1657015635,1,"I’ve realized that for the past 3 or so years, I rarely open up to anyone about how I feel and such. Of course, this is only in real life, since I still come to Reddit to vent about everything (which is kind of sad), but instead of telling all my “friends” about my problems like I used to, I just keep them to myself. I forgot why I became this way until yesterday. 

It was my second day of work and I was becoming depressed because I realized that literally EVERYONE ELSE had formed relationships with eachother and were interacting, while I was left out and almost always ignored. And yes I did try to start conversations with them and build a relationship, but they were always so dry to me. And it isn’t because they’ve been there longer, because the two other people I’m talking about started the same day as me. It made me realize that my goal of becoming more social by being in a social setting would probably fail, and Im mostly likely the problem since I’m so fucking awkward and stupid. 

So I went to the bathroom to cry of course, and I couldn’t stop. I felt like complete shit, and I remembered how one time, one of my close friends told me, after she vented to me, that she wonders why I never tell her anything anymore, and implied that she’d always be there for me to open up. So I did. I sent a whole paragraph and explained to her how I felt. I fucking regret it. She obviously didn’t even care. She just asked where I was working, then the conversation ended. After this I realized why I stopped opening up to people about how I feel. Because they obviously do not give a single shit. I started to remember the many times I’d be in my room crying alone because I’d literally be pouring my heart out to people and they didn’t care at all. And I know my feelings are no one else’s responsibility, I know that more than anything in the world, but to see people care so much about other people, then claim they’d like to care about me too, just to flat out ignore me once I actually open up…I think it’s a feeling worse than loneliness.

So whatever, I’ve made my mistake, I’ve now realized what I’ve forgotten. Sorry for the long rant, if you’re reading this till the end I hope you got at least something out of it",lonely,“Why don’t you open up about your problems?”,2022-07-05 20:07:15

4850,Facemam,1657003500,1,"To sum up a long story, my mom is crazy. It’s a long like 3 years spanned story of sadness about how she got swept up by alcohol that collided with her mental health and fucked her up. But she’s always had those problems really. What that meant for seven year old me was therapy like two times a week. I barley had any friends in elementary school and when I did, my fun would be interrupted with therapy. The therapist diagnosed me with Asperger’s syndrome. Keep in mind I was only seven. Fast forward a couple years and I was going into middle school. I was so excited. So many new opportunities to make friends now that therapy wasn’t on my schedule. So I started talking to more people. And then COVID shut everything down. So I was very depressed going into my seventh grade year I was super sad. My best friend moved from right next door to another state. So he wasn’t there. I did online for most of that year. Super sad time for me. I’d say that was my worst year, but it’s only gonna get worse for me. Anyways, I went into school for the last three months of seventh grade. I made so many friends it was so cool. And it was even cooler that we were going into summer so I could hang out with them more. And that’s what I did. I was calling them, texting them, and most importantly, going out into the world with them. Best summer of my life. So, going into eighth grade I was expecting big things. But my school had other ideas. Me and my one friend were separated from all my other friends. So me and him would become super good friends. A couple months in, toward somewhere around April something happened. It was a normal Sunday. I was gonna get picked up by my mom and we were gonna go home for school the next day. That didn’t happen. She was supper drunk. Like way over the top. And she snapped. She attacked members of my family and we had to leave. So I called my dad and he got us. She was still in the other car outside the police station. To sum it all up again I ended up living with my grandparents for the rest of the school year. Some other things happened from my “break” from my mom. I’m never going back to her. So I finished my eighth grade year and I’m going into summer living with my dad. I have no friends here. My dad lives In the city and my mom used to live down the shore and that’s where I went to school and all my friends are there. To add on to that, my dad works five days a week and for undisclosed reasons he has to work weekends. So I’m usually alone for most of the day without much to do. And then, my dad gets a girlfriend. She’s nice I guess. Idk I’m just not used to him with a girlfriend I guess. The last time he had one was like six years ago. But anyways, today, (July fourth) my dad got super drunk. And we set off the saddest and most lonely fireworks I’ve ever seen. Now he’s asleep and I’m in my room listening to thank you by Dido slowed and on repeat. I don’t know. Am I just made to be alone?

At what point did you realize that you were the one making an effort in your friendships and when you stopped, all you got was silence for days. Then those days turned to weeks, then to months, and now to years. I miss having someone (especially a woman) to talk to about stuff. I’ve always had girl best friends but as soon as they got a boyfriend, I got shafted. I mean, I genuinely happy for them but they’ll never understand how how alone I have gotten. Every time, I feel like a piece of me is slowly dying. I’ve already gotten to the point of leaving my phone on “do not disturb”. Why bother, I’m not gonna get a text from anyone.

4871,slattlover2,1656995427,1,"I’ve been in the worst depressive state of my life the past 4 months and started therapy and antidepressants to help work through it. 

5 weeks ago my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. Being that I moved to this area just 3.5 years ago all my friends were brought into my life through her and now she’s taken them all with her since we’ve broken up. 

I really rely on my summers to recharge me for school but now I’m dreading every day, and then falling more heartbroken when I look ahead and see school in my future as well.

I cry everyday and have only seen my friends once this whole summer (when I invited them to go to a special event that I’m very fortunate to have access to) and I’m constantly alone and depressed.

On top of this I attend a university I hate and also have no friends at due to staying mostly isolated through Covid and being in a long distance relationship deterred a lot of my urges to party. 

This weekend my family all went away and I was stuck at home watching my dog all alone on what’s supposed to be my favorite “holiday” of the year. I love fireworks and being outdoors with “the people I love to be around” but now they dont exist in my life. 

With no invite to fireworks or my “friends” 4th of July party I sat at home cleaning my golf clubs and paying for an overpriced takeout burger since I didn’t want to buy and prep to just grill for myself. 

What really set me over the edge this weekend was the one person Who’s promised to be with me through it all and has arguably “saved” my life texted me today to “calm down with the messaging” as I just reached out to hope she was doing well and to please send me pics of the fireworks she sees tonight (since I love them). It hurt more than anything I’ve heard in any memory I have to hear that I even now annoyed the one person I felt was still left in my life. 

I truly don’t even like “going out” but man I wish I could have some fun for once this summer.

I know my problems aren’t worse than anyone else’s in here but I truly am proud of all of u and I hope we can all get through this to a better time in our lives.",lonely,Not sure if school or summer is worse,2022-07-05 14:30:27

33(F) As women we hear this all the time. ""If he wanted to he would"". But not until my 30's did I give it a 2nd thought. If you've ever experienced being with a man that treats you the way you want to be treated then you are one of lucky ones. I've had that one time. Just once. Then I was introduced to reality. Reality is ghosting, standing you up for a date, pretending to want more just to get sexual gratification before bailing, etc. Sometimes it feels like finding a genuine person is impossible. But it is possible. I haven't had the happiness that comes from being with your person. But I have to believe that if he wanted to he would. I'm the 1st choice, the only choice. I'm not going to stand in the place that the one they wanted once stood. And if you're struggling with your own self worth and confidence just remember that there is someone out there that is dying to find you. Someone that would do what it takes. Because if he wanted to he would.",lonely,If he wanted to he would.,2022-07-05 14:23:06

4875,shelostcontrol777,1656993658,1,"Hey everyone,

So to start, I just want people to be kind and understanding of my situation here. I've been through a lot in my life, and especially a lot more in the last several months. That being said, I have made major improvements also so this post is gonna be not only a vent but a reflection piece as well. I just made a reddit after deleting and removing myself from ALL social media (facebook, instagram, etc...) as I found social media was extremely unhealthy and determental to my wellbeing. The only things I use online now is well, Youtube, hulu, online shopping sites and now reddit along with having a cell phone. I have found this all to be healing to not have the constant pressure to check how toxic people from my past are doing and then ultimately burning myself as a result as those people do not care for me anymore. 

So boring intro aside, here's my situation. My boyfriend of 2 years died 9 months ago from a overdose. It shook my whole world as he was my only friend besides being my significant other. And then to top the cake my ex best friend of 7 years turned out to have had an emotional affair the whole time with him behind my back and when he died she was the FIRST to find out from his family and nobody let me know for days while I worried and waited, ultimately having to call the police station in his town to find out. When I found out I was destroyed and let his family know I loved him and I shared in their grief. But when my ex best friend took the spotlight and started acting like SHE was the girlfriend I couldn't take it anymore and removed myself from social media. It was bad enough I lost him in that manner, the very fact that I had to deal with her being on the side was a double punch in the gut. So anyways, here is the cruel irony in the whole thing, my ex best friend who had the affair with my bf was friends with me for 7 years and was my only friend until she introduced me to my bf. I was isolated those entire 7 years with her being my only friend, then when she set me up with him she dropped me and hated me for falling in love. It only got worse as my bf couldn't let her go and it just turned into a really fucked love triangle. 

Anyhow, none of this really matters at this point but there's a little backstory. So that leads to where I am now that my boyfriend is gone and my best friend wants nothing to do with me and I didn't have any other friends or genuine relationships prior to all this, I am completely socially ISOLATED. I don't work at the moment as I am disabled with a heart condition, my family that I live with is planning on moving to the woods and nowhere urban at all, I don't have my GED or any education so college isn't an option, and I am stuck. I feel am trying not to feel hopeless but it's hard not to. Not to mention the grief, heartbreak and knives in my back that I am dealing with as well. I am 22 years old now and I feel like I am literally wasting away my youth and reminising on the days where I felt loved and happy and when my boyfriend was here and when my best friend wasn't such a horrible person. I apologize too if all this sounds incredibly dramatic and fucked up, I just needed to vent. It's been an awful year and I just want to feel happy again. I know too there must be others out there like me who I could connect with but I imagine people like that are so far away and I have zero clue how I will find these people. I just want to know that I'm not crazy for feeling the way I feel after being through all this???

I'm broken. I'm lonely as hell. I do a good job hiding it 99% of the time. I'm sociable, I go out, I have friends I spend time with. I'm funny, know how to introduce myself to new people. I'm not the typical ""lonely"" guy. I have friends of both sexes and love meeting new people.

Yet I'm still, mind numbingly lonely, because I feel like I'm always having to wear a mask, never letting myself be fully seen. Always acting the right way, but never feeling truely known. feel like no woman could ever really want to know, the real me at least. They might enjoying hanging out with me as a friend, but I can't imagine someone wanting more with me. Part of that is my own self esteem talking, but nontheless I still feel that way.

I find that as I get older (I'm in my late 20's) that its really hard for me to accept myself. I have a pretty strong sex drive, and that causes me so many problems as a christian waiting for marriage. I'm constantly screwing up, and I wish I didn't have to pretend I have it all together all the time with people.

Of course you could make new friends... Oh wait, anxiety is a thing! Not only that, once you're lonely for a very long time, you become a gloomy and sad person, maybe even gain depression, then it becomes extremely difficult to keep up the positive act, or not, depending on how bad you got it. So yeah, not exactly the best chances of making new friends when you kill the good vibes with your gloom. Hmm? What about a partner? Significant other? You'd be wrong of thinking I would have one, once again, anxiety is a thing, I wouldn't dare to ask one out, besides, who would date a guy who just plays video games and rarely draws? Not many I assume. Oh, did I mention that anxiety, depression, and loneliness is an ""amazing"" combination? Because I can assure you that it can be life changing. So do I think anything will change by typing all of this? Probably not, but it does make you feel just a small bit better, it's good to let out your feelings out and pour your thoughts on a post, but sadly it's not the first time and probably won't be the last. I think the worst part of loneliness is that you become such a husk of a human being that compliments of any kind would not affect you, it's a sad thing, isn't it? In other words, life's a bitch.

Don't know why I continue to hurt myself emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

Just want to scream, I don't think I'll ever be alright until I just stop caring, but if I stop caring I really won't have anyone, because I feel the ones who are my friends - only are because of how generous I can be or in complimenting/bringing them up in bad times/just my overall down to earth presence. 

&amp;#x200B;

To say the least, I feel used but not in the way most would use that line for. More like I feel drained, just repeating my past when meeting people. I say it all with a smile or good humor but its just sigh.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was a kid I've had a small knit group of friends. Up until the age of 17 it seemed as though we were going to be the best friend group through life, but then life actually happened and I haven't spoken to either of them since 19 - I am 26 now, and time changes people of course so not even going to try and reach out to get them all together. But now I find myself with no friends, a single parent who needs me - and I them to an extent - for I really would have no one, a heavy heart, my dream car, a job that I can say I am good at and get paid handsomely to do, but there's this         gap       emptiness in me that is just missing everything I had growing up, the simple things...The go-to friends, the girlfriend that told me they loved me, the dog that died from a vet's malpractice...won't even get into that...

&amp;#x200B;

The said girlfriend who we were in a happiest relationship for 4.5 years, and its nearly 2 years later just mentioning her triggers me into a dark hole.  She had cheated on me for the first 8 months together, and then ghosted me at the end of the 4.5 year relationship. And this was a relationship where our first conversation was about the importance of closure..

There's no main point to all this, focus where you want in my write up...But what I am trying to say is, for those who have something like I had, try your very best to maintain it, while maintaining yourself first. Only thing that keeps me going at this point is that I am a bit of a dreamer and am just throwing on a smile keeping a good attitude....but I do admit its a struggle, and I've never gone to therapy or taken anything for it other than sleeping it off, dragging my feet feeling empty, and laughing it off...Will say this though, I honestly don't want to go over double my current age in this life, unless I find a convincing out; of broken promises, ghosting, people who can just get along and not be on the fence of lashing out if things don't fit into their puzzle...not speaking on anything specific with that, just an after thought.",lonely,back...where to start or end idk.,2022-07-05 10:18:50

Someone told me I was, making others responsible by blaming them - or not taking full responsibility for myself.

I've never blamed anyone but myself for my mistakes, and the way they have affected me. That's all me. People are just a relevant detail to the story.

Someone said I had personally decided to stick to my vices (stuck because it's easy).

I have a serious set of addictions, and have acknowledged them very much as a problem, that I am regularly fighting for my life to break away from. These vices and addictions and dependencies aren't my identity, and I never let them change the way I treat people. I never let it get in the way of my obligations, and never put it before my health.

4949,soulstasy,1656966884,1,"I have always alien as long as I remember. But, despite that and being introverted, my academic reputation at school opened doors for me, though they were shallow and only lasted till school, Even back then, I wasn't a first choice, just a backup among friends and for academic 'uses'. Now, I'm in college, gonna complete 2 years, and I have made 0 friends, can't get out of the classmate zone. Its a curse to be a deeply intellectual and deeply emotional being. Like you'll be talking in a different language; Its like you're a wizard trying to explain magic to muggles(aka mudbloods), they'll either call you an idiot or weirdo or be disinterested. I don't know, at this point, I'm tired of explaining. The problem is that lack of social life is taking a toll on my academics / career prospects, and more importantly, it has fucked up my brain chemicals. I couldn't get antidepressants without prescription. I can't get or afford therapy, as I'm cursed to be born in India, and have narrow minded parents with whom I don't have a good understanding either. They just gave birth to me just of the classic going-with-the-herd mentality and spoiled my childhood by destroying my self worth and spending all my energy over grades grades grades. Today, do the grades matter? not much; but are the scars still there? oh yes, they're burning without fading. I managed to build some self-worth myself, and hell, amidst this battlefield, I still manage to be assertive than many. Strong buy fragile, as you can't overcome some physical aspects like brain chemicals. I have no money on my own either to try online therapy. As I said, I don't know I'm just tired of ranting and venting, I even ruined a couple of online friendships because of my ranting/venting. I mean after all, it's good for them to cut away my negativity, can't blame them. This has brought in other issues, like depression or god-knows-what personality disorders. I guess, as we grow up, we can understand psychopaths better than sane people. I do have a good personality and all, Good taste in movies, seeking depth in everything, both intellectually and emotionally. I guess I'm just not from here. I always thought, right from my childhood, that if I die, I might go home. I've been through suicidal phases, and ever since that, the rift between me and normal people have widened, as I am familiar with a darkness they aren't. It has become a part of me, I've learnt to live with it. I self-harm at times, to cope, it temporarily helps. I never talk about it, the self-harm scars are an issue whenever I wear half sleeves. So, yeah, I don't know what else is there to type.
Credits to Shawshank Redemption and many other films for feeding some life into me, and kept me going.
So, yeah, I'm an alien, I wanna get home, far away from these mudbloods. Until then, guess I'll have to live with my unhealthy self-destructive coping ways.",lonely,Wish there were pills to compensate for lack of connection,2022-07-05 06:34:44
4950,assburgersgrl,1656966275,1,"Once my family have gone to bed, those whom I speak with virtually are preoccupied with their own lives or for whatever reason stop replying - it hits me hard that I am ''lonely'' when in fact in that moment I'm alone i.e. in my own company. As for me, personally, I have recently discovered I am autistic after years of trying to be neurotypical it is such a relief to be able to take off my mask and take a deep breath rather than wondering why I don't often respond to situations like others do but often many times for me I take it personally, as a rejection when for actual matter there is a time where we all go to sleep and someone can't always be there to talk to us which may seem blatantly obvious. What I'm getting at here is that for so long, even now, I have been terrified to sit with my own thoughts away from the outside world and I will always have some source of interaction, whether it be someone I personally know or a kind stranger who is willing to listen and the truth is, there always will be a kind stranger who is willing to give you their time and energy although sometimes that is not what you need. Sometimes you need to take time out to spend time with yourself. Whether that's going for a brief walk around the neighbourhood where you live or taking yourself out for your favourite beverage. For too long I have been running away from myself and scared of what I might find. A lot of the answers you seek are already inside you if you look close enough.

Then that feeling slowly fades as you already start to feel tired and remember you don't have much of a life so you grab your phone and dive right into the overstimulating dopamine rabbit hole of social media to drown out your recurring negative thoughts. Lie there for a couple hours and refuse to get up until your on the brink of pissing your pants so then your forced to get out of bed. Might aswell feed yourself since your up so you head into the kitchen to grab a bite then remember your broke as fuck and have been for the past couple years because you cant find a job. Atleast there's some bread left so you toss a couple slices in the toaster and remember you forgot to buy butter. I guess plain toast is better than nothing. Shuffle on back to your room with your delicious and nutritious toast to just sit there and wonder how the fuck your gonna scrounge up enough money to buy those beers for tonight you so rightfully deserve after a hard day scrolling your phone and making that gourmet breakfast of plain toast. Then those negative thoughts start creeping their way back so you quickly boot up YouTube or some video games to distract yourself again. Before you know it it's 7pm and there's that slight moment of happiness as you realise it's drinking time, quick, better down that tin of tuna and questionable leftover plain pasta with cheese so your stomach atleast has something to work with. Down go those  beers into that dark empty void you try to fill however notice they gave you nothing but a light buzz and slight sense of  relief. Oh well better than no beers. Guess it's time to feed that other addiction and masturbate yourself to sleep.

I’m a traveling construction worker and I think a big thing that has saved me was being able to go to a new place knowing I was safe from all the chaos and death.

I do enjoy being a loner for the wrong reasons. I know that eventually everyone will be gone one day or will leave me.

4955,Navajoes_ho,1656963940,1,"when ppl hear schizoid personality disorder, they automatically think SCHIZOPHRENIC. i really, really, REALLY wish ppl would either educate themselves about it, or even better, ask ME about it. there is a HUGE difference between the 2. HUGE!! matter of fact, they're not even close (or related) to eachother, and they're not even in the same cluster of groups for personality/mental disorder/s. 

NEVER has anybody associated w/me been in danger. NEVER have i heard/seen things that wasn't there. NEVER have i *blacked out* and went into an episode. NEVER have i been in jail/hospitalized because of my disorder.


Something very real that happened though was CPS was called on me years ago because of a misconception. for a week they visited my house daily. interrogated my child, got into my personal business (therapy visits, family interviews, drug tests, etc.), scared my daughter to death (because they told her she would be taken if anything came back false), and caused an even bigger rift between me and what little bit of family i did have left. 

the only thing about my disorder that might be considered *crippling* or *odd* is the fact i long for and can thrive with ZERO outside interaction. I'm not bothered by not having friends. I'm not bothered by the fact i never leave the house (when i DID have a home; outside of work, when i did work, i would go MONTHS without leaving). I'm not bothered by not having close, meaningful relationships, to be perfectly frank, I'm not bothered by having nobody. that's literally all that means. i am 100% content and happy with it being JUST ME, or just me and MY DAUGHTER. 

i know it probably sounds sad and depressing, but i am 100% content having nobody. HOWEVER, it doesn't mean I'm a dick to people either. I'm pretty intelligent, so I'm decent at carrying conversation, I'm really good at faking my *social personality* so i laugh at appropriate times, feign concern if needed, ask questions to seem interested/engaged, and basically just act like your average, empathetic female. it's completely draining when i do do that so that's why i would reserve that personality for work. 

But, in a nutshell, that's it. that's all schizoid personality disorder is. if everybody in the world (with the exception of my daughter of course) disappeared i would be absolutely content. i don't go insane if i can't talk to somebody, i don't start hallucinating ppl because I'm alone for days at a time, i don't need ppl to stay sane.",lonely,Misconception,2022-07-05 05:45:40

4959,the_trash_man79,1656962145,1,"Well I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone has ever been in a similar circumstance and how they dealt with it and if things got worse.

But lately even my very small group of friends has evaporated. I used to have a regular sized friend group in middle school with about 9 close friends I saw regularly. Then half of them moved away and the other half got into hard drugs not a little weed or anything but cocaine and meth (I'm cool with psychedelics and weed but I don't hang with people who do hard drugs) and that left only my one close friend we will call bill and another we will call derrick. And I consider my little brother in this group as well because my mom always made me bring him along anyway when I was younger so all my friends knew him and hung out with him too sometimes even without me which felt weird but that's besides the point. 

Now I'm 21 and Derrick has married a totally fat and disgusting pig of a woman who he's too good for. And it's not just her body it's her personality moslty. My buddy Derrick was in the army and it broke him and while he's always had confidence issues he's being taken advantage of hard by this witch. She was homeless when we found her and I knew that was a red flag then when he came home and got out of the army he brought her with him and I thought that it was weird. I let him stay with me at my place for awhile and regrettably let that vile pig in my house with him as well. Do not show her any sympathy she takes advantage of his low confidence and shy submissive nature. (He used to not be that way but the army made him much worse he was suicidal at one point He hated it so much and couldn't quit) and it's not just me who thinks that his parents, his brother, and his other friends see her for the snake she is as well. My brother, my other friend bill I mentioned earlier, derricks brother, and a couple of his friends all have an intervention with him after he tells us they got engaged and he basically cut us all out of his life besides his brother which he barely talks to anymore. So that woman has got a hold on him now forever he pays for everything and he's her little slave. She won the lottery with a shy good natured guy like him and he just can't see that she is using him I guess he was that desperate for a woman and now that he finally found one he is clinging on for dear life. Most of you guys might know this but any woman who's worth anything hates clingy guys. But I digress.

My other friend bill is even more depressed than me he's big into conspiracies and all that if you have ever seen the meme he's the definition of a doomer plain and simple I barely see him anymore cause all he does is get high and wallow in self pity. And when he does come over all he wants to do is talk about how shitty everything is like Stan from that matrix parody episode of south park when his parents got divorced. I've tried to help him and get him to at least enjoy the little things but it's no use he is 110% sold on his worldview and anything otherwise is nonsense to him. While I agree he makes some good points sometimes it's not like sitting around moping about will change anything. So I hardly see him anymore.

My last real friend my little brother, has recently become a stranger to me. 2 years ago we were closer than ever. We loved all the same hobbies and got along perfectly which was quite different from our at odds childhood together. But about 2 years ago he started getting obsessed with bands we both enjoy music as most people do but I mean he really enjoyed it like starting watching YouTube videos on music theory learning about all of his favorite bands history, all their albums, fun facts, all their concerts, etc. And that only led down one road learning about them playing their songs he started playing guitar and if there's one hobby I hate more than any other it's a noisy one. He can't just play loud enough so he can hear it he has to play super loud like he's performing for an audience or something  he even does it at like midnight when I'm trying to sleep (he's my roommate for the next year till the lease Is up so I have to stay here anyway) and gets all moody when I ask him to turn it down like I'm ruining his fun or something. And now all he wants to do is guitar guitar guitar. He's not even that good and he bought a 2000 dollar guitar while being in debt just to show you how crazy he is for it. To put it simply he's obsessed and now he barely talks to me anymore and when he does he tries to talk to me about guitar but I don't care so he eventually just goes to play or talk to his friends about it. He left all his other hobbies in the dust, so we can't even relate anymore. And I've grown to dislike living with him since all he does his play guitar at an annoying volume and I'll be moving out as soon as I can. This one is mostly on me for being selfish and yes I know it's definitely a disgusting way to look at it but I can't help but feel any other way about it, he's the only one I find joy in hanging out with anymore and now that's lost to his guitar obsession. My brother said I'm jealous of him playing guitar and having his stupid garage band but really it's not that I just want my old brother back who used to share hobbies and interests with me. And now I realized besides on occasion my doomer friend I have no one left to hang out with. And no I'm not into playing guitar or anything besides he's already got his little garage band made up there's no room for me in it anyway even if I did try and play something. I don't care about bands like he does. I don't worship the guys as gods. Most of the time when I listen to a song I hardly know anything about who plays it or anything if I like the sound I like it if not whatever. Me and my brother still talk some here and there but it's never anything deep like we used to and how al I supposed to hang out with a guy who's whole life is guitar now? He wants to be like those guys from the 80s like Pantera and Megadeth but that era is over he just doesn't get it. Part of me hopes he will understand that he's never gonna make it big and be as good as dimeback Darrel or Dave mustiane and he comes back to his old hobbies and back to me instead of these new band weirdo friends he has. Call me a bad brother for saying that it all you want but trust me I'm very good at understanding people he's only doing it for an escape he's having like an early life crisis or something and can't hold a job for a month. And is in debt like I said. He's been trying to find a way to get rich and I guess he thinks this is it. Most of those guys he worships learned guitar in diapers basically and your brain masters things very quickly and easier at a younger age you can't just pick up guitar at 19 and think you are gonna be as good as they ever were. Everytime I call him out for his pipe dream and strike him with reality and say he should worry about paying off his credit card debt instead of guitar his story changes. Sometimes he denies even wanting fame saying all he cares about is the music aspect which might be true a little bit. But then other times he says he only expects small concerns just enough to get by off music so he doesn't have to work anymore then I show him thousands of people who thought they could do the same thing (and are 100x better than he is at guitar) and end up bankrupt or homeless and he gets pissed at me and kicks me out of his room. Idk what to do he won't wake up from this pipedream of being an 80s rockstar. I hope this is just a young phase and he grows up when he's In his early 20s. 

People can say whatever they want  but making friends after your school years are over is not the same in the slightest. I'm really not hoping for a woman anytime soon I have been with plenty of girls over the years to know I prefer hanging out with guy friends more than any girls I've been with yes the sex is great but I've never meet a girl that I can really have as much fun with just hanging out with compared to hanging out with the guys. 

Has anyone got anything similar that happened to them? Maybe they had a positive turn in events maybe it was worse? Anything to share?

4977,Jurez1313,1656958490,1,"I am honestly just so ... sad. All the time. Loneliness has consumed my life and my thoughts. I'm at work with a pile of tasks that I have no intention of doing anytime soon. All I can think of is how daunting the rest of my life is right now. Because I can see it clearly. Another 30-40 years of getting up, going to work, coming home to an empty house, eating dinner, playing video games (until arthritis and carpal tunnel catch up to me, then just watching movies), then going to sleep to do it all over again. The weekends just remove work from the equation. That's all my life has been the last 5-8 years, that's all it will be until I die.  

Why do I not only think this, but absolutely *know* it, with every fiber of my being? Quite simply, because there's no way anything else is possible. I know myself well enough to know I will never have the motivation, discipline, or sheer willpower to change anything about my life. The ability to force myself to work out, or change careers, or make friends was bullied out of me at a very young age. What few friends stuck around are long gone. The only people that remain in my life are biologically programmed to do so. Once they are gone, I will have no one, until the day I die.  

So what do I do now? To say my future sounds bleak is a gross understatement of affairs. How am I supposed to move forward knowing that the ONE thing that I've always wanted, the ONLY thing I've *ever* wanted - to be loved, cared for, hugged and kissed, to have my hand clasped in my lovers' - has never been, and never will be, possible? That no matter how many strangers I try to talk to, no matter how many MeetUp groups I attend, no matter how many jobs I start and lose because of my poor work ethic, I will never make another *friend* let alone a partner?  

I'm really, really struggling to see the path that leads from where I am now, to actually being happy. Or at least, being *not* miserable. If such a path doesn't exist, if I really am ""destined"" to be miserable the rest of my life...why even bother walking such a path?",lonely,All hope is lost...what do I do now?,2022-07-05 04:14:50

5007,whtevvve,1656941920,1," I'm 30, M, and have basically been alone for the past 4 years, give or take. Absolutely no friends left, no one left for checking up one me,  or even think about me I think at this point, except for my mother, the rest of the family barely gives a shit. Same love-wise, no relations since 2017...

 I never had a lot of friends, but I always had a few, 2/3 tops, with a few acquaintances, friends of friends etc. It wasn't always lasting, sometimes it was just for one year, we were in the same class, university, job... some of these friendships were definitely mostly circumstantial, but at least I had a few ppl I could count on, or to hang around with. I miss that way more that I'd like to admit.

I at least until recently (15 months ago) had this same group of friends on the internet for a decade, we played games and talked for extended period of times, but I began to find them uninteresting af and they had opinions that I deemed stupid (aliens built the pyramids) or disgusting (racist stuff) and they expressed them too much for me to just ignore. I started to enjoy my games and free time way better without them, so one day, impetuously, I cut all contact, deleted them from friend-lists and moved on. Kinda regret it. Being totally alone is way worse than being in bad company imo, despite the idiom.   


So here I am, I didn't have a genuine conversations for months, I work from home (IT)  and have only professional talks with my few colleagues, no one knows me. If I were to die right now, my body would probably rot for weeks and be partially eaten by my cat before my mother worry enough to break my apartment door or something. I should not think about such a thing but it did cross my mind a few times and this thought is particularly making me depressed.

I feel I'm totally responsible for the situation I'm in right now. I have been lazy in my twenties, I didn't put enough effort in some friendships, I pushed away some people that were genuinely trying to be my friend, I didn't try to broaden my network hard enough, I rested on my laurels, being content with the few friends I had, not knowing I'll lose them one day and end up totally alone.  

I don't even know how to interact with people anymore, how to make connections, even ephemeral ones. I don't think I could even handle a simple conversation anymore, my life has become so dull I have nothing interesting to tell, I'm literally incapable of small-talk. I'm starting to be really afraid that this loneliness will characterize the rest of my life. Not sure I can live like this for decades. I'm thinking of ending it more and more often, not that I'm brave enough to do it, it's just thoughts, but it could become more if this doesn't change.

It's cliché, but I literally feel like I'm at the bottom of a well from which I can barely see light shine, I don't feel like I have an ounce of the strength I need to get out of it, or how to use it, as the walls are smooth and I can't get a grip, to follow up on the well's metaphor. Weed, video games, books, tv shows, movies and the likes, a bit of social media helps make this life livable, but it' s not enough, escaping in fictions and not living my life is now occupying my mind strongly enough so that I can't enjoy these kind of things anymore. 

Ppl in their thirthies already have their long-lasting group of friends and are not interested in making new ones, I already had a fair bit of troubles in my youth making friends, but now, after working from home, not meeting new ppl, and living alone between 4 walls for years, I lost all social skills.",lonely,I don't know how to climb out of this hole I put myself into,2022-07-04 23:38:40

I am never around people, i work alone, i eat alone for last 3 years now. I remember having a girlfriend about 3 years ago but its so distant that it feels like a different life. Last month i was shaken up from my loner slumber when i went to Switzerland and i was able to think clearly for first time in years. I realised there is something wrong with me if i am not able to even talk to people. My confidence has been at all time low level, cant go to bars, or clubs, heck cant even order at a restaurant. I am very intimidated by people and i dont think if i continue i would ever find a companion. I am seriously lacking courage. My prospects are declining every day and I cant seem to find a way to talk to people. Wish there was a way to know if someone is lonely like you so you could talk to them. All the conversations i am having have no emotions, they have no taste, very monotonous and dry. And i am zoning out of them like crazy. My internal monologue is very loud right now.

I had a healthy social life from my first memory until I was 14 or so. I was always relatively shy, but I had three close friends who I enjoyed spending time with, and I also had cousins who I was very close with.


Flash forward to high school, I’ve now lost two out of the three friends I had in grade school, leaving one friend remaining. I’m a quality over quantity type of person when it comes to friends, but the issue was that he was a douche to me constantly since he knew I didn’t have any other friends to fall back on.


I finally cut ties with him the summer after senior year in 2017, leaving me with zero friends. I wasn’t talking to my cousins anymore at this point either due to extended family drama nonsense. My family also stopped having family gatherings around that time due to the drama.


I made a friend in early 2019 at my old job, and we hung out frequently that year. However, we hung out only one time after 2019 ended. We still talked regularly, but it was an awkward situation where he moved an hour away and only wanted to hangout if it was on his terms, so we weren’t super close. He ghosted me about a month ago over a super small disagreement. 


That leaves me now with quite literally zero real life friends or acquaintances. Like, there’s no one (except for one online friend) who I ever talk to. It feels like I’ve never even socially existed. Most people have old acquaintances or friends from school/work they catch up with from time to time, but I somehow don’t even have that. It’s honestly almost impressive that I’ve lived 23 years and made zero lasting connections.

\--

So I (M26) have been talking for a month or so with a girl (F22) I meet at the gym. We were having a good time talking, lots of things in common. She texted me every day. I was not initiating texting, she did every time, so I was very confident she was interested in me so I asked her out.

We have been on two dates, first one we grabbed an ice cream at night, had a fun time knowing each other better, a bit of flirting here and there. That's where I decided I actually liked the girl.

Second date we had a walk on the beach at night, super romantic vibe, had fun and made out a bit. No sex since I didn't want to push but she was very comfortable and all over me. I thought I've finally found someone special. I know there is no special one girl and that there is plenty of fish in the sea but man it's been a long time since I was so comfortable with someone.

I drove her home and kissed again goodnight, we talked about see us again the next week but didn't specify a particular day. I promise it felt like I was in a dream. Never seen a girl so interested in me.

Next week I started to notice she texts me less offten, but don't think too much about it. Half through the week I ask her again if she wants to meet me on Sunday but she says she can't, but we can hang out the next week (this week). At this point I see she is less interested in me than I am in her.

Today (Monday) I saw her at the gym, so it looks like a good oportunity to set up the third date. I made sure I was not interrupting and no one was hearing our conversation so no pressure, she looked happy to see me when I approached.

I asked her to have dinner any day any day this week, and she says that she is busy, but she will let me know if she is available some day this week. I also noticed as quick as I asked her out her body language completely changed and she was trying to go.

Yeah, I am very sure she is busy every day of the week. It's not like I am the backup plan. Fuck off man, what do I have to do to find someone I can share my life with?

I'm not interested in casual sex, I just want a meaningful relationship man. All my friends are in relationships and I am the fucking idiot who is always left alone. I have been on self improvement for fucking years. I have studied, have a good job in IT, making good money, I work out every single fucking day, ripped as fuck, abs like rocks and arms like tree trunks. I have hobbies, I practice boxing, have friends, don't smoke, don't drink alcohol. I notice I get looks when I go out but I just don't care about ONS.

I've had two people suggest that my ex was lonely after I claimed he was stringing me along for a while. Both of these people said that those were two different things.

 To me, loneliness and wanting a partner is a recipe for a disaster. In my two serious relationships, I was not lonely beforehand. I was pretty happy and I wanted to share happiness with someone and get to know someone. But life tends to be good when I'm single. I can't comprehend the whole idea of loneliness and settling down with someone just because they're available. 

Since this is the second time someone suggested that my ex was with me because of loneliness, I broke down. It feels like I went back emotionally to the day we broke up. For a while, I felt relief after the breakup. Relief that I didn't have to feel anxiety about not feeling wanted. Relief that I initiated the breakup. But now I just feel despair. Like it was really all nothing. That I was a nice person to be around that cared about him but ultimately, replaceable. 

Now that I think about it- during an argument before we broke up, I asked why he was with me. He said because I care about him, listen to him, etc. I am just a concept to him. I was his support, but he didn't see me as a person and an individual. 

Realizing this is just as devastating as being broken up with and I hate it. Please, everyone, if you are lonely, please sort your emotional issues out before hurting an SO.

5036,Strong_Outcome_9811,1656920659,1,Hi Reddit am a 13 year old male going in to my freshman year of high school. For all my life my so called friends would bully me my whole life up until the 6th grade. I got out of that environment and me and my family moved but not because of my friends. After I made some new friends in the 8th grade they all seemed cool and fun to hang around but I was wrong. They never invited me to places they would go. Sometimes I would ask if they wanted to hang out but they all said they were Busy but when I would check there Snapchat story they would be hanging out with each other. This would go one for 5 months and then I just stoped asking. I built up the courage to ask if they wanted to come over they said NO. One day they invited me to a party I was so excited but I never got a address or an invitation. Near the end of the year I met this one girl in my art class who actually liked me and we became friends I forgot to mention that I do not look the best and have always been insecure about my looks. Then I found out that 90% of my friends were fake. I found this info by hearing a conversation at lunch. Am not going to go into details but it was hard for me. And on the last day of school I built up the courage to ask the girl out and the one think she did was laugh in my face and walk away and now I have no friends to hang out with this summer and I am pretty lonely and I am pretty scared for high school because I will be all alone. anyone have any tips?,lonely,So lonely,2022-07-04 17:44:19

To top it off this is the third time that this has happened to me, I get to know someone for six months to a year and ask them and then something out my control pops up and my date cancels on me permanently a few days before the date is supposed to happen.

I know I am not doing anything wrong, I've talked over my steps with my sister and friends every day leading up to the date to make sure I stay respectful, humble, and excited for the date.  I took all the right steps just for this to be taken away from me again.

He's being him ..but I am mono and this is not normal for me...but I want to be there and supportive ..this year I've developed a feeling of constant loneliness...he spends so much time texting her and hanging out with her in VR and stuff ...our relationship he says is his priority...but instead we fight more and I'm left feeling like I'm not important. I get it he's trying to make sure she knows he cares cause he doesn't see her...but even though we live together...I feel ignored and pushed aside...my loneliness now controls my mind...I sit there and stare at him thinking how much I just want to be beside him...or want to cuddle or wake up beside him...knowing he doesn't want that ...even around friends or coworkers I just feel insignificant...I just want to feel loved again I guess...instead of spending my insomnia filled nights in a room alone and starting my mornings alone ....while he spends all his time...being online with her.,lonely,Feeling alone even with my significant other,2022-07-04 15:50:27

5057,redsocialistpanda,1656910838,1,"I'm a 29F from South American and I have been living in Western PA for almost 3 years. In the beginning I met a bunch of girls who I immediately connected with due to the same interexchange reality we shared. 80% os these people are from my home-country. 

Then I was lucky to find the love of my life, got married, have a house and a dog. I can't say I feel 100% lonely thanks to my wonderful husband. But as I just told him, he is not a girl and I can not throw on him all my expectations about having friends.   


In my home city I always had so many friends, there were a few of my birthdays that I would invite 50-60 people and would always have everyone making sure to be with me in my day, it always made me feel so special and lucky. Every weekend I had stuff to do with different groups of friends - not to mention that a few of them I know it's been more than 20 years. It is not about the quantity, I am just glad to have so many close friends, to the point that I am having trouble to decide all my bridesmaids for the wedding ceremony we are gonna have in my country next year. I was always told that if there is one thing about me is that I am a friends magnet. Also I have a solid 10 years friendship with people I met online that live in other states and I would always visit during vacation.  


And with all this, now I feel the most lonely. I ofc can message and call all this friends, but I feel really lonely in this city that I live now, because I don't have a friend to go to the cinema with me, to go play volleyball, to have drinks, to go biking. I don't have actual friends here, I feel like I have many colleagues - that I thought they were my friends. I used to have 2 really close friends that got divorced by the time I got married and I feel like they got divorced from me too cause they changed completely with me. I once thought being the only single girl of my girls group was hard, but being almost the only married girl is 100x harder. I feel like I lost connection with all my girl friends here, it's almost like we had connection enough for sometime but not deep enough to really bond. I try to invite people out and sometimes I barely get answers, as ofc they have plans without me. I wondered once if it was because I am not in single anymore, but I guess it's more than that, it is just that I am not important enough for them to include me in their plans and this makes me really sad, but at the same time, I would never go talk to anyone about it, cause I believe this should be spontaneous. The only friend I had is going back to her home-country in Europe and I couldn't be sadder that she is leaving.   


I hope this changes when I have my work-permit in hands and start to work. I used to think I shouldn't  mix professional and personal life by being friends with people from work, but I will have to give up on this belief.

5059,workingonitig,1656909905,1,"I think the route cause of my loneliness is in my childhood. Im pretty sure I was neglected by my parents emotionally. I didnt get babysitters after the age of 6 because i had become so used to playing by myself despite having older siblings that they didnt even worry when i was left alone. My sister traumatized me and i'll never forgive her. I would try to show her my drawing only to be met with complete apathy and turned away. Whenever i played with my toys or club penguin or watched disney channel my sister would tell me that i couldnt do that in 5th grade or i couldnt do that in middle school or that i couldnt do that in high school. I never enjoyed my childhood because i was always being told to grow up. I dont even remember what my brother looked like before 18 because he spent all his time playong video games in his room. My parents didnt do family dinners, so i ate alone in my room. My dad worked a lot, i dont really fault him because he actually tried. But my mother is an alcoholic who drinks every day of the week. She is immature and lazy. She makes the house a disgusting mess and blames my dad for it. She would make me pay for my own birthday presents, or pay for my own school clothes at 11. She would tell everyone at a party my siblings private issues that we didnt want shared. I was never hugged and tucked in, my boundaries never respected, my emotions never understood. She never taught me life skills or social skills, most of what i learned came from my aunt. Its like she hasnt mentally aged since her time as an 80's cheerleader. 

I dont think i had any role models to help me learn how to healthily socialize. When i was kid i was pretty mean because of how my sister treated me and so i struggled to make friends. By the age of 12 i was apathetic and numb to the world from the emotional neglect by my mother. Ive had to learn empathy, i still struggle to be vulnerable and to feel my emotions as authentic. I got by high school telling myself that i would just make friends in college and now that im in college ive never struggled with loneliness more. Ive cried myself to sleep on several occasions. Listening to people talk i just dont understand how to get past aquaintances. How do relationships evolve to actually hanging out? And how do i stop oversharing to every person i do meet, it only scares people away. I dont even know how to talk to people.",lonely,why i'm lonely,2022-07-04 14:45:05
5060,BreadfruitOk3987,1656909638,1,"It's my first time posting to Reddit. I am lonely and have no one to talk to. 
I've never had many friends, and I've been totally alone since high school. My social skills aren't the best as I've never been very socialized since I was a kid and I'm a bit of an introvert, but I think I'm pretty friendly with other people. But every time I try to make friends, people leave me. I recently had an internet friend for over a year but he ended up ignoring my messages. My best friend from high school cut ties with me after graduation and people always start to ignore me after a while. I've always been ignored but I don't know what I'm doing wrong and it's killing me inside that I'm such an unpleasant person and I don't know what to change about myself. I also recently went to Erasmus for half a year and during that time I made totally just one friend out of all the exchange students almost at the end of the semester, but now we both left, we don't text each other anymore and I'm alone again.

I often have a hard time connecting and fitting in with some people, but even when I've tried to make friends with people I thought I might fit in with, I ended up alone.
I've been lonely for years and have developed social anxiety as a result, making it even more difficult for me to make friends.
I've also been seeing a therapist about this for a year, but I still haven't been able to make any real, long-term friends. Honestly I don't know what to do and I am desperate and feeling hopeless and worthless. After years, I'm so afraid of losing people with no explanation of what I did wrong, that I'd rather not try anymore and hate myself for not knowing what's wrong with me.

Lately, however, I’ve felt like I’ve had all of the hope, joy and happiness I once had sucked out of me and now all that’s left is an empty shell of who I strive to be and all of the terrifying and depressing emotions I’ve tried so hard over the last few years to make better. 

Nothing necessarily happened to trigger this feeling, but I find that I’m much more aware of lonely and alone I truly am. I’m always there for others but nobody is ever there for me.

So about a month ago this girl and I met on Snapchat and we lived close to each other, we flirted on Snapchat and calls for a while when I asked her to be my GF and she said yes. We met up in person twice and they were great. While talking with her on the phone so much I had thought that I knew her pretty well but I was wrong. Basically, over call, I had learned, that she was a shy 14 yo who was awkward in real life and the first time we met IRL she was really scared to talk to me and apologized in texts after the first meet-up. She apologized for a lot of things that didn't matter when she would text me sometimes she would say sorry for bothering me but I didn't know how to explain to her that I was awaiting her texts. Anyways it might seem silly because this relationship does not matter in the long run but at the moment it is a big thing to me, I want to get to the point of feeling indifferent and not like shit. So she started saying she loved me and stuff and we cuddled a bit the second time we met IRL and I thought it was going great. Then today at 6:00 she was texting me on Snapchat and I saw that she was typing for a long time, and in my head, I had thought that it could either be really good or really bad, and unfortunately it was the worst possible result, and extremely confusing I am so confused about her and feel like I do not know her nearly as well as I did. Basically, out of nowhere she just texted me that she wanted to be in a more 'toxic relationship' and she wanted a guy who was more of an 'asshole' and it was like a kink for her, and I was just like wtf. That was weird considering she was only 14, naturally, I was confused and asked her to elaborate and she said she wanted dirty talk and shit and I'm just shy and awkward in person and I couldn't get myself to do that. She said I was too innocent and she was too dirty and idk I thought she was the opposite of that type of person by talking with her, she seemed extremely sweet and this is definitely not expected. At first, I felt nothing and was just absolutely dumbfounded but rn I feel like absolute shit and its just overpowering rn. I feel like getting another girl will be so hard and that I just don't have game or confidence and I'm just back to square one back in the shit trying to start again. It feels like I just lost an entire months worth of progress which seems like a long time to me now. IK this seems ridiculous to adults who have experience but this was genuinely my first love and girl that has actually ever liked me back. Now I am just left lost and confused. What tf am I supposed to do, she was my first love and I have never felt anything like that before. Any advice, help, coping techniques would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

If he's lying to me about these things, there's no reason to believe he's honest when he says he loves me. Or when he says he cares about me. I'm scared to lose him, but he might already be long gone. Part of me regrets ever meeting him. Before he came, I held everyone at arm's length. I was afraid to let people in. I kept myself hidden, tucked away in some dark space so that no one could ever use me again. He reached out to me first. I think I'd forgotten the sound of my own laughter until he brought me so much joy. Was I happier alone? Maybe not, but at least I was safer. I wasn't scared because I had nothing to lose.

5086,adventurer309,1656901017,1,"In May my girlfriend and I broke up. Just recently someone I had been friends with, hung out with a lot, and really opened up to said they wanted to stop being friends over text. And someone I met who I really grew to like started to act really different and I think they liked me for a bit but now it seems like they aren’t interested at all and we never talk in the way we used to and it is breaking my heart. 

After my girlfriend broke up with me I was heartbroken. I went through a whirlwind of emotions all within a week. I told myself I didn’t think I could handle another relationship at all (friendship or romantic.) Then I met this woman and even if it was online I grew to like her a lot (I still do) and I won’t go into detail but I think she liked me too. But now we never talk in the same way and it hurts. We talk a bit, but it isn’t anything like how we used to. Maybe she’s going through some difficult stuff. 

Then my now ex friend said they didn’t wanna be friends anymore over text. I’m fine with it as while I enjoyed our friendship it isn’t all that upsetting to me.. I’m still shocked and I am upset that they did it over text rather than in person. 

But I don’t think I can handle opening up to someone and being vulnerable ever again.. I don’t wanna give a huge part of myself to someone just for them to leave. I wanna be there for someone and support them but I want the same in return. I used to be okay with being on my own but then I made friends/a girlfriend and things ended, and now I feel empty. I wish I never knew what it was like to have someone around in the first place. Now I’m here, alone, and I have to live with it 

I just don’t have the energy for any relationship or friendship.. I can’t let anyone new in. I won’t be able to handle it if they leave and I have nothing left to give anymore at this point. I feel as if I’ve been slowly whittled away and there’s nothing left of me. I need to start relying on just myself again.

5126,FlyAway1944,1656888692,1,"I started reading a murakami novel. 

Ok let me explain. 

Ive had some pretty intense periods of loneliness throughout my life- but Ive always handled it in my own way. As a guy, the status quo is just to shut up and take it (although this is wrong I literally have no choice) and try and put on a brave face. 

I was doing fine, making healthy steps in my life, career was going well, everything seemed more positive. 

Until.. I started reading this book “south of the border, west of the sun”

Murakami captures that feeling of loneliness so well in his books but the way he describes that raw emotion-the wanting and how much it hurts- the craving for real connection and when you do find it and it goes away-how much ur life changes as a result it brought everything back up again.

I cant keep going with this facade that everything is fine- its not.

Sure I have a steady job, sure Ive got  plans and im organised about my future, sure Im trying to sort out my health, sure I have friends and go out often.

But that doesn’t change the fact that my life feels void of any meaning of purpose without sharing it with someone else. Honestly. All I want in life is to have a deep connection with my partner and start a family. If i can just achieve that- I will literally be the happiest guy on Earth. 

Let me put things in perspective. I would rather lose 100 friends if it meant that I could have a genuine partner that loves me and I them. 

I would rather have sex with 1 person for the rest of my life and thats the person I want to marry, there is no religious thing here thats just how im wired idk why. 

Reading this book made me realise how bland my life is right now, how much Im hurting inside, how can I even be touch starved when I literally have never been touched by anyone? I feel a round ball in the pit of my stomach- anxiety and just this intense-wanting-I cant describe it as anything else. Ive had pain before, this is so much worse. 

To anyone out there who feels this way, I’m sorry. I really am. Feel free to reach out and lets all help each other through this.",lonely,I was doing fine…..Until,2022-07-04 08:51:32

5129,imHereJust4This,1656887254,1,"After one failed relationship 8 years ago and no friends ever since, I've decided I'm not the guy for a relationship. There's many different reasons why, I won't bore you with all of them, but to list a few:

* I think I have Asperger's (currently waiting on a diagnosis) and have always struggled with being affectionate, have very low confidence and self esteem and just have zero experience in this field. My partner would have to do most of the heavy lifting and it wouldn't be fair on her.
* I work long hours and am working on launching a business at some point in the future so it's not like I'd have time or energy for a stable relationship anyway.
* I have weird, slightly hostile views towards relationships. I believe that most relationships aren't how they appear on the surface, that the concept of soulmates is nonsense and that it's impossible to fully love someone.

From reading this, it's probably clear that I absolutely should not be in a relationship right now, if ever. But.. well, that's kind of painful to think about. I'd love a relationship with someone. I fantasize about it constantly at work. I've built an entire story about a relationship in my mind. It's like my mind defaults to it whenever I'm stressed and having a bad day. And it gets much worse:

* I'm trying to work on self-love, but tell myself I hate myself nearly every day
* I want to be with people but I'm scared of receiving affection or even becoming close to someone because I'll probably catch feelings and make it so much harder. I feel touch starved but would probably push anyone away.
* I see and read about people unhappy in relationships every day but feel unhappy because I'm not in one. Maybe it's a validation thing, I don't know.

Any advice for anyone like me?

5151,1redeye1,1656880415,1,"Reading posts and hearing different perspectives on this sub made me connect a couple of dots about my lifelong history of loneliness. Especially how my own attitude towards people and the institution of society had evolved over the years. This will probably be a very long post, but maybe someone can benefit from my observations and I can pull it together in my head by committing it to writing.

I am a 26 yo male. Never had a girlfriend. I used to have quite a lot of acquaintances when I was younger and have a couple of friends to this day. But most of the time, I don't feel like talking to them and they barely know anything that goes on in my life and certainly less so what goes on in my head.

In my school years, I was quite well-liked and as mentioned, had quite a few acquaintances. I don't use the word 'friends' on purpose as older in experience, I now have a higher threshold for what I would call a friendship. 

Back then, I made 'friends' by wearing a lot of masks and adapting by creating a character that everyone will sort of vibe with. I also made sure to avoid conflict and not offend anyone. I avoided subjects that my peers would consider 'too dark' or that would 'spoil the good vibes' that everybody loved so much. But those 'too dark' subjects were in actuality almost the sole content of my mind, and so nobody really knew or liked me. They liked the persona I have created so that they don't reject me because I spoil the fairytale vibes that they prefer to exist it. 

I could not tolerate the risk of losing this warm blanket of being universally well-liked and accepted because I was a child and I had nothing else. My mother never wanted me and made sure I felt it since day one and throughout. My father rightfully left her when I was 5 years ago and himself withdrew from society. He fought as hard as he could to bring me with him, but my mother resisted him out of spite and because she could not handle the societal stigma of being a bad mother for not being with her child. 

Her being a woman and being more affluent than my father (having robbed him during the divorce as well), she won the case in court and I was condemned to stay with her and my stepfather to whom I was also a nuisance (on a good day). My father lasted a couple of years in isolation and committed suicide when I was 10. Soul left my body that day and I don't think that I have recovered it to this day. I loved my father very much. He was the only person that genuinely had my interest in mind and wanted me to live. By 'live' I don't just mean have a pulse but actually live a life that has meaning and love in it.

And so my school years went by, myself living in prison with people who hated me deep inside but were too conceited to admit or show it to the outside world. So the outside world thought that everything was great. We weren't poor and my 'caretakers' were not alcoholics so obviously everything was going great, no? Actually, no. I was depressed, paranoid and had nobody to reach out to. I lulled myself to sleep every night by imagining suicide or any other scenarios that would end my poor excuse of a life. I would not sleep until 3am and only got about 5 hours of sleep every night because those couple of hours lost in the darkness of my imagination were my 'happy place'. The only place I could feel safe. When everyone was asleep.

I have read one of the top posts here today that said that the reason why depressed and lonely people don't reach out for help is not because of the societal stigma of depression but because people don't understand and trivialize their problems - this is extremely true.

See, when you are no different from all other people in your environment, then all you have to do is 'go out there' and talk to people. You do not have these problems and you do not understand when other people do. You will always find common topics for conversation and the feeling will flow freely because the two of you are pretty much the same person. And this is what the overwhelming majority of society is comprised of. People who were molded by the previous generations, culture, religion, governance etc. to be similar to each other. But if a wrench gets thrown into you on the way and you do not go through this molding process uninterrupted, you will discover that life has other, dark aspects to it and you will either repress this knowledge inside of you and pretend that you did in fact go through the process swimmingly, or you will no longer fit in.

And when you no longer fit in, you are rejected. Not even out of ill will but out of natural necessity, because other people simply **do not understand you and your problems.** They cannot relate. You are threatening to disturb their calm sleep of ignorance. Think about it - if you could reject the darkness and live without your problems - wouldn't you? And what would you then do if someone came around threatening to disturb your peace? Would you welcome them?

I have also read a couple of posts along the lines of 'if someone shows me any attention I fall in love with them' or 'I keep looking at my phone hoping for a notification'. I understand and relate to those from my childhood, but it no longer happens to me, and this is where I stand today. I had lost the energy and urge to pursue relationships because the only things that I have experienced in relationships since my birth are drama, treason, violence and toxicity. 

Because of my childhood situation I have developed strong survival skills and learned to lean on no one for anything. Because of this, I have attained a lot of what the society would consider 'success' - moved out to a much wealthier country, finished a good school and have a good job that sustains me. The people at the good job in a good country are very nice, but virtually all of them come from favorable conditions and so they are even further removed from my understanding of reality. I tried tying myself to some people in my adult life and they either took advantage of my resourcefulness or somehow else disappointed me every single time.

To my mind, at this point, it is utterly senseless to voluntarily pursue something that only brings pain and trouble. I had completely lost faith in people. I don't trust their appearances, words, promises, acts, anything. I have learned too many times that humans are selfish creatures that in a situation of any kind of pressure will default to their inborn egoism and do whatever is beneficial to them at the time, at any expense to me that is convenient.

My therapist claims that there are people more like me out there with whom I could have meaningful relationships, but I neither have the energy nor the will to sift through the other 99% of society to get through to them. 

I am in the prime years of my sexuality and I see beautiful girls everywhere on the streets. It hurts not to be able to be with them. But I have yet to meet any girl my age who would get or want to deal with any of the stuff I had written above. And I refuse to go back to my childhood strategy of being a social chameleon because life as a fake is worse than death. I will never do it again. 

And so I am lonely.

5158,icepick324,1656879297,1,"This is a throwaway account. 

I have been on medication for major depressive disorder for two years now, around the same time I moved abroad to a foreign country. Integration for an introverted teenager like myself was almost impossible, especially due to the fact I am still not fluent in the local language. I have always been alright with being alone, accepting it as part of my experience so far, perhaps because I wasn't what people were looking for in a friend. 

School was tough for me; very few friends and I had a distinct impression of never fitting in or belonging to the already formed friend groups. I held my head my up whenever I could, but some people seem to be able to recognise when there is no one willing to stand up for you. 

I eventually sought out counselling, and after a particularly tough winter for my depression, everything seemed to begin looking better. Unfortunately, a series of circumstances led me to distance myself from my therapist just as I was getting through the last months of high school. 

Now, everything feels like it's back to what it used to be before I even started bothering about taking care of myself. The only two people who I sometimes hung around with are soon to leave the country due to university, and I am once again left to myself without therapy, acquaintances, very little family, and in a foreign country where people are hard to approach socially. Most of my nights are spent fantasising about making friends, being sociable and gathering a moderately sized group of friends with which to go out, drink, and have fun. 

One evening I went grocery shopping, and I came across a group of people about my age who were gathered around the alcoholic section to pick up beer together. They seemed to get along pretty well, and they obviously had a fun night ahead of them. The sight of something so simple yet unattainable that for so long has been dangled in front of my face led me to break down once I got home.

Hello! :D

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 27 almost 28 year old guy from the USA (it doesn't matter where you're from by the way, message me even if you live on the moon!) and i want to make some best friends since being lonely stinks. I have like two or three people that i actively talk to haha and they are my parents/family members, Im almost 28 years old and I don’t really have any friends outside of my parents/family, I live with my parents. Im quite shy and introverted and have always struggled to make friends. I am far too aware that the majority of the people that I have cared about in the past have had little regard for my feelings. I have a awesome family that loves me haha but I really want some friends that aren’t my family. I just really want to make some genuine connections and have a best friends to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m very talkative! I love talking about anything at all, unless it's really weird stuff then maybe perhaps not. I love poetry, I do poetry as a hobby but thanks to depression/anxiety I have (in the past) lost all my motivation to write poems, so finishing a single poem without getting impatient and deleting it prematurely takes a lot of effort sometimes. I can still try writing you a silly funny poem tho if you want. For example i'll write you a funny poem that will make you laugh, for your birthday. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Focusing on self growth has been huge for me recently so if you’re on a similar journey I would love to hear from you. Part of this process has meant I’ve taken up learning a few musical instruments and practicing meditating.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a pet dog. :) I love animals so much!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I need music recommendations so we can totally make awesome playlists for each other. I love to draw (it’s a newish hobby and I’m not great at it), maybe I can draw a goofy picture of you. Or maybe I’ll make a statue of you on Minecraft! Lol. :) :)

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoy cooking, baking, cake decorating and trying new recipes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of interests, a few unique ones but i'll leave them for you to discover, meanwhile i'll just list the common ones here. I love video games, I usually just play Nintendo stuff but sometimes I play some other games too. I love Don't Starve Together, i've been playing some The Sims Games recently. I also love Fallout and several other games! I love watching stuff, from movies to shows to whatever on Reddit haha ahhh so much to list. My favorite movies are Ponyo, Your Name, and Cast Away. My favorite animes are Parasyte, Code Geass, Fruits Basket, DeathNote. My favorite shows are The Good Place, Black Mirror and Malcolm In The Middle. My favorite color is green! There's a funny story behind that, if you wanna know, just ask me. My favorite music genres are indie and k pop haha but I listen to all genres. I love music so much!

&amp;#x200B;

I love helping people, i love supporting people emotionally and I'd do anything that im capable of to emotionally support/help someone out if im able. :)

I guess this part is going to get sad and i understand that a lot of people don't like that, so you can just skip this section if you want. I suffer from a lot of mental issues, for example pretty intense anxiety/depression that super messes with me a lot. It's very hard to even go outside sometimes, I suffer from OCD, and i absolutely hate when people say that OCD = just being “really clean and tidy”. It's way more than that. I know this is gonna sound cliche but I just feel like a lot of people don't understand me or mentalillness at all sometimes. I have always felt somewhat like an alien and i've always been a outcast kinda. Even when surrounded by other outcasts! If you suffer from any issues at all, i'll try my best to help you out. Chances are i know how it feels. Im not looking for you to fix all of my issues but :) im looking for a supportive friend that is kind.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that's enough about me! Now i'll talk a bit about my ideal friend. I'd want to be best friends with somebody(s). I've always been just another ""choice"" for everyone, they always have their own best friends and i'm always just ""the dude they hang out with when nobody else is around"". I want to feel cared for, i want people to support me emotionally and check up on me if they see that i feel down. I want to focus on one (max, Three) person(s) and i'd like it if you focused on me too. The only requirement for you to message me is: be in the 21-35 age range. :) Your gender doesn’t matter to me, I will be friends with you regardless of your gender!

5169,coinflipdrifter,1656874852,1,"This is a burner account. 

I almost ended it last night. I called the NSPL while pulled over on the Marin side of the Golden Gate. It’s not the first time and it probably won’t be the last. 

The person I loved most vanished on me 12 months ago. We had spent years together. I wanted to marry her, flaws and all. We had moved to NYC together to chase her dream, tried to build a life amidst a pandemic. We split for a bit, still took care of each other, and then I made an honest man’s attempt at change. True change; the type of shit that you only see in the movies. Lifestyle changes, communication changes, and acknowledging my faults head on and then making a noticeable effort to fix them. 

And she took all of that from me, fucked somebody on the side, and immediately moved in with him across the fucking country.

I feel worthless. I’ve tried dating, but I feel gross. I’m exhausted. The grief is obsessive and overbearing. I haven’t made contact with her since she called me from Los Angeles to tell me. 

I feel like neither version of who I am or who I tried to become was worthwhile to the one opinion that inexplicably still somehow matters. I’m an ugly depressive now - craving validation from a place I’ll never get it. 

Loneliness and being alone are two completely separate things. Being alone is a choice, an embrace of mindfulness and control of your presence. Loneliness is a fucking disease. 

I’ll do today what I did yesterday. I’ll press forward with no direction, no validation of my decisions, and no mutual comfort waiting for me wherever I end up.

I haven't been asked about my day, week, month or year in such a long time, I have almost forgotten what it feels like for someone to give a shit. My Mum said I ""had turned into someone who's too serious about everything"", and I said ""then ask me why!?"" and I got a subject change.

I thought to myself of instead of being in home looking outside and thinking about past lost summers in home, I went to the beach alone.

I go to the beach sometimes with public transportation, which takes some time but bearable. Normaly I spend 3h30m for the round trip. But yesterday I spent 5 hours in the round trip, just to stay 2h30m in the beach. I became exausted, specially waiting for the bus 1 hour standing, with lots of people annoyed and complaining, not to mention the lack of respect we get from other people, that got the nerve of passing the queue, and let others not get inside the bus because it become full.

I went with transportation because it is much cheaper than go with taxi or Uber, or even having a car. In this times with high inflation it is very important to save in a poor income country.

Instead of enjoying the beach, I became exausted and depressed. I was thinking to myself that not even ""the beach experience"" I can enjoy. For me ""the beach experience"" implies being very comfortable, having good food and good fresh soda, eating an ice cream and most important having company.

Instead of ""the beach experience"", I don't have better things to do than go see the sea, write in a paper, look at others and think I would be better at home and avoid the exausting trip. After a couple of hours I start to get annoying and boring of being by myself.

Yesterday I start thinking and writing, maybe I don't have a choice of enjoying the good things in life, like going to the beach, go to a nice restaurant, eating italian ice-cream in seafront of a coffee shop, have a pleasant walk in the sunset.Maybe I'm here just to be at home, to look at the window, or being in the computer pretending to learn programming, or doing things not related to leisure.

Marital rape being called fake and just feminist agenda was the straw that broke the camel's back, i couldn't stand it, it was just too much to bear, everything and every topic turns into an argument and a clash of opinions.

It's fine to just rally behind an important figure but denying science just to protect that figure is a horrible thing, just because someone said dinosaurs are fake and you refuse to call them wrong doesn't change the fact that dinosaurs existed.

That being said, I have several lifelong friends who just disappeared the moment I moved away, and the lack of any meaningful friendships has me feeling really lonely right now.

The weird part to me is before I moved I didn't see my friends very often anyway because of covid, but we still played games online all the time. For some reason, me moving was reason enough to just be booted out of the rotation from every game, I see them playing all the time without me. After inviting myself a few times (among other efforts to keep in touch) and realizing nobody will ever initiate the invite to me, I realized nobody actually gives a shit about maintaining a friendship with me. 

I literally had to delete them off my friends list on Steam/EGS because it upsets me too much to be reminded every day how a simple change in proximity is excuse enough to drop someone from your life entirely. Nobody messages me, nobody checks in with me. Nobody made any effort to hang out with me when I visited my family back home, despite me reaching out.

The sad part to me is I made a few new friends last year at my new job that I hung out with a few times, and now that I moved on to a remote role everyone is quickly trickling out too. It really is human nature ""out of sight, out of mind"" but I thought I could have some form of a genuine friendship that doesn't rely on me being conveniently close-in-proximity.

Anyway, here I am, 30 years old, working remotely, across the country from just about everyone I know. I don't really get any opportunities to make new friends at this age being out of school and working remotely. I'm going to have to proactively do something if I ever want this to change.

Thanks for reading this if you did, I'm overall in a good place in life besides this, but sometimes it's easy to let stuff like this get to me.

5202,boopsandpoops,1656862471,1,"I stopped caring about things for some time. I've been on different medications for 15 years and have been to numerous therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists.
I was once in an outpatient program for two weeks of my life years back.

Without going into too much detail, I've been through more s*** than many people have and more than many people will deal with in this lifetime. Professionals have even said the same.
My anxiety and depression has gotten so bad now, No strategy or medication or physical activity has helped alleviate it.
I used to want someone to be a partner with me and love me for who I am unconditionally with flaws and all but I am married to the wrong person and we have a family now and too much encompassing it all that its not as easy as a break up, it would be a bloodbath of a divorce. Believe it or not, I married out of depression a long time ago.

This year I have finally accepted that I will probably never have the love I so desired because for some reason I just wasn't meant to have a partner that treated me with true human love and decency. I gave up on that idea and haven't been dwelling on it because the stress of so many other things in my life has taken that space over.

I also often think about how good it would feel to leave this life and daydream about ways to off myself. Mentally, I think about the mechanics of how to hang myself, and other types of suicide methods. 

For some reason I believe in reincarnation but I don't want to come back here if given the chance. I hate this world so much. I was once a religious person but came to the age of reason and realized how much it was bullshit and how it had this power over my life that in fact caused me to make permanent regrettable decisions that would have otherwise saved me from many years of headache.

I no longer care when someone tells me about anything sad in their life because 99.9% of their stuff is utter narcissistic 1st world problems and I just want to yell at them for how blind they are to the real problems people have.

So long story short, I'm lonely. I'm lonely in many ways, in many areas. It's not something I wanted, but I've just had to accept it and move on because it's not doing anything for me to think about it.
I would once sit in my feelings and every now and then I'd cry it out at night. But that didn't help me.",lonely,I stopped caring,2022-07-04 01:34:31

I no longer can hang out with certain people I used to hang out with because it turned out that they were fake, and one of my best friends still goes out with said fake people so I feel awkward talking to her or asking her to hang out since I don’t feel like I can really trust her. I try to join new groups etc but since they all know each other I’m then often left out, except for the occasional times when there’s a short conversation about something really basic. I don’t want to rely on constantly working and studying as a distraction and I actually want to do something enjoyable for once, yet I’d rather be alone in my own presence than ending up hanging out with toxic people or getting into a relationship because my friends have one. I consider myself really kind and loyal, always willing to help others out to the point that this has been taken advantage of in the past, so I don’t know why it’s so hard to make new, long time friends when people constantly say that they want to have more genuine friends.

5206,United-Reporter7757,1656860376,1,"Adulting life depressing for me.

1. career: I am not really passionate about my career but it pays the bills. Awhile back after working crappy jobs I decided to go back to school and chose practicality over interests. So here I am now. I think I dislike the idea of working. The job is tolerable just a means to an end for me. I think one thing that has killed me is work schedule. I have a crappy schedule like I work from 11pm to 730 AM on nights 4 or 5 days a week. I been doing that for 3 years and I think that has negatively effected my mental health.

Working that schedule I felt like a zombie. Drag myself to work everyday. Lacking good quality sleep. I remember not seeing the sun for months. I would go home from work at 7am sleep until 12pm, workout, play some video games. Take a quick nap again before work. That has been my life for past 3 years lol. However I recently got hired at a different company where I will work 7pm to 7am 3 days a week so I will have more days off. It is still nights but way more days off so hopefully that will improve my mental health more. Working days is too stressful for me. I like working nights. I just don't like all the other things that come with it.

2) Lack of relationship and friends: Getting older in my 30s feel like its way harder to meet people and make real friends other than work. Past 3 years working nights I only met couple of friends here and there and its mainly through work. We don't really hang out cause most of them got families. I have had some short term relationships those past 3 years but nothing real solid more like flings. My work schedule and nights one reason why it didn't work out. I mainly just talk to my old friends through video chat. I got 2 friends I really talk to that's about it.

3) lack of goals: Lacking ambition. For me its like what now. I make okay money little over 100k. I don't really have any debt. Only goal right now would be to find a wife, have a house, have a kid. That sort of deal.

I am pretty sure a lot of people in the same rut. Any advice? I know my dad worked from 4am to 3pm 5 days a week, never missed a day off for 30 plus years, and never complained. I don't know how he did it.",lonely,Adulting life has been so lonely and depressing.,2022-07-04 00:59:36

I feel like I work an interesting job, but the hours are crazy and I often do on average 50 hours a week sometimes more. Yet still I feel like I’m just a number at work and not really valued. 

I just feel like everything seems so superficial. Like I spend a lot of time with friends celebrating things like birthdays/weddings, but as much as I enjoy spending time with friends I don’t find anything fulfilling. I end up just wondering why everyone else seems so happy and what the point in all of this is. 

I feel very lonely and like if I was to disappear no one would notice. I can imagine they would care, but I don’t feel like my absence would be a massive loss to anyone. Growing old scares the shit out of me.

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety. 

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them.

But in search for community
When old friends were chosen poorly
And new ones stay in their own walls
The lonely man doesn’t feel lonely
He just feels disconnected 
When he cares for a life he doesn’t live
And indifferent to the past groups he’s joined
Is he running backwards?
This connection is coined
Sealed only by motive
Mozart didn’t fill those halls
Without each note forming
When a commune calls
It’ll be one friend calling

I think I'm kind of over being single. I want to find someone who will love me for me.. Someone who will show me that real love actually exists. The kind where we can sing and dance together in the middle of night. Laugh at stupid jokes while cooking with eachother. I want to fall head over heels for someone who can show me new things. Add to my life instead of just staying stuck where I'm at. I miss the days when I could cuddle and feel loved. Not so much a chore. I love the men I have in my life now but I've realized none of them really make me happy. I want someone to spin my head around with excitement and passion. I miss being able to say ""I love you"". And then ""I can't wait to see you"". I miss everything about missing someone but knowing you'll see them after work. 


I'm getting sad again. I'm falling into a darker state of mind. I'm searching for love in the wrong places. The 2 am ""what are you doing?"", ""come over."", ""let's party"" 's are getting old and boring. It's bringing me down. Bad. I so badly want someone to want me equally. I want someone to think about me and buy me flowers or bring home my favorite snack. I want someone… to love. 


I've been feeling alive when I'm drunk and not caring about anything. No responsibility, free feeling. I'm falling in love with that. But deep down I know it's not love. It's chaos and destruction. It's tearing me down. It's making me sad. But I can't quit. I can't say no. I have the fear that my soulmate will pass by.. thinking it's the 2 am drunk guy telling me to come over. But it's not. I do this stuff because I'm not happy with my home life anymore. I'm missing something so important. Love.

I want the lunch date at 1pm. And the movie. The walk on the beach while the kids run alongside us. I want the hand holding and the forehead kisses. I want the slow and tender kisses… And love making. Not just fucking. But also I want the excitement of our sexual life to be something we prioritize. I want the being able to communicate with each other and work through problems. I want the make up sex after we fight. I want all of it. Again.

I 23 F, am in college double majoring and working at my university, in a somewhat small Midwest town. Everyday I’m constantly surrounded by people, hardly ever alone. In classes, work, home, there is always people where I am yet I’m am so devastatingly lonely. The few friends I have are moving on with their lives by getting married, moving, and having kids, so I rarely get to talk to them or see them anymore. 

I feel like I’m a stuck, going nowhere while everyone around me is enjoying life to the fullest with their partners/friends. Don’t get me wrong, as an introvert I love my time alone. Lately, I’ve noticed that the feeling of being lonely has taken over everything for me. I have no one to talk to, to hang out with, to travel with, to do literally anything with. I’ve never had a problem with being alone till the past few months or so. 

As a college student in my early 20’s, I feel like now is the time that I should be enjoying life and making memories, yet all I do is work and come home and repeat. It’s so hard to meet friends or date where I live, with it being a small Midwest town everyone already knows everyone. I’ve been alone for so long now that I don’t know if anything will ever change.

I've always enjoyed my own company. always have. then again though, i am all i ever had. i can't recall one single time either one of my parents ever asking me how i was. how my day was. or school. our interactions was chores i had to do or more beers and liquor to hand them. not saying my childhood was bad. i was just... nobody special. my brothers were special. when my step sister would visit, she was special. i... was around. so everything i did was just me. i played alone, when i got older, i ate dinner alone. i had no supervision really. my teen years were great. ppl came to my house to party. i had friends because it was the party house. all of my friends (even the one person who i called my *best friend*) were pretty much superficial. nobody really bothered getting personal and deep with me, and i never volunteered to speak. my entire life has been built on superficial relationships. all of which I've made only because they were beneficial. nobody really knows the *real* me. the inside me. the person who has full conversations with characters in my head. the one who closes their eyes and can transport to another place. the imagination i have. the feeling i get from hearing certain songs. how my fingers tremble when i touch a tree because i can feel life. the one who talks to their Creator like he/she is there, beside me. never have i opened up. i like my cocoon. i love my company. i love knowing at the end of the day my only responsibility was/is making sure ME and ME ALONE has been fulfilled that day. i am responsible for only myself. which is why I've never cared if ppl liked me, or talked shit about me.

5252,screaminginside10,1656828664,1,It's so rare to vibe with someone and feel this spark they create inside of you. Sometimes you think you've come close to finding this pure warmth inside someone that resonates with you but most times it's only that they are mirroring your own glow. Sometimes we think we need others but we often attract those who need us. Truly we have much more to offer than we realize or give ourselves credit for. I have spoken to a various amount of people in my life and I've come to find that it's so so so rare to actually be deeply drawn and connected to someone unless there is a genuine feeling of safety and familiarity and understanding. This has been my experience at least. It's like there's just some types of people who come into our lives at the right moments and they somehow share a deeply profound role in our life experience. Its both beautiful and sad to see them come and go. I think what makes it so hard to give up is knowing how awesome it feels when the right pieces do fall into place effortlessly.

It started getting really bad last December and it has not let up since. Every day is hard and I can barely move without feeling out of breath and I must bring my rescue meds wherever I go. I've always been an introverted/shy person and never really got out much but now I want to. I just graduated college and I now have the time to actually have a life. But I can't. I can not even hold down a job right now I'm so sick.

The thing is though, is that right as these symptoms got severe I got my first ever boyfriend. And every time I saw him I felt like absolute shit and I even had an asthma attack while he was driving me home once. He seemed freaked out by it tbh and seemed bumped when he dropped me off. Well, after almost 4 months he dumped me in a kind of harsh way and I partially blame my sickness for him leaving. Who wants to date someone who is sick all the time? The end of that relationship absolutely crushed me. Not only was I crazy about him, but I also got a taste of what I was missing for the first time in my life. I was not expecting to be in a relationship anytime soon until we met and then he asked me to ne his gf and only months after he ended it after lying about his feelings. Now I long so badly to be in another relationship that it's eating away at me so badly, every day. 

I have been saying yes to every social thing I get invited to even though I feel like garbage. Parties, hanging out, I even went to a wedding for people I did not even know (my cousin knew them and I was her friend's plus 1). I even had a guy ask for my number once but the second I told him I don't casually date, he stopped talking to me. Every time I go out I have an asthma attack. My one older cousin is like,""Go out! You should be having fun!"" I wish I could and when I do my breathing is so bad I can't laugh, cry, or move without it flaring up.

Basically,  I want to go out and meet new people to fill the void and hurt from my last relationship but my asthma is keeping me isolated and sad. That relationship also fucked with myself confidence so bad, I'll never date anyone who was attractive as he was again. He was also really nice (or iI thought he was???) and I liked his personality. He was a 10 and I'm like, a 7??? (Maybe I'm just shallow) I can not fight this insane longing that I have for him. I'll never see him again. He's all I can think about.

3. Practice talking with as many people as I can find.

5280,Tough_Representative,1656817777,1,"Hi. So yeah, here's some background. I've always been rather shy and timid and have had trouble making friends. Never had a GF or went on a date, never went to prom, no parties with friends. I don't even have a high school yearbook photo because I didn't care enough. I've also moved a couple of times as a kid forcing me to start all over again which was just double whammy. 

Now being 24 years old, I must say I have been slowly but surely coming out of my shell over the years and have been making progress in terms of loving who I am and interacting with people better on a social level in large part because my job forces me to do so. I've been getting bolder in conversations and dressing sharper as well due to the confidence boost and feel great.

A new change I've made now is simply starting to wear my glasses. I've had these prescription glasses since freshman year of high school but I've never got into the habit of wearing them in part due because I was self-conscious about how the glasses would make me look and on top of already being the quiet kid, I felt like I'd really then be a walking stereotype.  So I didn't wear them. But now that I'm getting used to them, the world never seemed so clear and I dig the way I look in them too. 

As I think back to me being that scared lonely boy in high school, there is one instance that I'll NEVER forget that has stuck with me over the years. I was late to lunch one day in the beginning of the school year. New town, new school. Didn't know anybody. Was absolutely terrified. I sat at the nearest table all alone and 4-5 tables away from me, there was a group of upperclassesmen who were looking at me. They then started to comment on me, laughing and mocking me at the fact that I was alone, watching my every move as I pretended not to hear them or that I wasn't bothered. That HURT. I can't even begin to describe how humiliated I felt. There were other instances but this was the worst.

I've moved on since then but I honestly still tear up thinking back to that moment and reliving it. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it's made me stronger overall as a person and would absolutely NOT tolerate that kind of nonsense today. I wish I could go back in time and have done things differently and talk to myself and give advice. I can't do that. All I can do is continue to self improve and look forward to the future and see where life takes me. But the thing I'm most proud of right now is that I can actually say I'm happy to be me.",lonely,I've been pretty much lonely all my life and I have been doing some self-reflection lately and want to get some things off my chest and talk to somebody.

5285,AdventurousEmu3702,1656816287,1,"Hello! I'm a 27 almost 28 year old guy from the USA (it doesn't matter where you're from by the way, message me even if you live on the moon!) and i want to make some best friends since being lonely stinks. I have like two or three people that i actively talk to haha and they are my parents/family members, Im almost 28 years old and I don’t really have any friends outside of my parents/family, I live with my parents. Im quite shy and introverted and have always struggled to make friends. I am far too aware that the majority of the people that I have cared about in the past have had little regard for my feelings. I have a awesome family that loves me haha but I really want some friends that aren’t my family. I just really want to make some genuine connections and have a best friends to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m very talkative! I love talking about anything at all, unless it's really weird stuff then maybe perhaps not. I love poetry, I do poetry as a hobby but thanks to depression/anxiety I have (in the past) lost all my motivation to write poems, so finishing a single poem without getting impatient and deleting it prematurely takes a lot of effort sometimes. I can still try writing you a silly funny poem tho if you want. For example i'll write you a funny poem that will make you laugh, for your birthday. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Focusing on self growth has been huge for me recently so if you’re on a similar journey I would love to hear from you. Part of this process has meant I’ve taken up learning a few musical instruments and practicing meditating.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I need music recommendations so we can totally make awesome playlists for each other. I love to draw (it’s a newish hobby and I’m not great at it), maybe I can draw a goofy picture of you. Or maybe I’ll make a statue of you on Minecraft! Lol. :) :)

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoy cooking, baking, cake decorating and trying new recipes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of interests, a few unique ones but i'll leave them for you to discover, meanwhile i'll just list the common ones here. I love video games, I usually just play Nintendo stuff but sometimes I play some other games too. I love Don't Starve Together, i've been playing some The Sims Games recently. I also love Fallout and several other games! I love watching stuff, from movies to shows to whatever on Reddit haha ahhh so much to list. My favorite movies are Ponyo, Your Name, and Cast Away. My favorite animes are Parasyte, Code Geass, Fruits Basket, DeathNote. My favorite shows are The Good Place, Black Mirror and Malcolm In The Middle. My favorite color is green! There's a funny story behind that, if you wanna know, just ask me. My favorite music genres are indie and k pop haha but I listen to all genres. I love music so much!

&amp;#x200B;

I love helping people, i love supporting people emotionally and I'd do anything that im capable of to emotionally support/help someone out if im able. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess this part is going to get sad and i understand that a lot of people don't like that, so you can just skip this section if you want. I suffer from a lot of mental issues, for example pretty intense anxiety/depression that super messes with me  a lot. It's very hard to even go outside sometimes, I suffer from OCD, and i absolutely hate when people say that OCD = just being “really clean and tidy”. It's way more than that. I know this is gonna sound cliche but I just feel like a lot of people don't understand me or mentalillness at all sometimes. I have always felt somewhat like an alien and i've always been a outcast kinda. Even when surrounded by other outcasts! If you suffer from any issues at all, i'll try my best to help you out. Chances are i know how it feels. Im not looking for you to fix all of my issues but :) im looking for a supportive friend that is kind.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that's enough about me! Now i'll talk a bit about my ideal friend. I'd want to be best friends with somebody(s). I've always been just another ""choice"" for everyone, they always have their own best friends and i'm always just ""the dude they hang out with when nobody else is around"". I want to feel cared for, i want people to support me emotionally and check up on me if they see that i feel down. I want to focus on one (max, Three) person(s) and i'd like it if you focused on me too. The only requirement for you to message me is: be in the 21-35 age range. :) Your gender doesn’t matter to me, I will be friends with you regardless of your gender!

Thank you for reading!",lonely,Hello. I dont have any friends and im almost 28 years old. Im a American guy that is a fanatic over anime and nature!

When I moved to the new school, I hung out with 2 other kids that had just moved to the school as well. Initially we were friends and then we formed a group with other kids and became a friend circle. These 2 kids were a bit 'alpha' and always wanted to prove themselves. I on the other hand was a bit soft and shy and so wasn't very confident to begin with. These guys then started picking on me, belittling me, making me feel small in front of others. They'd have a party and just not invite me from the friend group. They'd take my school bag and throw it on top of the school roof. One of these guys just out of nowhere kicked me really hard in the balls. The other guy got invited to a family event and he belittled me in front of my cousins - so they could all see what a loser I was. They would verbally put me down on an almost daily basis. And this gave them more confidence and they became even more popular and people wanted to become their friends. I also know these 2 guys were having a tough time at home - but they had no right to take it out on me. They were also both really good looking, very rich and so had plenty of girls wanting to become their gfs. They would make fun of the way I looked. I was so low in confidence that even after school for approx 6 I couldn't speak to strangers without thinking they will make fun of me and judge me negatively - so I just couldn't speak to random people.

Fast forward 12 years. I'm a bit better now and am more confident - but still shy and insecure. I was depressed because of bullying for a very long time - it derailed my career. I now have an ok job but nowhere near where I thought I'd be. I don't have many friends. I don't have a gf. My bullies on the other hand - amazing careers. That confidence from school allowed them to progress far in life. They makes tonnes of money. Have a very large social circle. Constantly have pretty gfs. These girls all just see their confidence and social status. They don't see how much of a bully these guys were and how much they picked on and made fun of vulnerable people. Or they don't care. 

They probably don't even think of me. It's possible they've even forgotten what they did to me. They turned me from a loving, innocent boy to an insecure man. I hate that they are successful and that I am struggling. I hate that no one really cares that these guys bullied me a lot.

I have really been struggling with the loneliness.

As soon as I open my eyes, my brain greets me with a “nobody loves you”. Or other times, I get woken up to the sound of a voice saying “nobody loves you”. Then I start to cry and try to avoid an anxiety attack. I battle myself for composure, trying to find some sort of rationality.

The mental exhaustion is real. 

I’ve tried reaching out to form online friendships but they seem to lead no where.
I get tired of putting effort into my replies to be told I’m boring, be ghosted or asked of things I can’t give. Was hoping maybe finding a connection would help but feel like it’s just made me realize I am meant to be alone.

“Nobody loves you”

I think it also stems from my childhood. Whenever someone told me “love you” it was a lie. Behind those words there was abuse. 

My family wasn’t great about emotional support. My feelings and experiences would be invalidated. Then again, I’m the black sheep of the family. For years reminded how I destroyed my mother’s future. Grew up feeling unwanted and like I didn’t belong.

A bio father that only reaches out to boast about our similar appearances and ask how my mother is doing.

“Nobody loves you”

My last relationship was full of love bombing. When I was upset or going through depressive epsiodes I was loved. When I was succeeding or asking for support, I was ignored. In public I was placed on a pedestal and talked about, behind closed doors I was criticized.

It’s taken a huge toll on my mental health for the last two years, and it finally boiled to the point of her hitting me, then calling the cops on me for dv. I’m facing 2nd degree assault and 3rd degree assault, which holds up to 6 years in prison. There is a lack of evidence to persecute the 2nd degree assault. The 3rd degree assault is written where if you accident hurt someone your still guilty. (I threw an empty water bottle and it bounced off a wall and hit her)
I am still in love with her for some reason. For some odd reason I can’t detach myself from wanting her in my life as my partner. We’re going through this divorce and she is toying with me telling me she wants me in her life, but then goes on reminding me about how I’m the biggest piece of shit she’s ever met. I can’t ever seem to get a positive response from her, but here a last I still got some stupid reason love her. 

It may be that we have a child and have another on the way, or that I go back to my childhood trauma because it’s the only love I know, but I can’t shake it. I totally wish I could. 

I feel completely alone right now. No seeing my family, and that results in me isolating and not seeing my friends.

Stuff happened, and she lost the ability to show grace and forgive. She turned bitter toward me and the rest of the family. I tried to hold our family together, despite her vitriol and sometimes worse.   


In the winter, she said she'd leave me to raise our children by myself. A couple weeks later, she was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that required removal. I thought that maybe this is what caused all the turmoil. I thought this could almost be her Get Out of Jail Free Card...her pass for all the nastiness. She's endured a slow recovery, but managed to be a fighter and beautiful in the process. However, the past couple days...almost like a storm approaching...there were clues that she was returning to her pretumor condition. Yesterday, she exploded at our daughter calling her a f'ing b for having her kindle in her room at bedtime, when she should've been sleeping. Before I got home, she threatened to take multiple Xanax pills in front of our children. It's fine to discipline, but never denigrate. She doesn't get it. She thinks weak for choosing a different way to mentor our children.  
This morning, she said I treat HER like s\*\*t. I fear I will never be appreciated, because in her twisted mind, she's the victim. I'm middle aged, without financial stability because of bills even before her condition, and I want something better.

On one hand im pretty intelligent when it comes to problem solving or analyzing situations and behaviours. On the other, I have a hard time with memorizing stuff and I am lost as to how to behave with others.

I have a good amount of friends cos im a kind dude, I find it really hard to keep track of those who are far away so they think ive forgotten them.

Never had a relationship (20M) because my overthinking generally stops me in my steps even though I do have a good amount of options. So I just end up alone because i shoot myself in the food.

Being with people drains me so much because I see and notice every small behaviours and attitudes from everyone around me and always try to act on them accordingly.
What comes from this after is that people that don't know me see me as either grumpy/mean and pretentious, because I don't know how to act with people that are other than friends (e.g. collegues or crushes, even family members that i don't see often)

Finding a career for me is a maze because if there is no deeper purpose and meaning to either me or others in the work I do, I end up coming home unhappy and unfullfilled. 
I tried biology, but the system in france values memorization and learning off by heart rather than problem solving and practical application (in other words i shred in group and solo projects with a practical application and a context but I am very mediocre in spitting out the 80 page course Im asked to learn off by heart). So my diploma isn't worth much because my grades aren't that high ( im in the top 30% relative to the other students)

5339,RavingAnarchy,1656794366,1,"This is not a healthy post, I'm not healthy.

I need help.

I am slowly going crazy, why? The love of my life left me 2 and a half months ago, we agreed to end the relationship and i agreed to let her go. Because we were both too far apart from each other to make things work for longer than the year we were together. But my heart doesn't feel that way, i still love her, everything, the whole shebang. And letting her go while i still love her doesn't work.

Worst part, she's with someone else now. My mind is broken, my heart is broken even though she didn't do this to me, it wasn't her intention, what's worse is that i can't hate her for it, i don't feel angry, i understand why she went and found somebody else, now she's feeling happy. And here i am in a coma. I have gone through the worst thoughts possible, my heart has broken in all the most shameful and degrading ways possible (Queue having a nightmare about her getting fucked by someone else), I feel like I'm scum.


I've been on antidepressants for weeks, going to a psychologist and everything, and I can't stop breaking down, nothing makes me happy, nothing helps me get out of my own negativity, I've got suicidal thoughts every so often when I'm at my lowest points, i can't get over this hurdle. My mind was too young I'm just 20 years old, never experienced love before. I feel like an incel, like I'm the lowest human there is, i don't feel like i deserve anything. I don't want anything, I hate myself and brought myself down on my own. Not her bringing me down, but myself.

And I'm going insane, i can't grip my own persona, i can't find him. All that happens is that i close my eyes and feel pain, excruciating pain. I twist around my bed and want to rip my own eyes out in anger, and after that I just want to pass away. Why can't I die and come back 10 years later when this is through.

My health is decaying as well, I've been sick for days now. My depression is pretty much breaking down every single piece of my being and I've questioned everything in my life up to this point. I've had one moment of clarity where i decided i wasn't gonna feel bad about this anymore, where I'd try to be happy and do what i feel and what i want. But then it came, the thought, the cursed love I have within me. That I want her back, I hadn't done anything of what i wanted to do with her, I didn't even get to hug her, comfort her in person, kiss her, love her. I'm in Argentina, she's in Europe.

She's so far away from me, and all I want to do is close the distance, go to her and try getting her back for all my heart screams for is doing that. But then reality comes back, she's loving someone else, my chance is lost, I am lost. And here I am with my broken reality, with the single love i had breaking me in more pieces than i can put back together. Everything hurts, living here on this country hurts, knowing another man is doing everything my heart yearned to do with her hurts, feeling like i still love her even through all this pain hurts.

I'm crying while writing this, on the edge of puking and coughing out my throat because I'm sick. I didn't write to her a single thing about this, she's living life and i want her to be happy because i love her, but I am in the most disgusting place of my life, and when I'm feeling clearheaded and happy and motivated to do something, all i want to do is do my homework, get a job, save up and move to Europe to try getting her back someday if she's single again. I'm crippled, i can't let go, time isn't helping.

I'm going mad, and I'll never come back to the happiness i had before at this pace if I don't do something about it, so here's the most honest and brutally straight up post i could ever write, because I need help. I'm seeking help. For myself and for my future.

Big deal, people lose their love all the time, everybody gets a heartbreak, get over it you idiot. That's what I tell myself, but i can't. I'm going insane, I'm going insane, IM GOING INSANE.

I don't want this to keep going, i want this nightmare to end. I want to move on, or I want to feel happy and try living life to meet her again and love her once more. But right now all I'm doing is going through torment.",lonely,I'm going insane,2022-07-03 06:39:26

To the extent where getting him to go out and do anything ever was a never ending beg. I have no problem with games or gaming this isn't a gaming hate post. But he showed 0 interest in me, and for some reason I can't explain, I never wanted anyone else's attention. I've had a pretty rough life and my parents moved endlessly, and I made many sacrifices at a very young age to be close to him, lived in hostels, lived with shitty family members. Etc. When I turned 18 and finished school, my parents moved out of tye country, to a third world country where my brother, 14 , would have a hard time adapting. I offered to take care of my brother, my parents were sending money so I was privileged in that way. I had a super hard time renting a place to live as I had no job or car. My boyfriend, at that time of 6 years, reluctantly agreed that we could move in together, to a big 3 bedroom house where I paid tye rent. However he refused to let me decorate anything, or have any of my things,  since I had forced him into this arrangement so I accepted it. Throughout these years I accepted it, I was a begger,  even if I had a massive financial upper hand. He gamed, never went on any dates with me, watched any shows with me, refused to eat any food I made. Why was I with him? He's a jolly spirit, we laugh together. He's positive and everything my fathers not. But he over and over showed me he has no regard for me in a romantic way and I never.... .. saw ut for what it was. I always thought "" as soon as were not in an odd position anymore ' "" as soon as I get more attractive "" "" as soon as THIS game phase passes, as soon as he works on his own self esteem issues. "" in the last 6 months someone bought the apartment we rented and by this time my mom had moved back to our count3y. I went to live with her, and he went yo his parents very far away. I didn't like this because my mom is super welcoming and has plenty of apace for us and she was in the city we called home. He went to his parents far away. I should've seen it at this point too, when he has the choice, he chooses not to be with me. I then called him up with a plan for our lives, maybe a tad silly, but I didn't like being apart and I decided to call him and tell him we can live like students for a little while, which we are, I did some law school and he has never worked, his parents have money, but at this point didn't want to help us with housing anymore. As he's a grown 24 year old man. Anyway, I said we could work for his sister as a real estate duo, and make a life for ourselves independent from our parents. He had no regard for any plans like this. He just wanted to wait untill his parents got bonus so he could rent a place again. I decided that I didn't like the trajectory of my life and got a foreign job, he wasn't against the idea at all. At first I was happy, I had always liked that he wasn't controlling, but he just doesn't care what I do and I never saw that. He didn't fight against me going at all. Now I've spent some time away, I have a gr3at job, great apartment, I'm finally independent after all these years clawing towards it. And I'm finally seeing things for what they are. Seeing how I was treated, but I had to ignore cause my life was dependant on him and "" atleast he's not violent "" . 

But I want someone to be inlove with me, want to spend time on the couch with me, want to be by my side, car2 about what I like,  let me listen to my music sometimes, like the meals I cook. I wana love. It's all I ever wanted. And after 10 years of this, I'm now in a city in a third world country where a social life is going to be challenging. I don't speak the language, I don't know howbto get around. The only bright light in my intense loneliness, is visiting home in 6 months. But I'm starting to realize he actually hates me. He moved in today, in a new place,  he sent some pics but he doesn't call me, doesn't say he wishes I was there. And just doesn't have an issue with his gf of 10 years being alone in a third world country. He did nothing to prevent this. It sounds very stupid but I'm realizing now, true love is wanting to be WITH that person, doesn't matter what you're doing. And he will never ever give me, or any other person, taht. I just want to love and be loved. He doesn't give me ant aggravated reason to leave him, but he just doesn't... like me.. and everyone sees it and everyone has tried warning me in subtle reasons. But he's the only love I've ever known. He's truly a jolly person. But we both deserve to actually be inlove, and get giddy and WANA BE AROUND someone.

&amp;#x200B;

When was the last time a male friend really lent you his ears and shoulders about anything at all?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't remember and I've grown tired of that. We are taught not to seek any help with our difficulties, let alone seeking help from **another guy**. And why is that? Because it means being *weak*. It means being a *p-sy*. It means being *gay (nothing wrong with being gay, by the way if you are)*. You name it. So we have to ""man up"". For what? How is this helpful? Is there something wrong with being any of those things? Why do we keep telling ourselves that then?

&amp;#x200B;

It's so miserable to keep living like this, pretending everything's fine when it's not. I've been reading this some places on here for a couple days now and it's striking how men, including me, are completely lost and lonely searching for someone to connect with. I want this to end for every one of us. Can we all be less automatic and really look after our brothers? How can we do that? How can we start more intimate, down-to-Earth, non-judgmental conversations between guys?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear from you, either here or over messages. I have seen some jerks and it just feels like a wake-up call to me. I want to be a better man with the support of other men, which is something I've long lost!

&amp;#x200B;

5376,Own-Fig-9874,1656780191,1,"I am well aware enough of the fact that the problem was on me. But I feel like I just need an outlet to release these complicated emotions. I’ve been jobless for more than three years. And the whole job seeking process really took a toll on my health physically and mentally. I have been trying to avoid hanging out with a good friend, who happens to be also the only one that I have, but in a passive way. Like I‘ve been secretly avoiding those get-togathers that we had on a regeular, which means I wouldn’t initiate the interaction. Because I feel like I am in a really bad place right now energy wise. I am just simply not in the right place to be around her too much at this point of my life. She has achieved so much and I am still living with my father. I feel that we are not equal. But it’s anything but personal, it’s not about her at all, it’s me being self-conscious. But when she invites me to hang out I also find that I don’t want to turn it down. I still want to seem normal. 

And this evening we went to play squash and had dinner afterward. On the way home we ran into an Aesop boutique, the fancy hair care/skin care/fragrance brand which we both really love. She wanted to stop by it and buy some body wash. I was glad about this spontaneous stopover. But as the staffer patiently and kindly serving my friend, the joy out of the love of the brand and the excitement of a possible nice ‘’plus one’’ shopping experience gradually faded. Instead I started feeling uncomfortable and panicking despite the deliciously upscale aromatic profile the staffer was gushing about. My brain started going crazy and wild, thinking every parts of my body must now be shouting loser. The entire universe was yelling at me “You can’t afford this. You are asking your father for money every month and you are freaking 29 years old. Cedar? Geranium? Vetiver? That’s funny. How about incompetency and patheticness? Please, look at yourself now, can you embarrass yourself more?” In the midst of all this, I still wanted to appear cool and casual. The indifference would only show that I was so vulnerable and just a baby, which was annoying. Particularly in this setting, I didn’t want to make my friend feel like she couldn’t be who she is just because I was struggling. And I also didn’t want to be rude to the staff’s hospitality. So I stood beside my friend and listened their exchange for most of the time.

I know it was ALL IN MY HEAD. I know I made everything about me and everything I just said was hilarious. It wasn’t really the end of the world. I still got a place to live and wasn’t skipping any meals(even though I wasn’t paying for anything). But it felt so real. After we parted ways, all I was telling myself was to distract myself from all this. But I simply couldn’t. If I didn’t let them out, I knew I would absolutely be all night up for this tossing and turning. I knew somehow I need to do something. Just when I anxiously swiping right and left on my phone screen, I found this app I had downloaded some days earlier for the sake of learning real colloquial English. The idea of expressing my feeling and making it online popped into my head. And here I was typing first on my phone and now on my computer. Guilty as charged, I admit I am pity seeking. But anyway I feel so much better now. And for that I say thank you. Lastly, I really hope whoever is reading this could give me feedback on my English phrasing in terms of grammar, expression, anything. Thanks again.

i was talking to this guy for a month or so and we had a very deep conversation, i was vulnerable which i have a strict rule against. and i got the ick. he said he cared about me and i felt physically ill. i don’t like it when people care about me or love. i don’t know if it’s because i think i don’t deserve it or a trauma response or whatever. i have such a wall around me all the time. even with family. i voluntarily seclude myself from affection and love and care because i’m so immensely scared of being hurt. i’ve been hurt so much. and i don’t want to be a victim. but fuck, im hurting. i feel lonely. i like doing drugs because i feel love for people and i accept love for myself. and it’s the only time i do.

5384,Imaginary-Can-7853,1656776072,1,"A self therapy post I suppose, but would love to hear any thoughts from any people in a similar position or who were in a similar position. Here's the summary.

51 years old. Divorced about 8 years ago. Have two good kids age 15 and 11. 50% Custody. Have spent the last 8 years as a single dad and yes it's been challenging in many ways.

I hate my job. Hate it. It's a professional job where I make almost 6 figures. I'm financially just fine but i'll have to work a few more years before retiring. Then what? I have nobody. No friends and my children will be off and running at that point. Being over 50 and married you find yourself looking at the entire world as being heavily involved with their wife, family, etc. I'm such an outlier.  

Had alot of friends in my youth and in college. Then I started moving around. Lost touch with all of them(no cell phones back then!) and they're in different states. I have a new job now for about 2 years and I work remote. All my co-workers are in different states. I don't go to church or anything. I mean.....I'm a hermit pretty much. Have one brother in a different state.....long story. We don't talk.  Parents are dead. No aunts and uncles living. A couple cousins in a different state that I haven't seen in 2 decades. Had a few friends from work 5-10 years back. Two moved to different states because the job sucked so bad. One of them retired.....I still talk to him every 3 months or so but he's older and something going on where he doesn't want to do much anymore.  Honestly, most people my age have good lives with spouses, family, or a career they're passionate about. I have NONE of that except my two children, which I adore and I think are pretty well adjusted. They do good in school, have friends, play sports, etc. My kids, at some point if not already, are going to look at me as quite a loser. Live alone in a tiny house. No friends. Never do anything, etc.

I don't get stimulated by anything anymore. I see people doing the most mundane things and they appear excited and happy. Not me. I have nothing to look forward to really. Retirement? ha. What am I gonna do? and with who?

Meeting a girlfriend? Again....I'm a decent looking in shape guy. But who the hell would want to date someone with ZERO Friends and ZERO family. I mean i feel like the giant red flag is waving over my head for everyone to see. And see it they will.....on the first date. ""Do you have any friends?"" no. ""What do you do for fun?""  Nothing really. Play with my kids and try to be a good parent to them.

How did it get to this point? Hard to explain. It's a totality of decisions, bad luck, and life just happening. Also i'm not the type of person who likes hanging out with just anybody. Obviously at this age it's hard to find single friends. Not interested in hanging out with married couples so there's almost zero opportunity to make a decent friend at this age.

Depressing huh?

I am super lonely. All my siblings have their partners and I’m the only single one. I don’t get noticed, men barely look at me much less approach me. I’m kinna tall and chunky (5”9 98kg) so maybe that’s why. And I don’t have a great body shape (saggy boobs, belly and no bum). Plus with my illnesses, what guy is going to want to enter a relationship with me? Knowing that they’ll have to help me for the rest of my life? (Help me with food, cleaning, financially). I just don’t see it happening. I don’t use dating apps cos I can’t sell myself, I’m not a good product and I don’t want to lie. 
I just don’t see the point in me being here. I literally cannot live by myself, I have to always ask for help. But eventually I won’t have my younger siblings around me daily or my parents (they’re divorcing and selling the house) so what do I do? The only option I can think of is killing myself. I don’t want to be here by myself. I don’t have many close friendships or people that live local to me. I don’t drive anymore so I can’t travel very often cos of the pain. So I’m isolated from people. I don’t meet new people or socialise often. I just want someone who cares about me. Someone who prioritises me, someone who treats me like a woman.

IM on ur side and ur on mine.
I'm crying.
I canr stop crying.
It's tearing my heart out from the inside.
You're snoring.
You've found peace in this.
You've never missed a night of sleep no matter the pain you've caused.
The worst part is I'd forgive you anyways. Everytime. To this day I'd forgive you.. 💔 
Today is Friday night 2 39 am. Technically Saturday. You stayed over because I didn't feel well. On Monday we are going to the courthouse to sign the papers that will separate us forever. (Or so I thought)

This was never what I wanted. The nights when I went to bed crying because I knew something was happening. When I woke up in the morning to you already outside (probably on a call with with her ) I didn't care. 
I trusted you. Or I at least WANTED to believe you..believe I was the one you wanted , believe I was enough. 
We never had a true relationship. I laid in bed all day and night at times because I was so stressed and depressed from working my ass off to make sure u didn't have to feel pressure. To make us both happy I thought.

But u left every chance u got. 
Was i not good enough? 
Was I not sexy enough?
Was I just like ex where I didn't sleep with you  enough. . .

There's no question in my mind that we were not right for eachother, but I would have changed myself to fit you. To be right for you and that's the problem. 
I should never have thought that was an option.

You're snoring right now, the lava lamp is giving u a pinkish aura. Ur hair is curling around the light. You're using the  blanket that we've had since the first apartment. 

I hope I never forget the last moments I spent with you... as my husband...

I hope I can keep myself from falling apart in the courthouse..
I'm a mess....
I keep crying.

Fuck.
It's so hard.
It hurts so badly.
Devastating.

I still see the look on your eyes when u lie to me.
You're always going to lie to me.
You lied to me earlier tonight
 And I saw the lie in ur eyes.
Like I usually do..
I recognize it now.
The guilt in ur eyes and face.

There's nothing to be guilty for my love.
It's over now. 💔 

Im broken.
My spirit is broken.
My heart is broken.
I'm a shell.
All I feel is pain.
I'm miserable 
I can't even breath.
It hurts  
Ans you're laying next to me, snoring.
Peaceful
You've always been peaceful 

I know you're going to miss me one day.
And its going to be too late.
And im going to find a man who loves me and makes me feel valued and validated.
And you're going to reach out and see my happiness and know you made the right decision to leave and stay gone.

The best thing you have ever done for me was to not come back when I begged you to.
I will always love you. You will always be my husband.  Idk if I'll ever have another one..but you will always be him. In my heart.

Unique approaches are nice, asking how you are over and over again really doesn't do it for me. I need conversations and connections, shared thoughts, feelings, insight, and most importantly matching my effort and questions and engagement.

People say they want to get to know someone but then get discouraged by questions and the process. I can't be into someone if they're just presenting or pretending to be someone I want, the truth comes out sooner or later.

I like jokes, I'm full of sarcasm, lack bullshit, have emotions and feelings, know who I am and what I want, but don't know if my match is out there, at least not locally. I prefer to find someone local, but online would work if the vibe, flow, and conversation is a breeze.

I love food, binge watching shows, sports, technology, keeping current in events and news. Not big on politics.

I work fulltime, not a big partier or social event attendee, but I enjoy BBQs, dinners, attending certain events ... for the food and weed, not usually the conversation but hey, you never know unless you go right?

Very occasional drinker, but love my weed and dabs.

It would have been our 5 year anniversary of dating. We had a normal conversation just talking about where we were in our lives, and in that moment I realized I haven't moved on from her what so ever. She was my first and only girlfriend. She was my whole world for 3 years. However, we had lots of ups and downs. Lots of arguments about stupid higschool stuff. Long story short we broke up because of covid and we couldn't ever see each other which caused more fights. She was very insecure and controlling during the relationship.

But tonight I (very stupidity) went through snapchat and re-read damn near our whole history as boyfriend and girlfriend. It was heart breaking looking at all the good we had together... and realizing how easily the bad could have been fixed. I realize that I'm young and I have lots of life to live but I think I'm still in love with her and don't know what to do about it.

I can't really try to fix anything with her because she has a boyfriend now and I've recently joined the military, so I moved to the other side of the country. I haven't had any real companionships with anyone sinse we broke up and feel extremely lonely all the time. I fear that I'm never going to get over her and die alone. It's very irrational, I know.

5408,Ok-Cheesecake-9437,1656753712,1,"Hey y’all, first time posting here. For some background, I (19F) have done online school since 4th grade. It was largely an isolating and lonely experience, with a few short friendships sprinkled in. However, each ended with the person completely ghosting me for seemingly no reason. This has admittedly given me abandonment issues. 

However, my loneliness was put on hold when I was able to do an irl college program with 10 other students. I quickly became friends with who I’ll call A(), and we spent the entire summer last year having sleepovers, going on vacations together, and playing video games. She has always been slow to reply to me, but I’m slow sometimes too so I accepted it as a relatively harmless flaw. Plus, irl A never gave any indication that she didn’t like me, and mutual friends have said she takes a long time to reply to them too. We both graduated in May, and we literally talked one on one for hours after my grad party about how much we wanted to hang out this summer again, and she said I’m one of the only people she feels like she truly connects with. Afterwards we sent a few memes back and forth, and a few days later I tried to make plans for a vacation to Disneyland, because she always talked about how much she wanted to go. Radio silence. Eventually I had to press her about it because me and my family needed to buy tickets. She curtly said that she couldn’t go because she was busy around the time of the trip. I reassured her that it was totally fine, and tried to make other plans to go to the mall. Once again silence, and she didn’t even respond after the day I suggested we go had passed. I tried to send a meme to show there were no hard feelings, and once again, nada. It’s been two weeks now. I know she has some tough stuff going on with a sick family member, but I only know because her dad has mentioned it. As someone with a chronic illness myself, I understand that the pain can make us isolate ourselves. Still, I wish she would just take a second to let me know what’s up. 

Today I tried to reach out and make a final effort to reconnect and let her know I’m here if she needs me, but I’m just heartbroken. I feel just as alone as I did when I started online school. What should I do? If she abandons me, how do I find new people? How can I feel secure in my friendships?

i have somewhat diagnosed adhd (weird story, i love mental healthcare) and i get obsessive interests for various periods of time. i started stranger things after seeing some stuff about eddie munson’s character. i’m only on season 3, but i got the spoiler that eddie dies and i’m really fucking torn up about it. that sounds really dumb, but i don’t think it’s normal to have the kind of reaction im having to this- the death of a character i haven’t even seen properly. finding out is genuinely making me feel so hopeless. like so nauseous i can’t eat. maybe it’s just the topping on a pile of things wrong and that’s why it’s hitting so hard, but i feel so much genuine grief and sadness.

i feel gross. i don’t even know what to do with myself. my life is so boring. all i’ve done all summer is work, my friendships have become so stunted the only time i did manage to hang out with someone it was so awkward. i just feel like im rotting away at home. i use media to cope and had been using stranger things as my big source of happiness- it’s like the only thing really making me happy has been ripped from me and im just. fucking awful.

So we we’re talking for like 2 days and getting to know each other. She seemed super nice and friendly and I woke up this morning and got a message from her. She asked me if I had Snapchat and I relied “yes”. But that’s when I noticed something strange. It showed up as if I sent myself a message and I was confused. It said only one person was in the group. So I clicked on her profile and she deleted her account. That made me so angry because I thought she wanted to be my friend. She just used me like my last friend did. I’m trying to talk to some other people on Reddit and so far they haven’t messaged back. I just want an actual friend to chat with and laugh with.

I’ve had a rough couple of years, especially this last year. Adjusting to adulthood after college has been difficult. I’ve spent more time alone in the last 1-1.5 years than probably all my prior years combined. I was okay with it at first. I am an only child so being alone isn’t completely out of the ordinary for me. But the last years have hit me like a train. Between most friends getting in serious relationships, married, or having babies, I feel completely left behind. I don’t have too many friends in the city I moved to, and I’ve fallen out of touch with most of my college friends. I haven’t been on a date since last year, so I’ve been alone in a dating context for a little while, which also upsets me. I wish it didn’t. I know a relationship isn’t the key to happiness, but I feel like my heartbreaks ever time I see a happy couple in public. I hate dating, hook up culture, and I would give anything to have a healthy and loving relationship with someone I felt safe with. I know I shouldn’t put romantic relationships on a pedestal like that, but I feel so intrinsically pulled to be with someone. I just feel like that’s natural? I miss and crave intimacy with someone so much and every day I just feel like I ache to be held by someone again. It feels like it’s been so long since I’ve kissed someone. And it’s turned me bitter. I struggle so much to be happy for others. I’m doing as much as I can to try to better myself. I’m going to therapy to work on myself, trying to make career moves, and volunteer on the weekends I don’t have alot going on. But I just feel so empty still the inside. None of it replaces intimacy from a significant other or a strong social circle. I’m tired of grocery shopping alone, eating alone, going to the park alone, sleeping alone. But most advice towards single women my age is to embrace independence and “live your best life.” To work on your career. And I’m trying to ..I feel like I’m an ambitious person. But that also isn’t giving me satisfaction right now.But I don’t know how much more I can embrace it. I pretty much do everything for myself, I cook and take care of myself and some weekends I spend Friday to Monday alone. Making friends as an adult is just so hard. I just so emotionally tired and broken. I wish I was wasn’t myself.  I want to see the good in this chapter and not waste my time, but I’ve been so lonely and depressed for what feels like so long. I miss feeling carefree and having fun, and I crave being able to love someone so badly. I’m tired of feeling like a miserable shell of a person at 24. I feel even more pathetic writing this shit on the internet.

Same goes for the guys they didn't mentally mature passed the age of 12. They want a supermodel girlfriend  while putting zero effort into their lives. No working out, trying to make money, all they do is procrastinate in their room wondering why nobody wants them.

We know each other since January. We met in a discord server. At the start, he was searching me night and day, I was a bit scared because in my life I've never had such experience. But I understand that we have so many things in common and started to talk a lot. Every day. 4 - 5 hours per day. It was awesome. For the first time in my life I was important for someone, I was alive. 

Then something broke... 

So many though things happened around our life, but still... we managed to chat every day, because I loved it and he loved it. Suddenly he started to be more ""closed about himself""... he stopped searching me like when we met. Many times I reveal at him my feelings. I'm not in love. I just consider him like my lifeline. He's the one who is capable to make me happy just send me a message. He always accepted it and I was very happy... until today.

I send him a message for start our daily conversation... he said that he didn't wanna chat with me... I felt ok with this, but he added that maintain regular basis chat was getting harder and harder... 

He's ""running out of battery"" and he wants to take a break from chatting for a while...

He said that ""chatting every evening since January was a bit draining"" and he started to hate people typing something to him.

After those messages I was feeling so sorry because I probably oppressed him. But I know he's a very straight person, if he had felt oppressed by me, he would have absolutely told me

I'm sure that he's passing a very very hard time. I'm feeling so sad that I cannot help him. My life is useless without him... I'm alone. He was the only one that gives me some love...

He stopped our conversation saying that I'm an amazing person, he's not going to abandon me by any means and he'll come back...

Until that day... hard time is coming for me...

5472,Charming_Oven,1656718197,1,"I'm in London this week doing some travel (I'm American) and I ended up going to the Adele show tonight in Hyde Park.  


I'm a pretty extroverted person and I have no problems striking up conversations with random people. I ended up meeting this group of 8 people and they were really fantastic (at first). They were hugging me, making me feel super welcome, and just generally being nice people. It was really nice and fun.  


The closer it got to the show, I noticed they started shunning me. Small things like they were cheers-ing each other with drinks (which I was doing with them earlier) and then they just kind of ignored me.    I feel pretty socially self-aware and I don't think anything was said or done that would have turned them off to me.  


The loneliness really hit at some point (probably thanks to Adele's songs as well) and I just became a shell of who I am at my best. I will add that I've recently started taking Vyvanse (a stimulant) which helps a lot in my life, but as the day comes to an end I often feel worse. I recognize this and try to take steps to mitigate that. Rather than being in the moment with people, giving love and receiving their love, I became isolated and sad.  


I think what is most lonely is I genuinely know that I'm a great guy. I'm caring, loyal, strong, and funny. And yet, I often just experience the world by myself without anyone to share it with. And I don't really mean a partner, but friendships that really go deep and mean something.   


I used to live in a shared community living situation for about 5 years. I've done a lot of things in my life to foster community and help it grow. And I continue to try and do that, but honestly, I rarely receive friendship back.  


I hope you all have some type of positive, deep connection this weekend.",lonely,Lonely in a sea of people at a concert,2022-07-02 09:29:57

At a wedding I went to last month, the reception MC made sure to call couples specifically onto the dance floor for multiple songs. Which was fine, but they made a huge deal out of it, and the worst part for me was not even being coupled up or not itself, but seeing all the loved ones at my table that I was having pleasant conversations with blend into the crowd and walk away, and I couldn't really join them since I didn't want to wedge my way in or anything. Just didn't feel right.

I just kind of sat there awkwardly and tried to be mature and keep a smile on my face. When I looked around, there were almost no other people at their tables. The dance floor was full. It made my heart ache. I dunno. I'm the only one of my siblings who has never been in a relationship, and one of the only ones of my friends. So sometimes I figure this bad luck/what I haven't worked on enough was just a super lethal combo. On the bright side, my little sister pulled me onto the floor eventually and danced with me. I still don't think she realizes how grateful I am for that.

I have noticed this over and over again. I make friends, we connect, i take initiative, learn about them, make plans but they eventually stop showing up, they always have someplace else to be, someone else to meet, they always cancel at the last moment, i stop initiating. And the friendship dies. They only reach out to me when they want something from me. 

People don't want me as they're friend.

The girl I'm seeing now told me she thinks about me all the time, she likes taking to me. So i made plans to be with her today, but she cancelled on me at the last moment to go to some pub with her friends. Now that i think about it, she doesn't put as much effort into the relationship as much as i do. She doesn't care about me as much as i care about her. Makes me think that everything she has said to me so far have been sweet nothings.

I'm sitting here on my bed like i have all these years starting at my laptop to distract myself from the loneliness. 

The only person who truly cares about me is my sister and she lives in another country. She is planning to get married in 6 months, so i don't bother her and try to be as helpful as i can. Tbh she is the only person in the world who cares about me. Idk what I'd do if didn't have her in my life.

Nobody around me cares about me.

Now i find myself retracting into myself, being pessimistic and judging anybody who talks to me, that they are only talking to me because they are trying to get something from me. It's sad and it hurts but it turns out that I'm right.

I feel like over the last years I existed to purely serve this person. Doing everything I could to make them happy while slowly losing myself. Forgiving everything they did.. the lying, the cheating, the stealing, the abusing, the manipulating.. Even though I gained nothing but a smoking addiction and probably a looooot of mental health issues. Becoming a person I hate. I dont recognize myself anymore. I feel like I can never trust anyone again. All I wanted was someone that cared for me, but obviously I had to fall for the one that just used me for their personal benefits. I've wasted three years with hugs and cuddles and kisses that made me feel sick in the stomach because I was so unhappy with that person. And everytime I told them, they lured me right back into their arms, lovebombing me for three seconds just to go back to the usual. 

I have no one I can talk to now, the only person I trust and love is my brother but I am too embarassed because I kept most of the stuff I've been trough in that relationship a secret. So now I am here. A fucking loser.

I don’t regret it at all, I know it was the right choice. I wasn’t in love with him anymore. 

But man he loved me so much from the start. 

In the last few months of meeting guys and dating I’ve realised that the way he felt about me was rare to find. I remember him travelling 40 minutes every day to come see me for the first few months of our relationship and just how incredibly into me he was. He even got fired because he would skip work all the time to hang out with me. 

Any guy I’ve met recently just doesn’t seem to care that much, they don’t make such an effort to see me. That’s one thing I never thought about before the break up, I think expected dating to be easy but it’s really not.

5544,cockrobotcock,1656684160,1,"This just got validated after an old friend, someone who had already never bothered talking to me unless it related to me giving them ideas and writing for their personal projects, ghosted me because I vented a lot on a completely different platform (think of it as an online diary sort of thing; it was never sent towards anyone directly, there’s always a warning that it’s a vent before it actually starts, and you can swipe away from it if you’re disinterested or uncomfortable and no one will know) when I was going through a really bad period mentally, miraculously came back after months of silence because they claimed they ""miss me"" all of a sudden. This isn’t me speculating either; they told me this directly because it was scary, but now that they need me as their substitute friend, it magically doesn’t bother them anymore?

I don't care if they wanted to cut all ties with me, whether it was because of the vents, they were tired of me, or whatever else; I'd want to cut all ties with myself too, but what irritates me the most is that now that they're bored and lonely, *now* they want to rekindle our friendship (that was just me composing their project while they ignored me every time the subject wasn't on that). No one’s obligated to be my friend, and if being aware of my declining mental state turned them off from pursuing our friendship further, so be it; I'm aware how strenuous it can be, but now that they need another friend, it’s all no biggie despite their choosing to watch my vents and express discomfort in being my friend and ghost me after slowly dropping communication prior to that once I started exploring conversation topics outside of their characters and projects? Yeah, okay.

How stupid do they think I am? People don't just get the urge to talk to someone who they haven't even said a word to in months because they were in a silly goofy mood, because now it’s ""BRO I MISSED YOU SO MUCH"" when you don’t have anyone else to talk to.

5545,offoctet,1656683805,1,"I don't know what this post is. Maybe I'm just trying to make myself feel better by hoping to find more people like me?

So basically, I've never been great at maintaining friendships. I find it easy to make friends in the beginning but once I get to know the other person and if I don't really vibe with them completely, I tend to just slowly let it fade out. Either people don't meet my expectations (which aren't really that high) or I just don't feel like myself/comfortable around them or I just can't be asked to put any effort in because I don't see any potential there.

The gist of what I'm trying to say is I'd rather have no friends at all than mediocre ones. Does anyone relate to this?

I don't like being alone. I enjoy my own company but to an extent. I'd like to have people in my life who I could talk to about anything &amp; everything and they'd just be constant figure in my life. I know it's a long shot to find someone like that on the internet and Reddit of all places but what's the harm in trying I guess?

7 Billion people on this planet, most of us are just looking for that special one. It's so difficult to find someone you're compatible with, let alone someone to eventually spend the rest of your life with.

5554,EquivalentHorror1984,1656674913,1,"It's been a while, long while since I've been in a relationship, I've never had much luck dating wise.
Longest relationship was just shy of 5 years.
When I was younger I'd feel strongly about the person, but I don't know if I'd call it love, at times I'd be filled with energy, but it was likely more just infatuation.

As I get older I just feel an emptyness, I've never really been close to people, just temporary aquantances that for one reason or another depart and become part of my past.

Earlier this year I reached a particularly low point in my life and eventually participated in some counseling, it helped to have someone who actually listened, rather than just telling me things and how I ""should"" feel.

I've found that overall, I don't become addicted to substances (alcohol, pot oil, stuff like that). Pop and the occasional game (rare these days), might be another story though, though I have cut down on the pop versus a few months ago.

Recently I had my first experience with magic mushrooms, assuming low quality because it took a fairly large dose for the effect. There was ups and downs for how I felt, at times I felt what I would describe as ""feeling loved"" very strongly, and the first in a long time.

To cut the story down a bit, I'll skip ahead a bit.
Since then I've begun to learn about growing my own (early stages to my first harvest), I've gotten alot of different stuff for the various stages.

I work a full-time job, so I know that it can't be an everyday thing (other than microdosing, if I try that route). I'm not sure if this will be different in not getting addicted, which part of me worries about. Overall I'm alone, and I don't see that changing anytime soon, though the happiness I felt from that experience has been wearing off, it helped take away the longing I had for a romantic relationship.

I know that I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life, though partly I may not have much choice in the matter as I get older based on different factors in my life.

I'm not really sure how to finish this off, I just felt I needed to say it somewhere.

Down and out as an adult. Dropped out of school.

Working the same dead-end job for 30 years.

I realized I gave up a long time ago...why complain about it now?

Just got to keep reminding myself that the pressure is off. There is no greater happiness to seek and the happiness I have has been cultivated over years of isolation.

No need to get bent out of shape over people who don't care, hate me, or seem nice, just to be nice.

It still happens though. I give someone an inch and they take a mile.

I'm not going to fight for anything, what's the point? It's safer and happier just to walk away.

Doesn't matter what is said or done, there's no trust aligning anyone's thoughts. So there will just be misunderstandings every time I open my ears or mouth.

And now after decades, I am like everyone else. I don't care. Now that I know how it feels, I know all of you don't care about yourselves either.

I will end with this lesson. If you ever meet someone naive, old or young, don't burst their bubble or bust their balls. All the lessons of life are painful, spare them and save yourself.

After you crossed over and learn both sides you realize every living thing on the planet is a scammer, whether they know it or not. At the same time, they are all just seeking the same happiness.

DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT IF IT BOTHERS YOU

So apparently I am considered attractive by people on the internet which automatically makes me think it's either bs, or they are saying I am relatively attractive compared to what I could have been.

Either way, never touched a girl at the age of 20 while being a normal young man who grew up without any disabilities or major tragedies. I did have trauma from childhood and teen years and started self harming so that's why I think I'm a bit too fucked to properly be with a woman innit.

By the way, I don't consider myself all that attractive but even if I was, I think I just think I'm waiting my potential and my self harm scars make me too damaged to be loved or desired by any girl. Fitness helps but I'm not the biggest thing out there; not big enough to compensate for my flaws. 

I actually want to apologize. I want to apologize to those who wish they could be in my shoes instead of their own; I do not have any disabilities and have sexually dimorphic features. I also want to apologize to any women in the world for not being in the top class of men who display high status features. I want to apologize to my ancestors whose efforts of many centuries kept a long succession of males going which might only stop with me being a fucking failure of a man.

Or it's also ok to decide later, I think I want to spend even more time with you--and more committed time. Either one is fine, and neither one of them means you shouldn't do something today. The whole point of you dating someone is just to see how you feel and not make up your decision for the rest of your life today.""

""You, on your own, as much as you don't believe it, are perfect. We want you to choose to engage with people not to complete you but because these are the people you want to spend time with.""

""Part of this is just from spending enough time with people to realize that most people are blinded into themselves because, well, just think of the design of the body. We look out. We naturally get raised into looking outward. And then we receive. And so it becomes this sort of natural progression of I look to external sources to receive. [...] We grow up thinking that we need other people. And depending on how we were raised or the environments that either gets solidified or we're allowed to create space to individuate. And your family confused you enough that you felt shunned, that you just separated, that you felt you were less than. So then you really felt a desire to latch onto somebody that could help you feel whole again. And what we're trying to say is that's all a facade that you were indoctrinated into with your parents doing the best they could. But you are not broken, maybe just blinded.""

""Part of this is for you to not try and fix the external in hopes that it'll then improve your internal. We build within and then we encounter relationships from a position of strength, and that's how the healthy relationships get formed because there isn't an imbalance. As much as it feels good, it's always going to be an imbalance the way that you had previously been doing it. So then it's never enough because as soon as you're separate--it was so imbalanced that you're like, 'Oh, I'm less than now.'""

""What we want move to is that you want to be with people. We want that to be different than I need-- I am incomplete without it.""

""You're an equal partner. And it's ok that your needs are undefined. Even if he is sure of himself, we're not trying to rush you to catch up to him.""

""It's so much easier if we stay with what we know--even if it's you know that you don't know. Because it's the thing that is. Your anxiety and sadness comes with all the things that it could be or couldn't be and might be and may become, which is a lot of extra internal dialogue. When if we just stayed in the moment, it's just the thing. This is where I'm at. And there's no what if, what if, what if. If you stay with listening to yourself and your feelings, when you feel differently, then you'll know you feel differently. You don't have to wonder about the day you feel differently.""

""What we're trying to do is make things simpler so that you know what you're even deciding on. You're deciding on how you feel about things--not how he feels about things, not what other people may think of your relationship, or not how you think you'll feel differently about it later. The exercise is how do I feel right now? And then, you express either it to yourself or to others, not with the intent of them changing that; the point of the expression is just to express.""

""Just breathe into that space of being and not always doing.""

""There is some pressure that comes externally. But we don't need to add internal pressure preemptively based off of what might happen.""

""They can be responsible for the experience. [He] did things that directly affected you. We can hold him at fault for his actions, but your feelings are yours. [...] This doesn't mean you shouldn't feel hurt or upset or whatever feeling comes up or sad, but we don't want to start blaming people for our feelings. Because then the physics of it starts you believing then you can be responsible for other people's feelings.""

""You don't get a free pass, but that doesn't mean everything you do requires critical judgement.""

""Here's the deal: they're blind spots. When we happen upon an accident, it was in our blind spot, and then, we become aware. It's when you're aware and then you just callously disregard, then maybe we can sit in some sort of judgement of like alright I should apologize for that. But if it's a blind spot, you don't see it! We don't want to hold you accountable for things you don't know.""

""If that's what you needed to say in the moment, we don't want you to then go back and go oh, that's not what I wanted, oh, I shouldn't have done that. If you said something you didn't mean, then we can say oh I shouldn't have done that because it's not what I actually meant. Do you see how that's a little bit different? If you needed to yell at him because how you felt, ok. That's better than you not yelling and having it get really, really bad inside and then you going over and hitting him with a bat. If you yelling on the phone helps you let him hear you, ok. As long as what you said was true. If you're lying, then you can feel guilty about lying. Don't feel guilty about having feelings.""

""Save the I'm sorry's for the things that you deem necessary to say I'm sorry.""

""This comes from just a sense of you deferring. I'm sorry that I'm in the world. Please let me remove myself from your path so that you may go unobstructed from the barrier that I created for you.""

""I'm able to engage you in a way based off of my understanding of how you've described your world. Just to help you reflect on what's actually happening to you, and then you get to decide what you want to do with it. And what pacing looks like for you. I don't have an opinion on what the pacing needs to be. Other than I'm certain that when we feel anxious or sad, a main component is usually pacing.""

""You won't know something feels good if you don't know something equally feels bad. It's the physics of emotion. [You won't know if something] feels good unless there's a comporable negative feeling. You wouldn't know you felt happy if you hadn't ever felt sadness.""",lonely,"More notes from my last therapy session, in case it helps anyone",2022-07-01 11:19:10

5620,Tataroonie,1656634035,1,"In the UK, you either become apart of the sheep’s herd or suffer alone. If you decide to be yourself, you’re deemed weird and not worthy of basic human decency. I haven’t had friends since I’ve been at high school, I always ate alone and watched everyone else talk to their friends. I was bullied so no one in my school liked me, I was basically an outcast. I tried to socially do what I could to put myself in situations that would be worthy of making friendships but it always failed and it takes effort from both parties to become friends. After a while, my social skills went from decent to nothing. I have spent every year alone in my room and I have no reason to go outside. 

I fail to make online friendships, either everyone is the same or the fact I try is worthless since they live so far from me. I crave physical interaction, and i’m always jealous and envious of the fact that they have friends. Whenever i was surrounded by online friends, I wish they also didn’t have any other friends so we could relate and I would be the only one they had so I knew they wouldn’t leave me. It sounds selfish, I know that. 

I’ve became a completely different person as I once was. I no longer feel excitement, happiness, surprised, or any regular natural human emotions. I have no empathy for others, I’m starting to only care about myself and fulfil my needs and dip when they become fulfilled. I have lost my mind with the amount of time I’ve spent alone, I want to kill people. Therapy isn’t an option, I only see it as an illusion as it only works for some. 
No one truly cares, they’ll say a few things and go but they won’t actually reach out to you and try and associate themselves with you. Even the ones that struggle and are going through similar experiences to you don’t give a fuck.

5635,24_T,1656627518,1,"Here's my life story from birth till now. 
From the beginning of my life,  the earliest memory I have are my parents fighting and paranormal activities at my home done by black magic. 
My parents used to fight a lot, they do now and due to that a lot of ugly memories are still stuck with me... Like my father leaving our home every now and then and me, my mom &amp; sister begging him to return. My mom tolerating a miserable life,  my paternal uncles saying bad stuff about my maternal side and mom and my maternal uncles doing the same. So I was constantly being manipulated about who's side I should be on and who's right and who's wrong.... Still didn’t figure that one out. Regular fights both physical and verbal,  people gathering infront of my house hearing the shouting always made me feel I'm just not meant for this life. The only thing that helped me survive was just the fantasy of my death so that all of this ends  and this was from the age of 12-17. So as a child I've seen how shitty can be and may be that's why I've never been in a relationship and probably won't be able to be in one because I've seen from my childhood how ugly relationships are and how much the offsprings suffer for it. 

Till the part you might've judged that my dad is bad probably and now let me break it down why he has been put that way in the previous paragraph. My dad is one of the nicest person I've ever met. He is constantly being manipulated by his family and they used to come at our home just to instigate fights and to top it off black magic was there to completely control him. Through this they used to create a distance between him and us and take every single penny he had and it's still going on. He doesn’t realise it,  even if I bring this topic up he gets paranormally angry as if he's been possessed but he is an amazing human being and I know that but there's nothing I can do to fix it. 

Then comes my mom. I've never been nice to her till I was 16 when I realised what's actually going on in our family. Her side of the family isn’t the best and that also caused many problems in my life . 

So because of all this mental issues I used to keep myself busy all the time. I didn’t keep a single minute as leisure so that I didn’t have to fantasize about my death. I joined many clubs and I was darn good at my job, my whole high school knew me teachers,  staffs and students and it's a high school with over 1k+ students in my batch .  I reached a place  and that created some good bonds as well so the greatest bond I made was with a Senior of mine and he was like ' I won't hear a word from you,  you have to work in my social service club cause I know you're  person who can do the best and you're my younger brother you’ve to do it ' then I joined that club everything was going great. Suddenly my dad fell sick and it was during covid and he had to get an Operation so I took a leave for the day of operation from his club and on the day of operation I got a call from the General Secretary of the club pressuring me to go back to work and at that time my whole family was crying and I was devastated as well so I left the club and then everyone from that club apologised to me but still I left.  After few days a former member of a club who is a friend of mine got in touch with me and introduced me to a group of people that left the club as well and they were planning to bring that club down and it was my biggest mistake to stay with them and watch them accomplish it,  anger got the best of me. They posted some harsh allegation on that close senior of mine and gave him a tough time. So all of the club members thought I'm the one who did all this because nobody would be smart enough to organise and pull this whole thing but genuinely I was just a spectator . They hacked my social media accounts,  everything and that's when my life became more depressing cause whenever I used to get a notification my heart used to feel like it's going to stop cause they did something. I stopped using social media and the end of my social life for the past three years . My accounts are still getting hacked, I've no one and I feel really lonely every minute. 

I have never enjoyed a happy moment in my life and I believe it's cursed. Many people have genuine happy moments like their first bike ride or trip, I had this but remember that there was a pre or post fight.

I got selfish I had been through so much emotionally that I never knew what it was like to actually have a friend that cared about you, someone that wasn't just there because they felt they needed to be but because they wanted to be. That could make you laugh effortlessly, talk for hours on end about utter nonsense, and make you feel like your feelings are valid. Since I had never felt this before I got stupid and I ended up falling for her, and I hate myself for it. It's the stupidest thing I've ever done and I wish that I could take it back. I didn't mean to fall in love I just didn't know that I had and before I could stop myself it was too late. Now instead of having the one person in my life who made me feel happy being myself I'm alone. All my other friends are gone, every girl I try and ask out rejects me, and making new friends is impossible because of how socially awkward I am. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from making this idiotic and selfish mistake, but I can't and it hurts.

5652,BaronesseRouge,1656622175,1,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty new to Reddit. I'm 37 years old, single, no children. Two years ago I lost my best friend who was the greatest blessing in my life apart from my family - I've no siblings and only my mother left. I have two ""friends"" left you could say but actually they only call me to rant about their life, they're rather misantrophic folks (call me to tell me how sh\*tty the world and people are) and barely ever ask how I am, what I'm up to, what interests me, whatever. Well, I have no problem with people ranting and thinking the world and people can be sh\*tty but I'm fed up being only a listener while they don't even notice when I'm sad, I could never talk about my friend for example. All this time I thought it was me and I had to be a friend to them, but I realize it really is just one-sided. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had no luck meeting anyone else. I guess it's difficult at my age. I force myself to go out and put on a smile, I greet strangers but I seem to be invisible. Last November an old friend reached out. Someone I really liked and I felt soooo happy to be back in touch again. Turns out he had just broke off with his girlfriend, was bored with lockdown and that was it. The meeting I was looking foward to never happened until this day. Maybe I should tell myself lucky that he remembered me at all and reached out. At least I had two very nice conversations on phone... 

&amp;#x200B;

It's summer and I'd love to go walking with someone, talking, laughing, having fun. I so miss someone who looks at me and I feel liked, maybe even loved. I miss caring for someone, I miss relating to someone and feel like I belong somewhere. I wish I had found love and having kids was my dream. Okay, it may not be in the cards for me but having absolutely no one apart from my mother who has her own problems and is getting older... Actually I always had wanted to make her proud. I'm a loser, my life as it is now is empty. Job-wise of course I haven't succeeded either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, guys, if someone is reading this - I don't want to put anyone down. Actually I feel ashamed to admit all of this. I really don't know where I have gone wrong and what I have done wrong. I've been battling an anxiety disorder for years and now I wonder why I did all the things I did - I'll be alone forever it seems. And again, I'm rally ashamed to tell all of this openly but I just can't stop crying today. I wish I could be happy again, but I'm tired of distracting myself all the time, I'm tired of reading, watching movies, trying to kill the day and have false hope that some day things will change.",lonely,I've never felt more lonely,2022-07-01 06:49:35

So... I've moved to a new city like a year ago for work and I'm pretty lonely here. To be honest I like the job, and the people there is nice, but once work is done no one seems to do anything outside office (And it's almost impossible to do things at the moment since lots of them are remote-working).

Anyway... Since I don't know anyone I normally have two kind of days, the once I stay at home and just work on my stuff and the days I just walk around the city hoping something will change (On which I end up pretty depressed to be honest, but I know I won't change anything if I just stay at home all day).

I just... don't know how to approach people without knowing anyone, I don't know where to go on weekends to know people and actually feel like it would be weird to go alone and end up being alone for the whole night...

Lately this has been affecting my work and mentality but I'm blocked on how to find/know new people just by myself.

5664,Zypher132,1656617613,1,"Just venting and seeing if anyone else encounters this issue. A little backstory: growing up, 4th of July weekend was always a big deal for me and something I looked forward to every year. It really signified it being summer time. I would often go with my parents to cookouts or host them in our neighborhood. Sometimes I'd go to cookouts with my friends or go watch the fireworks together. Sometimes we'd camp. My dad liked fireworks and we'd go and buy a bunch to light off together. It always involved friends and/or family and a weekend full of fun.

Fast forward and I'm now 33. Lost my dad in 2017 and mom in 2019. Even before they passed I found it hard for the holiday weekend to live up to my memories as a kid and young adult. After they passed it became even harder. 

Now here we are approaching the holiday weekend and my wife and I have off Sat-Tues. Turns out our best friends are camping way up north and we weren't invited. Our other married couple friends are going away all weekend. Our one bachelor friend is busy all weekend. So now I'm staring down a depressing and lonely weekend with no plans and no one to spend it with other than my wife. Don't get me wrong, I love spending time with her and I'm super grateful she'll be by my side, but we spend every weekend together and the prospect of spending this holiday weekend just lounging around the house has got me extremely sad. I know my dad being gone is a part of it as I have this romanticized version of what this particular holiday weekend should be like. 

Does anyone else run into these feelings on a big holiday weekend? I just know I'll see people all over having cookouts with friends/family, camping with friends, going on vacations or having parties, etc. And I'll be watching from the sidelines.",lonely,4th of July Blues - Long Lonely Weekend,2022-07-01 05:33:33

I've been thinking about this lately. Many people are coming to the conclusion that they are more at peace, and more content living their life without a significant other. This of course doesn't mean that all romantic and physical contact will disappear for some people, but I just wonder how does this affect an individual psychologically. How important is physical touch? Nonsexual physical intimacy like hugging, or hand holding, etc. Can platonic hugs from friends, cuddling pets, etc. really fulfill this alleged need - or is it just a desire?",lonely,Is it possible to live a healthy life without physical touch?,2022-07-01 02:36:57

5693,givewhatican,1656605246,1,"I’m pretty new to Reddit and only just started getting active in/creating communities. I’m sure this is in guidelines or posted somewhere but it didn’t occur to me until I started getting weird DMs on here. Looking more into it I saw that the DMer’s were heavily involved in 18+ content (nothing wrong w/ that and not trying to kink shame or shame in general) but the types of comments were the issue, and the way they targeted me by my posts here and approached as someone who was just “here to help” is the issue. As someone who’s been down this road too many times I wanted to bump this word of caution: BEWARE THE PREDATORS.

It was really, painfully easy to tell how insecure I was as a teenager/young adult. Physically I dressed to hide myself, I walked hunched over, avoided eye contact, held myself, etc. If people interacted with me I was very shy/docile and overly nice. I didn’t realize it at the time but I was being tested too when people would say random insulting/mean things, and then noted when I avoided confrontation and brushed it off. I was always off by myself, nose in a book. Same story every time: I’d get involved with them, become super attached, and then a cycle of abuse started in which I convinced myself nothing was wrong and had no boundaries because I just needed to feel wanted so badly.

I wish I had someone in my life to guide me during these times. Please, especially to those of us  posting on here exposing our vulnerability about lacking connection, please be mindful that there are people out there who clock this behavior and who can tell how badly we need someone. This is NOT to discourage you from being open to relationships nor to make you believe you don’t deserve love and attention, but to encourage you to have boundaries (which is your right.) I spent so much of my life waiting for a fairytale like the books I relied on to keep me sane growing up, and there were many predatory people who fed on this (literally to the point of making the kinds of romantic declarations the hero gives the heroine about how they’ve never felt like this, they can’t breathe without you, etc.) They do this to trap you. They want something from you and don’t care about hurting you. In fact, some of them like hurting others because it’s just a power play for them.

Do not be afraid to say no or tell someone to leave you alone. Do not be afraid to tell someone when they hurt you, and never feel bad or wrong about being hurt. In fact if someone tries to tell you it’s your fault or that you’re wrong for how you’re feeling instead of being willing to talk it out, that’s a huge red flag right there. You deserve better. You can’t always be the wrong one. You deserve to feel good in your relationships, not anxious/scared/exhausted all the time.

Also, if you’re 25 or younger being approached by people in their 30s, please be careful. I’m approaching mid 30s and while I respect and value younger people (I don’t think teenagers are incapable of making choices or are stupid or anything like that) I honestly cannot engage with them on a friend or romantic level. I have nothing in common with them and I am not at all attracted like that, nor should anyone in their 30s be. It’s still your decision to make at the end of the day, but as someone who was targeted at 17 and 22 by people significantly older than me, I caution you to consider that they are doing this because they know you still likely lack experience in some areas and are still figuring out a lot about who you are. Youre brain is literally still developing too until around 26. You’re vulnerable and that’s totally ok, but just know that not everyone is going to protect that the way they should.

And to the predators, you are just disgusting. Figure out what went wrong with you, if you’re even capable of that level of self reflection, and put some honest work into being better. Stop taking advantage. It doesn’t make you the god you think you are, it just makes you a huge asshole and that shit WILL catch up to you one day.",lonely,Beware the predator.,2022-07-01 02:07:26

I have no friends and the loneliness is unbearable but at least I can spend my time trying to enjoy things that I like, like long walks, tv, video games, writing drawing music etc. 

I’m a social freak and most people don’t like me. Having to meet people and spend time with them is just horrible and makes me depressed because it’s so obvious that they either don’t care or don’t like me and it makes me feel like I’ll never have any friends or enjoy life and I’d rather just be alone than be with people who don’t want to talk to me. 

And if I work I won’t have time to do all the other stuff that might make me happy and I’ll just be more depressed. 

I live with my parents and I’m very privileged but I seriously wonder if a life of absolute poverty would be less horrible than working a depressing job with no friends and no enjoyment and then dying and being that morbid story co workers tell about the loser at work who was completely worthless and then died suddenly.

I don't even know how to start or begin something like this. I'm a single dad of a two year old and a 5 month old.  The mental toll of things are mentally and both physically exhausting thats its driving me to unimaginable depression. 

I am both currently both negative in both gas and electric. I currently have no freezer/fridge left and bave barely minimum to feed my daughter. I'm on the last couple tubs of formula. I'm almost of nappies. I'm falling behind on bills dramatically and I'm having zero space to breathe. Which I'm more than happy to provide evidence either by video call, screen shot. 

I'm still waiting on assistance from the health visitor. I'm to far out from any soup kitchen since I do not drive.  I am in the complete dark and feel utterly lost within life and myself. I want to be the best possible father to my children but feel as if I'm failing them considerably and feel as if someone would do a much better job than I.

Please if anyone can assist, I'd be happy to give my address or even a home visit within reason of trusting you. I feel backed into a corner, unable to breathe.
