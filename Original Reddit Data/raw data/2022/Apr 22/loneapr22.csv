I’ve tried being ‘me’, whatever that means, and it hasn’t worked at all. Not a single friend, nor certainly anything else. I’m almost a helpless child in my mentality, completely socially inept and well behind my peers. But fortunately I’ve got just the opportunity to turn it around. I’m at the end of my HS senior year, going away to college. This seems the perfect setting for a rebirth. It’s a pretty great college (I’m still shocked I got in), and only two of my classmates got in and are also going (different schools in it I think, so hopefully I won’t be seeing them), which means absolutely no one will know me. A completely blank slate.  Terrifying because I know my capacity for messing things up, but at the same time exciting because now I can truly transform myself. I hope to never see anything or anyone from my past again (barring family of course, though they’re not *past*), and if they do, I wish to be unrecognizable. I wish—no I’m going—to be fit, confident, calm, easy-going, and sociable. Strong in every sense of the word. I want to get a job, I want to read more, read better, work out, go out more, meet people, make friends even. As if nothing ever happened, as if it were always this way.   I live in both terror, expectation, and hope. I know how easily I can screw this up, so I’m planning myself carefully. I think I can get this down to a formula. I no longer care about HS, it’s a lost cause—something else on the horizon emerges. I’m just now setting the stage for a metamorphosis.

I don’t mean to keep this going any longer, I’m going in circles, so I’ll end it here. This is almost an affirmation in rant form—I’ve not been this positive in a very long time, if ever.",lonely,I’m going to completely reinvent myself,2022-04-30 23:54:45

I treat everyone with kindness and respect but in return I get treated like dirt.

Those scars didn’t remove the amazing person underneath, those scars tried to hide you. Whether you’re here or not, the love and strength you have, is clearly seen. You have not given up and I appreciate that. It might take a long time, but the right people will come along and show you how worth it you are. Just keep fighting and moving forward for those of us that do love you. You have no idea how much your integrity means to someone else.

I see people these days look out for partners solely based on looks and how rich they are, and how muscular the body is (for boys) and how curvy is the body (for girls). I must say that personality check factor is getting buried. One should look for how kind the person is, whether he/she is into spirituality or something like that. But everyone's going for looks, like almost everyone. That's how tinder and other dating apps are surviving. I'm a boy (18) and there's a girl who sincerely have feelings for. We hung out and stuff, she gave me mixed feelings. Only if i could look a bit better, my chances of her liking me back would be stronger. And in my college, or any other place, i see boys dating beautiful girls and girls dating handsome boys. If a person (boy/girl) dates an average looking (boy/girl), i start hearing comments like ""why's she dating that ugly guy, or why is this hansome chunk dating that average looking girl?"" I really want these problems to end, cuz this is what I'm facing as I'm an average looking person. There were friends of mine, whom I considered my  best friends, commented ""bro u look like ur 30yrs old"", ""bro i showed ur pic to my mother, she said u look like ur a father of 2"" with that fcking laughing emojis. And they themselves look pretty average, and they comment this. Why are people like this? What do they get by commenting on others like this?
I'm really ashamed that we're living in a society where people date or marry the SO based on looks, status and money. Where is the place where the people look out for kind guys/girls, who can understand u easily, set boundaries, make life easier by having mutual understandings....?

I’m 24f and I’ve never been in a romantic relationship or anything close, but it’s definitely something I really want. 

I’ve realized lately a big reason why I’ve never felt comfortable pursuing a romantic relationship, is because I’m scared of men, and I very regularly get creeped on by them. Every time I go to the park near my house (I live in a city), or a coffee shop, or on a bus, about 80% of the time a man will make me feel very uncomfortable. I don’t really want to go in to detail of what exactly has happened to me, but I’m still traumatized by some of it. I already have a problem with isolating myself, and my fear of something bad happening is making it worse.

I wouldn’t say I’m ugly, but I’m not any more attractive than a lot of other girls I see, so why me? I dress a little eccentrically sometimes but nothing revealing or suggestive, not that that would matter. 

I just want it to stop, I don’t want to be scared of men, maybe I’m being too sensitive and dramatic, idk. It’s making me feel terrible about myself. What do men see in me that makes them think it’s ok, what am I doing wrong? I feel disgusting and I can’t quite figure out why.

62,mammothsarentextinct,1651299712,1,"So I don't have many friends, maybe 2-3. Most of them, I know from school, but I switched to homeschooling a while back, so it's kinda strange that they're still around. They're really great people, don't get me wrong, but we're just all different people now, then we were, when we first met.

We used to be a friend group(albeit a small one) and were like best friends, but now we aren't as close together as a whole. I still am kinda close with one, that's nice. 

But the thing is that they still go to school and they're far more social than I am. Outside of our friend group, they have other friends. I don't really have all that many. I have one other online friend, who I really am so so grateful for. But that's it. I used to have a bunch of online friends, but we all kind of drifted apart.

I know that's still a lot, I really am grateful for what I have, but there's still this fear that I'll freak them out if they find out that I don't have much more than them, that they'll think I'm too dependent on them, and that they'll pity me or be weirded out by all this.

So there's this urge to just go find new friends, somewhere, somehow, but I really don't know if I'll be able to maintain that, or whether I even really want that. It feels weird.

They've moved on in life, and are building a future for themselves, they don't have time to waste on me, yet it is me, who has so much time to wait for them and only them.

It feels kind of sad. And lonely.

We are friends, yes, but the day that they leave, I don't think I'll have anything else.

we me online January 2020.  We both had an attraction to eachother but we were on 2 different paths. I was focused on making money and she wanted to be social.  I am a livestreamer its my job to get people to like me to get them to spend money on me.  She later started as a streamer but did not come thru me went her own way.  Fast forward to November 2020 we start to get close and we make it official december 2020.  I do notice shes protective of me in my lives but think nothing of it.  April 2021 she is supposed to come see me on the aniversery of my daughter passing away and tells me a few days before a lie that she is not coming because we have not been communicating enough but were on the phone or in eachothers lives all day and night.  We dont talk much over the next week or so and i needed someone to talk to so i reached out to another streamer who I know and talk to.  May 2021 she tells everyone online shes coming on Friday.  Friday morning I'm so happy to see her text her when shes leaving she say idk i have to do laundry also that she had booked a hotel for her entire stay after I bought all this stuff for her to stay here.  2pm was the last I heard from her till almost 3am she said she fell asleep from the stress. I tell her I'm done don't come.  She came the next day we talked ended up sleeping together but she still went back to her hotel. I was already very hurt by what she had done. The next day she came we went to a few stores her hotel had ran out because she was supposed to go back home.  We talked and she stayed with me the 2nd night. The 3rd day I woke up went to walmart to get her some things she wanted and to buy her some flowers.  I get home and she not in the room and I think shes upstairs taking a shower.  After I notice there is not water running I look around her bag is gone.  There is a piece of carboard on my laptop that said FUCK OFF and my whatsapp was open.  I have a talent agency it was 1 of my host who had  been hitting on me and I told her no I dont love her when she said it i told her I have a girlfriend and she knows it.  My girl saw her say why dont you ever answer me or text me back and went off on her and said i was cheating with her even tho the messages showed otherwise.  She told me be honest is there anyone else.  I told the truth about the streamer I talked to when she did not come see me.  The conversations did get a little adult but this is also someone who i was never going to be in a relationship with or be with as they are married with 3 kids and live in a different country. To my girl this was 2 full affairs

AFTER THE 1ST VISIT
She had a problem with everything I did as little as not saying goodmorning to her 1st other than taking care of my business, not telling her when i have something planned right away when is something im doing in my lives.  I blocked both women for her and released the one from my agency which means i lose money (only like $300 per month). she came 3 more times the last being for the 4th of July. She started to get close to a group of women who i introduced her too called the coffee talk wives.  She and one of them got real close and she started spending less and less time with me to the point where I had to schedule time with just to hang out or talk to her and even then she slept thru some of them. The woman went to see her because her own boyfriend canceled on her.  I was supportive because this was like her only friend.  She became more and more nasty in the coming weeks to the point her own friend and someone else who is close to us had to tell her she was wrong for how she was treating me and she was taking the cheating thing too far.  Her response was ""He cheated I can do what I want"". They told me they were gunna talk to her and she was wrong.  Durring one of my shows football and mukbang  someone come in my room and says dont kick me.  My girl says she will tell me later.  She then says the person who came in lets call her trouble was hitting on them and they handled it but it was days ago and she did not tell me because I dont trip over little things. I was never told what was said till a fight later on her friend showed me the text.  Trouble was saying thing like ""show me ur t**s"" and ""forget your boyfriends they dont have to know"" but this was not big enough to tell me.  My birthday month comes around and some people on the app throw me a party she slept thru then my actual birthday durring my party again slept thru because she was up at 6am with the wives. We broke up and I still kept doing thing for her including saving her business which she said im pretty much not getting anything for.  People who were quiet because they said they did not want to ruin our friendship because they saw how much I loved her said it seemed like I was the 3rd wheel in my own relationship.  When I recently told my ex how I felt I showed her the stuff she showed me on emotions cheating.  I check 3 boxes combined with both the women she said she cheated with and she checked 7 with her in her new friend.


She got mad after we had broke up becuase I would not let her come get the stuff I bought and told her she was a gold digger because of the whole time we had known eachother and been together in person multiple times i have nothing from her. I bought things like streaming equiptment new cell ps4 gaming chair expensive standing ac for her room and these are things she was asking for or telling me she need.  I did try make up for what she said was cheating with gifts

I spent thousands of dollars on this woman and did everything in my power to make her happy before we were together while we were together and after we split.  Now all I want is to be left alone by her and she won't.  She is now blocked everywhere andI have had to tell friends who are streamers like I cant even come to they room anymore because of her. Alot who have been close to us have blocked her becuse of it. I loved her so much and did everything i possibly could.",lonely,long fuller story,2022-04-30 15:54:08

I'm not going to insult her, as she has her problems, but it basically caused me to start a life from ruination. She was my world, and I was lied to for over a year, emotionally abused, torn between the happiest of people, and the lowest of the low. I was there for her at all times, doing everything I could to take care of her. I loved this woman with all my damn heart. Hell, I still might. 

She phoned me, after 2 months of no contact (I deleted everything) but even though she said she did... she 'somehow' found my number. She phoned me at 2 am a couple days ago, crying and telling me how much she missed and still loved me, and hated that I had moved away from her.

We talked for 2 hours.. and while I was already on the path of moving on.. now? I can't stop thinking of how lonely she is, and how it makes me feel fucking lonely. Our breakup was so over-reactive from her part (alcohol) and I had no say in it. Now, she's regretting it, and because I moved on, I feel terrible.

So, I sit here, with no friends, no connections, nothing. Missing an ex-gf going through the same thing hundreds of kms away, and I just feel terrible, knowing she feels the same way.

TLDR: My ex and I are lonely without each other, I moved provinces to move on, and after a phone call one night, I feel incredibly lonely, because we miss each other, and we have no one else to talk with, spend time together.

I just wish I had one person in my life, just one single individual, outside my biological family (who are programmed to care about me), who cared enough about me to hang out with my IRL. Who cared enough to listen to my problems. Who cared enough to tell me that I'm not ugly, that I'm not a bad person, that I don't deserve to feel this way. I'm so fucking desperate for that person.  

But they are never coming. Because I am ugly. Because I am a bad person. Because I do deserve to feel this way. I have no value as a member of society, or as a friend, and certainly not as a lover.

99,8anan4fish,1651287348,1,"a run down on my mental health

i don't have the typical life of a f/18 girl. i was practically abandoned shortly after my seventeenth birthday and and mentally and emotionally abused for years beforthat (narcissistic mom/siblings and absent dad) so for the past 1.5 years I've been spending rebuilding myself and everything I've lost in my childhood. i currently stay with a sibling and I pay rent, bills, car note, etc etc. i have so many hobbies. I've been drawing for almost 8 years, I play the piano, tattoo, embroider, I love anime, video games. my art has won competitions so many times. so whats the problem? well the problem is I feel like wasted potential. and im literally alone. i feel as though people dont get me or they never will. i have friends... just a few. but I always seem spontaneous to them or they dont understand my interests. or if they do understand my interest, I seem to be way more into it than them. i used to have friends that would judge me for taking too much of a liking towards something. but I still was friends with those people for years and naturally I just silenced myself. i do everything alone now because I am convinced that there's no one out there that will care to listen to my interests or care for me like I want to be cared for. i have this strong odd sense to be independent. ill take help when I can get it, because I'm kind of a broke college student trying to reparent myself and is also forced to do life on my own. but its been so long since I've felt a real connection that I've just been conditioned to be alone. and yeah yeah I know someone is probably going to say that I'm still young, but I dont know how much more of this I can humanly take. if I think a bit too long, I get this feeling that Ive had enough. its like the euphoria before a rollercoaster drop. and its constantly just edging me (wrong word choice, i know). i distract myself by doing things alone. i go out to eat alone, go to the movies, the beach, smoke and read my books alone. i play video games and workout alone and i just... do everything alone. i even explore new places by myself. but its like... will there ever be anyone to do all these things with? I feel like I've lived 10000 fucking lifetimes. the days go by so slow. i feel like I've aged 30 years just to look at the calendar and I'm not even 19 yet. maybe its the psychedelics i used to do.

see i was a very rebellious kid. but also open minded and made smart decisions. i was in advanced courses all though all my high school years and i haven't ever failed a class. i dabbled in some weed when i was 16 and did my first acid trip as well. it was what i call my enlightening trip. because after that, everything basically went downhill but uphill as well? i basically became aware and conscious. sometimes i think I'm too aware. painfully aware of myself and the other people around me. sometimes its literal. like I'm literally aware that there are other people near me, percieving me, and i hate it. because then they can point out the weird shit that i do. other times its mentally. I'm aware of my state of mind and who i am and what imout to be. what i have to do and what i need to do to be okay in this lifetime. sometimes i wish i was oblivious and blind to the real world. i wish i could live in a fantasy and not have to Know. because ignorance is definitely bliss. but knowledge is so much more valuable... i did some shrooms a few times. molly as well and went to shows. but its not really my thing. although i only did psychadelics socially, i made sure it wasn't for pleasure but to have the need to want to learn something. i dont have a problem with psychadelics, but i know they're definitely not to fuck with and do too much. now i just smoke weed. and live my little lonely life. but will it always be like this? i cannot fathom the timeline where I'm just alone all the time. i dont mind being alone but I'm afraid that Itll always be like this and ill slowly become crazy. i talk to myself a lot because i can actually solve problems that way. and its one of the key points to me going to do things alone. but will i ever want someone at my side in these times?

as i stated before, i live with a sibling, and they invite me out sometimes but... there is an age gap so their friends arent my age. plus i didn't live with them when i was younger. i dont know i kind of just push them away sometimes. or i prefer to be alone. they complain but i feel like seeing them everyday and going out every so often is normal.

yes I've been in relationships. but none of them have ever worked out. I've never even been properly dated. i was either a mistress, or a side piece. i had one successful relationship but they didn't respect my boundaries and i later found out that i didn't even like them, i just didn't know how to say no when they asked me out... in person. I've lost so many friends and relationships as well. i sometimes wonder if im the problem. i keep wondering if things like this have subconsciously pushed me to be alone.

I've known I've been depressed for years but anxiety has been new for me recently. i was diagnosed a few days ago and started antidepressants. my family was never big on diagnoses and i have speculations that i have adhd and maybe autism. but i simply cannot affort treatment for either... i just kinda want to know if i have it or not. so i can know if something is making me like this or if im just fucking weird and was handed the worst life humanly possible. i got diagnosed because i have come too close too many time to taking my life and for whatever reason... i want to at least try to stay on this earth as long as humanly possible. of course i have some conditions (which were broken the first few attempts... but i always convincedmyself to stay) but... i dont know. is it bad that if there were someone out there that just... understood me... i think id be okay?

i dont know how to apply myself and put myself out there. i get commissions with art and stuff but that's just if someone happens to find my page. and it makes me feel like wasted potential. im socially awkward and i dont knowhow to apply myself. this comes with anything else media related. i suck at being consistent and i dont know where to go or what to do to find people like me. or even with the same interests. or maybe i just get too pu/sy to ever engage in a conversation online or something. i was kind of taught that my opinion matter because im young. and of course i know better now but... you cant overcome trauma in like 5 minutes of staring at a comment section. even worse if its in person. i beat the shit out of myself for even looking at someone (that im interested in) wrong. crushes are actually bad for my mental health and i hate when i like someone because being around them is too fucking hard. i start overthinking and wondering what they're thinking about me. or if what i said was too much. or not enough. just to find out that im stupid as shit and i come off as uninterested or i perceive things too logically instead of emotionally.

but Is it bad to want to want to be understood? I haven't had a real connection in such a long time. I haven't Felt anything in so long. I think right now in this very moment im realizing that ive been so numb all along. i dont feel anything anymore. i constantly read mantras about the only person who should be makingyou happy is yourself... BUT I FUCKING HAVE!!! ive made myself so happy. so sad. so angry. so upset. so insecure. so confident. so loving. so bold. so.. everything. will there ever be a time where i dont have to do this for myself anymore. maybe there will be a day where someone else will care for me like i care for me. i wish someone would come in and just read my mind. and everything doesn't have to be so hard for me. i wouldn't have to beat myself up the way i do now. maybe then ill feel something.",lonely,Vent abt my life,2022-04-30 12:55:48

I went to court with her to support her while she was getting her ex imprisoned for domestic violence. After that we got into a huge fight and stopped talking, we eventually started talking again and ended up dating. 

By mid April, shit hit the fan, I picked her up from the bar, we went back to my house and talked for hours, when we went to go to bed she began to initiate intercourse, I asked if she wanted to, she said yes so we did. Having been in love with this girl knowing how crazy she was, I didn’t suit up when I should have, I let the citizens off the train inside the station cause she told me too.

From that point on things changed, she didn’t want to talk about things, I kept asking about if she got pregnant what would she want to do and if she got an abortion if I could come with her. She told me if she did she wouldn’t tell me, she started accusing me of all kinds of things, just generally trying to push me away. Everything I said was wrong, she told me she has the beginning stages of cervical cancer, I tried to learn as much as I could about it to help her, then she threatened to kill my dog and herself when I told her she shouldn’t do coke.

I am what has been called pretty more often than not. I don't know where I fall on a scale, but I really do not care either. Anyone that is basing my life on how pretty I am, that is no different than any other superficial reaction.

Do you know what pretty gets? Pretty gets a string of men that want to have sex with no attachment. Guess what, that sucks. Pretty gets people afraid to talk because they feel you won't want to. Pretty gets insulted and treated poorly cause you had the easy road.

Do you want to know what pretty is to me? It's being fucking lonely an awful lot, no one cares, and they only pretend to care to get into your pants.

Like, I've seen this sub every now and then in the past, but I never really actually clicked on it and checked it out fully. That is, until this morning. I was scrolling through and clicked on the posts with titles that interested me, and then, next thing you know, I'm reading one post after another after another.. And I have to say, there are some pretty cool, single redditors on there/in this world, lol!

So anyway, after reading the dating bios/ads, if I still found the person intriguing (or might I even say, ""attractive"" in some way), my mind automatically went into deep imagination-mode of trying to envision what it would be like to date or fall in love with them. After several scenarios with several people, I stopped myself bc I felt a bit pathetic lol... and thought, wow, I'm such a lonely and sad person, hah

122,mrlivestreamer,1651271437,1,"me 32/m her 28/f

we me online January 2020.  We both had an attraction to eachother but we were on 2 different paths. I was focused on making money and she wanted to be social.  I am a livestreamer its my job to get people to like me to get them to spend money on me.  She later started as a streamer but did not come thru me went her own way.  Fast forward to November 2020 we start to get close and we make it official december 2020.  I do notice shes protective of me in my lives but think nothing of it.  April 2021 she is supposed to come see me on the aniversery of my daughter passing away and tells me a few days before a lie that she is not coming because we have not been communicating enough but were on the phone or in eachothers lives all day and night.  We dont talk much over the next week or so and i needed someone to talk to so i reached out to another streamer who I know and talk to.  May 2021 she tells everyone online shes coming on Friday.  Friday morning I'm so happy to see her text her when shes leaving she say idk i have to do laundry also that she had booked a hotel for her entire stay after I bought all this stuff for her to stay here.  2pm was the last I heard from her till almost 3am she said she fell asleep from the stress. I tell her I'm done don't come.  She came the next day we talked ended up sleeping together but she still went back to her hotel. I was already very hurt by what she had done. The next day she came we went to a few stores her hotel had ran out because she was supposed to go back home.  We talked and she stayed with me the 2nd night. The 3rd day I woke up went to walmart to get her some things she wanted and to buy her some flowers.  I get home and she not in the room and I think shes upstairs taking a shower.  After I notice there is not water running I look around her bag is gone.  There is a piece of carboard on my laptop that said FUCK OFF and my whatsapp was open.  I have a talent agency it was 1 of my host who had  been hitting on me and I told her no I dont love her when she said it i told her I have a girlfriend and she knows it.  My girl saw her say why dont you ever answer me or text me back and went off on her and said i was cheating with her even tho the messages showed otherwise.  She told me be honest is there anyone else.  I told the truth about the streamer I talked to when she did not come see me.  The conversations did get a little adult but this is also someone who i was never going to be in a relationship with or be with as they are married with 3 kids and live in a different country. To my girl this was 2 full affairs

AFTER THE 1ST VISIT
She had a problem with everything I did as little as not saying goodmorning to her 1st other than taking care of my business, not telling her when i have something planned right away when is something im doing in my lives.  I blocked both women for her and released the one from my agency which means i lose money (only like $300 per month). she came 3 more times the last being for the 4th of July. She started to get close to a group of women who i introduced her too called the coffee talk wives.  She and one of them got real close and she started spending less and less time with me to the point where I had to schedule time with just to hang out or talk to her and even then she slept thru some of them. The woman went to see her because her own boyfriend canceled on her.  I was supportive because this was like her only friend.  She became more and more nasty in the coming weeks to the point her own friend and someone else who is close to us had to tell her she was wrong for how she was treating me and she was taking the cheating thing too far.  Her response was ""He cheated I can do what I want"". They told me they were gunna talk to her and she was wrong.  Durring one of my shows football and mukbang  someone come in my room and says dont kick me.  My girl says she will tell me later.  She then says the person who came in lets call her trouble was hitting on them and they handled it but it was days ago and she did not tell me because I dont trip over little things. I was never told what was said till a fight later on her friend showed me the text.  Trouble was saying thing like ""show me ur t**s"" and ""forget your boyfriends they dont have to know"" but this was not big enough to tell me.  My birthday month comes around and some people on the app throw me a party she slept thru then my actual birthday durring my party again slept thru because she was up at 6am with the wives. We broke up and I still kept doing thing for her including saving her business which she said im pretty much not getting anything for.  People who were quiet because they said they did not want to ruin our friendship because they saw how much I loved her said it seemed like I was the 3rd wheel in my own relationship.  When I recently told my ex how I felt I showed her the stuff she showed me on emotions cheating.  I check 3 boxes combined with both the women she said she cheated with and she checked 7 with her in her new friend.


She got mad after we had broke up becuase I would not let her come get the stuff I bought and told her she was a gold digger because of the whole time we had known eachother and been together in person multiple times i have nothing from her. I bought things like streaming equiptment new cell ps4 gaming chair expensive standing ac for her room and these are things she was asking for or telling me she need.  I did try make up for what she said was cheating with gifts

I spent thousands of dollars on this woman and did everything in my power to make her happy before we were together while we were together and after we split.  Now all I want is to be left alone by her and she won't.  She is now blocked everywhere andI have had to tell friends who are streamers like I cant even come to they room anymore because of her. Alot who have been close to us have blocked her becuse of it. I loved her so much and did everything i possibly could.",lonely,my story better written,2022-04-30 08:30:37

 The thing is though, I have never dated someone before in my life, haven't kissed someone or done anything romantic. And I crave it... to just have someone at my side who I can spend time with and share my interests and hobbies with and who I can love and receive the same. 
All my friend here already have some connections with a dude (or even multiple) and all of them say they're not even serious about it and... I just dont get it. All these people around me start relationships on a whim and I cant even find someone to get to know better.
 I'm not ugly but I'm not very pretty either, just a average human... is it my personality?
 I try to appear more confident because I think it's because of my lack of self esteem but then people just call me obnoxious for trying to be part of the conversation or trying to be more outspoken... 
maybe I just need to give it more time? But I've spent 21 years of my life without a partner to call my own, without any experience of romantic or sexual feelings and I just start feel like I'm maybe more ugly than I thought... or my personality is worse than I thought... but the girls and adults around me often praise me and tell me they like me or how I look but I've never received any positive attention from the guys around me... is it me or is it them? Idk this is pretty much just a rant because the negative emotions have been piling up and I dont know where to put them since there is no one to listen to it, haha.
 I would feel pathetic to tell my friends about my feelings because I feel like they cannot relate at all to my issue... I always hear about how they've started seeing these different people and it sounded like the dudes are falling in love with them and then they tell me that they arent serious about it in the first place.... it frustrates me even though I know that I cant make them responsible for my loneliness but then I'm just thinking: why are you leading them on if you dont plan on being with them?!

For those, like myself, that often forget… the people posting and replying all have different icebergs of life experiences, thoughts, and behaviors.  I use the term iceberg like the iceberg meme to describe the “hidden depths” below the surface layers.

A post about feeling lonely can stem from a general feeling of isolation but it’s important to remember it could be so many other things, too: recently broke up, recently rejected, emotional instability, personality disorders, manipulation, etc.

Our society is the loneliest it’s been in generations due to the rapid advancement of social media, the unrepentant monetization of our social lives, and the pandemic spreading a brain damaging virus.

I think, in many or even most cases, there are other underlying issues that need to be addressed for these individuals including anxiety, depression, autism, ADHD, a personality disorder or being denied entitlement or privilege.

It’s okay to feel lonely at times.  We all do.  And I don’t want to discourage people from posting - far from it! Please reach out if you are hurting - but ask that everyone keep in mind that your situation is (likely) different and we all carry biases.

I encourage everyone to take care of themselves, too: eat healthy, exercise, get 8 hours of rest, avoid toxic individuals, and engage in hobbies.  Hobby groups, especially, are a great way to meet people.  Avoid online “dating” as its incentivized to NOT match you up and get you paying.  And be careful of redditors who message you; you don’t know them or their intentions.

I get the procedure done this morning and managed to get an Uber home because someone in my family came through for me. I wasn't allowed to eat or drink for eight hours before the procedure so I'm tired, and thirsty. I'm also on three hours of sleep. I get back and need something to drink. It's oral surgery so here is me with my mouth full of cotton barely able to talk feeling tired. 

I think, I could use a coffee. Make that a latte. I walk in almost out of instinct because I'm half asleep and she's there again. She sees me and gives me this smile. Suddenly I feel better. She says how was your procedure. I said, painful barely able to form words. I look down when a girl talks to me out of the habit of being looked down on but then I look up and she's still smiling. Then I start feeling weird and start talking nonsense because of nerves and she doesn't mind. Once again, it's her job to be friendly but she made small talk for a few minutes again. I started stuttering out of nerves and the fact she kept looking at me in the eyes. I felt awkward and didn't want to creep her out so I went to leave. Then she said, I hope you feel better and used my name. She remembered my name! I didn't even know hers. See, this is the kind of thing that just makes my day. I say, what's your name again? I said, thanks her name, see you this weekend(I always go in on the weekend). That simple exchange that most people will say, who cares, is huge for me because I don't get to have girls smile at me and say even the most generic things. Then the pain came back and I walked home but I can't stop smiling. If this is what most people get on a daily basis, it is as great as I thought. This is the most happy yet pathetic thing that has happened to me since my crush on my therapist. How much of a loser do you have to be to be so used to rejection and never getting anything positive with a few minor exceptions to let this get to you? I bet other customers have crushes on her. Lots of places have the attractive employee who all the customers like haha. In her case it's not her looks so much as it is the way she looks at me. There are lots of attractive girls out there but most are not like her being nice to random people. I'm in pain right now but am still smiling. I have this warm sensation that is making me feel good.

163,Top-Software-7398,1651255298,1,"I had a plan with my friend first time in a couple months. I was excited about it before, but this experience made me feel that being alone is much better than being with someone selfish, and to be honest I am a bit hurt too. I just need to vent, and I'm sorry if I sound really whiny haha.

This is just the backstory with this friend: (I had this friend who used to be really emotionally dependent on me. For example, off the top of my head, she used to get upset at me when I didn't listen to her when she was feeling down, and once, I listened to her complain about a really minor thing for two hours, and stuff similar to this happened a lot.

This went on for years and it emotionally drained me so much, so I kind of told her (not too directly, she didn't fully stop) and I figured the reason she continued was because I was too good a listener maybe, so I purposely avoided telling her what she wants to hear. Also she became busier than before  too so it eventually stopped.)

I had a plan to meet this friend this week. I got a car last year and she doesn't have a car, so she said, ""Let's drive to somewhere nice with your car"" and I was excited about it too since I haven't done it with her before.

We were deciding where to go and she was sending me places that takes 1.5 hours from where I live, and it seemed like she wanted me to pick her up too so it would take 2+ hours at least (which is 4 hours total, the gas price in my country is very expensive, like 2 dollars per liter and traffic is always bad in this city, so it's actually very tiring to drive). I would have been happy to go there if it were a better time, but it was a weekday and I was overworked and very tired with cramps, so I told her my situation and let's go there some other time and we should go somewhere close instead. 

I looked for a nice place that was closer. The closest station from there would take about 30 minutes for her to come and then we could drive together from there. Then she suddenly changed and said she can't come because it takes too long, and she only wants to meet right in front of her place if possible. I was a bit annoyed and I know it's kinda petty, but I suggested a place that's halfway between us (which takes less than 15 minutes), and she still says no lol. I would have been totally fine with her answer if she didn't just suggest 1.5 hours when she thought I was driving... Maybe she was expecting me to pick her up and everything and became disappointed when I suggested otherwise. None of us was happy with any place, so we said we'll meet next week instead, but I don't think I will be contacting her. 

I am pretty hurt because I did put a lot of thought into picking places, like the convenience of her getting there. She also gets disappointed every time when we don't go to places that looks ""pretty."" lol... so I took that into consideration too. But she just shot me down without any thought and just wanted me to come right next to her place.

I know I went on for too long even though this story is not really interesting, so thank you to anyone if you actually read this story haha. Maybe I overreacted, I don't know, but overall, I've had too many draining experiences with this friend compared to other friends. She does have good qualities, but I always find myself drained by her.",lonely,had a plan with my friend and it was cancelled (a bit long),2022-04-30 04:01:38

Well I wasn't looking in high school so I can't be mad about that.

I thought for sure in Undergrad was where I'd find someone. A lot of my peers in undergrad found their partner there. I actually had someone women interested in me then but due to various reasons, really all boils down to bad luck, none of them worked. Or I wasn't interested in them, though many times because I was in love with / pining for someone else. I also met my dream woman but she rejected me which scarred me and set me back as I kept comparing everyone to her. In restrospect, undergrad was my best chance. Should have focused more on love and less on everything else, including studies.

Ok. I'm only 22. Perhaps law school means I'll find someone. New school. New people No. No luck. Then COVID hit cutting that down.

Perhaps I can ask my friends to set me up with someone they know. Nope. No luck.

Online? Quickly realized that if you are a man you need to be super hot for it to work.

Ok. Well I graduated. I'm only 25. And look; I find work in a completely different city 800km away. Maybe that is where my life partner has been this whole time.

I have a significant other of 10 years, I have 2 best friends that have been around since I was a kid, a cousin, who is more like a sister and 2 sisters.  I have good relationships with them all, some deeper then others.  We talk about the surface things and issues in life, or what’s going on in their lives but it never really feels like a fulfilling conversation. when we’re talking I am engaged and I do my best to be fully present and helpful if they are looking for that.

this has been my first year in my new school, and it's almost over. it feels like all of my classmates and the other students in my grade have all gotten to know each other and even make friends.
i feel like I'm the only super lonely person in class, since I rarely talk to anyone. I find it really hard to make friends.

each time when I ask my classmates to go out, they always refuse, ignore me or have someone else to go iut with. I just don't know what to do anymore, I crave going out. I can't even go out on my own because my parents don't let me ( I begged them multiple times).

I haven’t cried in about two years now; I can shed a tear wanting to cry, needing to cry, but it’s like I’ve forgotten how to. I’ve tried other methods of releasing my emotions: running, weightlifting, therapy, journaling, etc, but it’s like trying to drain a filling bucket drip by drip.

In the past I’ve always tried to hold in my emotions &amp; was pretty much out of touch w/ them — I was raised never seeing an adult male cry. I grew up attending a high performing private school where perfection was the expectation &amp; struggling academically or emotionally was looked down upon. I grew up told that being depressed was being ungrateful: that I didn’t have the right to be depressed when I had two parents, didn’t have to worry about bills, had a nice home, etc. I consciously know that depression transcends socioeconomic status &amp; can simply be a chemical imbalance, but I think subconsciously I still believe it: I can’t be depressed, men don’t cry, I’ll be happy if I work harder etc.

But now I want to cry &amp; be vulnerable w/ people, but can’t. The only time I’ve told anyone about how I’ve actually felt &amp; cried because sadness rather than pain, my parents hospitalized me when I went to get an X-ray for my arm because “they couldn’t deal w/ my depression.”

i used to not really have this issue. ive never been popular but i’ve always wanted to talk to proper and make friends but since about maybe 4 years ago, i just stopped doing that. obviously quarantine probably worsened it but it was still there even before it. i’m asking this because i’m worried that i’ll soon be too far into this quiet kid persona that i’ll just have no friends or girlfriend my entire high school experience. i just want to know how i can fix my brain.",lonely,how to fix social anxiety?,2022-04-29 16:08:49

What about if you were engaged and she took off 3x in 3 years to spend the night at her parents?

You know, those that know my u/ know that I'm not a nice guy. What some have not discerned is I'm a good guy.

Js looks awfully suspect considering she ditched me to marry.... Y'all know the story.

Day I left, waiting for Greyhound. She could have come with me to see me off. There were staties chasing down a stolen mac truck on the highway I'm alongside of so I message her. No response until hours later.

Moral of the story, ALWAYS buy a guitar from a pawn shop because it already knows the meaning of the blues. NEVER buy an engagement ring from one for the same reason.

I keep telling myself that you have no friends anymore maybe you should go with them and it will be fun. So I did and at the second bar I looked around at the group I was with and realized that I was with all couples and everyone was acting sweet and cute with each other. 

Meanwhile I had been texting a guy who I had been with a couple years ago who lived nearby and we had planned on me coming over. Well he changed his mind and just kept saying he wasn’t feeling it and he didn’t know if he wanted to hang out anymore and alluded to me not being as attractive as he remembered. 

And it hit me, here I was with all of these couples thinking I was going to be able to stay with this guy I knew and would finally be held and hugged and just get some actually human contact where someone wanted me. And in the end I am literally so ugly that he turned me down. I thanked the couples I was with and did exchange numbers and offers to hang out so I was nice, and headed home alone. And just realized that this is why I don’t go out. I get my hopes up every time thinking something is going to be different and each time it is exactly like my worst fear.

229,DownvoteIfYouWantMe,1651209306,1,"I'm a 19 year old college freshman and there's three things that have been weighing on my mind about getting a girlfriend that I can't stop thinking about.

1. The girls that I find very physically attractive, usually aren't content with my physical attractiveness, so if I were to go for a girl that I don't find as physically attractive, I feel that it would be an injustice to her for me having to ""mentally settle"" for someone that deserves to be more to someone. I wish I could forcibly lower my standards.  
2. In past relationships near the beginning there would always be a burden lingering over me over whether the one I was with was really as close to being a perfect fit for me as possible. I constantly thought about if there was another girl that could make me happier and if there was another guy that could make her happier instead. I always was worried about bottlenecking my experience with a relationship that was a 6/10 fit when I could find one in the future that would be a 10/10 fit for me. 
3. I'm not sure how to meet girls these days specifically for romantic endeavors. Online dating seems out of the question since there seems to be so many more men out there than women, and so many less swipes for men than women. There's also a lot of changes in society that push against speaking to strangers and especially pushes against speaking to women you don't know for romantic purposes. 

Out of these number 2 bothers me the most and has always been a worry for me whether I'm in a relationship or not. I hope one day I'll meet someone who will shatter my issue number 1 by being incredibly attractive to me, and vice versa. Obviously I wouldn't want to be dating someone who doesn't find me to be very physically attractive either. Number 3 is just probably the most rational issue I guess.",lonely,I'm overthinking finding a girlfriend,2022-04-29 15:15:06

I'm not able to keep a friend for more than like a year. No matter what, we will just stop talking, for God knows why. BUT, I've never had a girlfriend, so maybe I'm not bad at keeping a girlfriends unlike friends. Even though that doesn't really make sense. I've never had one so I'm not entirely sure that the relationship will just slowly dissolve, very painfully no matter what like every other relationship, so I've been holding on to that hope. I think I have to acknowledge that it makes sense that I probably won't be good at keeping a relationship with a girlfriend either. I really don't like this thought, if this is true. Everyone I'm friends with this year, I wasn't friends with them last year, and I won't next year. Is there gonna be that one person? That I just click with so hard that we never come unstuck.

I know it sounds stupid or cringy, but I have to focus on these mundane, small moments because sometimes they are all I have. It's been great help for me and I advice you to also do the same.

259,lardass_megamind,1651199478,1,"Ok this is gonna be kinda hard for me to convey so hang in there.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in college for about a year now and i hate every single part of it. I hate my classes, my roommates, I don't have friends, nobody shows up to the meetings for the clubs i joined, assholes with loud cars drive past my dorm every 6 minutes, the classrooms look like an old mental hospital, the labs are under supplied, I haven't been able to get a research position despite applying to all two of the ones that my school offered for my major. it's a mess. I'm just as lonely as in high school except for two major differences:

1. I don't have my own room
2. I have nothing in the future to look forward to

In high school, my life was the same if not worse, but I could console myself with the knowledge that I would eventually be in college where I would only take classes i liked, have a fulfilling social life, and feel like I ""belonged"".

I can't describe what I expect ""belonging"" to feel like, but I have a few ideas. In January, i was stalking one of my high school friends insta when I found a picture of him arriving back at school from winter break with the caption ""missed you \[college\]"". That post genuinely ruined my day because I couldn't fathom not only liking college, but liking it enough to ""miss"" it. And I know what the boomers will say reading this: ""stop comparing yourself to what other people post on social media! Everything on there is a lie!"" I get this to an extent, but is it really ""unrealistic"" for someone not to dread returning to the place they are spending $100,000 to attend? I feel like this should be the minimum.

Another issue is that this was my safety school. Actually, the school I wanted to be my safety rejected me, this was the only one i got in to and i don't even remember why i applied. Every time I see this school's logo it's a reminder that I'm not smart enough to go to a good school. That's probably why my friend gets to ""miss"" his school, he's smart enough to get into a school worth missing. I, on the other hand don't deserve such luxuries.

I've been looking into leaving since December. I filled out a bunch of applications, but I only applied to one school and it was in a fit of rage after I failed my math midterm. I later decided against going there and withdrew my application.

Why did I change my mind? One reason was because I joined that club that I mentioned in the first paragraph, but of course, that's dead now so that doesn't matter. Another reason is that all my ""friends"" are here, but they never hang out with me or answer my texts, so idk if this counts. Another reason is that one girl who I had a crush on in high school is coming here next year. I didn't find out about this until after I decided to stay but it makes this decision so much harder for me.

Anyway just wanted to scream into the void for a little bit. Thanks for reading",lonely,I can't remember the last time i felt like I belonged anywhere,2022-04-29 12:31:18

It doesn't even matter if a thousand people say I look good I still just don't think so. And oh boy one negative comment and I'm done for.

I post pictures on here all the time because I just want to feel better about myself. I read all the comments and I still feel nothing. I still look in the mirror and just see ugly. 

And of course my anxiety is building up causing my chest to hurt which just makes me feel worse about everything. I'm sick of hating myself.

In the last month i've lost two of my pet budgies, suddenly and without warning.  Online friends reach out less and less, and my closest friend, who used to call every day and come visit me in person told me that he was busy lately and when I said I miss interacting him with more (even just with messages) he said ""Saying that is as useless as me saying I want to win the lottery"" which really cut me deep and i've been crying about it. I've known this person for 15 years but I guess I don't matter anymore? He called me annoying too. 

My family never visits me, I only see them if I visit them. I live with my mom but she is no emotional support, I am only support for her. She has the motto of ""Life sucks and then you die"".  I haven't been wanting to eat much lately, and I don't physically feel very good.  I don't have the money to go anywhere and when I tried to make new friends online I was only treated harshly and judged for having an icon of my mascot character because she's not human. .\_.

310,throwaway0183701,1651176501,1,"Finals are coming up. That sucks for 2 reasons. First, the standard stress that's more or less normal and to be expected. worse in me to some degree cuz of all the shit I got swimming through my head. Second because I don't know what I'm gonna do once it's over. I know my entire living situation is gonna change. Idk, i guess i dont feel like writing about it tho. or thinking about it

What's really on my mind rn is that fuckin girl wh talked to me. I can't remember if I wrote about her last time. I think I did, I think she was the reason I wrote aat all, actually. Well, here we are again. She was nice to me again today. Not like overly nice, just normal human smalltalk nice. But last time, she was asking me a question to hopefully gain information from me that could help her. This time, it was pure smalltalk (she asked how I thought I did on a calc test we both had today. I hope I behaved well through and didn't fuck up somehow and make an ass of myself.

Actually, before that, she walked over to me and asked a question about the chem lab we were doing at the time. she has her own partner, idrk why she asked me. mayber her partner was away and i didn't notice? But yeah, just normal human behavior.

And then what does my pathetic little damaged brain do? become infatuated with her, again. I had just gotten over the infatuation of last time, and now here we are again. I know I'm gonna see her as soon as I try to sleep tonight and wish she'd hug me and tell me I'm safe and cute and she  cares about me.

Why tf do I have to be like this? She didn't do anything to warrant this from me. She's just being normal, and my fucked up head goes and makes it creepy. And I know it's creepy, I know if she read this she'd be mortified and avoid me like the plague at the very least. Probably would fucking drop ochem next semester just so she wouldn't see me. And I wouldn't fucking blame her, I am a goddamn creep. I don't want to feel this way towards her, but it's apparently out of my fucking control. How the hell do you turn off a feeling? I've tried for so long. I've tried to turn off romantic attraction from the moment that  I started experiencing it. But it doesn't go away. It just sits there, bubbling out unfulfillment and loneliness and self-hate that corrodes my soul and leaves me fucking broken.

The worst part of this rn tho is that I can't help but wonder if she's trying to befriend me for some reason. I have no plausible reason she would, I'm a fucked up sack of shit, and in public I'm so nervous that I don't even have a personality. But I can't just ignore that it's me she talks to out of my lab group of three. Why me? And why ask about my confidence on a test? Isn't that something you do with friends, prospective friends? But if she is trying to befriend me, what the actual fuck am I supposed to do? I'm nothing, I don't deserve a friend. She'll see that I can't drive and that I'm too anxious and depressed to do anything and she'll just regret getting involved. Plus, I don't have the fucking energy to maintain relationships of any sort. And then obviously I'll just be constantly infatuated with her. Doesn't matter that I facebook stalked her just enough to know she's in a relationship, doesn't matter that she has a picture of him and her as her lock screen, doesn't fucking matter to my brain that I know she is not at all romantically interested in my fat ass. I'd still get a refreshed ""infatuation bar"" everytime she was nice to me, which would probably be pretty often if we were friends.

How are you supposed to be friends with someone when you can't get over how much you want to be more with them? It's all that's in my head. I know this much from experience, a similar thing happened with the only other physical member of my physics 101 class. We had to do everything in the class together, and every goddamn time it was hell. First it was me hoping to fuck that she'd say she liked me and end the anticipation. Then it was because I knew she was in a relationship and was trying desperately to not find her absolutely captivating.

It'd be the same shit with this girl.

I was lonely and had no one. I lost all my friends, all the people i liked.

i found this subreddit and a discord server that got promoted in here.  
i had a great Time in there at first. I vented, i finally felt understood. And the most important: i felt like i was part of something.   
I got to knew great people talked for weeks to them.  
With one Person i talked nights long. That Person told me a lot about themselve and i felt like we understood each other.  
I also became moderator on that discord and tried to make it possible to make people feel what i felt. TO finally find a safeplace.

The Person i talked nights long with told me about suicide and their suicide storys.   
But also that the server prevented another attempt and i felt so grateful for that.  


Then all of the sudden the Person left. I immediatly tried to add her and to reach out. To ask whats wrong. i was so afraid he might have harmed himself and that we would never meet again.  


just to find out that everyone i felt a deeper connection on there left me. They created a own server.  
Even the Person i talked about above.  
Now im sitting here crying. My suicidal thoughts are back.  


Even the people i felt understand me left me. Im left with one girl that i met on that Discord. She is a great Person. But thats it everyone else abandoned me. And i dont even know why. It seemed all great.  


Some are also on both servers. They turned their back on me but pretend as if everything is fine.

328,throwaway00788789,1651168688,1,"    Okay so I am writing this after writing the post. Its a bit ranty, venty and long sorry about that :( 
    I just want some input about what you think about my situation thats all :)

  


&amp;#x200B;

Life was hard for me. I never really had any real friends during my school time, never had any afterwards too.  
I was able to live with that. I never felt like I was missing much... well not really but I was reasonably happy where I was.  


I had my first break point about two years ago, where I realised the only person in my life is my mom. And I love my mom, but she cannot replace friends and relationships, nor should she. I became incredibly depressed afterward, cried almost daily for a week straight just thinking about that, when I dont change things asap, I will one day be alone. And I cannot bear that, things would get really dark really quickly should that happen, so I started working on myself more then ever.  


You see, because of my depression and difficult past experiences I am basically unable to work right now, and I am glad to live in a country where that is possible. I have a psychiatrist and working with her is fun if not challanging at times. I started to work on my self worth to a point where I actually like myself now! I started a diet and lost like a big chunk of weight and life was a bit brighter after that. I still dont have any friends but I now feel like I will be able too! So I started to go into a day clinic so I can meet new people and work on myself a little more.  


You see, I did have a little sneaky background mission because I wanted to try and maybe get into a relationship. I do not want to rush things, but I desperately wanted to meet people who COULD be potential relationship material, not only to get some new friends, but also to maybe find someone I can relate too and who can relate to me. I tried online dating but like... no that not my style and never will be.  


Funny thing is, I feel much better when I am around people, like my depression suddenly weakened. It doesnt matter what kind of people, but just talking to people casually, about hobbies, playing games or whatever. I feel even kind of happy! That vanishes as soon as I am back home and I become lonely and bitter and sad again.

You see, a big part of me also part of my depression and weird school life is the fact I am gay. I hated that part of myself for a very very long time. I hid it, and the times I showed it only reciprocated hatred or disgust of other people so that didnt make stuff any better. Now, a couple years later I am now way more comfortable with that fact and are basically ""out"" to most people.  


You see, I had hit a second depressive low not too long ago, a lonly low. I have no one that can hold me or hug me or comfort me in a way I want and desperately need, and that made me incredibly sad, like depressive sad. Thats where my sneaky background mission came into play where I maybe can meet other guys and try being more... ""out"" and maybe try making guy friends and maybe yknow ask someone out (or even better have someone ask me lol).  


Well we have a lot of people where I am currently, and even a couple in my age, but sadly all of them are girls :D. And I really like them! I love being around them like they are my little friend group even if we dont do stuff outside of the institution. But... I just feel alot happier being around them.  


But the fact that there are NO guys is really making me angry. I could always be with girls, never had any problems with them. I went there to try and work on these issues which is incredibly hard when there are no guys with me lmao.  


Well since Ill only stay there for another two weeks I dont really plan on making any ""real"" friendships out of this. After the day clinic however I will immediatly go into another very similar program, which will go on for much longer, multiple months even. I already visited that to have a look and the people there are almost all around my age, and its very evenly mixed. I cant wait to go there, to the point that I may be asking to go earlier... although I am kinda scared about asking because ... I dont really know, it feels like I am not appreciating the opportunity I have right now, which is stupid because this is exactly what it is for.  


So ... what did I want to say with this post? Now after writing it I dont really know. By writing it I am now realizing that I basically go into the right direction and am doing everything right. Maybe I just want to vent I dont really know anymore haha but I feel kind of better now.

329,Willing_Swordfish_76,1651168339,1,"It really sucks when you have people that call you a friend, cool, and say good things about you. Then they just stop caring. Whether or not you live close or even a few hours away. 

One of my best friends growing up recently in the last couple years just stopped responding to messages and calls. I know he is super busy, but I also know he uses his phone. Strings of messages over multi-month period. None responded to. Was the fucking best man at my wedding. 

Have another friend I absolutely adore but they stopped responding to my texts or even messaging me. Lots in common, have known each other for years. Found new friends which is absolutely amazing for them, but seems to have forgot I existed. 

Other friends that are local who did the same thing to me. Just off doing other things. Apperantly I'm just boring to be around because I like cars, beer, smoke among many other things. 

Like I don't fucking get it. I do work from home and will nit change that. But why does it seem like it's only me being friends with people. Like do they not know how much it would mean to me just to get a sinple text, or respond to on I sent them? I'm apart of no ones life and it really sucks. I'm just the really good, nice guy that's funny. I guess that's all I am to them. 

Sure I may be married but a spouse is different then friends. No one asks me how my day was. No one invites me to anything. No one really snaps me, or sends me tiktoks (first world problems right? Lol). Like all things I know they do, but not with me. 

Like wtf is wrong with me? Can I not be on someone's mind? Am I too much? Am I gross? Am I secretly a fat loser? Am i unfriend-able? 

I've literally met people doing things in my town and we talk and hang but then after a couple weeks it's the same old story. 

Life just fucking sucks. And yes.. spouses should make everything better and should be the only friend I need. However, it's not that simple for a lot of us. I struggle with depression sometimes, nothing bad. Just looking down on myself, or feeling sad that I'm once again alone at night if my spouse goes out and I have to stay at home.

My fiance is in prison and we don't get to talk much anymore since I've been working. We used to email every day but he can't get wifi in his cell so we never email anymore. He calls when he can but me being at work limits when we can talk. So communication with him is limited.

On top of barely being able to talk to him, my boyfriend is back into his addiction. He's kinda trying to come out of it but it's been really hard on him. We were talking last night and I told him I wasn't going to move money around for him anymore, because the way we were working stuff out was thru cashapp. He told me he understood that I didn't want to use my own money (he always paid me back) but that if I didn't move his money around for him then he wouldn't trust me anymore, it would create a wedge between us, and he'd just have someone else do it for him. I feel so torn up about what to do. On one hand, if I do it then I'm enabling him. On the other hand, if I don't do it then neither of us can trust each other and our relationship suffers.

I'm in emotional turmoil. The shit with my fiance is tearing me apart, and then I have to deal with a new job, trying to get an apartment, and all the other responsibilities of being an adult and trying to create a new life for myself. I know my fiance's family has my back but I just feel so alone. I've never had to deal with someone's addiction before so I don't know how to handle the shit with him, and it feels like there's a rift between us. I'm tired of being strong and trying to handle everything alone. I just wish I had someone to help me thru everything",lonely,Blah,2022-04-29 02:37:13

For a long time I thought I needed a sexual connection. But, the more I think about it, the more I desire and emotional connection with someone that genuinely cares. Almost like a mother figure. My mother was never really emotionally available to me as a child after being hurt by my father. Maybe she just didn't know how to love.
All of that brings me to what I ultimately long to find. A motherly figure that is close enough so we can get together occasionally. Sometimes we might grab lunch on my lunch break. Maybe coffee sometimes. On days where I need it maybe we just sit quietly somewhere and she can hold me like a mother would. And i could love her like a good son would. Age doesn't matter as long as you have a maternal instinct. I am not looking for financial assistance. And I'm not looking for sex.

I didn't really have any friends in public school, and for the first few years I was homeschooled, I had no friends at all. My parents eventually decided it would be best for me to join a homeschool co-op to meet some new people. A homeschool co-op is basically just a big group of homeschoolers who learn together and whatever. It's a little bit like a school format, with different classes and stuff throughout the day. 

The thing is, I quickly learned that a lot of homeschool families are super fucking weird after going to this co-op. If I had to put most homeschoolers into two categories, it would be people who are extremely, extremely religious and take their kids out of school for those reasons, and the other being pseudo-science nuts that believe in shit like vaccines causing autism.

But I mean like whatever, I was lonely as hell and as weird as I thought these families were, and as much as I disagreed with them on things, I thought maybe the kids would be less like their parents. Nope. Not at all. A lot of them were very sheltered, putting it lightly and a lot of them held the same beliefs as their parents. I had a very hard time connecting with a lot of them, and with the ones I did kinda connect with, I couldn't hang out with without their parents completely hovering over them the entire time, and I never really got close with any of my friends.

Now at 16, I finally have some people that I'm close with. But I'm still pretty lonely I guess. I think it would be awesome to have a friend group or something. I feel like I'm still kind of missing out on some teenager things. I'm out of that co-op now, but obviously not going to school means it's harder to find friends.

376,backwardsgirafarig,1651138035,1,"My mind has been a mess for quite some time now. I hope you understand why it might not be that very well written. 

When I was younger, I saw my dad beat my mom up because he caught her snooping on his phone. He was very angry at that time and now that I'm older, I'm only realizing that it might be because he was cheating at the time. The fact that I recall this scene as if it happened yesterday makes me think that it really traumatized me. I remember my then 14-year-old sibling held me in his arms as we listened to my father beat up my mom. My mom, a kind and quiet person didn't even have the heart to defend herself and just accepted it. I cried and cried. I bring it up nowadays to my siblings and they don't even remember it. Granted, my older sibling was probably 18 and the other was 14 so it was harder on 6-year-old me. My father remained emotionally abusive towards all of us. Think narcissistic. And I still live with my parents. I'm still suffering. I wish I could leave without feeling guilty.

A few years after that, I was sexually assaulted by my cousin-in-law's brother. He asked me to lay beside him to take a nap but the moment I did, he touched me. I trusted him because he was an adult. One night, he also kissed me. I was like nine? I don't know. I don't like remembering these things. Even in elementary school, one of my classmates sexually assaulted me too. Fuck all of them. I hate this chapter of my life.

High school and college were okay. It was, at some point, fun. I had friends and they're still my friends to this day. Most of them are settled down, married and some even have children. Sometimes, I would feel jealous but at the end of the day, I'm happy for them. Especially those who I personally helped, ie, I asked this one guy's number because my friend likes him and now they're married and have one child. I know they remember what I did because my friend still brings it up. It's a pretty great feeling.

My love life, or the lack thereof, is pretty shit. I've been in love with the same guy from high school who I connected with again last year only for him to ghost me. And, oh, before that, I was ghosted by several men as well. Now, I feel like I'm not even capable of loving anyone anymore. I am so tired and people still give me shit for being single at this age. 

I've always felt like a bystander watching good things happen to other people. I've lived a life but I don't really know if I were ever truly happy. If happiness hit me in the face right now, would I even know it? Life isn't fair, I know. And I wish I had known it a bit earlier.",lonely,Ramblings of a Bystander,2022-04-28 19:27:15

381,toast_ghost12,1651131873,1,"This is a pain I know all too well. To put it into perspective, I'm usually a very apathetic, cold (but not insensitive) person. Seeing this recurring theme as well as the posts here in general actually made me cry (and to the people suffering, I'm very very sorry) because it hits way too close to home.

This entire thought all together fueled my depression for the most part, because I was so convinced that I would live a lonely life and die alone with nobody to share it with. I let this thought pattern take over my mind and convinced myself that there would be no point in trying if I'll live a future devoid of love and social interaction.

This is obviously a bit egodystonic, so to speak. A healthy, happy relationship (frankly any affection, I just want to be held) would make me happy. So to defy this desire is in direct conflict with what you want. It can leave you feeling torn in two pieces; part of you that wants to share your life with that special someone, and part of you that's ready to give up.

Logically speaking, I can't predict the future, and neither can any of you. I've never been in a relationship, but I'm only 18. Does that mean I will never be in one? Not necessarily, and while that is a possibility, time is the ultimate deciding factor.

Every time I get messaged especially from people on my “friends list” on social media, it usually is asking something like a favor from me… like to buy something from them or vote for them to win some contest. I hate that. I won’t hear from them for months or years and then suddenly getting pushed to help them out of nowhere. “Oh help me help me! my car got a flat tire!” “help vote for me I need to win $600” “help me with my homework I cant understand it!!!!!”

Whenever I try to talk to them about what I want to talk about and myself… how I feel and whatnot they don’t want to talk to me. I be talking and get left on seen or short responses like they aren’t interested at what I’m talking about. JUST SAY IT TO MY FACE THAT YOU DONT WANT TO TALK.

Known eachother 2 years
Dated 11 months 
This is long distance only 4 hours away we saw eachother 4 different times from March to July staying the longest a week

1st issue text from 2 girls found her 1st visit first was a host of mine I own a talent agency for live streamers she had a crush on me told me she loved me I told her I don't said I gotta girl she sent me a tit pick I did not ask for I told her not to do it again the other was flirting but never anything that was gunna happen

My girl saw them and said both were full affairs and gave me a bunch of stuff on emotional cheating

She the was on me for everything if I did not answer how she wanted or fast enough 

This got to the point other people noticed 

In a call with 2 other females who we work with one being her best friend they told her she needed to stop she was treating me bad for no reason she said ""he cheated I can do what I want""

Her new best friend replaced me in August no time for me I had to schedule an hour just to talk to her 

November my bday month we break up stay friends and business partner 

Missed both my birthday events as a streamer 

Leave me alone for Thanksgiving Christmas and new years December I save her job and she pretty much said she's keeping all the month over the 11 months I spent between $6,000 and $10,000 on her and she never bought me a thing

She even got mad because after we were broke up I wouldn't let her come get a bunch of stuff I bought

The emotional cheating stuff she gave me her and her new best friend checked more than me she bought her gifts even other people said it seemed like I was the 3rd wheel in my relationship

I just had the most amazing long, great chat that I have had with someone in a very long time. I am so sick of feeling like no one cares, that I ended up on one of those random chat apps, because I just can't deal with it most of the time.

I fake it well, I hide it as best I can. But today I was down, really down. I had started to make some progress with a woman down south, and it turns out that she was just playing me, silly girl that I am I'm still a sucker for honesty.

I was gonna delete the app, and then between last night and today I began chatting to another person. Let's call this person J. J actually had a meaningfu, non sexual, interesting and fun conversation. But now the problem is, as always, I'm gonna hook feelings on this person I know doesn't give a shit about me, it was a random chat. Chances are she has already forgotten I exist.

All I want is for someone to care enough about me to actually want to get to know me. But how do we break out of the cycle of people that use, hurt and abandon. How do we get to the point someone wants to know us.

I feel this is a pointless task, J will never actually look my way, it doesn't matter to her, I was a pointless chatter. Being a gay woman in an isolated town, hating being around people, but just wanting someone to literally give a crap.

I wish J could know how it meant to me to feel important for a day. She probably never will, but it was something.

Nobody forced me to get married young, take on $100,000 in student debt and not finish the degree, or start cutting.

I grew up in a Hispanic household with a single mom and an older brother that was a gang member so growing up people always thought I was somehow affiliated. In reality I was allowed to go out because my mom would never allow me to be like my brother so I learned to find joy in books, animals and comic books but as the years went by things got more rough and I got bigger 5'11 300 to be exact so I always got seen as someone to fight to prove yourself. I hate violence but I had to fight numerous times, I portrayed myself as rough and rugged, I started smoking bud , cigarettes and alcohol at 14 just because I had to make myself seem like the people around me to fit in. But everyday I was scared to go to school because I didn't want to be bullied and I didn't want to keep fighting to walk in the hallways without someone trying to check me. But all those years of being the tough guy I lost track of who I am. I don't know who I am or what I can enjoy I stopped talking to people and slowly people just forgot about me and now here I am just trying to be human.

Hiding sadness hurts more than the sadness itself. What is my pain from? What I thought was the love of my life took my soul and tortured it to death, smothered every fiber of enjoyment I get out of life, ruined my view on trust and love. Am i broken? Maybe, but in the end it's my fault I couldn't make her happy enough, that's just how it's always going to go, sorry me, kinda wish we could've been better off. Maybe it's something from my past, I've been homeless, grew up fatherless, lived clueless, I still don't fully understand this world, it all seems so pointless when you look at it. I'll just close my eyes for the last time one day and that's it. So my idea was to be something the world remembered, thats good great.. not... but maybe I can find love and make sure I can help someone else with their pain, just so I can feel love again. I have happiness within myself, it's just battered and beaten up. I can say I at least try.

I just want to know what it feels like, I had fake love for 3 years and didn't know it, what is real love like? I'm to afraid to let someone in, every time I try they just don't respond. I just accept I'm not what someone would prefer, it just hurts. I try to workout,  sing, be funny, but for who? I'm still a stupid fuck who can't show love right, who wishes to have a family and just love my person forever. My lasts fleeting moments with her in my eyes. To enjoy drinks during a sunset, to feel every inch of her body and feel comfortable and passionate, funny laughs in the morning,  petty little arguments, Our favorite shows, just enjoy every part of each other in a whole. We'll always disagree on something but that's love right? Maybe... who am I to say. I've been having heart pains bad these past couple weeks, hopefully my deathbed isn't soon, I don't want other people to hurt, I also don't want to be alone, I want someone to wait for after death.

I miss her trying to teach me CSS and me trying to teach her music. I miss the little Javascript games she made for me. I miss random calls in the middle of nowhere about the dumbest of things and nothing in particular. I miss being there when she needed me and her being there when I needed her. I miss feeling like my heart beat for someone else.

I miss being understood. My first ex only gave half a fuck and my parents give less than none. I miss the ability to fully trust someone with all my heart and soul. I have nobody else in my life who I can trust that much, and after having experienced a truly mutually healthy relationship for the first time, I struggle to return to a life where I don't.

It's been 8 months since the breakup and the subsequent mutual decision to go no-contact for thr betterment of each others' mental health. That's longer than we've known each other for.

But I still don't feel like me. I'm starting to doubt I ever really *did* feel like me before she came around. Not even with my first relationship that turned out to be emotionally abusive.

thought that was it. Im just glad we know each other's names now and was gonna start using my phone

But now when I started out a new school around 2 to 3 years ago, I now have new friends, I'm not bullied, I'm invited to events and I even managed to get a girlfriend. But funnily enough my online friends aren't a thing anymore.

But I still feel lonely and empty. 

I guess it might be because my real life friends don't meet up that often. The same with my girl. And since my brain got so used to having social interactions over the internet quite constantly, having these big gaps in time where I barely talk to my friends, it really messes with me.

All my friends have found groups where I don't know anyone, but I feel like I wouldn't fit in there anyway. I was left practically alone. I had a girlfriend for a while, but even she left me. But she managed to tell me that I don't do anything and that I'm good for nothing, and then she told the whole school how bad I was. Since then, at the mention of the word ""relationship"", only bad memories come back and the whole day is practically ruined. I don't want to show it though; I try to act normal the rest of the day, but it's not easy.

458,thelonelyindividual,1651102226,1,"So I am unsure where to start with anything really. I always here of people I am friends with(people I go to school with who are some years younger than me), talk about going on reddit a lot and seeing post for so many different topics. I never truly know where to start with anything. I guess this is my little rant about how life just feels unfulfilling in the most part. I have friends and I have people I care deeply for, but i feel as if no one around me cares deeply for me. Is it my depression that makes me feel this way? Is it my train of thought that just confuses my mind and tricks me into believing I have no real purpose? I am not the best guy to look at and I tend to not be the nicest individual sometimes, but I feel like majority of the time, I have no one there for me at the end of the day. I work a fill time job and go to school part time while living alone and making it all by myself. I've pushed away people that care because of trauma I have endured before, and don't want to hurt them. But I then see them with someone else within a week. The person I really like for just seems to only care for the attention it brings them. I want to just say fuck it and tell the person how I feel, but it is also a person I work with. I am tired of being alone and always feeling sorry for myself. I want to be happy and joyful. Maybe not everyone is ment to feel joy in their life. Maybe we are, and I just tend to push away the good and only want the bad. I never have anyone to discuss my feelings with and my emotions are not something I wish to divulge and bring the bear of pain onto someone else. I just feel inadequate in so many ways. I doubt people will see this or even read it. So, the point of this, to my opinion, is purely for self release of agony and dispare. Maybe one day things will change. Maybe things will get better and I will find my reason. Find my purpose. I just really hope I'm not the only one who feels this way most of the time. Maybe. Maybe not.",lonely,No Where To Start..,2022-04-28 09:30:26
459,QueKings,1651101871,1,"Its very few people  in my life that's seen how I actually am and its not if I choose to pretend how I am at work or home, I just know if just keep my responses short and keep to myself then nobody would think a thing. Idk when I started to think I had to be this way, but I've been like this for  years, who wants to hang around the a guy that can't hold a conversation and does nothing for most of this time. Beck when loneliness was only an option for me, I could be social whenever I want, there wasn't sickness or anxiety whenever I spoke to someone. 

7^(th)  grade changed that for me. Relationship was fine but the breakup is probably the main cause of my issues today. Her mother found out we had sex and wasn't happy. Talk to my mother and had an agreement to say away from each other. I'll keep my distance in school and even when we had the same classes and after school when I would usually hang at the park after school, since she was always there just felt like I had to stay away from my friends. I could deal with that though, I always told myself that no matter what happened I could walk anything off. Boy was I wrong. I wasn't popular or anything but I did get around much, so people knew of me or at least my face. Probably a week after the forced breakup, I felt stares from all directions walking in the school. It wasn't the first time feeling this way but this was different. I used to fight a lot back in those days so coming to school the next day and having people stare at you was normal. These were stares of fear and disgust though. Even my closest friends ignored me or kept away from me and I so confused on the matter. Lunch, PE, normal classes, nothing but stares. Wasn't until one day a girl in my class came up to me and asked if I had sex with ( Imma call her Rose, not her real name) Rose, I was shocked and very uncomfortable. I asked how'd you know trying to figure out why rose would expose that. Then she asked if I raped Rose. Everyone around me went silent. I couldn't believe what I had heard and just stared at her. Idk what the look was on my face but after probably 10 mins of silence she said sorry and walked away.

This was the start of my end. For weeks I've felt these stares but I could've never guessed it was for this reason. People already knew that I fought and that just made me look worse. Even though everything was consensual and she was even the one to ask me and I asked her to confirm it again, I was now a rapist in those kids eyes. And people don't know how cruel kids can be and I never knew how weak I was. There was no defending myself cause who would listen, the things I was called and the bullying was out of control. I waited outside school ground until first bell rang and took the shortest way to class. I learned to keep quiet in and outside of class, even when the teacher called on me, I answered with idk or wasn't paying attention to get them to forget about me. Though my grade didn't fall thanks to the abundance of time I had to myself, I lost too many people I considered friends. All because of a rumor.

I guess Rose couldn't handle the guilt, its not as if she hated me, even tried to talk a few time but I wouldn't be stupid enough to let someone catch us alone for any reason. Rose came out and told the truth towards the end of the year. The deed was done though, she didn't really face any backlash and some people tried talking to me saying like,"" you should've spoken up"" or ""why didn't you say anything"". I felt as though when screamed and yelled, no one would listen.  She said her mother forced her to spread those rumors and a few other things but I couldn't care anymore. I was a shell of my former self and only had 1 person stick with me the whole way but too much damage was done. 

All I could do was blame myself, if I just hadn't done this or that, would I have been in this state, I asked myself everyday, every hour, every minute. I couldn't be around anyone, hardly slept and hardly ate. After a while things died down, only her closest friends stuck to her and I still kept to myself. There was no happy ending, and there would never be one. I was broken and beaten, and only told myself to walk it off and the more I did, the more I started to hate waking up the next day, I began to hate myself for not ending it all when things started to pop off. But I knew I didn't want to kill myself. I just hated the fact I had to exist. Even started prying for me not to wake up the next morning or to take away my existence. I gave up on faith shortly after. And that was only 7^(th) grade, the start of my decline. I don't mind opening up about this or letting know about 8^(th) grade: The aftermath and then the hell we call high school. Rose had moved to New York with her mom the following year and I've never seen her again. texted a few times through a friend but I still keep my conversations short because all I can remember when it comes to her, the hell I've been through.",lonely,Just don't want to exists anymore: The beginning,2022-04-28 09:24:31

I’m a 27 years old male, working full time, went abroad for my end of studies internship and worked there
I came back to my home country and it’s been a year. I can’t say I’m not privileged, got a good education and job, my family is together, but I’m dead inside and I feel like I just float in a sea with small islands of social circles. The more I look at it the more I think people in their 20-30s mostly hang out with the friends they made during studies and early years, and I’m down to only 1 friend that I see every month or so.

I have never had a serious relationship (more than 2 months I guess) and I progressively fear/run away from dating apps because I’m demotivated the moment I have to speak or meet, I don’t think I have a lot of green flags good enough to oversight the fact that I’m extremely lonely &amp; clingy. I did watch a few r/Healthygamergg on that and god I don’t know how to motivate myself.

I have an extremely bad habit of needing to show my competence and I rewind every single social interaction I have to blame myself, I was quite pressured in my studies and I guess I keep doing that shit. Been in therapy for 1y and a half, started taking anxiolytics to see if that helps but so far not much, I think I just have no motivation whatsoever to try and get out there, connect with people, I stay alone with YouTube and feel like shit every time I eat to cope.

I’m not a stranger to suicidal thoughts, scenarios and ideation, thank god I don’t live in a non regulated gun control country because I think I would have considered ending things way more often.

All that to say, I feel like I’m sinking slowly towards real depression the more the years pass and I only have my work to cope, I even open Slack at midnight to check and keep my mind busy. Chatting with my friend is mostly around work too because I guess I don’t have many passions left.

I am Avi. It's my nickname.  almost 17. 

I listen to music and also to podcasts. I listen to some hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi and hebrew songs and some times arabic too. Well I have a huge list of podcasts. My favourites are Simple ken. 

I am really into reading novels. I started reading recently but read a good number of books. I will be buying some novels soon. So, if you have any suggestions suggest me. 

I am currently trying to learn mimicry, Sketching and a lil bit of origami. 

Also I have started to write my dreams. They are weird. So, I thought why not write it. So, that I don't forget it. I have written one. I can share if you wanna read. 

Well I like talking about religions. I don't really know much but I try to know about religions. It's kinda cool btw I don't follow any religion.

I like learning languages and cultures of different places. The types of rituals, festivals people celebrate across the world.

I’ve got a bf but not even  he is that supportive as he used to be and it  really makes me feel alone. The last 2 years I’ve been suffering from all sort of things that can now be seen as trauma but at the time I didn’t know it was abuse and that it would hurt this bad but school definitely made that trauma worsen.

502,EERMA,1651085120,1,"It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control. 

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. 

 **Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",lonely,Feeling Overwhelmed?,2022-04-28 04:45:20

I am always tense and stressed around people and I think they perceive me as a hostile person, they stopped talking to me. Of course I don't blame them, talking to me is not fun usually. I feel incapable of being openly friendly, I feel very stressed and anxious. In the past I often found myself being ghosted or rejected, I didn't have many corrective experiences since.

I moved out to a different country. I have a few online friends but I can't make any long lasting friendships in real life.

Another thing is that it's hard for me to figure out what do people expect and what are the boundries of people towards newly met people, if that makes sense. For example could I suggest grabbing a coffe to a flatmate? (On that note, is it normal to invite a guy for a coffe without being perceived that I want a date with him?)

They‘ve been dealing with anxiety and depression and started to question everything and kinda confessed to me that they didn‘t love me romantically anymore. Since then I feel like my life‘s over. I‘ve tried my best to gave them space and time for themselves to figure them out, I read and watched several things about this topic, but so far it‘s been a waste of time.

I don‘t think I will ever find someone as amazing as them every again and it‘s breaking me. They were always I was always looking for in a partner, they were truly the love of my life. They even told me that they felt the same with me, but now they don‘t wanna try anymore, they‘re not even sure if they even want a relationship with anyone. This is the worst… because I really tried my fucking best to be an amazing partner but it somehow still wasn‘t enough? This was the first time I really felt appreciated and loved and desireable and now it‘s all gone and will probably never return. I‘m an awful human being, I don‘t have  normal things to offer and I‘m not even interested in most humans anyway. i have some friends and my family, but I‘m yearning for this intimate relationship I had with them. I felt comfortable around them like with no one else, I wasn‘t afraid to put of my mask around them and I trusted them with so many things about my own mental struggles. I struggled so hard to even told them that I’m trans! And now they’re  not even sure anymore if they’re even bisexual like they thought they were, which is the worst of all. They  started to question their gender too and I was always their biggest supporter, so I even made them part of my transition which I would never do with platonic friends. Those things are just too intimate and now I feel disgusting and  just weird to have them as just some person to know all of this about me. I would have to lie if I didn‘t thought about killing myself, though I would never do that. I wanna achieve my goals, I wanna go to university… I just… wanna be hold and be told that I‘m wonderful and loved for the way I am, that I am enough… I don‘t think I will ever meet someone who will look at me like I‘m the best thing in the world, I guess I don‘t deserve that anyway… I never did anything wrong tho, I tried my best, but I‘m simply not enough for others, no matter how hard I try.

The thing that messes up my head the most, a week earlier they already questioned some thing about us. They weren‘t sure what they even want with me and that I „will leave them anyway, so what‘s the point.“ Ironic that they‘re the one who leaves me!

527,FitAbbreviations4197,1651066067,1,"So I'm about to turn twenty and I’ve nearly finished my first year at uni. I rly thought I’d have found someone by now, all my friends have dated, but I’ve never even had a girlfriend. I've had romantic experiences before, I've kissed a couple girls, and done some bits, but It's always ended badly (both of them had boyfriends I was unaware about).

Every night I torture myself about how I can’t find anyone, I think I’ve thought about it every day since I turned 18. As a result I have extremely low self esteem and I constantly think about how I'm not good enough. I'm not even that afraid of rejection, so I don't know why I find it hard to approach girls, maybe because I just feel like there's no point. It's quite ironic really, because everyone says I come across as extremely confident and funny.

I know I'm not that old, and that it will probably happen eventually, but I just constantly have a voice in my head telling me that I'll never find love, and that I'm not good looking enough, or too weird. At this point I jus want to know if its possible for someone to like me.",lonely,I cant stop thinking about how I'm a virgin at 19,2022-04-27 23:27:47

I loved you so bad 
I didn’t believe in love 
the day you first made fun of my novels
you somehow knew all my tells
and that was that 

I loved you so bad 
i never ran into trouble 
you said have you ever been high 
that day I learned how to lie 
but not to you

I loved you so bad 
i could barely breathe 
so I grasped your shirt with fear
Your hands burned my skin
and yet I’d never felt safer 

I loved you so bad
so cold from the rain
I wept in your arms for the first time
like an idiot I kissed you in your car
so silly to think you were mine 

I loved you so bad 
but then i left for college 
before we knew it you’d fallen in love
I’m so sorry i left you alone
you keep me alive 

I loved you so bad 
like a kid who gets grounded 
and feels a mix of rage and shame
but unlike a kid I knew how to lie
how could I?

I loved you so bad 
but you never loved me back 
not like that

I loved you so bad
why did you ever kiss me
you know me better than anyone else 
and yet you ruined my life

548,OmarJab,1651054923,1," 

I thought a lot about my situation, i spent days and nights wondering why I'm this lonely and eventually, I figured out the reason, or at least one of them.  
The problem is that I'm boring. I spent my last year focusing on my future and career and basically forgot how to have fun with others.  
When I was young I was the complete opposite, I was the kid in class that would talk to anybody with no problems and was able to keep the conversation going for hours. Literally, with anybody.  
Everything started to change after 2019 and the pandemic only gave me the final hit, the one that I didn't need but still received and it completely changed me.  
It's not the pandemic itself that has ruined me because I was already used to staying home and not going out for long.  
The problem though is that it made me realize how lonely i was.  
During that period I've also lost my bond with a girl that i liked (a lot) and who was the only that was helping me to keep going.  
After i lost her, everything has fallen apart, i was completely lonely and the 2020's summer was for sure one of the worst periods I've ever lived.  
There wasn't a day where i didn't cry, inside, not outside because for some reason i can't..  
I eventually asked some people out but they were all ""busy"" with their friend groups so they would always deny or make an excuse.  
I made it through, somehow, i survived, thank god.  
In the late part of that summer, i met some people, online, that helped me to get a little bit better. In particular, a girl.  
Going forward, i also met another girl near me, but due to some reasons, it wasn't easy for us to meet but at least we kept talking and only now i realize how lucky i got to meet her, and I'm grateful for that.  
Somehow i managed to also get through that year at school even though the period from March to June wasn't the best and I've completely felt alone.  
Fortunately, i made a friend before the beginning of the summer so i finally had someone to spend my summer with. I was really happy and grateful for that, i don't know if it was the same for her, but i hope so.

But now, let's talk about why i said i'm boring.  
Why do i think that about myself? Because whenever i have the chance to talk to someone, i don't know what to say and as an overthinker, when i see that the other person seems (even if it is actually that way) a little bit detached or cold, i panic and don't know what to say and give up on keeping the conversation.  
In-person it's a little bit better, even though there are a lot of silent moments, i try to find something to talk about but still, it ain't .

I'm kinda boring because i focus on other things rather than the ones, most people my age, do.  
Like, whenever I'm free, I will be looking for new things to learn and to improve, so what would i talk about with other people? nothing.  
That's why they avoid me, they only talk to me when it's needed (ex: school work) and nothing else. Because of that, people don't even ask me out or invite to do some things together.  
I can't complain tho, i recognize my flaw and i would probably do the same.  
It's obvious that nobody likes to spend their time with someone they think is boring.  
This has lead me to slowly accept my loneliness and start a solo journey of improving myself and learn as much as possible and i'm satisfied with that at least, but sometimes i would like to have somebody to spend my free time with, talk, have fun and much more but it seems it's impossible for me.

Don't get me wrong, i'm extremely grateful for my life. It could have been much worse and i'm grateful for the little good things i have. Thank you god and thank dad and mom.

I hope god has better plans for me for the future, i think i deserve it &lt;3",lonely,Quick vent about my situation why i'm boring and why I feel lonely,2022-04-27 20:22:03

And, I guess I understand. But, I don't, all the same. What's wrong with getting to know someone who has this issue? I am inwardly conflicted about how I should feel about this, but at the end of the day, I shouldn't feel anything about it.

Anyways, tonight, after several months, have finally 'found' the missing links for my webcomic's overarching (and underlying) plot. I have been getting the chills for a while, as it's better than I had imagined, and less contrived than what I had feared. I can finally write that initial scene that I have skipped over, since I knew it would need to tie deeply into the underlying narrative, and didn't want to commit to something before figuring out how exactly it would tie in, and which details would be important. I had almost lost hope that I'd be able to conceive a layered plot, so, I feel a lot of relief. I just wish I didn't go through the effort of opening up to that person. In my opinion, success isn't the end-measure of a person's value. 

I think that my future became a bit less bleak, though. Realistically, as a severe sufferer of GAD, if I can create something that blows someone away... if I can create a genuine fantasy of any size, my life will have some more solid purpose, and it could become or catalyze a proper career. I'll consider it... my portfolio.

Is it wise to put all my eggs in this basket? No. I'm a burden to my parents, and my depressive state saddens them. 

But this is all that I'm good for. The writing was on the wall, and the seeds sewn as far back as kindergarten, that I actually am some sort of a creative project leader, though, I don't need to lead anyone. I'll do it all myself, and it will be a story that, though has its inspirations, will definitely have its own identity. I'm not a huge reader, so I can't say for certain that a similar plot hasn't been done, and though there are only so many types of plots one can make, I think all the circumstances within it justify it as being referenced as unique, because my mind's pretty weird!

I can actually feel hope without having a girlfriend right now- it's a pretty interesting revelation! And a momentary break in that encroaching vignette of crushing despair!

I started to open my heart to the idea that I could love again, feel those emotions again and I did with the most beautiful Irish girl you’ve seen, her eyes are astonishingly deep blue, her smile lights up the room and when she laughs it warms my heart deeply. I sadly cannot say she feels the same though, I haven’t asked her directly however I know with certainty I’m not thought of in the same light, my feelings are one sided as a “friend” of mine took joy in telling me and I quote “(Blank) doesn’t even remotely like you back lmafo told you, you were hoping for a miracle” and then proceeded to show me a screenshot of her saying “I like him as a friend if that’s what you’re asking but I don’t see anything more in it” as you can imagine I told this former “friend” to get lost in other words because of the way he told me. 

Now as much as it hurts that it’s not reciprocated, I still want to be there for her and I now feel like if I’m a good friend to her, if I have her back then I’ll be able to help her find happiness with someone she likes or even loves. In my heart it would be painful but in my mind I cherish the thought of her happy, enjoying life and being with someone she wants to be with. 

There may be a time in future when she finds out my feelings and a conversation has to be had about them but for now I keep it to myself, locked away to be forgotten or as best as it can be. I don’t think my heart can take the loneliness anymore but the thought of outright rejection from even being a friend terrifies me even more so for now I’ll close off my heart to stop it from hurting as much but one day I might be happy, one day I might get my moment and when it comes I’ll be the happiest man on earth.",lonely,Failing in love,2022-04-27 17:47:34

No one looks at me in the eye when I speak or am part of a conversation. When I try to hang out with others they grow quiet, check their phones or leave the room. 

I don't know if it's my face or my personality or my poster or what. I have some social skills, so I know that I'm not rambling or oversharing. In fact, plenty of times I will be talking about, let's say, a show, and I'll be interrupted so someone else can say the exact same thing that I was saying. I am kind, not mean, I secretly have depression but I will smile a little and put on a happy face. I think I'm a bit funny. I think I'm not very pretty and someone once told me I'm very average looking, so that should at least mean that I am not ugly right? So is it a problem with my looks? 

It's so incredibly sad and frustrating when I say hi to someone I know and they don't say it back, or when I say something in a conversation but no one looks at me or responds and just acts like I'm not there. Sometimes in a group setting someone just walks over and stands in front of me like I'm not even there. And the thing is that it's not just a few people who treat me this way, it is literally everyone that I encounter. It makes me want to cry, scream and punch things but I know that I can not do all that so I just cry.

I graduated high school just before the first lockdown, after my graduation I made a brave decision to cut off all my toxic friends, which ended up being my entire friend group. I was hopeful about making new friends after cutting off my high school friends because i was transferring to college and i would surely make tons of friends there, right? 

wrong, the first lockdown became another lockdown and two years pass and I am only now able to go on campus with the exception job of wearing a mask, not that i’m complaining, i actually love wearing a a mask. anyways, i would be excited about campus opening up again, however i’m literally graduating in a week (graduating two years early!) 

i spent my entire college experience behind a computer screen with no social interactions, i didn’t get the chance to be social and i felt so isolated during this whole covid situation. 

fortunately in going to a graduate school in the fall, hopefully i’m able to make friends there but i honestly don’t even know how to socialize anymore. i don’t know how to make friends or talk to people. how do i even approach random people? what if they think i’m weird? 

i like spending time with myself, however i would love friends and to talk to people in real life rather than behind a screen , but i don’t know how to approach people.

I'm doing better much of the time these days, but today I had an epiphany about the source of my loneliness -- the first time I ever felt that I was truly alone in the world, and that no one cared about me.

I was 4 years old, and I'd gotten in trouble for doing something wrong. I don't know what. My mom decided to give me a spanking with a belt. I was a sensitive child,  so this hurt me a lot, especially since I had no idea what exactly I had done wrong.

So I cried and I cried afterwards. I sobbed so much that I made myself throw up. My mom got really upset with me. She started blaming me and yelling at me that I had done it on purpose to manipulate her into making her feel bad for hitting me. She made me clean up my own vomit.

It's truly fucked up. Even the story I tell myself about this event is that I *made* myself throw up. No, I was just in fucking pain. And I got absolutely no comfort from anyone and was even further punished and blamed for crying. It was at that time that felt, deep down inside, that I was truly all alone and that I would have to fend for myself for the rest of my life. My life has followed this blueprint ever since.

I'm a junior at college, and it's the week just before finals. A lot is going on. I feel let down today, I also feel I have let down others. I feel I could've done better. And a scenario of what could have been done better is constantly running in my mind, in the middle of the night. It's just difficult to go through all of this alone,  and yearning for affection, yearning for an old version of yourself who you know would've done a better job, wanting to have your person to lean back on when it all gets overwhelming.

As the title says I’m lonely in highschool. I’m a sophomore and I’m new to my school. Every day I walk to school alone. In the hallways between classes I walk with no one. During lunch I find a place to sit outside alone because I don’t like sitting alone in school while everyone is with their friends, it makes me feel even more lonely. During class I sit alone and it makes me feel sad, jealous and left out hearing others have fun with their friends. All class I’m either doing work or if I’m done I just start playing on my phone and watch Netlfix. I struggle with being introverted and I’m not confident to enough to talk to people first or start up the conversation. I sort of wait and rely on others to talk to me. Although I do understand that this affects my chances of making friends. But at the same time, it’s hard for me to “break out of my shell” (as my mom says) and open up to people. And if I do talk to others and actually try to have a conversation, I’m always overthinking and regretting thinking that I might’ve sounded weird or made a bad impression. I try my best to be respectful to others. I let others speak their mind, try not to interrupt others when they are speaking, respect their personal space among others things that really everyone should be doing. The thing is too I have many friends. Its just that they all go to different schools. When I’m out of school I have so much fun being with my friends playing video games, watching movies and playing basketball. It’s just I have almost no experience making new friends. All my friends I made were back from grade school where self-esteem and confidence didn’t really matter at that young of an age. I have 1 really close friend and we hang out sometimes and they’re really nice to be with. But that's about it. Besides friends I have been getting good grades and I’m grateful to be in a healthy relationship with my family and fortunate to have a decent amount of wealth. But even with all these good things its been really challenging mentally and I’m scared that the rest of my highschool life will be like this. I know I have to open up, I know I have to change a bit and I know that I have to overcome my problems with myself, but it’s hard. I don’t know if it’s because I’m unlucky or because there's a problem with me that I can’t see, but I’m in a really dark place right now.

Like, what's the point of putting effort into things you don't like or want to do when the outcome is also undesirable or blurry at best. Like, a hyperbolic example would be like your boss asking you to work the weekend but they wont pay you for it. You obviously wouldn't just work for nothing on your day off, but you might if they offered you a million dollars. I think the same applies for any action a person might do; that the degree of motivation dictates our endeavors, whether those motivators are personal or external. I don't believe I have any motivation to do anything other than the bare minimum required to survive an be comfortable, yet I still desire things like a relationship, wealth, or property. I just don't believe that my desires are achievable and therefore have no motivation to chase them. Like, I'm sure we all want more money and might be willing to work extra to make it, but like in my example, you wouldn't put in extra work if you were told you wouldn't get paid for it. I'm not even sure why I lost hope to begin with, but I doubt that I can get it back simply by thinking harder or by listening to the words of strangers.

658,Vassrugge,1651001676,1,"I feel like I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do about it. 

The day I turned 18 I ran away from home and never looked back. One of my parents suffered from extreme mental illness and living anywhere else was better than there. I saved $400 and moved to a new country where no one could get to me. And I moved straight into the arms of a drug addict and abuser.

I was heavily abused for four years by a man and his mother.  The last straw was when I realised they were drugging me with benzos to stop me from leaving. He tried to kill himself the day I told him I was leaving, and I still looked after him through his overdose and made sure he got the medical attention he needed. 

I finally escaped and put myself in a womens shelter, found a job and put myself in higher education. I had a new partner, a life trajectory, a stable and settled life after years of abuse and traumatic experiences. When I left him, I had no education, I couldn’t speak the language, I had no friends and no work experience. He didn’t let me have any of those things, I was 22 and alone in a different country with no money and nowhere to go.

___

I came off of my meds this spring thinking the sun was out and the weather was right to try again. In 2019 my entire family started dying of (unrelated) terminal illnesses and as an only child with no cousins I was readying myself for the worst. I was 25 and being hit with the harsh reality of being left entirely alone in this shitty world. 

I dropped out of school and looked after my dying grandma full time that year. I barely made ends meet being paid the bare minimum by the state as her designated carer, and we can’t afford a care home. 

It’s 2022 now and no one has died, and I’m grateful. I have no idea what miracle blessed my family that they ALL recovered from different sorts of stage 4 cancer but here we are. I thought I could come off my mind-numbing meds come spring and sunshine. 

Then my partner had a nervous breakdown and I was back to looking after someone else all over again. 

I caught covid the same week he broke and became severely sick. I still can’t breathe properly but I can’t tell anyone because everyone relies on me to be healthy. 

Now my grandma is dying and I’m back looking after her. I’m soon to be left alone again.

I’m failing school because all my time goes into looking after other people. I’m scared i’ll have to tell my work I won’t be able to come in any more because my life is falling apart, and I just don’t have the energy to keep holding it together. I don’t have any money because any penny I make goes to bills and care for others. 

I don’t have time for friends, and there aren’t enough hours or energy left in my body to take care of myself or have hobbies. I am drowning and honestly death is starting to sound nice because it would be some form of rest. 

I feel selfish, and guilty. I want to leave everybody behind and take care of no one but myself. Disappear into the ether where no one can find me and ask for my help.",lonely,Could someone just tell me I’m going to be OK one day?,2022-04-27 05:34:36

I'm here again and I don't really think I'll get over this deep loneliness that I feel inside. Even if I did feel happy, immediately after that I feel the loneliness crawling on my body and eating me alive. It's exams week today, I'm already overwhelmed and stressed about everything.

I don't think I'm learning despite some good marks, I see myself as nothing without these achievements and I have to keep myself busy otherwise, I'll be more and more stuck in my loneliness.I grew up in a household where your worth is defined by what you accomplished every day and that sucks.. I can't even concentrate for too long, I'd have to play a movie or show to keep me somewhat going and then I'll just see myself just watching. I hate this. I'm not as studious as I used to be. Looking back during f2f classes, I didn't know how I managed to do those things. I just feel nothing, I know who I am but I don't at the same time. Today I saw my classmates posting stories about them having study group sessions and I know to myself that I learn better by self-studying but I still feel some sadness that I don't have anyone I can connect to. Even with my only two friends, we don't really know everything about each other. It's because I also hide myself. I want someone to connect with but as a way of guarding my sanity, I just chose what I want to show. I had one guy that I really connected with but I broke my contact with him because I was getting distracted with school and stuff. I regretted it. He was so nice to me, we just click.

2 other friends who get along with my best friend's boyfriend have only come back into my life because said boyfriend is too busy to speak to them.

Family is a mess, immediate family was emotionally abusive, and I've recently moved out.

Got Tinder to see if I could find some sort of friendship or anything to distract me or start something new with no luck as of yet.

Even mates and normal friends don't provide the bare minimum.

Trying not to give up and end it all, but I've been having bad thoughts for years now. I've become a worse person because of it. Shared it all with my best friend and she hasn't responded in any meaningful way (said a bunch of words, but that's all they were). In fact, she judges me for some of the defense mechanisms I've had to gain over time, saying they're ""not fair to new people"", which is true but I have no reason to care.

Sometimes I'd fantasise about love and romance and it would give me hope. I used to watch romantic films/movies but I don't anymore. It just makes me sad and upset. Like what's the point of hoping when reality is way different than your expectations? Sometimes I wish I weren't a hopeless romantic. I wish I didn't have a big heart. I wish I was desensitised to all feelings and emotions. 

And the worst part of it all is, when people make you feel pathetic about it. ""love isn't all that"" ""being in a relationship isn't going to make you happy if you aren't happy with yourself"". Just because you (or the person you're with) are not putting in 110% of course the relationship isn't going to feel amazing. Or perhaps I don't have a blue what I am talk about.

dissolving with time

fading away into infinity

still passionately
waiting for someone.

Turns out I’m an emotional drunk.

I start crying after being 10ish drinks in.

Eventually go home, drunk text a few people, one of them being a small crush I had.

We start talking more.

She wanted to install Tinder again and find someone else.

I confess that I like her.

She says she’ll see how it’ll turn out between us, we should hang out more and get to know each other more first but as a group as opposed to just the two of us.

Turns out she’s also speaking to another friend of mine, decently close at that. (This friend at the time when we were drinking was already talking to another person and was making out with them in front of us too)

Her replies start becoming blunt whenever we talk, one worded or just uninterested. 

I feel this and start to give up. 

Two days later I get a message from them, in a nutshell she hit it off with my friend better, and didn’t want to lead me on, these two also hit it off during college too but didn’t go further for unspecified reasons.

I play it off and wish then the best of luck. 

I’m on call with my other friends, I start crying and punching my wall in anger.

He's really friendly, but also kind of nerdy. There was one time when he asked me what I was doing that weekend (we asked each other that question frequently). I told him, and asked him what he was going to do. He then said that he was going to visit his friend at work. He said ""I'm not going to say no to bothering someone at work. I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?"" I didn't know he was flirting then, but I do now.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my birthday party. I figured what better way to show him that I'm interested than by inviting him? I messaged him on Instagram. He messaged me back saying he wasn't sure, but that he'd let me know in a couple of days. That week at work, he was acting kind of distant. He wasn't necessarily cold, just not quite as receptive as he had been before. He told me later that he wasn't able to make it. For the next couple of weeks, he was distant. I never knew what I was going to get with him. Some days, he was talkative like always, and other days, he was avoidant. Keep in mind, the same week that I invited him to my birthday party, he accepted a promotion at work, so he has the title of department lead. Department lead is basically like assistant manager.

After about three weeks of the behavior, he's been somewhat back to normal. Because of the new semester, our schedules don't match up as much anymore, so we see each other less often at work. However, he's been friendly. One day, I said hi to him, he said hi back, and I had to go sanitize tables. When I came back, he gave me a hi five and asked me how I'm doing. It was Valentine's Day, and it could be a coincidence, but he's never done that before. We usually just say hi and that's it. In fact, he doesn't like touching people in general. At least, I've never seen him voluntarily touch any other coworkers. Just a few weeks ago, he came in, and asked me if things had been busy. I told him it was slow. So then he said ""so you've just been hanging out looking pretty the whole time?""

717,Orbitofchaos,1650956947,1,"Everyone always talks about loving yourself first, knowing your worth, and enjoying your own presence and alone time before liking anyone else or getting into a relationship. But no one talks about the loneliness you feel when you do love yourself, know your worth, and enjoy time alone, but no one wants you still. Overall I like who I am as a person, I think I have clear strengths, I’m the gift giving, physically affectionate kind of person. I appreciate tiny things and thanks to my raging ADHD I can be a pretty spontaneous and fun person to be around when I go from shy “leave me alone” to dancing with strangers. I’ve learned to love my alone time but now that I’ve hit that stage I’d also like to share space and time with someone else. Being aware of my good qualities and “my worth” only puts salt in the wound when I’m forced to ask myself “if I can do all of this why does no one want me?” I think sometimes, as cocky as it sounds Ik, how I would be the perfect girlfriend since I’d care so much and cater to their needs or because our personalities just match so well; but then it stops at that when I never become that girlfriend… to anyone. It’s hard to explain honestly but there’s this weird feeling of not being enough that comes out of knowing you are (?) 

Once I became more aware of what I have to offer I’ve started to wonder why no one else sees it or I think that if I have these good qualities then what am I doing wrong to not be attracting anyone. I think how I tend to love hard and have never in my life been loved the way I love others. Everyone deserves love so why am I never receiving any. What is it about me that isn’t meeting the criteria for anyone else? 

After hearing this I truly resonate with it: “don’t you think it’s possible that some people are born to give more love than they will ever receive in return.” 

So much of my energy is put into other people or doing the things I don’t have any choice or control over and it’s exhausting. It’s an endless cycle of having so much hope that maybe THIS person will finally be the one and I’ll receive the love I deserve.

I suppose it's late and my mind if just wandering,

I've always felt like a lonely person for a while now, I am aware I have friends and family and that I am surrounded by many people and all the while I am truly grateful for this.

I've always longed for a partner, someone special and dear to me, someone I can cuddle up with and someone that would make me feel less lonely, not to say I'd put all my happiness into a person but I'm just saying it wouldn't be bad to feel like you special to someone else.

Anyways I did find that special someone for the first time in my whole life, it was kind of shocking to me seeing thought I did not know how I had accomplished this, she was everything to me, she made me happy and made me feel whole. I think I made the mistake of putting all my feelings with her but regardless after she broke up with me it just made me feel even lonelier than I already was.

I'm always up late at night again always thinking of these things, how I wish to be special to someone and how I know this special person will come eventually, I'm just really lonely and sad. I just feel empty all the time and I just feel like I should belong to someone.

My GF of almost 4 years just got home from a few days away with a close female friend and left me. She claims I am not working hard enough to improve myself, my livelihood, my living situation, or my mindset. Continued in post.


I work in data management for a large oil &amp; gas engineering firm. I met my GF on my lunch break almost 4 years ago at the local downtown library where I would sometimes go on lunches to find a quiet spot, read, she calm my mind (my job is rather stressful). She was then a receptionist at another close by downtown firm and came to the library for similar reasons. We bonded over our shared love of books, music and film.

Since then, my position at work has stayed essentially the same, with minor pay raises on set dates. She has been promoted multiple times from reception up to lower management. She has made more money than me for a couple years now but says she doesn’t care. But I gave long suspected that she does.

I knew things had somewhat been fading between us for at least a year, but I attributed that to all relationships kind of slowing down, losing intensity and heat as time goes on.

We were still having pretty good sex fairly frequently and getting out and doing activities and talking and everything what I thought was a healthy amount when we weren’t at work.

Now, I’ve never been in the BEST of shape, but, since having a VERY serious (as in, I came very close to dying) bout with Covid in November 2020, my energy levels have been much lower and I’ve put on some pounds as result.

Still, I am what I would consider “husky”, no larger, and she has a extra pounds, as well (we have always had that in common).

Anyway, in the incredibly emotional 5 hour long incredibly heated “dumping discussion” we had, she basically turned all that on my head and said that what I viewed as “good enough”, she viewed as NOT good enough, and had apparently been into my for the majority of our time together that she wanted me to improve myself and my life in almost every way, and she was getting continually more and more dissatisfied with my lack of ambition and lack of drive to change.

We had grown (I thought) closer together during Covid / work from home (I have continued to work from home but she has been back in the office for almost 2 months now) but it turns out she had just been getting increasingly frustrated with how easily I adapted to being housebound and “using Covid as an excuse” to stop going out, stop exercising as much, stop caring about my appearance, and to not seek more gainful employment with better chances of promotion, higher pay, and potential travel / vacation opportunities (she has always wanted to travel and one of the things she has enjoyed most as she got promoted at her job has been the opportunity to go on exciting business trips to meet with vendors and potential new clients, one of which was the trip she had just returned from before ending things between us).

I am shook. Destroyed. Grief ridden. Giving my dog endless hugs. It has taken me 2 hours to type this post. And I could go on and on.

I FUCKING LOVED HER WITH ALL MY HEART. All my other relationships were shit, garbage, infantile, compared to her. She took me from worrying I would be alone together to literally starting (in my head) to plan a marriage proposal to her around her birthday near Christmas of this year.

Now I am left scared I’ll be alone forever again, with the added irony of now knowing just how good things can be.

How could I be so stupid, so oblivious, so blind?

How did I miss what she said were very frequent warnings and notices from her?

Was I just really that stupid? I like to think I’m a fairly smart and observant guy.

How could this have happened? Should I attempt to stay in contact with her, maybe get her back? She returned every gift and shared belonging and packed up all her possessions and is now staying with her parents in literally a different province.

I have not been able to summon up the courage to contact her again yet.

I am about to get very VERY drunk.

Any tips or advice for moving on / forward / how to deal?

I think being alone rocks. I am lonely, but i stopped caring a long time ago. I have all the time in the world to do things that I enjoy. 

I went to watch The Northman by myself at the theater,  a theater where ive been at with other friends that I've since lost, and i thought I'd be sad that they weren't there with me.

 But tbh i wasnt sad about it. I refuse to be sad anymore. I know whats coming is mine, i understand that sometimes in life we are forced to be alone, for whatever reason. Growth, change, opportunity, whatever.

 There are better days ahead but that is no excuse to neglect the present. Go watch that movie by yourself. Go dine in somewhere GOOD by yourself and enjoy every second.

I decided to go to a college a few hours away since my friend was going here and it had a better computer science program. Ever since then I have managed to not make a single friend in these two semesters besides our roommate who is awesome but we aren't that close.

I had a gf when i got here but things ended very badly at my expense around 2 months in to college. After that I didn't have the self esteem to try to make friends and I basically locked myself in my dorm and only left when I had to. The loneliness was crippling to say the least lol. It eventually caused my grades to suffer but i managed to get all A's except one class.

Going home to my family helped a lot and I helped my grandparents with numerous projects which made me feel a huge sense of accomplishment going back for this semester. Now here I am, barely getting b's in my classes, still no college friends, and am again secluding myself in my room skipping classes just playing guitar and video games. 

I realize skipping classes doesnt really help my chances but i'm scared of how my professors and peers would view me seeing me come in after so long. I do also have friends from home on discord that i talk to, but because of group drama, 3/5 friends left and i decided to stay with the two that I did because i've known them for a long time, despite being told to not be around them. I love them to death but they are negative people, not mean or bad people, just negative. I'm hoping I can get my stuff together and maybe meet someone sometime soon and find people who are positive and challenge me to be my best and step outside of my box, but i can't seem to even start even when i try.

762,muhshrm,1650938416,1,"I \[23M\] was pretty excited to finally move out of my small town and into a bigger city for university. I'm a couple months in and I find it really difficult to make friends. It felt as though that most people I tried to make friends with in my classes tried to keep me at arms length. Lots of people here feel very reserved and cliquey.  

There is a discord server where I regularly talk to some people but I get the feeling that they tolerate my presence more than see me as a friend. It doesn't help that they constantly talk about their relationships and people they've hooked up with, which only seems to fuel this feeling of loneliness. The people I have tried to hangout with are mostly interested in raves and large parties, something I'm not all too interested in as I have a rather low social battery. I'd prefer something more chill - like having a friend over for a drink and some board games.

I tried to use dating apps to find any sort of connection but most people I matched with aren't that interested in small talk or anything beyond wanting to hookup. I'm demisexual so it's very difficult for me to feel any sort of sexual attraction to anyone without at least getting to know them better. (Not sure if this is nsfw, so I'm marking it just in case)

I feel like I've never had a proper best friend; I've just been seen as someone that people would talk to if their primary friend(s) aren't available.

I could be my true self with her, and she could be her true self with me. She made me laugh, think, and imagine a future that I never could have before. And I just broke her heart.


I hadn’t felt like it’d been the healthiest for a while, because of both our insecurities feeding off one another. It became something that would keep me up half the night, when I’m someone who desperately needs structure, routine, and sleep to function. I almost ended it a while back, but we decided to work on ourselves and our relationship instead. I kept finding that working on myself was significantly harder due to worrying about her, and I don’t think I can afford that extra stress in my life right now. I have a history of self-destructive, sometimes suicidal behavior, and I can’t risk it. So I said goodbye about an hour ago.


I plan to continue pursuing progress and improvement, including therapy, but I know it’s going to be hard. I have zero friends within 100 miles, and she was the only person I ever talk to.

After 2 years or so It all went down. All because of one which i will call X. Well after two years things started to happen, my closest friend went to depression and started to be home from School. We were making fun of by other people because of that so X decided that we should agree on freezing him out of our group. Everyone agreed except me ig, didn’t se anyone else being doubtful. 
But I went along. Now we were up too

Next one was put out for being himself. This is when i started to think that i would happen to me. I’m still friends with him today but for me It doesn’t feel like were friends, but classmates.

And then another for liking someone else. When I mean liking someone else, he liked the new friends he got. He was short and no one liked him except me because I have empathy compared to X.
After these two we were up too 3.

Well our friendship lasted 3 months. I always felt like the third wheel when I was with them. The other friend made me uncomfortable and always made the atmosphere weird. This only happened when they asked me weird questions.

Suddenly one day they stopped calling me. After a week no calls. This time I knew that It was my turn. I felt scared and at the same time stressed. They were the one who cured my depression and now they’re gone? 

I’m right now in my bathroom writing this 23:41, 25 April on a Monday. I had a shower and got a idea to write this to see if someone was in my position. I got a gym card and gym for fun not for my body, It makes me forget all the things about life. I also play games for example LoL, and yes I play that 2022 because It makes me have the same feeling when i played Fortnite with my friends years ago. But even tho I do or have these things, so am I still scared of the future of having no friends. At night’s i just want to cry and have someone to socialize with. And I NEVER been loved my whole life which makes life harder. The only thing that was nice this year was to get a message from one of my female friend which I don’t know much but we just talk sometimes and help each other In school, we’re just help friends. She just texted to me that she was angry, I thought, out of everybody me? I helped her calm down and she was very grateful and when i was worried she called me cute for being so protective. That made me feel better, just one word. Right now writing this I just want to not exist, life Is to hard right now. And the early darkness here makes It 2x worse. You can say that I lost my life nothing to live for.

799,Witty-Aioli-4524,1650924407,1,"Hi guys,
I’m writing this here because I need to get it out and I can’t confide in any of my friends. 

I’m 24 and I’ve never been in a relationship. I’ve gone on plenty of dates (more than any of my friends) but things have never worked out. I’ve really been working on my self love over the past few years and tbh a lot of these dates could’ve become relationships but I wasn’t willing to deal with shitty behaviour for the sake of getting into one. 

A good few of my friends are in long term relationships and I get on really well with their partners, but in the past few months ALL of my single friends have found someone. It really hit me this week when my last single friend (who’s also my housemate) started getting really serious with the guy she’s seeing, she’ll be coupled up by the end of the month.

I feel like a horrible horrible person because even though I’m absolutely delighted for her and for all my friends who are happy I’m also sad. I’m crying typing this because I can hear her on FaceTime to him and I’m just scared of the loneliness that I’m gonna be facing into. But I also just felt so fucking SELFISH typing that sentence. I made a joke earlier on that I’ll have to make an appointment to hang out this month and she said ‘oh don’t worry, me and ___ will be happy to hang out with you’. It probably meant nothing to her but the thought of being seen as a third wheel is just shit. 

Apologies for the rant but I just had to get it out there.",lonely,The last single one in the friend group,2022-04-26 08:06:47

It was terrible for me way before it even ended (which is why it ended), so the stress has been building for years now. The loneliness, the hopelessness, the lack of security. 

And today I feel the continuous stress I hold inside (topped with anxiety disorders) has done something bad to my heart. I've always had issues with skipped heartbeats, but I've had them checked out and was told they were harmless. This last 10 or so days though, I've been having these insane skipped beats that get really erratic and make me feel faint. I didn't rush to the hospital bc I've had it happen before where I was ok. But it's not exactly the same feeling as usual. It's way more frequent and way more erratic and I've been getting really faint when it happens and today has been the worst. 

They've been happening in what I've been calling ""episodes"" that come and go and sometimes last over 15 mins. And today there's been a lot and I've also started feeling pains in my chest that are hard to describe.

841,notalexdefinitelynot,1650901501,1,"Hey man,

We are turning 30 next week. If you, my younger self, could see us now.. idk that you wouldn't jump off a bridge. You know it's not that everything before 18 was perfect, it's how steeply everything goes downhill afterward. It's how far off the trajectory you have worked toward and assumed our life would take after graduating high school ended up being. You are as well rounded as you could be as a human and a student. You had straight A's from kindergarten through graduation, you are vice president of student council, a mensa member, a boys state member, captain of the debate team, captain of the basketball team, all state in basketball.. the works. Although we tried my hardest, I now know, as a child it is impossible to do it on your own. Our parents either didn't understand or didn't care about the competitive nature of both academia or athletics and did not support you with things, that in hindsight, that would have changed my life for the better. For example, when we were invited to the USA U19 olympic basketball tryouts, i made the state AAU team, the national convention for future leaders of america, mensa events.. but they decided it wasn't worth their time or money. Anyway man, after graduation I chose to attend to Fontbonne Universty. Which is a DIII school that is well below our athletic potential and cannot offer athletic scholarships. I decided to attend because they offered me an amazing full ride scholarship that would have had me do 2 years at Fontbonne University and 3 years at Washington University St. Louis ending with a law degree. I thought we had a better chance of being a lawyer than a professional athlete, so it seemed sensical. My freshman year I injured our foot and knee landing awkwardly from a dunk and was red shirted. During the filing of my red shirt paper work with the NCAA, they discovered my scholarships were illegal. I was then barred from ever competing in collegiate sports forever and my AD was fired. The school then did everything in their power to make me leave. They filed suits and would attempt to bar me from available courses. It was a shit show and eventually ended with me attending less than a year of college and playing less than a quarter of college basketball. Now with no clear future, I moved back home. I got a job as a telemarketer. I shit you not.. selling internet university education. It was always run on the edge of illegal and was eventually shut down by the SEC. Since that point u have worked for over 30 companies in 6 years It was there I accidentally impregnated a co worker, I only knew for a month, who already had a child without a father. I say accidentally because at the time I was taking a SSRI for depression. The SSRI had side effects I did not know about, one of which was less of ejaculatory sensation. I tried to do the right thing and be good man. I got us our own place, a shit trailer, and began a family. After own second child turned 9 months old, their mother abandoned us. She said she was too young and didnt want to be a mom her whole life. So, at 24, I had 3 daughters I was raising on my own and we were living in a run down trailer park. The few friends and family members I still had in my life all abandoned me soon after. No one wants to hang out with a poor single father with 3 children.. and no one wants to help them either. It's been almost six years of my life since then and while nothing else horribly noteworthy has happened it has continued a rapid downward trajectory. I haven't had sex, a date, or even a hug in almost six years. I haven't been invited anywhere or even been talked to by an adult outside of my jobs and my landlord in almost six years. Any monetary investment I have ever mad has gone belly up inside a year. Although I exercise regularly and eat healthy my health declines physically and mentally, every year it's some new thing. This year its MS. I don't remember ever being happy. I'm not saying I never was, but I honestly don't remember when or what it felt like.

Anyway.. I just wanted to say how sorry I am man. Honestly, I wish so bad this wasn't how our life went.

Love you man, even though no one else does

848,krumplisteszta2004,1650896494,1,"TLDR/ When I was 14, just as I started to become independent and have a social life, my mum bribed me into moving away from the place where I grew up. I lost everything I ever had in life, and the social independence I'd recently developed came crashing down. I was in a bad situation but ultimately I was the cause of the vast majority of my own problems, I became weak, lazy and pathetic and allowed myself to sink into a reclusive and childlike state. I've moved again since then, and made a lot of positive change/working on bettering myself but I can't help but feel it's too late and the damage has been done. I'm lonely because of my own unwillingness to even try to socialise, as much as I try to talk to people, my social skills aren't great and I just don't know what to do at this point. 


(Be warned, I'm terrible at splitting things into paragraphs, so everything past here will be one giant wall of text, if that's something u have a problem with, then don't read it) 


Back when I was around 14 I was starting to become very socially independent, spending all of my free time going out with friends (I didn't have many but I had a few good ones), walking around until quite late at night with my brother and even getting to know all the homeless people. After spending my entire childhood and esrly teenage years being shy, unsociable, megere and very mentally behind other kids my age, I was finally starting to come out of my shell and for the first time I felt like a normal boy my age. At the height of this, my mum decided she wanted to move area, she bribed me and my brother and lied to us about what the move would have in store for us, promising to move somewhere urban and exciting where we would have loads of friends and much more money. As a kid who grew up in an impoverished seaside town, I really dreamed of living an exiting life in the heart of the city, with a fancy high-rise apartment, a stark contrast from the damp ridden basement flat I'd been living in for the past 3 years or so. I wanted more, I was a typical kid who just wanted to have all the nice things, so when my mum started promising that if we moved we'd be able to afford to live the exciting life I'd always dreamed of, being the naive teenager I was, I lapped it up. So the move happened a few months, and I realised instantly I'd made a mistake. I'd been taken away from the place where I grew up, now an hour's train journey asay from all of my friends, living in an area that was unfamiliar to me, surrounded by people who I didn't know and felt like I had nothing in common with. I'd lost my social life as soon as I got it. The area we moved to was not the exciting, urban city environment my mum had promised, but a small rural town with nothing to do, full of stuck-up people and quiet suburbs, this place that was now my home felt so alien to me, and as soon as I moved there I wished I never did, I desperately wanted to back to the place I grew up. Then a few weeks after we moved I started a new school, on the first day I went in with an optimistic attitude hoping to meet new people but faced nothing but rejection from the moment I got there. Just a few weeks earlier I was a confident and sociable young man, and I'd been reduced back to my mum's little baby in an instant. Because of all this I started to become bitter and self sympathising, and with the loss of my social life I also lost my confidence, my self-respect, my social skills and my identity. I was a complete shell of the person I was before, now completely inable to go anywhere without my mum, I couldn't even order at McDonald's by myself. I was fully dependent on my mother again. There were valid reasons for us to move, my attendance and behaviour at school before that was so poor that my mum was under constant threat from the teachers of being fined and even arrested, and me and my brother were always this close 🤏 to being kicked out. We were struggling a lot financially and needed to find somewhere cheaper to live, and also we needed to move somewhere that was closer to my mum's university which was a 3 hour train journey each way from where we lived. However, the timing of the move and the way that my mum only decided she wantsd to move once I was starting to become more independent, makes me almost certain that there were other motives. My mum didn't like how fast me and my brother were starting to grow up, she'd spent our entire childhood making sure we grew up as slow as possible, she wanted us to remain children for as long as possible because she never got to have a childhood, she called it ""preserving our innocence"", and for the longest time it worked, but once me and my brother turned 13, we started to rebel, and once we were 14 we only rebelled more, wanting to do all the same typical teenage things that our school friends were doing. My mum didn't like that we were staying out with our friends every night and getting up to trouble, so she hatched a plan to take us away from our friends, from our entire life and from the area that we called home in the hopes it might make us fully dependent on her again, and it worked. For the next 3 years from 14-17 I completely reverted back to a childlike state and was dependent on my mother for everything, and there were small phases within that where I'd try to reclaim my independence again but something would always end up happening to being me crawling back to my mother again. Once the pandemic started I began reverting backwards more and more, until it all got to a point where I realised what I'd become and knew something had to change. See, despite everything I'd lost because of the move thar my mum bribed me into, promising me things that she never followed thru with, there was never a point where I decided to not let it get me down, instead I just sunk inside myself, I allowed myself to become pathetic, weak, self-absorbed, self-sympathetic and childlike again. All those times I felt too anxious to order at McDonald's, instead if facing my fears and going up to order, I'd just beg my mum to do it for me. I went to 4 different schools in that 3 years and never made a single friend, despite the rejection I faced, I never even tried to make friends, I just blocked everyone out and on the rare occasion someone did try to be friendly towards me, I'd meet them with an awkward, standoffish and unenthusiastic attitude, I was judgemental and bitter towards anyone and everyone in my age group and if someone didn't completely reflect myself in every aspect of their personality, I wanted nothing to do with them. Instead of going out and making friends I spent all my free time laying in bed indulging and social media and the Internet, involving myself with fandoms and political discourse that turned me into an opinionated, unlikeable and arrogant person who would jump at any opportunity to bombard people with my opinions. I did not help myself at all, any solution anyone gave for my problems I'd just make excuses and give them a problem for their solutions. I spoke to therapists who tried to help me but I'd always make excuses and was too lazy to put in the work to fix my problems, I just wanted to bitch and moan about everyone else and talk about myself. I didn't try to make friends in school or outsidr of school, I didn't take care of myself, I didn't keep fit and healthy, I just allowed myself to become weak and pathetic. Within the past year I've made a lot of changes to myself and started trying to fix all the problems, about a year ago we moved again to an area where I'm much happier and actually feel like I fit in, there's no doubt that change of environment has helped me to come out of my shell and now I'm working on myself to not be that lazy, self sympathising, pathetic little boy that I was but a lot of the damage has already been done, I'm almost completely incapable of making friends, my social skills are terrible and I've still got a lot of growing up to do, but I'm getting there. The only people I talk to are crackheads, drug dealers and people at my local boxing gym, and while I can hold a conversation I'm still visibly awkward and stiff. I'm able to protect a sense of bravado but my self confidence is still quite low and I feel just alone as ever. I don't know what to do to fix the damage that I've ultimately done to myself. While my mother's actions were the initial catalyst for the person I became, it was my own unwillingness to see my flaws and put in the effort to fix my problems that's done the real damage here. What annoys me most is when I complain about the way that I was, my mum acts like there was nothing wrong with it, which for me is what confirms that it was her plan for me to become that, she can't see anything wrong with the dependent, lazy, borderline narcissistic, reclusive, antisocial, bitter, judgemental, pathetic, weak little bitch that I'd allowed myself to become. And even now it feels like she's always making sure I have no time for a social life, I have to spend all of my tome doing housework and looking for jobs before I'm allowed to leave the house, and even still at the age of 18 I have a curfew to be home by, which is partially because we live in a rough neighbourhood/area but also partially because she's too scared to let me go out there and live life, there's so much of life that most people my age and from my background have experienced that I haven't had a chamge to experience because of how hell-bent on keeping my away from the dangers of the world my mother is. I know that she cares and it all comes from a good place but everyone in my family can see how overbearing my mum is, and how much she forces me to be her baby despite the fact I'm a becoming a man now and need to be getting out there and experiencing life. My mum wants me to have the responsibilities of an adult; housework, a job, learning to drive, etc, etc but without havimg the social life that someone my age should be able to have. My only friend lives in the area I grew up and is a 3 hour journey away from me, I've seen him twice in the past year and those have been the only chances I've got to socialise with people outside my family within that time frame of a year. I'm not alone but I feel so lonely and it seems like no matter how much I'm working towards being a better person, having more confidence and improving my social skills, I will never actually get a chance to get out there and meet people and have a social life. I'm 18 years old and still a virgin, the only relationship I've ever had with a girl has been online and my mum didn't know about it. While I am angry about the things my mum did to stop me from having the social independence of a normal teenage boy my age, I'm not angry at her for what she did because I know it doesn't come from a place of malice. I'm more angry at myself for not trying to help myself sooner and spending the majority of my teenage years as a weak, lazy, pathetic, sad little boy who I always made excuses. I never had a consistent father figure so there was no one in my life to nurture my strength and masculinity and father me, so now I'm having to father myself and teach myself to be a man. While a lot of the time I thrive off stress, ultimately I am lonely and al I really want when I get into bed at night is a hug. I feel defeated a lot of the time and I don't really have anyone I can turn to. On top of all this that online relationship I mentioned earlier has recently come to an end and it's been really hard trying to carry on and move past that, I just feel depleted and now I'm at a point where I'm back to being lonely again and I just don't know what to do from here. Sorry about how long this was, I don't like admitting my feelings publically but I don't know who I can turn to at this point.

863,9nkb6,1650883145,1,"Today I realised that No one will ever care for me as much as I do them and as expected...it hurts 

This is probably the hardest pill I've had to swallow till date but life has made it a point to shove it down my throat time and time again.

Because of life's constant attempts to get me to swallow that certain pill, it's something I've somewhat always known. But I guess I shouldn't blame life, after all, It's all my doing. 

I was the one who chose to care for people, I was the one who chose to prioritise those in my life, I was the one who chose to be a vessel of peace and comfort and I was the one who chose to ride or die for those in my life. However It was also my fault for continuously doing all this despite dying time and time again. But I refused to let that harden my heart and I'm paying the price.

While my heart may have not hardened, it's now simply a ghost of what it once was. Because despite being surrounded by people all I can feel in my heart is sadness and loneliness. I suppose this rude awakening came when I needed it most, maybe it's time that I finally lived life for myself, but what am I to do when I was born without a will to live in the first place ?

I’m 26 and enby(non-binary) and I’ve been introverted for awhile. And cause I’ve shut myself off, I haven’t socialized and made friends or had relationships. I spend my days on my phone. Watching other people live their lives. Wishing I could do that too. 
I mean I’ve tried too, but doing things alone isn’t fun. It’s just sad. So I’ve just stop and resigned myself to playing games about people finding love and living a life I wish I could. 
I have so many temporary solutions for me to not be lonely. I basically distract myself and tell myself that I’m just destined to be alone and that it’s okay. 
But I don’t. I don’t want to be alone. Don’t want feel this loneliness anymore. I just don’t know what to do. I’ve been on different apps and message people, but most of the time it’s horny guys.

How is that not passively pushing others towards depression or passively encouraging them not to end their life? Before I leave this subreddit, I wanna know where ya’all “moderators” at keeping up with these posted rules that clearly most not following by now?! Seriously?! For those of you suffering clinical depression, I sympathize but please seek help since pharmacotherapy will change your distorted view of reality often clinically accompanied with depression. However, for those defaulting to a victim role, claiming life sucks, etc try serving others so as to gain gratitude, purpose, and meaning to your life as well as focus on something besides yourself, outside yourself. If you have clothes and food, you are blessed. Life ain’t about some grandiose purpose but what you do to make it count while still here! Therefore, you can absolutely be a victim in your life, letting life happen to you or be an architect and allow life to happen for you. I also recommend cognitive behaviour therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy to everyone so pls look it up. I hope this post has meaning for some and the moderators please get a Freakin reality check on how ‘positive reinforcement’ of negative messages hurts and impacts people on here as well, potentially placing them at risk for self-harm or worse. The world is bad enough and lonely folks don’t need more negativity to agree with them! Too bad this sub doesn’t encourage Hope. 
Sorry if that sounds harsh, but you moderators are delusional if you ya’all think you’re promoting mental health, support, and wellness on here with people encouraging others it’s ok to be ill, have no worth, no meaning, etc!!!

We would take walks together and have lunch, we would talk about so many random things and she’d always laugh at my terrible jokes.

In my 3 years of being in uni she’s the only person who’s actually taken the time to know me. She doesn’t know it, but she’s the reason why I came out of my shell and gave me hope that I could become a better person. 

About a month ago I actually decided to dm her on instagram and we’re still messaging each other to this day. We’d stay up all night until morning just talking about literally anything and she’s so supportive of everything I do and makes my day better when I talk to her.

She’s the sweetest, most genuine person I’ve ever met and I wish I could tell her this, I don’t deserve her. But at the same time I try not to get clingy and I’m scared of losing her as a friend because she’s the only person that talks to me.",lonely,I think I have a friend now,2022-04-25 14:15:53

I used to have a lot of problems being alone, but in recent years, I've learned to appreciate my alone time. I've also become much better at coping with loneliness as well during the pandemic (and I feel very fortunate for this).

But god damn I am so lonely right now.

I will spare y'all the details but my circumstances force me to stay home a lot (dog that recently developed serious behavior issues... working on it). I am generally really busy, but during the times I have downtime, things aren't making me happy anymore. I find myself checking social media a lot because I'm craving social stimulation. My attempts to have company over (I don't have many friends but I'm trying to put in effort to change that) have all fallen through in recent weeks... and calling family is hard with our time zones.

Basically, I am just in a situation that severely restricts my socializing, and theres not a whole lot I can do right now but tolerate it. 

Is there some way I can convince myself that tolerating  periods of loneliness is character building? I used to feel that way but now it is starting to feel like I'm ... neglecting a basic human need.",lonely,tolerating periods of loneliness.,2022-04-25 12:39:12

I’m alone over 90% of the time. I have a one “friend” who contacts me when it’s convenient for him. That’s few times a year. I meet my parents a few times a week. I have some internet contacts, but even with them, even months can go by without us writing to each other. 

I’ve never dated, don’t have anyone to cuddle or hug with. I’ve been hugged the amount of times counted with one hand in my entire lifetime. I’m touch and company deprived constantly, and it’s killing me slowly on the inside.

I live in the centre of my town where all old families live (usually childless or adult children), only on the outskirts do kids my age lived so for my entire childhood i was isolated. Not only that but my parents were prevalently absent and left me to my own. My brother treated me as if i was his age (he's 5 years older) and i cried a lot because of how he was treating me. My preschool group was made entirely of children whom I'll never hear again of. Starting elementary school my class was a mess and i decided that'll fit in by becoming kind of loud and obnoxious for the most part. This pathetic attempt at trying to be normal was of course met with rejection. I eventually gave up around the third year and became the non-conflict, borderline mute, tracksuit guy for 5 next years. I grew to resent them because i love when it's quiet and treat school as a waste of my lifetime glossing over stuff I've already learned from a youtube video. Not long before the e-learning phase the class have been improving in coordinated ruining the already soulless creatures that were our teachers (except the history and physics teachers because they were just better) and my shield of cynicism i covered myself with struck back at me as they started to collectively get along not just in small groups. In response to this naturally my skin thickened and i became passive to any feelings not just those i wanted to ignore. This turned out to be a double edged sword as i was really annoying to my close ones (my mother and my brother), but also at that time i started to perceive world as i do today. 

I fucking hate my father, not only is he totally naive, he's arrogant, rushes everything he can (almost killing himself or severely injuring himself a couple times because of that, not that i care it just means the entire income of the house is gonna be on my mother). It's like he's unaware of the world surrounding him. I can't count how many times i and my brother were laughed at because that clown and he never once did **nothing** to interfere or even cheer us up. 
He's one of the major reasons for my oversensitive shame and insecurities.

Highschool begins, i accidentally befriended 3 people, a military guy (always well clothed, disciplined, tries his best in absolutely everything, funny, impossible to not like), a history nerd (walking stereotype, 800 hours in HOI4), and a bike guy (similar to me, the difference being that he still tries too hard). The third guy gets stumped immediately and eventually has to change schools because he got his bike spit on first and subsequently beat up. Why? Because he tried to fit in too hard. They turned their attentions to me but I don't react at all so they got bored and went out to haunt other losers. The prospect of getting bullied because i tried to make friends is sickening to me. 

I've had my brother recently tell me that im the only such person he met in his life, and that i talk like a robot, that normal people make things out of context. I mean i get from it what i can.

It would be a much better experience for lonely people if these events were consistent of people who don’t know each other or if these events require groups of people to mix around.

961,basketball2213,1650839684,1,"Hey everyone. I'm a 17 year old guy nearing the end of high school and I'm in need of some advice. For the past couple years or so, I have felt generally sad, just haven't felt whole. I feel like I'm wasting my teenage years. I have never been completely like my peers, as I am not interested in drinking/smoking and going to parties, or hooking up with random drunk girls like 90% of my friends. To me, the idea of fun is hanging with a few friends and chilling, working out, fishing, going to sports games, and just exploring the world while listening to good music. I wouldn't describe myself as a full-on introvert, but I definitely do have social anxiety. My mental health hasn't been the best for the past few years, and I have been in therapy and on medications for Anxiety and OCD (thankfully doing better in that regard). However, at this point in my life, it feels like I'm always sad. Okay, so here's a summary of my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I have never kissed a girl, let alone had any romantic/sexual interactions. This is what bothers me most. At this point, I am basically afraid of talking to girls at this point, and my confidence in myself is always low. If I ever do work up the courage to talk to girls, I get friend zoned almost instantly because I am too afraid to make a move and talk to them like I'm their friend (I don't know how to flirt). I know I'm not a bad looking guy, it's just that I'm always afraid of being judged, as I have had some really, really bad experiences throughout my life with girls. All of my friends always make fun of me for my lack of experience with females and now my entire school knows me as the guy who hasn't done anything, and is sort of a loser (I'm not kidding, I have random freshmen coming up to me making fun of me all the time). No joke, people talk behind my back all the time, and literally everyone knows about me and my lack of success. I get shit on all the time by everyone around me, which obviously doesn't help with my confidence issues. I hate hookup culture. I know it is kinda abnormal for a 17 year old (18 in September) to have this little experience with girls. I have had opportunities in the past to hook up with girls that I wasn't attracted to at all. A lot of guys in my situation would have taken the opportunity but I have standards and respect myself and the girl too much to do that. But no joke, I am literally afraid of girls now.

&amp;#x200B;

This past summer I went on a trip with around 150 other teenagers my age. I met so many nice people, and even talked to a lot of girls, but I was one of the only people who didn't do anything sexual. There was one girl I caught major feeling for but I was too scared to let her know I was interested, partially because I knew for 100% certainty she wasn't into me. I got led on by two other girls on the trip, one of whom I told how I felt (this went horribly, she rejected me on the spot despite the fact that she showed MAJOR interest and her friends were begging me to make a move). This ate me alive, and for months after the summer I was depressed because I felt like such an outsider for not having any experiences with girls. Every day I get deppressed when thinking about how I am going to ever have my first experiences. I feel so damn behind and like I am not taking advantage of my teen years.

&amp;#x200B;

I get led on all the time. It literally happened again this year in school. I was talking to this one girl and we were flirting but we eventually drifted. I asked her to hang a lot, but she kept saying no because her ""parents were too strict"" but she kept saying how she wanted to, and one night she even said she liked me and wanted to go out with me one day. Now she's going around telling everyone she never found me attractive at all. I just don't know what to do at this point. This happens to me so often, and I'm sad to say that I literally don't know what it feels like to succeed with a girl. This is partly why I dread talking to girls. Another part of my reasoning for being scared to make a move on a girl is because everyone is so much more experienced than me and I just don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Like for gods sake I literally haven't even held hands with a girl!!! Half the people my age now are having sex, and the farthest I've gone is a hug. I know I could get a random hookup with a desperate girl if I wanted to, and I could have make moves in the past, but I just don't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I so badly want a relationship. Every night I'm up late in my bed listening to sad music and just being sad about how it feels like I have nobody to love. I feel lonely so often and I literally find myself longing for the touch of a girl (yes, I know this is sad). I am so starved for affection and just really want to have someone I can connect with on a deep level (not just sexually). It feels like I'm the only one who's like this. A couple of my friends have girlfriends and it makes me sad to see them living my dream (obviously I'm happy for them too). I want to experience teenage love. I don't know why, but I just want to know what it feels like to be truly in love. I've had crushes, but I have never felt that connection. This KILLS me every day. I am ready for a relationship, but I don't know where to start, and I feel like I am running out of time. I don't want to wait until college. I have always been told by my parents, ""Just wait, soon enough you'll be getting all the girls!"" That hasn't turned out that well. During the summer of 2021 I started working out, which has done wonders for my confidence, but I haven't been able to work out for the past month due to a wrist injury and it is really impacting me negatively.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like nobody takes me seriously. I feel like a loser all the time. I am genuinely such a nice, funny, chill guy and though I can see how I can be annoying sometimes, it is always weird when people just seem to not like me for no reason. I honestly do get along with most people very well, except when I am in a large group. I used to get invited to everything within my friend group but now that my friends have realized that I am not interested in drinking/smoking or going to parties/hooking up with random girls they don't invite me anymore. My school is extremely small so there aren't many other options. I get made fun of when I talk and get shit on all the time, to the point where I don't even want to hang with my friends from school anymore. Thankfully I have some friends outside of school that are good to me, but I can't see them often. Whenever I go to parties I feel depressed afterwards. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE smokes/drinks, or does both. I always get offered to join in but always say no, which I obviously get made fun of for (I couldn't care less about this, but it makes me sad that I feel so disconnected from everyone). I don't understand why its either drink/smoke or bust these days.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday my friends invited me to a party but when I said I didn't want to go they absolutely demolished me for it. They called me antisocial and told me how I'm wasting my teenage years, while also continuously reminding me how I've never kissed a girl. They have this joke they make about me saying ""tonight's the night!"" like they're gonna get me a hook up or something. Honestly, it feels like my friends don't have my best interest at heart and like nobody gives a shit about me. Literally, I was sick for 3 days and NOBODY reached out to me besides one kid who I barely talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

I really feel like an outsider. I feel lonely, and like nobody understands me. As you can probably tell by reading this, I am quite emotionally mature for my age, and this has always been the case for me. Though this is a great trait, it prevents me from connecting with most people my age. I don't know what to do. I'm not a ""nerd"" but I'm not a popular kid either. I'm a mixture of both, which is why I struggle so much. I like rap music, sports, sneakers, and other things that ""popular"" kids like, but I'm also kinda nerdy at heart, and am a great student (I'd consider myself very smart as well). I don't know anymore at this point. I feel like I'm running out of time, and sometimes I feel like my friends are right about me wasting my high school years.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel genuinely unsatisfied with life at this point. I feel empty inside a lot of the time, and like my life is not being lived to its full potential. On most weekends I am alone, and don't go out a lot. When I do get offered to hang with school friends I often try to get out of it because I genuinely don't like being with them in social situations because they just make fun of me in front of everyone and treat me and my lack of experience as a joke. I seriously feel like a lot of this is due to me living in Florida. So many of the teenagers here are just spoiled pieces of shit and it is so hard to find genuine people nowadays that aren't from out of state.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to conclude by saying that I love life. I feel like I am supported very well, and I have a great family and financial situation around me that makes me feel loved and happy. However, this doesn't get rid of my constant feelings of loneliness, sadness, and not fitting in. Sorry for the essay lol, but I just had a lot to get off my chest.

#  How to get courage to do things alone?

Little bit by a little bit, this is the easiest way, and while it may take a little bit of time, it will speed up eventually.

Think  of it like rolling a snowball. You start small, and it stays small, but  then it snowballs into a huge snowball eventually. So, just exit your  house, and go for a five minute walk. Then a ten minute walk. Then a 15  minute walk. Then 30. Walk around neighbourhood, scout it. You don't  have to actually go inside anywhere, but mark your targets, scope things out.  Out of things you see, where do you actually want to go? Do you want to  go to this funky pizza joint? Movie theatre? Hole in a wall shop?

Some of your targets will be easier to conquer than others.

Going  into a pizza shop, and ordering a pizza slice and a pop will probably  be easier than going to a movie theatre or a restaurant alone. So you figure out what is the easiest thing to do, and go do that first. Then  you do it again. Then after you have built up a bit of confidence and  you feel ready, you go up a notch, you hit your next mark, whatever is  next on the difficulty scale.

This  is a marathon, not a sprint. You are not aiming to be fully socially  confident in a single day, that is too much to expect of your nervous  system, it is not capable of adjusting that quickly unless you are an  extreme outlier.

This will take some time. So take the time! **Take your time**. Have fun. Learn. Explore. Grow. **Push yourself, little by little, at the pace you decide is comfortable**.

I  hope this helps - let me know if you have any questions or if you feel  that it wasn't helpful and then we could try to brainstorm a different  solution if you feel that this approach wasn't useful to you for any  reason :)",lonely,How to work up courage to do things alone,2022-04-25 08:26:40
964,sadpostinge,1650838580,1,"I hate myself more than anything, and realistically I know that’s not true, but I can’t stop the feeling. I feel like everyone hates me, everyone is annoyed with me, everyone looks down on me or knows how much of a fuckup I am. I haven’t been able to make a new friend in years. My only friends are basically online, and I feel like they don’t even know me. Friends in person are basically the only ones that matter to me and I don’t really have any. 

I can’t shake the mindset. I’ve tried finding reasons against it, but it’s impossible. I can’t do it alone. I need people that make me feel reassured that they actually like me, to prove my shitty fucking mindset wrong, but I can’t even approach someone anymore, because I feel like I just bother them. I try talking to people, but it just dries up. It seems like nobody shares my interests and everybody is just so far ahead of me. I feel so embarrassingly far behind and that gap just keeps growing everyday.

I used to have so many friends. I was a well liked kid in high school. But I was still so lonely then, because it felt like nobody ever made an effort to get close. And things just got worse and now I don’t know how to talk to anyone. I’m so fucking lonely. I’ve never had anyone that has told me “I love you” and I could actually believe it.

967,MangoFruit64,1650838011,1,"The melancholic chords through my AirPods accompanied me sitting in the shower surrounded by darkness. I deprive myself of all senses except for the music playing in my ears and the warm water hugging my arched back, replicating the sensation of a loving hug. Eyes closed, I self-reflect while the song ""As The World Caves In"" reaches its climax.

Ever since I was a child, handling overwhelming emotions has not been my forte. I would cry easily and have negative thoughts. ""I don't deserve to be happy."" ""I'm not good enough."" Feelings of inadequacy stem from my perfectionistic standards, which I know well I cannot achieve. Bottling everything up was the only way I knew how to cope with the death of my dad, step up as the oldest child to take care of my family, and the loneliness that grips me every day. Suppressing all my emotions not only has deprived me of feeling anything at times but ironically made me prone to being *overwhelmed* by them. *This is perhaps why I find happiness, love, or joy uncomfortable.* 

I had the perfect chance during prom to talk and dance with this girl (\*note: I'm a dude lol). Our group had split up: some were on the dance floor, and some were outside the building hanging out. It was just me and her sitting on directly opposite sides of the round table. We did introduce ourselves very briefly and exchange a few glances before. Both of us were bored and lonely after two hours of prom. I had the strong urge to ask how she was doing since I could empathize with her feeling lonely. I was confident we would get along extremely well based on our previous interactions.

But I didn't.

I didn't approach her, despite my strong urge to.

Why didn't I approach her?

Because I was afraid. I was afraid of feeling happiness. Afraid of connecting with someone in that type of way. I was afraid of love. 

Why am I scared of love?

Because I will become *overwhelmed* by it.

971,AThousandBooks,1650835510,1,"Recently I have been feeling socially defeated.  I’m 31m, and besides my wife, I haven’t made a friend in more than a decade. 

Platitudinous friend-making strategies don’t seem to work for me.  The orthodox arsenal of neurotypical (I'm autistic) friend-making strategies — “join a  club,” “find people with similar interests,” “take a class,” “go to a  park and strike up random small-talk conversation,” etc. — has never worked for me. People (primarily but not exclusively neurotypicals) seem hardwired to be uncomfortable around me because I am too different. This is the case regardless of where I am or who I am with.  

 For example, I like to read. Therapists have ad nauseum suggested that I  join a book club to expand my social circle. Joining a book club,  however, has never helped me make friends. Because my interests are very niche, whenever I have joined a book club, a reading Meetup, etc., I  have been just as ostracized as anywhere else. The books I read and enjoy make people uncomfortable. This applies equally within book clubs as without.  

Another example is traveling. I like to travel, but like book clubs,  people who like traveling don’t like where I travel. Any potential social connection will end if I say anything about where I have been or where I plan to go.  

This is all based on my own experience. Many of what I thought were promising social connections have abruptly ended after describing anything from what my favorite books are to where I plan to take my vacation.  

At this point, I have managed to navigate the corporate office world and most other social settings by never revealing anything about myself to anyone. Neurotypicals love to talk, and I let them do that. However, I  have found this leads to unbalanced relations. People unload on me all their life issues, but there is no reciprocity in the relationship. They tell me about their marital, family, financial, or other life issues,  then leave.  

On top of this, most people in their 30s like me have mortgages, spouses, jobs, children, etc., making them far less interested in expanding their social circle.  

I want friends, but my efforts to make friendships have always come to naught. The older I get, the more likely it seems I will rely primarily on my wife for any social connection. 

This weekend I decided maybe it is time to adopt a dog. At least a dog won't think I am a freak. We went to the Humane Society, found a super adorable 10-month-old Shepard mix that had been through so much trauma, and seemed like he just wanted some love. But just as we were about to move through the adoption process, our landlord rejected him.

I’ve been struggling for probably around the last three years with a mixture of depression insecurity and other mental health problems. I’ve had a rough few years though. I was cheated and on and abandoned to live and pay rent alone which led me to jump into my next relationship rather fast for the sake of a better living situation. Jokes on me, he ended up being abusive and has given me a life full of hell for the past two years. Also in that time frame, I lost my grandma to cancer, had my best friend move across the country, and another friend eventually got sick of dealing with me and ghosted me. I also had this well paid job which I had to quit because my boss was sexually harassing me. All of this led me to pretty much shut down. When I was in between my jobs I just sat in my house for weeks and did nothing. Then I got my new job and after many months I finally started talking more with my coworkers and forming bonds with them. I have a very hard time actually making friends because I can be shy and shut down most of the time. but I got an invite for bowling night with this group of girls and it was truly the most fun I’ve had in years. I feel like the night was a blur simply from how deliriously happy I was to be included. So to my coworkers who don’t know how much a simple night out meant for me, thank you.

984,sunless_ac,1650831753,1,Recently I’ve just have had it rough with the realization of what I’ll have to do after high school or if I wanna take a gap year. I’m really leaning towards a gap year but everyone doesn’t want me to do a gap year. I don’t have any high school friends and I’ve always kept to myself for the entire time I’ve been at school. Ive thought about suicide but not like I’d ever actually go through with it considering I don’t have the courage for that. Sometimes I just feel so lonely and lose hope. I wish I had more friends but not purely out of pity but actual friends that wanna talk to me for me. I’ve lost motivation to do anything and my mind always lingers to just depressing thoughts when I’m by myself especially at night. I plan on getting a therapist soon since that’s what I really need. I even sometimes think I’m just not that important and I see myself as like a waste of space sometimes. All my other family members are doing successful things with their life like my cousin who is only 16 and he is just living the dream with his first girlfriend and his drivers license. I have a learners permit but haven’t gotten the hours in because I’ve been too scared to drive because I don’t want anyone to get hurt because of me or my stupidity or if I’m doing something wrong. The most I’ve ever been diagnosed with was ADHD but idk I think I have more than just that now since I didn’t even remember when I was diagnosed with adhd probably at a young age. When I was in middle school I had to take meds for my adhd but I have it somewhat under control but I guess I don’t. When I was on meds they didn’t let me feel like eating so I never really ate when it came to lunch time at middle school. I don’t take them now though. I also haven’t been eating much recently because of my body. I weight 260 or so and I’m 6’2 and I don’t think that’s good…I feel like as I am rn no one will love me if I ever decide to have a relationship. My mom is also over protective so I can’t really meet up with ppl she hasn’t met which I guess makes sense but still. Recently I’ve been using Reddit as an outlet since It seems nice here. When I was younger it was just me and my mom living with my grandparents since my mom had me when she was like 17/18 and my biological father left for plenty of reasons which im glad he did I’ve never met him but im told he went to prison when he was in high school and his side of the family is manipulative. I’ve never had too many friends in school tbh even when I was younger. I should probably wrap this up since it’s so long but im sorry for writing a lot.,lonely,I Just Am So Tired.

to make a timeline how my desperation and depression fucked me over badly.since I was a kid my dad was an asshole treating me like garbage and i don't wanna go into the details.i didn't talk to much but I made friends,so hey not so bad right?well untill my dad decided to buy a home away from where I grew up and lived, putting me in a situation where I cried because I didn't want to go,but It didn't listen me.new place,new town,zero friends,I passed an entire summer at home,it felt like it was infinite,days and days full of boredom,but then school started and was going ok,first couple of months I didn't talk to anybody but eventually a guy approached asking me why I wasn't talking to anybody...ecc., anyway I made a friend who made me meet the other guys,so it was great,no problem there,there was an asshole who bullied me,for no reason,I was extremely confused I didn't do shit to him,but when I saw that bullied other people randomly outside our class,I was even more confused, eventually I got into a fight with him because I couldn't stand his ass,long story short after that it tried to play the victim and failed,he leaved me alone after that.A year of school later it was when shit hit the fan,a friend of mine introduced me to a girl,we started talking and eventually got together,I was 14 at the time,I considered my self extremely lucky or I thought i was.first months fine but then it got pretty fucked.it started telling me it was depressed is father was an alcoholic,I felt bad for her, really bad.it got suicidal,every night I didn't sleep well with the worry it might do something,I was close to her, eventually it got worse,I started doubting her,I started thinking,yes It was true that her father was shit,but you can't make shit up like you got raped TWICE in a bus like how is even believable?the more I thought about it the more discrepancy there were in her stories and more ridiculous they went.like she went blind....and texted me.what the fuck.i never got angry,I know even the slightest change of tone of what you say can hurt somebody,I spoke to her about what it was doing and that I wasn't a fool and he needed to stop,all I got was an empty stare and he changed argument.one year.one year of not sleeping and doubting who I loved.it ended in a brutal way,I don't wanna talked about it,she didn't take her life don't worry whoever is reading.highschool started,I don't know how other countries do it,but here in Italy highschool works like this:2 year are general years,you do everything you do in other schools then there is the 3 year specialization,and you chose what you wanna do.here started my downfall.I was feeling like shit for what happened last summer and I wasn't really talkative,I got the asshole I was with in middle school in my class,at first didn't seem like a treat,but eventually it got bad, really bad.spreading rumors,turning people against me..ecc.,I didn't even have the strength to fight back.i was alone.very alone. and I still feel like this.i was not doing school,I was surviving school.ADHD didn't helped either.the days when I slept were a bleesing.i was often drunk going around my town at 1 am and ended every time in a mental breakdown.a thing about towns in Italy they are relatively small and at night they are empty, sometimes even at day,I really like when there is fog at night,I find it neat.those two years scarred even more,I tried to kill myself more than once.My therapist is a fucking moron who doesn't even try to understand me,it diagnosed me schizophrenic because I didn't talk to much or I was watching somewhere else when It was talking,it gave me olanzapine,the awful thing is that it literally suppress your mind,you go on like a machine,not even thinking,I stopped taking it after a couple of weeks and busted my therapist balls to remove everything antidepressants antipsychotic because rather than helping me they didn't do nothing,my mind wasn't clear even for how much shit I had to took in one day.i don't even wanna talk about the lockdown,the only thing it helped me with was my alcohol addiction,now drinking a beer is like drinking acid.last year April 2021 I tried to take my life buying chemicals online,it failed,I got away with only an intestinal irritation,no damage to the brain or other organs,but they put me into the mental department of the hospital.i was empty.out of life completely.the thing that surprised me was that there were people like me there,not batshit insane ones.A 40 year old guy complimented my AC/DC hoodie and from a compliment we started talking to each other about how we lived,what we did...ecc,I still hear from him to time to time.i didn't noticed at first but there was a girl staying in his room most of the time,I m friend with her now but I explain what happened.I was feeling bad for her.It was a week or two I was in, we got occasions to talk and It was heartwarming that I wasn't the only one with similar problems.i started liking her,and after 2 more week I said to her what I felt for her.she said was a lesbian.it hurts,a lot,he is even two years older than me,she study psychology, ironically,later when we got out it said to me that I was a good person and it would be with me if she wasn't a lesbian.is good to hear but it also hurts a little.she hugged me.i didn't cry but I wanted.i still have feeling for her,but I can't force someone to be with me.since then at home thing got more relaxed,my father seeing for the first time that I tried to kill myself he goes more easy

989,Training_Hedgehog740,1650829343,1,"TW: suicide, drugs, alcohol 

I’m beginning to feel overwhelmed by loneliness again. I spent the majority of last week struggling with suicidal thoughts etc. My life’s quite complicated as I’ve grown up in care and stuff surrounding that so I’ve never had any relationships (platonic/romantic) Ive tried so hard this past year but nothing has stuck and im still in the same place I was. Im turning 21 soon and honestly, I can’t live another year let alone 21 more years like this. People don’t understand they’re used to hearing “I have no friends” when in reality it just means they have handful but due to social media or whatever to them it’s interpreted as none. But when I say it, im talking 0 and I don’t want to explain to anymore people about it, im so tired and there’s no way of nicely putting my life and the reason my situation is like this because it’s all been horrific and in the past when I have shared, I feel bad for whoever im telling because I don’t mean to burden them or anything. Plus this whole “emotional dumping” that everyone keeps saying makes me rly anxious because I’ve got Aspergers so navigating conversations is already stressful enough. I have got things in life I want to do/see but I wish there was some definitive way of knowing things will be okay because I don’t want to live like this anymore. With summer coming up as well that’s when it gets the worst. Seeing everyone enjoy their lives being with friends only just amplifies what I don’t have. I’ve lost all my childhood and adolescence, missed out on so much. I’m pretty much free from what prevented me before but now It feels like I’m missing out on being a young adult too. I started drinking heavily and getting high a lot - it’s the only time everything feels okay.

990,DuskPigeon,1650829130,1,"Hi, everyone.

I am 24-y.o. guy, and I just really need someone to love me. Almost all of my friends and colleagues have relationships, some of them - for 5-7 years or more now. What about me? I felt in love with several girls in my life. Most of them even didn't reject me straight away, but anyway, all these ""relationships"" progressed no further than 3-4 dates. The most thing I had - the relationship 5 years ago, which lasted for a few months and still wasn't really passionate and intimate and eventually became quite destructive for me.

I know I am definitely not the most attractive and charismatic person. Socialization was always kinda difficult for me. But at the same time I believe (and my friends tell me so) that I am not actually ugly or toxic, that I am more or less erudite, have a sense of humour etc. However the problem is still there. I see I am not attractive for the people around. Almost nobody really wants to communicate with me. Nobody loves me*, nobody cares. Especially in recent years: even my old friends slip away from me one by one (and two years of pandemic are obviously not helping).

Frankly, I feel isolated, trapped in a vicious circle: I have neither a loving girlfriend nor a company of friends, whose presence would help me to gain some energy to live this life and to work on myself - and simultaneously I have no such energy to find and attract such people.

I do have a couple of hobbies, a couple of good friends and a couple of other things, which help me to feel bonded to this life. But the absence of the special person in my life, who would love me and care for me, feels just like a continuously bleeding wound. And I know: no matter what, I cannot actually be happy until this wound is cured.

So, as I said, I desperately need someone to show me love. Someone to share my thoughts and concerns with and someone who would share her thoughts and concerns with me. Someone who would be special for me and who I would be special for. And, of course, someone who would hug and kiss me, be around me and fall asleep next to me, because currently I am touch starved to an extent when it is almost physically painful sometimes.

And yeah, I am aware that relationship itself is not a ""silver bullet"" for every problem in the world and that it often requires much work to be positive and comfortable. And yeah, I admit, that being single has its advantages too. But nonetheless, I really need it and I really suffer from the lack of it in my life. I remember those my few moments with that girl: a smile in her eyes, softness of her lips and thighs, the way she touched me - and these are some if not the most wonderful sensations I ever experienced.

I dream about it every day (not about the specific destructive girl, but about all that I described several sentences above). I've been dreaming about it almost all my life. Besides, I am 24, and although I am still relatively young, I nevertheless feel that a significant period of opportunities in my life is gone now - fruitlessly. I still hope that one day either myself or something around me will change and love will enter my life, and I keep making attempts - but so far I did not succeed.

1007,throwaway126394728,1650821506,1,"Quick apology for the essay. I also wrote this at like 1 AM, so if it sounds kinda hectic, please excuse it.

So i am going to go over some background info about me. Im a secondary school student (High school). I have decent experience in multiple instruments, avid robotics person (I compete as part of FIRST robotics), I consider myself decently smart (Please dont take this the wrong way, i am not trying to be cocky), I am decent at golf and a few other sports although i do not play them often, and I also consider myself well groomed and relatively decent looking (Again not trying to be cocky, just trying to help describe me as a person). 

So in terms of personality, I am relatively introverted as in that I am shy at first but once i get to know someone, i am a lot more extroverted. I love to learn, talk, and enjoy my hobbies. I took all virtual classes for a decently long time so I am used to working alone and not needing social interaction as much. I also try to be outgoing whenever I can. I tend to overthink a lot, but that is not a huge issue. I used to have a couple really good friends, but due to their own romantic interests we have grown apart, I no longer contact either as I became sort of the only thing holding the relationship together. I just couldn't keep trying to maintain it when there was a clear lack of interest. I have also tried becoming better friends with many, many people, all of whom remain as just people i speak with on occasion, none actually show interest in speaking with me outside of when I attempt to. 

I think that is enough about me, so onto what I need help with. If you need more information about me in terms of giving me better advice, let me know and i can give some more context. 

Lately, it has just been a recurring issue where I cannot seem to find friends that actually show some sliver of interest or care towards me. Dont get me wrong here, I always try my best to be the type of friend I wish to have. I am always supportive, I try to make jokes, albeit really bad usually not funny ones, I try to help out if they ever need help, and I try to always be there for them if they are feeling down. I have had to help a past friend on occasion with mental health issues before in terms of comforting them and the like. Every time over my past at least 15 or 20 attempts with different people I get the same result of them either remaining just people I talk to at school, or outright disliking me. On multiple occasions people i barely even talk to just started to hate me out of nowhere. I have lost one of my past decent friends due to someone bad mouthing me even though I have never spoken to him/her. I dont know what I am doing wrong, if I even am doing anything wrong. It just that no one will talk to me unless I actively try and spur conversation. I am not horrible at conversations but I could definitely be better. 

I should also add that, not intentionally, but on accident I have overheard even people I considered decently close literally saying bad things about me. I dont know what i had even done to deserve that. And keep in mind these were people that I considered close and would have conversations with more regularly and such.

Ad it stands right now, I have no ongoing friendship or relationships in any manner. All have ended due to either the other person, unforseen circumstances, or just me giving up on trying to maintain a one sided friendship.

I really do not want to hear the same old work on yourself quotes, because honestly i hear it too much. Most of what I do is working on myself and to be honest i have no clue what that means if not learning and trying to become a better me. This whole issue has really been taking a toll on me lately because I really have been seriously feeling out of it and wholly unmotivated for a lot of things. Because really outside of school, I dont have anyone really I can talk to or hang out with. And it really feels horrible. I really just want 1 friend that cares enough about the relationship so that its not one sided, I dont want to be like the only reason we are friends. It sucks when I just cannot go on with a friendship just because of the toll it takes on my happiness. I just dont want to have to be the one to initiate all the time. I hope that someone will maybe send the first message once in a while. 

I hope this does not come off as selfish or needy at all. I just greatly want to feel as though someone really cares about me. Just someone that I can depend on, and will be able to depend on me. Its the 2 sided aspect that I just want badly. Its not that my parents dont, its just they way they go about it is not one that exactly sparks happiness in me. Dont get me wrong, i will always love them.

Please if anyone has any experience or advice, do not hesitate to say it. I am good at taking criticism and please tell me anything I am doing wrong, could be doing better, etc. 

Thank You.",lonely,Idk really. It seems impossible to make friends.,2022-04-25 03:31:46

1021,purinii_,1650814742,1,"So I met this guy online on Grindr and it just so happens that we were both also looking for a long term relationship. Using Grindr was something I thought of doing to help me detach from some other feeling I felt and had to get rid of which kind of worked a bit then backfired. I digress, but I met this guy and we chatted for a while and he told me that I was really his type, personality wise and appearance wise so I thought wow, maybe I have a chance after all. I'm 21 and he's 30. He kept telling me about how finding me was like finding a diamond in the rough because he doubt that he would've been able to find someone who was younger than him, was asian, and someone he was attracted to physically and personality wise.

We then started to talk about how serious he was going to take relationships too because they aren't casual as hookups and I agreed with him as well and we started dating for a while. Normally I'm a shy and introverted person, but something about him always being pretty positive and calling me mature for my age as well as just being a nice person overall gave me a lot of hope. We went on more dates and had some cuddles here and there and I really felt the sincerity in his words when he hugged me tightly and said he won't let me go. One of the main reasons he said that was because he told me he didn't feel like living past 45 without anyone to spend it with. I didn't choose to be with him only because of pity, but because I actually genuinely liked him. We got along pretty well too and I always had something to say.

However I did notice some red flags before we met too when he said ""We'll see how well you can handle me with your temperament since you're with me now"". Some context to this was that in his past relationships, he admitted to having a tendency to run away from problems and never turn back as well as well getting frustrated easily. But he said he didn't think there would be a problem between us and said he learned from his mistakes.

Fast forward to last week on a Sunday, we were supposed to meet on Monday so I asked him how is day was going and I tried to tease him a bit by saying what if I couldn't go on Monday because I was buried underground or something. The underlying tone in his message seemed very serious and he said, if you're serious about it, then I can't do anything. So of course, I told him that I was teasing him, but I probably shouldn't because he does have high blood pressure. Then he just told me that he was really stressed at that time and apologized if he was a prick. I just told him it was ok and he should take some time to relax and that I'll wait for him. He said thanks, then blocked me right after and his account deactivated 2 days later.

Now I'm just so confused and the intrusive thoughts keep bombarding my brain thinking that I might have said or done something horrible to him so that's why he left me and I get a bit anxious without having closure. I know not everyone gets closure either, so on the following Saturday, I made a care package for him with a letter inside hoping that he is recovering well from his stressful situation along with another way to contact me if he is ok. I added sentimentality into the care package as well, hoping that he would care enough to say anything back. But I assumed that he and his father went on a little trio because they do that often so only their gardener was there so I asked if he could give the guy a package from ""a friend"". He said ok and now I'm just waiting for his message like a dog waiting for his owner to come home, but this time, I don't even know if the owner is coming back or not.

I just feel really crappy and I am aware that I should accept the reality if he doesn't respond within a week that, maybe he just didn't want anything to do with me anymore, but I want to give him the benefit of the doubt as well since I really did like him and thought he liked me back as well.

Tl;dr This guy I met online that I was dating just cut off all contacts with me and deactivated his account so now I have no closure at all which bothers me so much. We both ""liked"" each other too, but now I'm not sure what even happened except he was stressed and chose to just not tell me anything at all.

Any comfort or advice for me and how to get past this would be appreciated :(",lonely,"Friend blocked me then deactivated his account on Facebook, leaving me confused",2022-04-25 01:39:02

I agree with that if it was the right person but I would honestly be okay with just having a friend that I could care about that cared about me as well. I crave some kind of interaction but my anxiety about being around/ talking to other people makes it impossible. I’ve done the whole tinder hookup thing but nothing good has come of that.

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety. 

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them. 

You can find the Zoom link here:

1042,Jesus_H_Christ_real,1650802382,1,"It really hurts me to see so many kind, helpful, sensitive and thoughtful people to suffer from loneliness. I think that you deserve better than that and so I thought it would be a good idea to try and improve that with a short small guide.  


These are my current, most updated thoughts on the matter, so if you feel that what I am saying isn't quite right or could be improved or added to, please do not hesitate at all to comment what you want on this. You have experience and knowledge that I do not and you might have great ideas that can help someone else out of this awful thing that is loneliness - let's solve this loneliness thing together!  


I think that, if you are isolated and alone, and that you want to find friends, you need to go out and do activities that involve other people. You should not join these activities with a mindset of ""I must make one of these people my friend"" but rather with a mindset of ""I am just going to hang out with these people, and if one or few of these people seem like a potential friend, then I will attempt to befriend them"".  


This is a subtle difference, but an important one. I think it's important not to try and force just someone, anyone, into being your friend, but rather find someone who has the right interpersonal chemistry with you. You are not trying to make someone your friend, you are trying to find someone who wants to be your friend and someone that you want to be friends with.  


Friendship, like a relationship, requires chemistry. Different folks are attracted to different folks - you just have to find your person(s).  


So, how do you go about that?  


There are sites, like [https://www.meetup.com/](https://www.meetup.com/), where you can find groups that do activities together.  


You can also take night classes in languages, arts and other things. It would be a good idea to pick something that you're interested, for two reasons - if you do not find anyone, at least you had a good time, and it's easier to find someone to be friends with if you share some common interests.  


There are clubs, like chess clubs, board game clubs, D&amp;D clubs, and others. You just have to look for and search for something that you think you would enjoy that is local.   


There are other people who are also lonely and they are trying to find their people too. If you are lucky, some of those people will be your friends. But if you do not go out, if you do not meet anyone, they cannot meet you. So,  


You need to take action. You need to expose yourself to people, you need to be around people so that you can hopefully bump into someone that you vibe with one day.   


If anyone else knows sites, activities, apps or just any other good way to find places where one can meet people safely, please do not hesitate to comment. You could be not just helping, you could be saving someone's life. So if you have any ideas, please speak up and let's help each other out however we can.  :)

Also, if anyone has a story of how they found friendships or have beaten isolation or being lonely, please, absolutely feel free to share your story so that others can find hope and courage and inspiration from it, but only if you don't mind doing so, of course. It might seem silly or not important, but your story can change or save someone, and that is important. So feel free to share, if you want to and if you don't mind to :)  


If you feel that there is something else that's helpful or insightful that you would like to add to this discussion, by all means, please go ahead, you are welcome to and I'm sure other people will appreciate it too.  


That is all, I would like to thank you all for your attention and for this wonderful community and for this subreddit. I don't know who created it or who keeps it running, but I appreciate your guys work and even just the idea of it, it's fantastic and you guys rock for just even thinking of creating it in the first place and then making it happen into a reality later on - this subreddit is important and you making it is important and you are important - you saw a problem in the world and you attempted to fix it - that is amazing and brave and thoughtful and caring and so are you for doing it! :)  


And the community itself, I see you guys trying. I see you replying to other people's posts. I see you trying to help. Sometimes I read a post, I see replies, and I see that my work here was already done by someone else, that you all worked together and helped the person and I couldn't be more proud of you then - I don't need to add anything to discussion or do anything because you already have helped the person. I want you to know that I really really appreciate seeing that, that it moves me, that it makes me feel proud of this community and it's members, proud of people helping each other - for free, with nothing to gain from it. That is great. That is awesome. Please do not stop this and keep this up - you are doing an excellent job. You don't always know what to say, or what to do, but I see that you try to do something, you try to help, and that is all that anyone can ever ask of you. You, just trying to help, it matters. You matter. Your kind words here matter. Your advice matters. You offering to be someone's friend or to just listen, it matters.   


Sometimes, your kindness, your attention, your words, maybe they just lift someone's spirits. Other times, even though you do not know it, sometimes, your kindness might save someone. Your kind actions and words here might save someone, might give them what they need to survive, and eventually try to thrive in life- your words and actions matter and what you do here matters, a lot. Please don't forget that.  


I think that is all I wanted to say here. I only hope that this hopefully helps someone, some day, and even if this only affects one person, if it helps them, I will be happy. Helping even one person, that is an amazing feat, that is an achievement in of itself. If I can do that, if I can help even one person, then I know that my life had meaning and when it's my time to go, I can go content knowing that me being here helped someone, that however small, I made some difference, that I left world a better place than when I found it. I didn't make this mess of a world with all it's problems, I only inherited it, but if I tried to it clean up even a little bit of, then I have done my part. No one can tell me that I didn't try.   


That is my current attitude, and, it helps me. I don't know if it will help you, and I am not saying that you should be this way or live in this way, I am just saying that just because things are bad in the world, it doesn't mean you have to accept it. You don't have to take it. You don't have to participate in the malfunctions and dysfunctions. If you want to, you can choose to make this place a better one. Everyone knows that everything is a mess right now. But it doesn't have to be. You can put on some metaphorical gloves, some work pants and get to cleaning this mess. No one can tell you not to.   


It can be a kind word. It can be a kind action. It can be a thoughtful gesture. It can be a smile and a compliment to stranger. It can be forgiveness for someone. Big or small, you have the power to treat your fellow humans with kindness. And while not everyone will appreciate it, some will be touched and moved by your kindness, and in turn, they will treat other with kindness as well. Like throwing a pebble into a still water, your kind action can spread like a wave and go out into the world, affecting unknown numbers of people in a ripple fashion. A smile and a kind word you give today, could come back to you through a chain of people tomorrow, and you wouldn't even know it. Today, you might give someone a pass, a break and, tomorrow, while not a guarantee, someone might give you a pass or a break. Share the love. Be kind to others. What do you have to lose? It doesn't cost anything to say something nice to someone, on internet or in real life. Sure some people might be a prick about it, but a lot of people will really appreciate you trying to brighten their day :)

1049,IsraelComics,1650796219,1,"So i think a lot of you can relate to the following feeling, you're amongst ""friends"", you guys are having conversations etc. But all of the sudden you just feel like you are not really validated as much as other individuals of the group, like what you have to say doesn't really matter as much or has as much impact in the conversation as what other people say, so in the end the feeling of ""do I really matter?"" Starts crossing over your head. So even though I do have friends, and I am lucky and grateful for having one very close friend, whenever all of us hang out either in lunchtime at work or outside of work, I always end up feeling like other people are just more validated than me, like it doesn't really make a difference wether I'm present or not, so i end up asking myself, are these guys really my friends? I mean i get along with them but do they really like me? Do they really enjoy my company? They don't show the same interest in me or what I have to say as they do with other people in our group.

I was getting drunk 4 nights a week at least while all or 3 of those nights I would not remember anything. There was an incidient at the time with my then girlfriend where I decided to get in the gym. That was three years ago. 

Fast forward to today (23m) after dropping out, I have completely dived into the world of bodybuilding. I have 6 organized meals a day, training is very intense, and sleep is strict for recovery. That is on top of working 40-45 hours a week.

Bodybuilding has been great for me because I almost never drink (i also dont get blackout anymore), diet is not garbage, and it has made me look past my current situation and notice what I need financially. However as Ive gotten more into the gym I have gotten almost antisocial. I rarely talk to anyone from school even though they are fantastic people, I never have time to hang out with any co workers, and the biggest thing is no girlfriend. 

I have missed that connection with someone for a while now. Its never helped Ive always been scared shitless on approacing a girl, but the biggest thing is my lifestyle. I have not eaten off my diet in 5 weeks. Almost no girl understands that. I cannot miss the gym, a meal, eat out, or sleep. 2 months ago I hung out with anyone for the first time in 2 years. I dont know how im going to survive outside the gym while being so alone.

Now dont get me wrong I love bodybuilding. Its given me life after I had a suicide attempt a while back, but it has crippled me when it comes to friendships and a relationship. If i quit the gym I know my depression will get infinitely worse, but if I keep with it I will stay isolated. I just have no idea what to do.

1084,purinii_,1650781490,1,"So I met this guy online on Grindr and it just so happens that we were both also looking for a long term relationship. Using Grindr was something I thought of doing to help me detach from some other feeling I felt and had to get rid of which kind of worked a bit then backfired. I digress, but I met this guy and we chatted for a while and he told me that I was really his type, personality wise and appearance wise so I thought wow, maybe I have a chance after all. I'm 21 and he's 30. He kept telling me about how finding me was like finding a diamond in the rough because he doubt that he would've been able to find someone who was younger than him, was asian, and someone he was attracted to physically and personality wise. 

We then started to talk about how serious he was going to take relationships too because they aren't casual as hookups and I agreed with him as well and we started dating for a while. Normally I'm a shy and introverted person, but something about him always being pretty positive and calling me mature for my age as well as just being a nice person overall gave me a lot of hope. We went on more dates and had some cuddles here and there and I really felt the sincerity in his words when he hugged me tightly and said he won't let me go.  One of the main reasons he said that was because he told me he didn't feel like living past 45 without anyone to spend it with. I didn't choose to be with him only because of pity, but because I actually genuinely liked him. We got along pretty well too and I always had something to say. 

However I did notice some red flags before we met too when he said ""We'll see how well you can handle me with your temperament since you're with me now"".  Some context to this was that in his past relationships, he admitted to having a tendency to run away from problems and never turn back as well as well getting frustrated easily. But he said he didn't think there would be a problem between us and I didn't think so either. 

Fast forward to last week on a Sunday, we were supposed to meet on Monday so I asked him how is day was going and I tried to tease him a bit by saying what if I couldn't go on Monday because I was buried underground or something. The underlying tone in his message seemed very serious and he said, if you're serious about it, then I can't do anything. So of course, I told him that I was teasing him, but I probably shouldn't because he does have high blood pressure. Then he just told me that he was really stressed at that time and apologized if he was a prick. I just told him it was ok and he should take some time to relax and that I'll wait for him. He said thanks, then blocked me right after and his account deactivated 2 days later. 

Now I'm just so confused and the intrusive thoughts keep bombarding my brain thinking that I might have said or done something horrible to him so that's why he left me and I get a bit anxious without having closure. I know not everyone gets closure either, so on the following Saturday, I made a care package for him with a letter inside hoping that he is recovering well from his stressful situation along with another way to contact me if he is ok. I added sentimentality into the care package as well, hoping that he would care enough to say anything back. But I assumed that he and his father went on a little trio because they do that often so only their gardener was there so I asked if he could give the guy a package from ""a friend"".  He said ok and now I'm just waiting for his message like a dog waiting for his owner to come home, but this time, I don't even know if the owner is coming back or not.

I just feel really crappy and I am aware that I should accept the reality if he doesn't respond within a week that, maybe he just didn't want anything to do with me anymore, but I want to give him the benefit of the doubt as well since I really did like him and thought he liked me back as well. 

Tl;dr This guy I met online that I was dating just cut off all contacts with me and deactivated his account so now I have no closure at all which bothers me so much. We both ""liked"" each other too, but now I'm not sure what even happened except he was stressed and chose to just not tell me anything at all. 

Any comfort or advice for me and how to get past this would be appreciated :(",lonely,Friend blocked and then deactivated his account leaving me confused,2022-04-24 16:24:50
1085,Ronald_T,1650781291,1,"I think i finally found peace in the solitude.

I'm a 25M and i've been alone all my life. Never had a gf, seldom had any ""friends"" in my adulthood, never even had my first kiss or been on a date. For years I wondered what was wrong with me or what i might be doing wrong. Am I just that boring, or unattractive? Do i not make enough money, or not muscular enough? It would keep me up at nights because I overthink things way too much. It would stress me out like crazy and consume all my thoughts for the entire day. It was unhealthy as all hell. My mom would not stop bugging me about finding a girl and giving her grandchildren, my sister wanted me to give her nieces and nephews to run around and play with even though she already has 2 kids of her own. It was driving me nuts. I moved out of the house to a different city 3 years ago to get away from all that, but they would still bring it up every now and then and I would have to hang up the phone because i didn't want to hear it. At one point some old highschool folks i knew got together to talk about what was going on in their lives now-a-days. Most are married, have kids, starting careers or going for masters degrees in college. And there I was, same old lonely me, nothing changed except being a few years older...

About a month ago, I finally woke up one day and said ""Fuck it, i'm done worrying about this loneliness shit. I'm not gonna let it keep dragging me down. If i'm alone all my life, then fuck it I'll be alone all my life. "" 

And you know what, it actually worked. I've started to find myself in a better mood most days, i'm more productive at work, and i'm actually get a huge promotion soon! I don't wake up in misery anymore, I dont dread whatever the day brings me, and i even started having dreams in my sleep from time to time.

Sure it would be nice to share all these little victories with someone, but screw it, these are my victories and i'll celebrate them with me, myself, and I. I don't care about finding that special someone anymore, or even making any close friends or acquaintances.

I spend most of my days alone and I enjoy it. That does not mean I don't like to party or hang out with friends. I don't have many friends, I thought I did but I realized friends come and go. Which left me to the situation where I am now, mostly alone.

Being alone with only my thoughts can truly be a wild ride. Sometimes I get an existential crisis and ponder the meaning of life but that's the point which I'm trying to make; only when alone can you truly self reflect and think about what you truly are and what you want.

I find it very difficult.

Most of the time it’s just surface level subconscious mindless chitter chatter keeping the mood light and silly. I feel fake, like all the time, yet I have nothing to gain from faking being a shit person right? Sometimes I am actually am a shitty person so I can figure out wether or not I actually am a shitty person. I am not (thank god). It’s just that when ever I express myself, in anyway shape or form that can be advantageous to me, I stop, and berate myself, so I never end up expressing my true self.
For instance if someone says something funny, and I look over and smile genuinely, and a thought in my head says “you smiled like that so you look like a good looking person”, I then automatically phase out of smiling… my whole fucking existence right now is a variation of theism scenario, constantly stuck in my head trying to “humble” myself, whilst I’m over her looking like a dead raccoons anus, like I couldn’t use the help of a genuine smile????? Wtf is wrong with me, how do I stop.

Should I forget trying to build deep and meaningful relationships?

All my relationships are like prefixes programs of what we will say and what we will talk about… like a fucking script that gets repeated….. and it’s not like this with just one person, it’s my mom, and all the4 of my sisters, it’s like we all are just repeating a pattern that we always do, I would love for answers in this….. the patterns are clear, the way I act with one sister is different to the way I act with another, yet all the individual relationships are genuine and authentic, I don’t force nothing, so are these patterns forced by my sisters? There persons that I am witnessing? Do I need to develop
persona? I am kind of a different person to everyone, like a mug is it? 

At first I thought it was just me who is repeating the same conversation and expressions and feelings/emotions again and again like a robot, or a shit human faking it through life, but then I realised that all my sisters are doing the same back, there just much better at it then I am, or much more comfortable doing it then I am, or even understand something about it more clearly then i do, that it is not a bad thing, that it is not fake, that everyone is doing the same thing, and the people who are socially fine are the ones who master this repetitive relationship thing to high levels???",lonely,Help me please..discuss below in comments,2022-04-24 15:53:02

1097,ineedsomemilk2077,1650778306,1,"This is me. I am 26 years old man. In the last two years, my life has had a dramatic, and I mean DRAMATIC, change. You see, through my early 20s I was poor, didn’t have money to have ‘fun’, but my job did allow me to make friends. After I was fired, I made some serious changes in my life and ended up working in the financial sector. Without giving too much detail, I went from earning 11 dollars an hour to clearing $600,000 per year now and next year I should be up $1,200,000 per year. I make good money, so I should be happy right? Right? My father passed away last year, my long term gf of 5 years randomly dumped me 3 days after he passed because she wanted to ‘not have life regrets’, whatever the f*ck that means.

So where am I now? I am lonely. I go to the movies a lot but alone. I went jogging in a big downtown trail, alone. I go to the same gym I have been going for 4 years every day six days a week, alone. I work for myself, which means I am alone in four walls. Sometimes I go full days without talking to anyone. Literally, I don’t see a single word. You know what’s funny about this? I’m not an introvert. I am so lonely I literally make up different people and dynamics in my head to have conversations and events happening. I’m literally talking in my head to imaginary people lol. Wtf even is this. Last night I was in my bed staring at the ceiling thinking, I would give up EVERYTHING I have to return back to where I was a couple years ago. I had friends, I freaking loved going to my sh*t paying job because I loved the social dynamics of it. The drama, the bs, everything. Now? A day doesn’t go by that I don’t think how sh*t my life is. It’s funny, cuz you wouldn’t think about it either if you saw me. I am very fit, look super cool(at least to me), I’m always doing something, but I’m alone. 

I don’t how people meet. I have heard volunteering, or hobbies but I see and do these things and NOTHING. Most people just are friends with people they already know. At the gym idk how others even break the ice because everyone wears headsets. I guess you could try asking for help to have others talk to you but they just go away after. I feel people in general aren’t interested in friendships either. I think people in general are sad/miserable/unhappy because life right now is very hard, especially for young people who want a good future. The economy is worsening by the month, literally, and social media and politics continues to divide and isolate folk. Maybe that’s just me rationalizing my failures though. Girls don’t look at me, much less even flirt or do approach invitations. I have a serious porn addiction now. Men look like they couldn’t give a fuck about anyone unless they want something from you.

He's pre-occupied with his part-time retirement job, maintaining his home, and their new puppy, so I hear from him maybe once a week or so. My brother lives 13 hours away and we aren't close. I know he lives with his girlfriend after his divorce but I don't know her name. I maybe have one conversation with him per year. 


My mother died over a decade ago. My grandparents are all long dead. I'm not in touch with any of my aunts and uncles. I don't have any close cousins. All of the friends I used to have faded away into everything from family formation to drug addiction and my phone doesn't ring. I have no social acquaintances. I get along with my coworkers, but I'm older than the ones who socialize with each other outside work. 


I have no ex-girlfriends, no ex-wives, no children. Except for a couple of long-distance online situations in my late teens, I have never been in a relationship of any kind. I have never been on a casual date that was specifically arranged as such. I have never had a friend with benefits. I haven't had sex in 16 years. 


My only interaction with the world, outside of my job, is you, reading this, whoever you may be. Once my father dies, I'm an orphan. My disappearance from this earth will commence in force, as it has been trending this way for decades now. I see myself sliding off of this plane, this reality. And there doesn't seem to be anything I can do to stop it. You see me here, right? Sliding past you? I'm heading for the waterfall. I can see it. You can hear the giddiness in my voice as the terror in my chest rises, as I realize I have nothing to grab hold of?


Perhaps that's the point of all this, the slide etc. Is to let go. Become the balloon that floats away. The stick that shoots over the falls. After all this pain, for one beautiful moment before the abyss swallows me up, it will feel like I'm flying.",lonely,"Soon, I'll be a balloon without a string...",2022-04-24 14:33:20

Whenever I hang out with my friends or family I feel happy. I feel euphoric. But the moment they leave the room or they have to go and the silence falls, suddenly that icy cold feeling of loneliness returns.

I don't truly understand why.

I feel like everyone hates me. I feel like their love is a sham. But that's irrational given the fact that they would benefit nothing much if at all if it were true and their words of affirmation, and their actions, they all say otherwise.

But I feel so lonely! I feel so lonely that I constantly vividly daydream to replace my loneliness.

I am trapped in a loop where I feel like everyone hates me. That I am unwanted, so I isolate myself, which makes me feel even more lonely.

And I can't stand it.

I act confident, bubbly, outgoing, to everyone.

But in reality? I secretly wish they would just stay.

Just stay with me. If you truly hate me then fuck it, keep the act up until I find someone better and than you can just leave.

I hate being left alone even for a few minutes. I don't know why I'm like this.

I can't truly fathom why I feel like this, let alone the origins of such a strong feeling.

But I loathe it wholeheartedly. Day in and day out I come home and when I enter my comforting bedroom I can never truly relax because no matter how homey or aesthetic it is, that solid state of solitude remains. It's an undertone that just grows to be more and more louder. With the ringing in my ears being the only company I have and the friends I have. The ones inside my head, in this little world of mine that I made years ago and visit daily for extensive hours.

I just can't do this.

Being a first responder, I really need a damn hug after I watch one of my patients die, but first responder culture is putting in a straight face and ignoring it. And of course that is also trying to match the “strong male” image to avoid being treated differently or them attributing it to the fact I am gay.

The past few weeks I have been really down because I just feel alone. The thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. My family, friends, and coworkers just never have me on their radar anymore. And again, dealing with school and being in EMS means dealing with a lot of stress. I don’t have anyone I can just go to for support, comfort, distraction, or recognition.

Today he was fairly quiet. Studying. Okay, I can respect that. But then I get home from a cookout and call him, and he’s got someone else over (his neighbor, a female) and he cooked for them both. He was very short. When I asked if everything was fine, he said yes but his mannerisms and behaviors are completely different today than they have been throughout the rest of the previous week.

1130,arti234,1650767850,1,"So it’s been almost a year since the first one that I did and some updates have happened. 

First of all I know longer am friend with my female friend and do not wish to be friends with a male one. 

The reason for is that I kinda “broke up” with the female friend cause she found me quite toxic which in fairness I was. so I after a few weeks of soul searching attempted to move on. A new semester of university started and decided to make some new friends which I successfully did. I would meet up with said group of friends and we’d have fun and they actually were inclusive to an extent (ie I was the new friend in an already established friendship group) so one of the friends invited me to go see the wider friendship group a few closer friends. Low and behold the girl is close friend with them. My friend sensing tension in private what happened and I explained. 

They thought nothing of this and for a while I was a bit paranoid cause I thought maybe she would spread rumours about me or advise people not to talk to me. However I dismiss this after a few months. 

A few months ago I meet another mutual friend who disclosed that she had been chatting about me behind my back and my new friends had been defending me and telling there other friends to give me chance. 

This caused a small rift causing one side of the group not talking to the other because they were judging someone without knowing them which I felt a bit guilty about however I couldn’t believe I was right and it’s been giving me major anxiety lately. 

As for the guy (who I know longer wish to be friends with) when I confronted him about the rumours he disclosed exactly what was being said. A couple of weeks ago. I had an epiphany that if he knew exactly what was being said he could dispel said statements however it was allowed to be spread and therefore he must’ve said anything. I heard when my new friends were still getting to know me they were defending me whereas this guy who I’m supposed to be close friends with was letting this sh*t slide .

1131,ladylavenderrrr,1650767077,1,"So, a few weeks ago I had a date where we were supposed to go out to a bar for drinks and to shoot some pool. He was doing work things later than the time we planned for and so I actually just ended up going to his house at like 11pm and stayed the night till like 7am. I totally didn't plan on sleeping w him, I just wanted to chill and drink some beers but he was really hot and cool and I've been lonely for months and caved bc I wanted to.

The first red flag was him asking what I wanted out of our encounter, I said something along the lines of ""casual dating"" and ""friends"". He then said him and his ex just broke up a few weeks before and I was like oh okay that's cool, whatever. Cuz wtf else would I say? I should have left then bc I'm really not tryna be a rebound but that's exactly what ended up happening. I was a few drinks in and ended up hooking up anyway. We had sex all night, off and on in-between talking and listening to music and cuddling. It was nice but in my head I knew he was just using me.

He kept saying how hot I was and how much he liked me, and I really wish he hadn't. I wish he just fucked me and didn't tell me nice things and then cuddle me to sleep. I'm annoyed w myself because of how fast I start liking someone. I'm always alone and depressed and get too ahead of myself if I think a date goes well. I literally spent 8 hrs at his house, left and made it home with no text at least asking if I made it home safe. No text ever.

So I waited 2 weeks or so to even say anything. I basically was just like ""hey what I think you did was rude, you literally could have just said you had a good time but aren't interested in pursuing anything"" and I would have been happy w that. I'm so sick of ppl treating me like I'm disposable and unworthy of basic communication. He ends up apologizing and saying how he had some ""shit"" with his ex go down. I'm like ok cool, that had nothing to do with being courteous and giving me some kinda heads up.

I also realize he doesn't even owe me that, we are strangers, but I went out of my way to go to his place, bought the drinks, even drove him to the gas station for more. I got no courtesy text. 

I hate that I actually like the dude. I'm positive he got back with his ex and I'm mad at myself for literally always liking emotional unavailable douchebags.

1161,MemphisGirl93,1650759440,1,"Let me set the scene and explain my current situation. I’d like to get some support and maybe advice. 
Last August my husband and I moved to Nowhere, PA from Tennessee so that I could start my PhD program at the massive and cult-like Nowhere State. I was scared about moving across the country to go to a new program but I had my husband. We struggled with infertility for years so we began IVF after we moved. From August to October, I was so busy trying to adjust to the PhD program while juggling a rigorous fertility schedule, I didn’t exactly try to meet people. And then in October I got pregnant. We would finally have our little family right?

Wrong. My husband (who I since learned has a massive drug problem. It’s complicated and I don’t want to get into it) abandoned Baby and I when I got pregnant. No warning, he didn’t even pack up his belongings. Just had some sort of mental breakdown and left one morning, and was very cruel in how he told me he never wanted to come back. This has obviously been extremely painful, and we are in the process of getting a divorce. 

Along with my heartbreak, my pregnancy has had a ton of complications. I’m due in July and I love my son so much, but I have basically been 100% remote since thanksgiving last year. I have spent almost all of this pregnancy fainting and throwing up and in bed. I go out for my doctors appointments and sometimes the library to work on papers but other than that I see no one. 

A group of grads girls in my program invited me to be their friend and I was excited for this except it hasn’t worked out. 1) I am too sick to go anywhere or do anything 2) they’re super focused on work and work only. The few gatherings they’ve had are normal I guess until they all start pulling out laptops and working. And bragging. My PhD program is very toxic and hostile. Everyone brags or competes or rolls eyes/make snide little remarks. It’s a very unkind place to be, with lots of undertones about how I specifically don’t belong because I am from the south (so people think I’m stupid) and that I do not come from money. Some of the things people said to me were really jarring, especially after coming from a masters program that was supportive of and celebrated everyone. There’s a few kind people I have met in passing but they seem really busy and again, I’m too sick to hang out. I do wish I could at least have a texting buddy in the program though. 

So I thought I would try my luck with the local mom groups. They have been friendly (yay!) except they’re almost all married SAHMs. Nothing wrong with that but we live very different lives. They stay at home while their husband works for Nowhere State…meanwhile I am totally on my own, work for Nowhere State myself, and have no family or anything here. 

I have flown home twice since moving here, once for thanksgiving and once recently for my baby shower. I literally have a panic attack every time I try to come back. In November I sobbed, loudly, in the Philly airport to my soon-to-be-ex hubs about how much I “hate it here,” which I know is pathetic but I literally didn’t have anyone else to talk to. The night before I flew back from my baby shower I had to essentially choke myself out with a pillow in an attempt to drown out how loudly I was crying because I didn’t want to wake my friends up. I do hate it here, so incredibly much. I don’t fit in, in ANY group I try to join. The grad girls made a new group chat without me because they’re all going to Paris, and the few other people I’ve made friends with since moving here (except maybe one, she’s nice) have all ghosted me. It’s like damn am I so awful that no one wants to be around me? 😞Even though I hate this town and hate Nowhere State, I try to be positive. I know acting all sad won’t get me friends. But I do cry myself to sleep a lot. 

It’s warm weather today so I went for a walk. The outdoors make me happy. I saw couples holding hands and groups of friends and I just felt so sad. Especially the couple I saw with their baby. That was supposed to be us. I’m so incredibly lonely here, in a town that also seems to hate me too. I worry how this will impact me being a mom. How can I care for my son if I am so sad and lonely all the time? I don’t want him to see me crying. I know he’ll just be a newborn but won’t he pick up on how unhappy I am? Yes I am in therapy but the isolation and rejection is getting to be too much. I don’t feel comfortable leaving him with a babysitter once he’s born, at least not for a while, so any friends I make would have to be ok with me bringing him (he’ll be good I promise). 

My 29th birthday is in May and I don’t think I’m going to do anything for it. Last year my husband took me to the botanic gardens I loved so much. I have no one to spend it with this year, up here in Nowhere. I considered getting a massage or something but I think if I told anyone it was for my birthday I would just burst into tears. It’s a stupid birthday anyways 😞 I know this whole post is just really sad and pathetic but I thought maybe I’d find some kindness here.",lonely,And baby doesn’t make three,2022-04-24 10:17:20

I'm feeling lonely more and more lately. I have never been in a relationship before and always thought ""I am too young and don't have time for it"" since I'm only 16 years old. I have never flirted or even felt like I was really bonding with a girl. There is a girl in my class who I think is really hot but I'm not sure how to handle it.

I'm also losing my cool with some friends, they don't know but I'm getting more and more frustrated by them. They are changing and becoming different persons, I think we are growing apart.

My best friend, the one who I can tell everything has met a nice girl. He is kinda dating her and things are working out for him and obviously I'm very happy for him. But he can't stop talking about it and I kinda get it but he says ""I'm not going to talk about her the whole time"" *continues to do so*.
Today he asked to go play soccer, I get at the location and we start playing but he doesn't. He is chatting with her. He kept chatting with her for an hour and we stop playing and go back home.
Today it happend again, we did karaoke at his house and he only stopped to sing himself but when we were singing he just kept chatting with her.
He also gets mad if I don't ask how its going between them every 5 seconds.

I just want to be there for someone and someone to be there for me.

I don't really meet new people. I go to school, come back home, sometimes do sports or meet up with my friends. So I rarely even see new people.

(wouldn't my mother be so proud) If you'd like someone to chat with, I'm pretty much open to talk about anything you'd like. You can tell me about your favorite or newest hobby, about your favorite book, or you could even vent to be about what a dork Bill from accounting was this week. (Darn Bill!)

Incase you'd like a sense of who I am, here's some fun facts about me:

* I live in the midwestern region of the USA.
* My favorite food is pasta. Just give me noodles plus an absurd amount of sauce and I'll usually be happy.
* My newest hobby is game development. Very early into this, but I'm learning a lot!
* Sadly I have no pets... Not allowed to have them where I live but I'm real close to sneaking a dog into the situation.

1168,Dislike_Pillows,1650755171,1,2022 by far has been the worst year of my life. Everything I try at I've failed this year. By far this year has been the most socially isolated I have ever been. I went through an akward break up which sucked because I use to spend a lot of time with her. I also ended up losing a couple of close friends because of how much we have changed. So my social life is now non existent.  Ever since then I've become fearful of losing anyone so I've become an extremely clingy person which sucks. Because people tend to push away from clingy people. It sucks and this is the most alone I have ever been. I can't think of anyone to reach out because I have a fear of weirding them out.,lonely,feeling empty,2022-04-24 09:06:11
1169,Time_Bank848,1650754589,1,"Skip to end for tl;dr.

For background, I suffer from social anxiety, and have struggled with forming friendships my whole life. I have no friends at school, or anywhere really. 

This year, a new girl joined my class. She seemed very shy and reserved, so I worked up the courage and managed to strike up a convo with her. It went a lot better than I expected, so I sat next to her. The next day, we have to do an assignment. We pair up, and then the teacher tells a girl (who was working alone) to sit with us. They start talking to each other, and it turns out they have a lot in common! We become a group of 3. 

So over the next few weeks, they become really good friends, and I get left out of their convos A LOT, and they team up to pick on me. They also talk outside of school, whereas they don't even bother to initiate a conversation with me. They just ignore me. 

I was really happy at the beginning because I had stepped out of my comfort zone and made a friend, but now I've just being the third wheel. It's just an extremely shitty situation, and on top of that I've been overwhelmed with schoolwork and my fucking body dysmorphia is getting worse by the day.  It's all very mentally taxing, and I feel on the verge of a mental breakdown.

Everything is stacked up against me I swear, I can never win no matter what. I'm completely lost and don't know what to do. 

tl;dr: new girl joins my class and I become her friend. Another girl comes up and they become even better friends, now I'm the third wheel.

1171,Less-Entrepreneur-93,1650754404,1,"It’s not an happy period.

I’m taking zoloft for mood swings and depressive moods. It’s probably caused by loneliness. I’ve never felt enough for others, so i always avoided joining groups or asking people to hang out.

When i walk down the streets of my city, i always see groups of friends hanging out. 
I always wonder why i’m not like other people of my age. I don’t want to go to the disco, or get drunk, or post pics of me on socials. But i also want to get to know new people too. And it’d be so weird to approach total strangers.

When i walk down the streets, the thing that hurts the most is seeing couples. 
“Why not me?”
This is the question i’ve been asking myself for years. Being chosen by a girl for who you are… that has to feel incredible. I got chills every time i think about it. 

While having friends is still something i consider reachable, being interesting for a girl feels impossible to me. It’s not that i don’t have anything to offer ( i can be funny, caring, and also passionate about things or people i care about ), but i think it’s never enough. Most of my friends left me alone when they found a special girl. They were so different after their relationships started. I’ll admit i’ve been very jealous. It seems unreachable to me. 

Just to make it worse, i’m rapidly losing my hair. I’ll have to shave my head as soon as possible, in order to get used to it. But i know it’ll affect my nonexistent dating life for the next 10 years, and probably will worsen my self esteem. I know i’ll look like a 30 yo man.

My psychiatrist tells me i’ll meet interesting people at the university, or things might get better. Honestly, i don’t think that’s the case.


I would like to be like other guys: cheerful, carefree, attractive. I want to experience a true friendship, have a group of friends and, especially, be in a relationship, at least now that i still have some hair left. But i spend my time thinking, creating stories ( i like writing stories ) and worrying about lots of things, especially my future.

I can’t find another way to rant about life.

Ever since September 2020 life is getting progressively worse, the summer was great I met so much people and met my first girlfriend. But then autumn came around with the lockdowns and stuff. My relationship was going downhill and because of the lockdowns I lost my social connections with lots of friends. It was so miserable I couldn’t even go outside and I just found myself sitting at home doing nothing all day. I was always telling myself that things would get better, even though it was not. Summer came around and my grades were the worst ever and I realized I am not passing my year this year. Then my relationship was turning in a toxic one and I broke up with my girlfriend hoping it would get better. Nothing happened it was summer and I sat inside all day because I had literally no one. I saw everyone partying and enjoying when I was sitting alone in my room watching f-king tiktok. Since then I did not met anybody else I don’t have contact with women whatsoever and I am losing more more friends and social contacts. I restarted my school year and I do not connect with anyone, on that all my remaining friends are finishing this year and as of now they are already free of school and studying. I am literally on my own now.  I also lost interest in my hobby, however I did find a new one “producing”. The thing with this is that it does not include social contact whatsoever. Yesterday I got fired the only thing keeping my going is hope in better times. From time to time I go clubbing or something but it’s like nobody connects with eachother anymore, then I feel like “what am I doing here”. Also my confidence is heavily damaged because of several events in the past and I don’t feel like i get any attention from people. Maybe it is in my head. Before COVID it was so easy to make new friends, but now it seems harder or even impossible. The magic of life just turned into a grey abyss. Everyday is the same for me but not for everyone else. Does anyone else find him or herself struggling with this.
I just want somebody with the same interests or somebody I can talk to.

I'm done making myself vulnerable to people who claim they won't judge because the first thing they do is judge. I'm never opening up to anyone again.

1180,1v3n4s,1650752182,1,"Hello,

I don't really have anyone to talk with, so I thought I'll write here.

I am 31 yo male, virgin. I am starting to hate my life. I live alone, never been in relationship and I don't have anyone to talk about my struggles in everyday life.

I love my parents and my brother and I have good relationship with them. 

I have 2 friends that I meet like every 3-6 months. But they are not my best friends, just guys that I meet once I am in my hometown just to grab a beer and talk about sports, politics etc.

My job is not boring and I have good coworkers, but they are just work friends, so we don't hang out besides few work party's.

I don't want to pity myself, because all of this is that I am experiencing for last few years, is mostly my fault. I was way too much into computer games from age 14 till 29 (I still play some casual games from time to time, but not nearly as much as I've used to). I wasn't socializing, I wasn't dating (I never been on a date). 

My self esteem is low as hell, it doesn't help that I am unattractive and my attractiveness cannot be increased just by getting haircut or having nice clothes. I have ugly face (big teeth, potato nose, big lips). I've been called ugly many times in my life and thats probably why I've isolated myself.

I just came back from my grandma birthday party. There I saw my cousins having wife's, kids, overall having good time. Today, my uncles and aunts keep asking me why I don't have gf/wife, kids, because I am already 31 and I should be. With a smile and confidence I keep t
lying them that I hate kids and I like to live alone and I keep telling them that every time I meet them. But I know very well that I am just not capable of finding a partner because of all my flaws.

Right now, I am sitting alone at my home, having suicidal thoughts (not first time tho). Thinking that I will never get to feel what is like to be loved by someone, thinking that I don't have anyone to talk with about my thoughts and my experiences.

They told me to ask her for her Instagram and I said I would do it the next time I saw her.

The next day I sat next to her and started chatting, I asked her for her insta and she added me, everything was going great, too good to be true. Well, then while we were talking she casually told me she had a boyfriend. 

The worst part is that I was expecting that to happen but my friends, who are more experienced in flirting than me, were sure that this girl liked me, so they gave me hope.

I'm not mad or anything, why would I be? I'm just sad because the one time I decide to actually do something when I like someone, this happens. I am very shy and I don't have any experience in flirting so this was a huge step for me.

Disclaimer before we carry on, yes, I am that kind of moron who believes in tarot cards and palm readings; something about a person being able to pick up very secretive details about me and the results aligning with other readings done by different people are just too convincing. But to cut to the chase, I came from a disastrous breakup with my ex-girlfriend because she cheated and faked her feelings for me throughout a good long stretch of time throughout the relationship—which really fucked me up because this is my first relationship and it had to be this fucked up. I was always the guy who’s seemed to be doomed to die alone. I was bullied from a very young age, was socially ostracized throughout my life, and I only understood the concept of friendship just very recently, a few years into college. With all of that depressing hell happening to me, fresh from the breakup, I was seeking answers hence the tarot readings and palm readings. To my surprise, I got the verdict that I will never get into a happy relationship, and that I am either doomed to horrible partners, and/or relationships that’ll never last. This is messing me up. Throughout my life, I have always thought that I will die alone. Years of bullying and social ostracizing has led me to believe that I am going to die alone, and now a lying philanderer and psychic readings have basically given the proof and confirmation that indeed they are right, that I am going to live and die alone. Yeah, this is messing with my head, and I am terrified and devastated. Apparently I exist as a cosmic joke to be lonely and misunderstood till the end of my worthless days. 

The fact that I have debilitating self-hate makes things worse. What next? Live for myself? I hate myself! Years of bullying and social ostracizing has led me to realize that yeah it pretty much was my fault! I deserved that bullying, I was weird kid growing up. If young people saw someone weird or outside normal attributes and interests then it’s very natural for them to beat the living crap out of it. Humans defend familiarity and I was in the way of that. (Full disclaimer: I do not condone bullying. However, I condone bullying to me) I refuse to live for myself because I am my greatest enemy, and I cannot live with the fact that I’m enabling my greatest enemy’s existence by letting them live. This is not pity masturbation, nor a seek of pity and clout. I calmly agree that I do not like myself and because no one else does or should, then I am terrified because I am running out of excuses to live. 

I am cosmically doomed to die alone, and I am terrified and sad about it because I’m running out of excuses to stay alive.",lonely,"I think I’m doomed to die alone and I’m terrified, and very depressed about it. (TRIGGER WARNING)",2022-04-24 03:37:39

I fuckin hate them. Every goddamn time I’m forced to go in one, I get reminded how much I hate being male.

And for all the places my hair is, it isn’t on my stupid fucking scalp. I have deep ass bald spots forming where hair just refuses to grow, I can’t put my hair into a ponytail unless the hair is PARALLEL TO THE GROUND because if it’s any lower then the bald spots show through. And it keeps falling out and getting thinner every fucking time I shower. It also won’t get any longer because it falls out too quickly. It’s not near as long as I want it to be.

So basically I'm not trying to be narcissistic or get attention but I think God has cursed me with being better looking than my classmates

I'll explain why it's a curse and why it isn't something you want to have 

Generally speaking we all think beauty is a good thing but nope, I'm a quite religious person and I was exposed to some stuff at a young age and I matured faster than most teenagers my age (I'm 15) so that explains why I'm religious and well God didint make me incredibly hot or astonishingly handsome he just gave me a prettier face than others and I didn't really care about it till recently cause I've noticed guys looking at me (men if you wanna know if you're good looking don't try to catch women looking at you they're good at it and try catching other men who have a very bad look on their face looking at you) and also sometimes girls and guys very quick to judge 

Guys have really let there jealousy leak out once in a while and it's really hurtful to know that guys hate you for just having a face 

And they don't understand women generally don't care about face most women have a whole different way of finding someone hot and it's not just about physical appearance 

So in the end I don't care about how I look I like wearing a face mask since it covers my face and I just stick to myself and minimise going out 

So that's why it's a curse cause teenage guys are insecure and jealous enough to hate me and girls don't care just because of the pretty face 

I genuinely am a nice person who tries there best not to hurt anyone cause I know how bad it hurts when you abuse someone (was bullied throughout my middle school and it happens now as well) so yeah it feels nice to say these things cause most people would say oh you're narcissistic or your ungrateful

1262,sadboy1999258,1650715652,1,"‘. . . Loneliness is hallmarks by an intense desire to bring the experience to a close; Something which cannot be achieved by sheer willpower or by simply getting out more, but only by developing intimate connections. This is far easier said than done, especially for people whose loneliness arises from a state of loss or exile or prejudice, who have reason to fear or mistrust as well as long for the society of others.
‘. . .  the lonelier a person gets, the less adept they become at navigating social currents. Loneliness grows around them, like mould or fur, a prophylactic that inhibits contact, no matter how badly contact is desired. Loneliness is accretive, extending and perpetuating itself.

Everyone said I'd be perfect for the job and I believed them. Idek why I applied for it, I was feeling more confident that day probably. I've since weaned down to 5mg from 20mg of lexapro, and lately I've been feeling more anxious and depressed. Like self-deprecating, excessive worrying, always belittling myself, feeling like I'm not good enough, stuff like that. I used to be numb to those feelings and I just needed the meds to know that I can ignore those thoughts. I work in a clinical lab, I believe in medicine, and I needed some external thing to help me understand that I can ignore those thoughts. And at my fullest dose, I was able to do it. I just needed to know that it was doable, and being on those meds proved it.

I don't want to be on lexapro anymore because I want to control these thoughts on my own without the help of ssri's..I mean, I was doing really well actually. But today I just had a bad day at work, and I felt like a failure or like worthless or something.

This might sound kinda ridiculous.. maybe it's more appropriate for the r/intp.. but, um... 

It's just been really emotionally weighty to me. I have talent as an artist, writer, and I love to try to come up with things. Because of these good qualities:

---One ex decided to burn her drawings

---Ex after that: decided to burn her drawings.

---My final ex: completely gave up on drawing because of me, didn't want to hear any poetry that's not directly about her, and got jealous of the characters I was coming up with for my story.

This probably sounds like satire, but I swear on my life it's real. I genuinely feel like I'm cursed. I even feel emotional writing this.

Then again, I kinda understand. My father's a highly skillful musician, so the thought of learning music is very daunting for me.

Anyways..... what even.. now thinking about it makes me feel like I want to laugh, but I don't. I really don't.

The only people who seemed to have any fascination in me have been various teachers and my parents. I don't like sharing stuff with my parents. I think I felt a bit of attraction to a certain professor I had that seemed a bit fascinated by my work. I guess that's irrelevant. I'm not special. There's plenty of talented people who put more effort into their work and have lots to show for it. 

Now I'm not in college anymore, so that feeling of, well, what I described.. I'm not getting that anymore. That specific kind of attention that I've always craved. But even then, it wasn't by someone who had romantic interest in me. So it wasn't enough. Nobody has fulfilled this for me. But I know I'd feel this way for an equally or even lesser-talented woman that I were in a relationship with.

There is a definitive memory from when I was I kindergarten. I was drawing a semi truck in (flawed) perspective, and the teacher complimented me on it, very surprised. Then, the class tsundere looked down at it, and told me that it looked good. I think that memory still resonates with me. In kindergarten, later on, I btriefly ran a ""game design club"" in one of the rooms during our recess time. Is it weird to peak in kindergarten?

And here I am now... I am floating through space on this bed just getting dragged through time. Wishing that, what, someone was obsessed with me? I'm not a narcissist, right? I mean, I have low self esteem, but I like personality traits that are considered toxic and I know my creative and artistic value. I feel a bit guilty for actually getting to the point of liking myself. Granted, I have some vanity issues with how I look. Hm....... and I'm practically a kuudere.. 

I can't help but think of the negative impacts I've had on most of the people I've dated. I've tried to help them, but I have negative long term effects. I'll continue to bear this guilt, and I hope that this cycle can be broken, without me not dating again, because I'm too stubborn.

So, a call to action: I'm going to make the best fucking webcomic single-handedly, plot-wise, emotions-wise, witiness-wise, poetry-wise, and... probably not art-wise, but it'll be damn sufficient, and visualized through the lense of my peculiar mind that adds colorful abstractions for the portrayal of mood in te absence of music! And I WILL get at least one fucking fan who eagerly awaits my greatest creation!

I might find someone to connect with or at the very least have a casual encounter with."" I know now that I am so completely amd utterly behind my peers that I think I might need professional help. All going out these past couple months has rekindled my urge to drink. I know I'm very limited by my demographics as far choices in partner go, but a part of tells me if I can't find some kind of happiness in a small pond, what kind of chance do I have in a larger market... What kind of advice would a therapist give me that haven't done already? I feel like my area is so sparsely populated, that to even find a proper shrink, id probably have to move... There was one day I was feeling particularly low a few weeks ago and remember I got asked the question ""Why are you still single?"" at least 4 times that day by clients and coworkers. My first response was articulate and thoughtful enough, but they became progressively less so to the point that I was literally stuttering by the last response... I'm beginning to think now that people fall on a ""Loneliness Spectrum"" Some people are meant to find that one, some people die alone, and most people fall in between.

Barefoot in the wildest winter...Catching my death...And I couldn't be sure...I had a feeling so peculiar...That this pain would be for...

But I swear...You were there...And I was catching my breath...Floors of a cabin creaking under my step...And I couldn't be sure...I had a feeling so peculiar...This pain wouldn't be for...

every once in a while (like right now) my subconscious guards will get tired of fighting and all the bad emotions will bubble up and ill cry a ton

i dont feel connected to anything anymore, i keep repeating the question ""what am i supposed to do""?

logically i know that:
- no one is supposed to do anything, meaning is ultimately subjective and must be created, not found
- i feel this way mostly because my basic needs for human connection arent being met (and probbly have never been)
- to fix this, i need to put myself in places where i can naturally form connections (?)

but i dont really want to feel better anymore

i cant kill myself, that would hurt the people that care about me too much, but i really dont want to experience anything or try anything anymore

""its going to get better"" doesnt work anymore because i dont want it to get better lol

it seems like this intense sadness is what i need to feel (?)
i dont know why im making a reddit post about this, maybe im looking for validation? i genuinely cant tell

i think that in order to live with these feelings, i learned to disconnect from them

For a while I thought I was a part of many of these friend groups, but I was really just an occasional tag-a-long. It's not that they had problems with me, but I just wasn't close enough to them as everyone else in their ""groups"" were.

I still don't necessarily belong to any friend group and I don't even have close friends (or family, for that matter), but I feel like I don't deserve to be lonely since I have so many people I get along with just fine.

Has anyone else had experiences like this? I'm curious as to how you dealt with this.",lonely,Knowing everyone and no one (feeling like I don't deserve to be lonely),2022-04-23 10:48:00

I personally don't have any relation with the few blood relatives I have, it's not that kind of situation and I just tell people that I simply don't have a family, because it's true.

Ever since my dad landed in the hospital and I'm just here with my brothers, I basically talked with her every day as basically the only one outside my family. We had good conversations, and I could let go of some steam as well. We were even considering meeting up in may. It felt really nice having someone like her, I just don't have any irl friends and online it's just a few. We been friends for more than a year now.

Until two weeks when she suddenly went quiet. I was worried what the matter was, she said she needed space because something happened to her. I though I was being too annoying, but after being reassured it was not me I said I'll give her space and time to mend. Yet, I still worry about her, so I did sent a message saying I was thinking about her and hoping things went well.

But last week was an utter hell for me. And then she suddenly removed me and kicked me from her server. Being afraid and worried why, I asked her why and she said she needs space. I said I will not message her again until she does and said I was worried about her. Then later the day got blocked.

Since then I've been holing myself up and just feel worried. I don't know how long and if so, I don't know if she wants to stay friends at all. I did not get blocked on any other platform we have each other on but I don't plan on messaging her there yet. And if she wants to stay friends, then I don't know how to reply at all. I'm just worried and missing her. It's pathetic, I know, but at times like these I really don't know anymore. 

I got blocked before, but she said she thought she was just hurting me yet by blocking me I got hurt.

Sound familiar?

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You’re in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It’s an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

· I need everyone to approve of me. 

· To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‘I must compare myself to others’ which can be re-framed to ‘I live my own life on my own terms’ or ‘I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others’. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‘Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others’ or ‘I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other’s accomplishments’ or ‘The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards’. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",lonely,And who do you think you are?,2022-04-23 04:26:04

What hurt me the most was getting replaced in projects by someone else without even letting me know, they did it in front of me, like what are you gonna do about it, without even thinking it was messed up.

Whenever I tried to open up about some personal stuff I felt comfortable sharing with who I considered to be a friend, they wouldn’t give me a single minute of their time, and showing complete disinterest, ghosting me for weeks just to come back whenever they needed me or when they weren’t ”busy” anymore, funnily, they never were busy when I saw them hanging out with with each other and spending hours laughing… 

I decided to erase myself from everyone else’s lives, blocked and erased their numbers, it’s not like they texted me in the first place but this way I won’t think of texting them, stopped hanging out with them and talking to them even when I see them in college, I just sit by myself now with my earphones in listening to 90s grunge which is sincerely the only thing that kinda makes me feel understood.",lonely,I’ve always been a spare tyre.,2022-04-23 03:41:34

It was fun in the beginning, there's always something to talk about even after tons of differences. It was quite fun honestly. 

But after a month or so, the intensity started to fade and the differences started to kick in. And as a result I drifted away. But, they were, I guess really a lonely and checked up on me time to time. It was bit of a work to answer the same things over and over again, but we did carry on for quite a while. 

When I met them, I was down. But, gradually my situation improved and I would get bored of hearing their stories. I did not respond to their texts for many days. I was just carrying on, quite frankly I was bored of hearing the same old monotonous stories. 

Whenever I stopped answering, they would try to initiate a conversation time after time. And I ""didn't need that"".  But eventually, they stopped trying to talk to me. It's been a long time now, we haven't talked. 

I never thought I would want to talk to them again. All those friends I made a while back, well dynamics keep changing and I am back to being a loner. I would love to have someone to talk to now, and I feel so guilty of ghosting this friend. 

They were a good friend. I'm pretty sure they would've heard me out and encouraged me. Their advice might not have always worked out for me, but they always listened and at least tried to help. I feel I've taken advantage of them, I realized I never listened to them much. I was selfish.

I'm lonely once again and I've tried making more friends here, but none of them would feel like that.

I just saw an old friend that I remembered I didn't want to hang out with anymore because he had an inapropriate opinion about my body. Thats where I drew the line with him. But if my best friend were to say the same thing I would just let it slide or tell her it was wrong. Shes obviously a closer friend and I can be more forgiving. Is it that the beginning of friendships are so importent before you can really start being yourself?

I want to make friends as an adult but I don't want to be disrespected by people who don't know me too well. I want to be forgiving and accepting but I don't want people around who could treat others disrespectfully or take advantage of me for being accepting. I also hate being used. I'm a human being.

every day is passing the same way for the last 3 years. i haven't made any memories and so i cling onto fake memories of the past. i can't let go because im afraid that if i do, i would spiral into insanity. 

i keep seeing classmates, ex classmates, all having the time of their lives, going to the beach, studying/ playing games together, staying up late to roam the city, having discord calls together for hours at a time, going to a concert, watching movies, partying, etc. and here i am, in my room, creating stories and characters to distract myself from my own reality. because im a loner who gets their happiness from fictional worlds like a fucking incel. 

im lucky enough to have my parents and im grateful for them, but theyre busy and tired a lot of the time. whenever i see other people happy or whenever i watch shows, im reminded that ""im supposed to be doing this"" ""im supposed to be like that"" yet im not, im wasting it all, im wasting the years which most memories are made. and soon, in a blink of an eye i would be an adult with a busy job with no time for such stuff.

i want to save these years for later, for when i have someone to spend them with if that impossibility ever happens. but i cant, i cant just put time in a box and open it whenever. i can't just pause everything. im forced to use them now, and all im doing is wasting. its like watching everything wither before i can even touch it.

I’ve met co workers but have never had a deep personal connection with them to hang out outside of work. Also I’ve never really had friends before I moved out my parents house so therefore there are no bridges to go back to. I’ve jumped to different schools almost every year since I was in middle school so I’m used to feeling alone and isolated since I couldn’t make any friends when I was in school. I don’t have social media because of personal reasons and I struggle to make friends in real life. I don’t do much when I get out of work and my thoughts echo in my apartment. I don’t go out because it’s already a struggle to make it through the month until my next rent bill pops up. Also the people who do want to be friends just want to fuck me. I have hobbies but after a while I get unmotivated and this loneliness kills. Some days I don’t mind the loneliness but other days I have self pity for myself I often get depressed.

We don’t speak at all now, she won’t respond. We had a friend group but it was just 3 people including me. We got really close last year and spent a lot of time together. She was a bit different from my other friends and I liked her more than I’ve ever liked anyone before. I was so happy when we were together. She said she only loved a few people in life and that I was one of them. I don’t think she was lying, I do think she loved me as much as she was capable of, but I think the love faded. I know she probably doesn’t have a passing thought about me now, but she was pretty much my life. I don’t get out much or have many friends (I lost her and one other friend recently). This isn’t the first time I’ve been left in a friendship it’s been happening since I was a kid. I think I have abandonment issues because a lot of my friends over the years have lost interest in me and just stopped associating with me. To me it seems kind of pathetic to have such severe abandonment issues over something minor that happened when I was a kid. As of now I feel like I won’t be able to allow myself to make friends again because I’m afraid they’ll leave me because somethings wrong with me. I guess I’m not interesting enough. I don’t have anyone to hang out with in real life because my 2 remaining friends (which I don’t feel close to anymore) live far away. I like being alone physically but I like to know that there’s someone I have to speak to everyday. I usually don’t talk to anyone anymore, I went from talking to around 4 people a day to none. It’s my birthday today and I’m an adult now but I feel like there’s no hope in trusting anyone in the future, I think this was my final straw as pathetic as that sounds. This is probably the lowest I’ve been in years and I feel like no one likes me. Just like when I was a young girl and got picked on and made fun of for some reason I wasn’t aware of. Anyway, I keep getting reminded of her from songs and old pictures, it makes me sad. I feel like I’m going through a breakup (I’ve never been in a relationship).

I have never really had a stable group of friends. Usually because I left for reasons or they disbanded and went separate ways. 

There has been a circle of friends that I had I held kinda close. It was a really good group. However, the person I am cohabiting with to help take care of our child has not made it easy for me. We are exes and with the economy, its been difficult finding separate places. I recently tried getting back into contact with someone I used to talk to and they couldnt handle it. We got into some arguments. I wanted to reach out to my support network and he couldnt handle it. Im sure it cost me a couple friends and im about ready to drop the other two because I feel like a terrible friend and I want to say fuck it on being social because I am tired of the drama.  Tired of the back and forth. I feel so fucking alone and just want to talk to somebody without feeling like the only person I can talk to is someone I dont want to talk to nor trust completely. So, might as well focus on the very basic and important. 

I have no family above me or around my age range but my mother to talk to and we arent that close. And she doesnt want to hear everything. She may listen, but she is very You On Your Own For The Most Part. 

I just want to freaking lie down in the sun and soak it up like a damn lizard right now. Seriously. Im so tired of all the turmoil and shit. I know many of us are and are struggling to hold on for unknown reasons. I just hope, like many, there is a good fucking reason.

I just do not understand why this is. I have an acquaintance/friend who is the above. I thought he was awesome, understanding, tender-hearted, a big softie, etc. So did his friends. But whenever he tried to meet someone, they'd often flake on him, the conversations would be one-sided, they would just straight up treat him as worthless.

i didn’t realize how reliant i was on my family, but being away from them is probably the worst part. i have a few acquaintances in my classes, but i don’t have anyone to talk to outside of them. it’s really wearing on me, a lot more than i thought it would. i’m miserable, i’m completely unmotivated, i’m skipping classes, and i’ve spent days in bed without even eating. i was a great student all through high school, and now i’m just apathetic. it’s like i’m a different person. 

i’m autistic (self-dx, but hoping to get a formal diagnosis soonish) and it’s always been hard for me to get close to people, but it’s never been this bad. i honestly feel like i’m from a different planet. i like to think that i have some redeeming qualities. i’m smart, i’m funny (at least in my own opinion), i’m not quite painful to look at. i just don’t know how to make connections with people.

 I might be wrong but I think I realised something. my group started to treat me differently once they saw her drifting away from me. I was the mutual between her and my group at first but it seems now they like her more than me. Only having guy friends sets a different personality in front of others.

I know it’s more about the connection but you can eventually establish that when you build up the courage to talk to the people already in your life. On the other hand, when I say I have no friends it isn’t an exaggeration and it also isn’t due to lack of trying. I find that people often already have their own friend groups established so they have no reason to put in the effort to have a connection with you.

she got into a relationship about a month ago and i am really happy for her. but a small part of me is jealous because in my 20 years i have never, ever come close to having a boyfriend.

i don’t know what’s wrong with me. i tried dating apps, but i feel like i get too attached. it’s so confusing differentiating between dating for sex &amp; dating for relationships. i did date a guy for a relationship once. he basically said he didn’t like me, but found me really attractive so wanted to keep having casual sex. he ghosted me shortly after. i sobbed and still don’t know if i’m fully healed.

so i decided to stop daring for relationships and just sex instead. found a guy, we’d been trying to make plans but he was always busy, then eventually stopped texting me altogether. i didn’t think i was attached to him until i once again, cried and cried and am now feeling like there’s something intrinsically wrong with me. 

and this has happened so many times, with so many different boys. i don’t even believe they actually find me attractive anymore, because i seriously don’t understand matching with someone you find attractive, messaging them, and then proceeding to not put in any effort to keep them in your life. i hold on to every boy i find attractive because honestly i’m picky and it’s really exhausting having to go start over on dating apps. 

i don’t think i’m capable of being loved or liked at all. and every bit of rejection hurts to the point of triggering my suicidal ideation. every single time. no matter how much i tell myself i dont need a certain boy in my life, every time they leave, which they always, always, do, it hurts so badly and i just cry and wish i could cease to exist so i don’t have to go through it anymore.",lonely,i’ll never know what being wanted or loved feels like. 20f.,2022-04-22 14:54:41

And also seeing my two friends who are in a relationship being all lovey dovet makes me feel even more alone.

And now the fun part :) i got a girlfriend and i am really trying to push myself to be some what excited for anything we plan. We are planning going to itally and i just feel like i dont care or just like meh and i know i would be excited before this mood swing.

Also its really weird i am the only one in my entire family thats kinda lonely and not excited about anything i havent had a proper friend in my country for 15 years i dont know why i dont fit in but no one gives me a chance after the first initial meet

Any tips ? I dont want to bore or kill the happy mood of my gf.

I have been lonely for a couple of years now every year I thought next year would me less lonely my break point was on my birthday I was looking out for it for 3 months and when the day broke I came home from school finding a card of my mom that she appreciated my help and some money this made me so happy but then I thought about doing something fun so I went out and I went ice skating alone ofcourse. I saw a couple of guys I knew and they asked “who are you here with?” I was ashamed and just lied and said “with a friend he already left” nobody even knew it was my birthday I just stayed there for a couple more minutes before feeling lonely again and I just left and went to eat at Macdonalds I ordered and ate my meal I was pretty upset I was that lonely on my birthday but yeah after that I almost weakly go to the movies to cope with my loneliness the rest of the time I just am in my room and on social media looking at others with friends I know I sound  ridiculous but I just wanted to vent about it,lonely,Trying to cope with it,2022-04-22 09:10:40

1504,Appropriate_Ad_811,1650582202,1,"I feel like I’ve lost my life. Almost exactly a year ago today (April 25), I got sick, and not just a cold or a flu… I mean really sick. I woke up that day and I could not get out of bed. I couldn’t move my legs or my arms or my hands, just my head. I was later taken to the hospital, and because of the severity of my paralysis I had to be put on a ventilator. Now all of this happened in my sleep, which means there were no signs or nothing ahead of time where I knew this would’ve happened. It was a complete shock, a mystery and it completely turned my life upside down.

Even prior to getting sick, I was kind of a loaner, and introvert. I kept to myself a lot, and I would rarely go out or even out of my room. But this is the most lonely I’ve ever felt in my whole entire life. I came home from the hospital about a month ago, and even being home doesn’t feel the same anymore. I felt trapped while I was in the hospital, and I still feel trapped at home. I can’t go anywhere on my own I can’t do any of the things I used to do because of my limited function in my hands and not being able to walk. I’ve honestly felt like I have lost everything that made me happy in life, and I cannot find joy in anything that I used to find joy in anymore.

I still struggle to talk to people and to open up and now that I am literally trapped in my own body, it’s even harder than it was before. I don’t like people asking me how I’m feeling because I don’t like talking about it. I just feel stuck, like I’ve been in the same place for a year now and that light at the end of the tunnel is just too damn and too far away.

Honestly right now I’m just looking for people to talk to, and I find it is way easier to talk to people online then it is to talk to people in person so if there’s anyone out there who’s feeling lonely and want somebody to talk to you, I’m here.",lonely,I feel like I’ve lost my life,2022-04-22 09:03:22

1506,DrJamesy,1650581623,1,"I had literally no friends until I was 8. I hung out with these people for a year until I realised that if I stopped talking I'd just be left sitting there... if I didn't hang out with them nothing would change. 

My dad never cared about me, only saw me as a possession. Left me in a boiling van cabin with nothing to do while he slept in the back and barely fed me. He left when I was 8 and I haven't talked to him since... 

I got bullied ever since I started school so my only interactions were only really getting bullied and them blamed for arguing back thus getting me in trouble to the actual bully. When I was 9 I started showing signs of being suicidal, I said stuff like ""I want to die"" or ""I should just die"". 

I didn't have a friend again until I was 11 and I used them. I didn't know how to be in a friendship so I blamed everything on them to save my reputation. I liked a girl when I was 11 and when I got rejected I couldn't handle it. She over overexaggerated it and told everyone I was a pervert and that I said I wanted to fuck her, which wasn't true and destroyed my reputation.

Luckily a new girl joined the school when I was 14, we didn't talk for a year until I was late 15. She got heartbroken by her ex bf and I tried to support her and help her through it. She messaged me every day for months and told me that i helped her and "" i don't know where i would be without you"" 

After a few months of talking I developed a crush on her. I didn't tell her until last week when I got a bit drunk and told her she was cute and then told her I liked her. She now hasn't talked to me for 5 days which is unusual . I didn't know if it's just because we're prepping for our GCSEs soon or she just didn't want to talk to me but I saw her Instagram story the other day and she was hanging out with her friends and then today I saw her at the shops doing the same thing...

however they both have their own groups of friends who they spend a lot more time with, my friend in particular.

with my friend, her friend group is very difficult to get along with and they dislike me as i don’t really fit in with their interests, etc.

my boyfriend, his friends like me, but we never speak nor am i invited to anything with them.

i used to have a big friend group, but they all ditched me after i confronted the ‘ringleader’ lets say, about them outing a tonne of personal trauma i had previously shared to her in the confidence it would remain a secret between her and me. succeeding this i was then blocked by her on every platform, completely demonised saying that ‘i was at fault and that’s why the traumatic event happened to me’ and the entire group went against me and that was the end of my social life apart from one friend that saw what they did to me was wrong.

at the moment it is the easter break for me, and i haven’t felt this lonely forever. my boyf went out to the city with his friends the other day, and i couldn’t help but envy it. i haven’t left my house once this break apart from a date w the boyfriend, and my friend has been busy the entire break on holiday.

it has made me realise how much i miss having a big group of people…. yes they treated me like dogshit but i would go out regularly and have a laugh. im a teen, about to enter my gcse summer (10 week break!!!) and i have no clue who i will spend it with…

1516,JustAnotherCeeJay,1650576794,1,"I’ve accepted that my life will be a lonely one. I haven’t secluded myself or stopped trying to reach out to others…but I think deep down I always know the outcome so I don’t invest too much of my heart into new situations. 

That being said, I still wonder what it would be like to find one of those special people that do anything for someone they are committed to. I know I use to be one of them, and I’m sure this Sub is full of people that are, or use to be that way. You see those characters in movies and shows…they fight so hard for the person they love and in the end they live happily ever after. 

I burned that concept into my soul. No matter the situation, I would fight through anything and do whatever I could to maintain my relationships/friendships. Sadly…those were all fictional stories I was watching. The reality is, those of us that do anything for those we care about usually just end up being used and eventually tossed aside when we aren’t needed. 

This post isn’t meant to be a downer though, but just the thoughts going through my mind at the moment. Those of us that have given our all and still ended up being tossed aside, we are still treasures. Just because we were used, and not treated fairly doesn’t make us “less” or garbage. It just means we put all of our efforts into someone that was  blind as to what a truly caring person is really worth. 

We are still treasures. We may not shine as brightly as we use to, but we are still worthy of being loved and cared for…truly “treasured” for what we have to offer someone else. We may not all find that one person that we would like to treat us that way, but that doesn’t diminish our worth. We are priceless, and if others don’t see everything we have to offer, that’s their problem, not ours. Does it hurt being a treasure in a world full of blind people? Absolutely. But just know, I see you…and you are beautiful. And if I see you, that means others do to…and who knows, hopefully the person you want to see you, will. 

Embrace that you are a treasure, no matter how you’ve been treated or how many blind people haven’t realized your worth.

1551,yoru_ni_kakeru_02,1650561466,1,"I am asian. I come from a family where my parents are always arguing. Even now that Im in my 30s, they still do.

I have a mum who often gas lighting me. A dad who has always been ""absent"" in my life, rarely talks to me even though we live in the same house. And I too lives with a grandma (paternal side) coz she was asked by my dad to move in with us to take care of me and my sibiling when both my parents were working.  But she is the typical whistle blower to my neighbours or relatives about everything that happen in my house. I have heard nasty story about her, she has acted pitiful and cried in front my relatives that we weren't taking good care of her and that my mum treated her badly.

Anyway... Basically they all hate each other but have to put up with each other coz they have no where else to go / stay. 

In my entire 30 years old, I was not abused physically. Nobody gives me beatings or sht like that. People around me often thinks I victimised myself and perhaps I do because I was seeking attention elsewhere where I can't get from home. I always made to feel everything bad that happened is my fault. 

* It's my fault that my dad pay less attention to my mum
* It's my fault that she isnt happy in this household
* It's my fault that she has to choose to trap here with me because I'm her kid and I was too young to take care of myself and that she pity me
* I am not friendly enough / smiley enough for my grandma to loves me
* Or that I am not good enough like my cousin
* Or why my face always look so angry 

I grow up feeling unsure of myself. I have very low self esteem. My parents are not the type that will give praises or supports but rather often gives bad remarks or complains. 

So growing up, i have 2 phases. Pretending to be someone I am not to feel fit in or emo and avoid human interaction at all cost. 

And despite how parents treated me, I tried to please them however I can. I studied real hard and often get straight As in hope that they will praise me and also that my family will be happy. 

Then, comes the year I was struggling with studies and friends. I often feels I have hard time connecting with people, that I have something wrong in my system to be emphatic with people. I was at the lowest point of my life. I dn really rmbr what i did that causes my mum to react in such way ---&gt; she kneel down to me and beg me to make her life less miserable. Maybe my dad is blaming her again. 

At that point of life, something just breaks inside me. I almost gave up my studies because I started to see my effort bear no fruit. They will never give me the loves and attention that I want just because I studied real hard and ace the exam for them. In my teen years, my parents are everythg to me and it starts to crumble down. Well thank God for few of my friends that sticks with me. Else, I don't know how/where I will end up to. 

Then comes uni year where I have to be apart from them and study in another state. I only go back for semester break. It was the time I feel there's thing larger than my small world. Met different people from different state. And because I have to live independently, I am gaining confidence that I am not a failure after all. 

Then after graduation, I move back to the house. And I continue to stay with them until now. I thought things were getting better but pandemic has proves me wrong. Very often my mum will yell at my grandma for her habit"" and my dad often stay silent and let everything just transcends to chaos. Sometimes things get even heat up when my parents argue over the little of things.

Working from home was tough. And my mental state took a dive. I tried therapy session. It feels like it's working but after a year, I had to stop due to financial problem. Prices were rising and I have trouble staying afloat. 

But even I have trouble staying afloat, I have decided to move out to get out from that toxic environment. Then today things got pretty heated up again because my mum was yelling and it's about my dad blaming my mum that I am moving out. 

I have no one to turn to, to talk about these things. My close friends are all family oriented and I don't like to bring this issue to them because they often dn know what to say or advise. I know everyone has their own family problem but why do I feel my family are like the worse kind of ppl to live with. 

I just don't know what to do at this point. Explaining to them why I want to move out feels it's pointless because of the way they reacted / defended themselves. I just feel so exhausted at this point. Why was I even born into this household?

I think Japan,  US, Canada,  the west, the east are cool, w/e.... but our governments do treat us super unfairly, for example in Japan they've 99.99% conviction rate... if the government thinks You did it, they'll get a fake confession out of You.

I want all of US to do good,  to be happy... not just the 1% or the 3% or the 10 %..... we all deserve dignity and respect.

The people I have called friends in the past I found out were gloating and mocking me behind my back when they found out someone I was interested in friend zoned me quite strongly which was fine however it was the fact they found it really funny and we’re happy about it.

1578,Effective-Biscotti81,1650539499,1,". ive been so lonely so far, theres not much i would immediately have in common with others (especially being a tad 'fruity') but maybe that's just where i live. because of that, its been hard to make close friends; sure a bit of small talk here and there to get on good terms with people, ive gotten pretty good at that but close friends? not really. the friends you do find, they come and go. if you want any semblance of a social life, you have to endeavour to craft it yourself. no one will fall out of the sky to comfort you, and no one is able to read your mind to see how you truly feel. if they knew, at least a handful would offer to lend a hand. i wallowed in self-pity, the amount of times i have cried over this inescapable feeling, that my teen years were slipping so quickly away and i would have no memories that i would be fond of. it felt so awful. it may sound obvious or even a little bit insensitive, but dont sit there complicit and be sad for yourself. nothing will change and no one will know what youre going through; its just how things work. in having said that if youre truly alone, take baby steps. this could be going out (you dont need to do this with other people), go to a local restaurant, go on a hike, go thrifting to piece together a new fire fit; i chronically stayed at home, i could not muster the energy, reason or emotional strength to wrestle against my clinical anxiety to go out. when i did find it, i felt so much more independent and confident in myself, it was a rush. i would say you need to find yourself before you can fully make friends with others, if you're just someone there to just laugh at their jokes and perhaps return the occasional witty remark, you're not going to attract many long-term friends. people want to be around other people who they think are interesting, funny, relatable or any combination of other adjectives. someone who might add on to their experiences, or bring something new and interesting to the table. you could pick up a hobby. i picked up the art of artmaking, i drew every single day as an outlet to express what i was feeling, which has culminated in me becoming at least i would say decently good technically, and conceptually. i like to share it to social media, they might be intrigued, they might not care, it might even be a mix. but at least then, you have something new to talk about the next time you bump into them. i also started expanding my taste in music as well. my point is, if youre reading this and it sounds like you might be in a similar situation: work on yourself, find happiness in yourself first. you shouldn't need others to be content with your life. the more you discover about yourself, the more you can share with others, and the higher chance they might stay around that little while longer for you to seize the day. this might be overly cliche, or you might've just skipped to the end for a tldr but i wish you all good luck in your journeys considering i probably wont ever encounter any of you again 😁😁.",lonely,dont overly self-pity yourself,2022-04-21 21:11:39

Sometimes it seems we let ourselves get bogged down by what other people think, or let their opinions on us shape our outlook on ourselves. While it's never a bad thing to take constructive criticism, we can't let someone's sour mood because of something outside of either of our control hurt us to such a degree. Of course someone badmouthing us will hurt, but we should see if we can take anything from said badmouthing and grow, even if just to spite their faulty opinion of us.  
They'll more than likely forget the following day, week, whatever, but while you might remember that, it won't matter to them. Even if you see them every day, especially if they're commonly in a bad mood! While taking care of yourself, take care of those you love, and if they're not adding something to your life? Even if it's something as simple as a smile and kind words when you're at your lowest, seriously look at if you need them.

I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia and over all being very insecure and mean to myself. I’m working hard to overcome these things but I still feel alone, not wanted, and not worthy of someone’s time and affection.
I’ve been at my current job for 6 months, my department is all men and myself. I feel kinda pathetic to admit this, but the attention they’ve been giving me has kinda help with my confidence. For once I feel desirable. And it’s led to some impulsive and bad decisions. Like sleeping with a couple of my coworkers. I’m always forward with my intentions before anything physical happens: I want something causal, preferable non-committal, and that I was interested in other people. They never seem to have an issue at first, but the same thing always happens, afterwards they say they don’t like women who “move that fast” or “sleep around”. 
I know I bring this upon myself, and they have every right to to not want to be with someone like me.  But it still hurts. I keep hoping that one of them will stick around long enough so I don’t feel so lonely all the time.

1619,bikersquid333,1650516492,1,"I can't remember clearly but apparently I had a small friend group of three guys in kindergarten and reception as we call it in the UK, so age 4 or 5 maximum. Unfortunately that was the end of my friendship days. Since then, and as far back as I can actually remember, I've had huge difficulty making and keeping friends. I've never felt truly loved or wanted or appreciated by a fellow peer,  if that makes sense? I haven't been able to connect with anyone on a deeper level and what makes it so painful is that I'm literally the opposite person of who you might think to be typing this. I get along very well with everyone I meet but only at a purely acquaintance/small talk level. 

I put it down to my upbringing and always being the odd one out or unique should I say because I'm definitely not odd, and I've been told many times that I'm not 'odd' as well. I grew up ripping through the streets on my bike with my brother and a couple neighbourhood kids. I was climbing trees, exploring, crossing rivers and flying through the monkey bars and slides at my local park, etc 😁. I didn't even know what video games were until much later and I'm thankful for it because objectively I had a great childhood playing so many different sports and my parents really did give me everything they could have...

Except maybe the ability to stand up for myself and fight back the bullies and weak sheeple who looked down on me because I had long hair for a time and probably talked about different things to them. Even the parents of my school mates would look at me weird and for me to remember and even acknowledge that as a kid, it must've been very toxic. Later on in high school I was similarly ostracized by certain teachers as well, never mind my peers. It's been an excruciatingly slow, painful and most importantly consistent downward spiral of diminishing self esteem, self confidence, self assurance, contentment, happiness. 

I have always stayed strong and stuck to my guns, never sold out and that's probably why I haven't been able to 'fit in'. Thing is, I see so many genuinely 'odd' or 'unique' people and they seem to find each other and honestly couldn't be happier. Full love to them, I'm envious of their joy and how easy it seems for them to make friends even if just with one another. I'm just completely baffled and disheartened why I just can't seem to make any headway with fellow human beings. I mean shit, even animals like me! I have two cats and they are great and all the dogs and cats and other pets of people I've met over the years have always been good with me (I mention it because I do believe they have a 6th sense) and can tell a good person from bad. 

Oh, and I've never been in a proper relationship so double, triple, quadruple whammy 🙄😂. Everyone says my standards are too high but then I think on it and always come back to the answer 'why shouldn't I have high standards?' (which tbh are not high at all, I just haven't found someone yet who is physically active and intelligent, but humble and down-to-earth at the same time). It's always one or the other unfortunately I won't settle for less since it wouldn't do either of us any favours in the long run. 

And in the end, I always end up alone, completely isolated from everyone. It seems like people want absolutely nothing to do with me unless they are getting something out of me. I've recently dropped out of uni because of this mental anguish and I was abused by my last boss so quit the job and I'm at a real crux in my life right now.

As soon as I got back to my place I packed up all my things that I could put them in my car and I left because it was no longer safe for me to be there. This post isn't about that situation is just about the last two years since I've been living out of my car.

Man it's just so hard on me knowing that I really don't matter. All of my friends family co-workers etc, I've always said we'll have your back no matter what, only to have my request to do laundry at a friend's house the first week I was homeless not denied but ignored, and the same thing happened with countless other friends and family members. I don't understand why people do that, they extend their love to you verbally or on social media but when the rubber hits the road they don't want to do anything and it's okay you know they're not obligated to do anything for me. And that's one thing I learned the last 2 years is that people will just say things just the same you know. 

Another time a person who I called my best friend / brother laughed at me in a text message because I was using the 7-Eleven app and if I had somebody sign up using my link I could get a free two slices of pizza or something like that. And he responded with laughing emojis, I already send the link and nothing happened. Once again nobody's obligated to do anything for me or to help me. The hardest part was my birthday was last month in March and just like last year nobody called me, nobody remembered and I used to never really you know take too much stock in the birthdays, but man it hurts so bad no one that once you're out of the picture, don't have any money, can't hang out or go to the clubs or any of the stuff we used to do, you're pretty much nothing to them. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this post and I feel like I'm just rambling but man I'm really kind of just feeling this loneliness and it's it's hurting me so bad. Abnormalize the thought of me being worthless, and my wife not meeting anything because what do you do when the people that you think are supposed to love you don't? Their days man where I wish I had never been born, cuz it's not the homelessness it's not living out of my car it's not being able to eat for the last 2 weeks, it's the nothing, that silence no text messages no calls not even somebody coming up to the place where you kind of hang during the day when you're not doing anything to check up on you. 

I swear the only thing that's keeping me going at this point is that my father's still alive and I don't want to put them through having to bury me or any nonsense like that. I'm not perfect nobody is but I wonder sometimes what did I do to deserve this? Not the homelessness but the lack of love from everybody who cared when everything was good 

I don't really know why I'm posting this I usually don't use social media much but I just felt like I just needed just to say something to somebody maybe just to get it off my chest to vent I don't know. But if anybody has any advice how to manage this feeling it would be much appreciated.",lonely,two years homeless and I'm invisible,2022-04-21 14:18:18
1623,FadedOnline,1650514145,1,"I try to approach people in real life but let's just say I need to go back to the drawing board on this method so therefore dating apps is another option. It's really frustrating because how does anyone approach anyone else anymore without looking like a creep. I know some people have an easier time than others and I never say anything crude or s*xual. I always say I think they look great and if I could treat them to a drink or something. And I've never had anyone run away or freak out but the result is always the same a polite decline. Maybe I am just ugly haha but at least I am fit and don't smell bad. I know this is a me thing and no one else's fault but just wanted to vent a little bit since I absolutely despise dating apps and refuse to pay for premiums or an upgraded account so I keep trying the more traditional way despite the lack of luck. One thing I tell myself is although some days I feel like a loser, a real loser is someone who won't even try so thats what motivates me to keep trying. I have and still use dating apps but I don't want to rely on these to find meaningful connections. Anyway I've rambled long enough. If you've read this far I appreciate you taking the time and open to any suggestions or advice.

second case: i'm in a close friend group of 5-7 people, where i'm typically the one that gets left out of things. everyone in the group does care for me, it's just that i get so lost in conversations that i don't even know what they're talking about. i love them all, but i feel so oddly distant as i have nothing to say often. sometimes, i think they're even annoyed by me.

third case: my closest friend is in this group. i've known her since 1st grade, and we only started talking again recently. she texts me often and i feel comfy with her; she doesn't get super touchy and is super chill and lets me feel chill. however, it feels like she would pick other people over me, as she is talking about her other friends often.

God forbid you decide to isolate yourself because you’re tired of putting on this fake face and personality, you’ll realize the people you thought liked you actually just wanted to use you as their “distraction” or “entertainment”. 

Even if you’ve known them for longer, they’ll choose people they’ve met after you and they’ll only go for you when they’ve run out of options. 

They don’t text/call to check on you, they text to check if you can entertain them.

I have no friends.

I don’t get along with with my biological family.

I’ve suffered depression since I was a child, (37f). 

I’ve been betrayed by too many people to ever trust in the ways I use to, I cannot handle another loss or allow myself to be that vulnerable.

Leaving my home makes me anxious. 

I don’t look forward to anything. 

I no longer feel happiness or excitement.

My self esteem is lower than it’s ever been, my self confidence is non existent.

I know I’m a decent looking woman but I’m convinced depression, and crying all the time has changed my appearance, I look permanently sad and droopy. I can’t stand to look at myself in the mirror anymore I just burst into tears.

To live is to suffer, and without finding something worth suffering for, without joy, there is no balance and therefore life is not worth living. 

I use to take pride in being my authentic self, loving, caring, kind etc. only to find out those qualities paired with being naive is what’s prevented me from seeing the evil in others, or realize when I was being taken advantage of.

Therapy is not helping, as I don’t have the mental fortitude or alacrity to start over and build a new life.

1641,Miahrod831,1650508794,1,"Before I got into the shower I almost started crying looking into the mirror trying to smile, and so to avoid breaking down I decided to just get in the shower and relax. But I ended up breaking down anyways. I was trying to remember times in my life when I'd been happy but I just couldn't for the life of me remember anything, and when I did finally remember something and also remember that soon after Whatever it was that I was happy about was taken away from me. Whether it be my best friend no longer talking to me, my great grandfather dying from cancer after recovering and then my mom being diagnosed in the same week, or my whole prom incident thing. It just seems like when I'm happy it's only temporary and more often than not I end up sadder than I was before. I've always tried to make friends to sort of ease the pain and have someone I can lean on when I'm in need and be the same for someone else if need be, but one way or another everyone just ends up leaving me behind like they never cared about me in the first place, and no matter what I do to keep them around they just don't say. 

I mean it had been 3yrs since I last talked to a group of friends I've met and thought they finally accepted me, only to find out that most of them were still keeping in touch with one another and hanging out while I was struggling to talk to them and get them to talk to me. One of them even has a kid now and I only found out because I forced myself one last time to try and reach out to them. Now we are supposed to meet this Monday but I feel as though it's all just an act to make themselves feel better for not even trying to talk to me since highschool, and I don't even care because it's been so long since I've hung out with anyone who I thought of as a friend or even had a friend at all.

Then all these thoughts just started flooding into my head, while I was trying to remember my life and remember the things that used to make me happy, but I just can't remember anything everything is just a huge blur. Then I realized that the only thing I had left that makes me feel less alone is my family, but then for a split second I went to the one place in my mind that I hadn't even realized I'd been avoiding. My family has always meant so much to me as they are the only constant in my life, the only thing that I know is here when I inevitably get shot down or left behind by the people I meet in my social life. The only problem is that they expect so much from me, everyone expects so much from me. They are always saying how smart I am and how I destined for great things, and I've been so focused on trying to make them happy and live up to their expectations that I've been driving myself crazy. Because it seems that no matter how hard I try I always seem to fail.

That's when I really lost it, what if I'm not able to live up to their expectations, what if I end up disappointing them, what if I let them down and don't become the person I'm supposed to. And then they leave me too. And then I'm truly alone with no one left in the world to love me. I already don't have anyone who I think considers me a friend, no girl out there wants to be with me, and if I'm not able to figure something out and find out what to do with my future it's only a matter of time til my family starts to shun me and become distant as well.

I don't want to be alone, I'm so full of love and I just want someone to be able to share it with. I try my best to be nice and I do what I can to stay positive, but I don't know how to move forward anymore. I know my life isn't that difficult and I know there are people out there going through much worse than what I've been through. All I want is something to be happy about, something I can remember, but right now it just seems like that's not possible and what I'm destined for isn't a life of happiness but something full of loneliness",lonely,I just broke down in the shower,2022-04-21 12:39:54

1646,BlackPillSurrender,1650507192,1,"This isn't like a brag or anything like that. I'm truly curious if there are others that feel similarly because honestly, it is so sad and pathetic. There's no reason I should be lonely. I'm all in my head. I wonder if this is how famous comedians feel sometimes like Robin Williams. Surrounded by so many, but at the same time, so alone. I don't have any problem with myself except for myself. I'm decently attractive, smart, and quite funny. I've always been a class clown. I've always been the person that everyone knows my name, but I don't know who they are. People are really kind to me and want to hang around me. Maybe I should mention, this post is me mainly feeling lonely about women, and it is beginning to catch up to me. I have the biggest ghosting problem known to mankind I think. People wanting to hang out with me on weekends, people wanting classes with me in school, people inviting me to parties. I've rejected every single last one of them. Because why the fuck. Girls have always said nice things about or to me, ""John is actually really smart,"" ""What are you doing this weekend, John,"" ""John, I want you to come to my pool party."" I've never had a girl friend, a kiss, or had sex. This girl was talking about how her boyfriend didn't treat her right, and I asked if she wanted to talk about it. She gave me her snap and wanted to talk about it later. She messaged me this fuckin essay about it and I typed ""that sucks."" Never messaged anything more and it became awkward between us after that. Another girl, asked me to come to her house, and I didn't tell her no or give an excuse, I just straight up ignored it and started talking about something different. Awkward ever since. Multiple girls made moves with me and I shut them down. I really don't know why. These are girls that, I myself, had crushes on. Some of which I would never have thought would be in my league. Girls have broken up with their boyfriends and then expect that I will get with them, but that's not the case. I flirt all the time I just don't follow up I guess. Girls in my work place have slapped my ass repeatedly and flirted with me, and groups of girls have walked past me and started giggling and then one will come up and ask if I'm single. I enjoy attention and will play along, but I'm just...don't know. There was this one girl at my job that liked me and showed it, and I left the job. She messaged me one day and I left her unopened, and then I saw her months later at college and we made eye contact and I just kept walking. It's definitely awkward. I asked a girl out for the first time recently, and she said yes, but I didn't show up to our class on the last day and she asked why I didn't and I just said I was busy. Then that eventually led to awkwardness and ended up never meeting up. I feel as though I have a very unique problem. It’s not like socially awkward or ugly or unfunny or dumb. I just avoid being a boyfriend when in reality my heart is in literally so much pain because all I want is to love someone like that and be loved. I’m 20 and feel my problem is all in my head.

2. We meet up once and then the communication slows down to almost a stop. They suddenly claim they're "" busy"" or "" busy with work "" or something like that when they were somehow just able to text all day just days before even though their schedule hasn't changed any. 
3. They come up with some excuse as to why they don't want to talk anymore. 

This is so frustrating. I recently came across this guy on a dating app and it was gong okay. I wasn't really too into him but I talked to him anyways. We had made "" plans"" to meet up, although I had a fejjf the whole time it wouldn't happen and then last night he succeeds we facetime. We did and it went okay I guess.

1659,entrylevelheaux,1650501527,1,"Even though I hate being alone and wish I had people to talk to about anything, I realized that the reason why I'm alone is because I'm just way too different for other people. 

For example, whenever I watch a show or a movie I have the urge to discuss it with someone and of course I go to Reddit because reddit usually has movie or TV show discussion threads. For some reason, my comments in those discussion threads are often downvoted. That made me realize ""what is the point?"" 

I think the only person that can ever be my friend is myself because no one is ever going to think the way that I do. So I guess whenever I want to discuss movies or tv shows, I'll just discuss them with myself. 

And it's not that I need upvotes, but it doesn't feel good to constantly try to have discussions with people about stuff that you enjoy just to get constantly downvoted for everything you say which means people do not like the things that I say.

Discussion threads are nice because they bring up points and things I wouldn't have thought about on my own (the point of discussing things with others rather than yourself only) but I don't even want to look at them anymore because I will feel the urge to want to participate in the discussion and I already know I'm not wanted.",lonely,Talking to other people is wholly pointless,2022-04-21 10:38:47

1662,sir_com,1650499327,1,"I go to a medium-sized private university in a large city. My first semester was absolute hell as I came to terms with the fact that I was suffering from severe depression and anxiety, which was only worsened by home sickness. Why? Because I’m fat/overweight/obese and ugly. So there goes any confidence or self-esteem I had, and began to convince myself no one even wanted to talk or befriend me.

I would isolate myself from others in classes, clubs, the dining hall, etc. because I truly believed myself to be a boring, annoying, callous person, and I kept thinking, “there are so many people at this school. Surely they don’t want to be hanging out with me when there are so many better people than myself.” So I pushed people away. I was “saving” them from myself. Of course, I only thought it was a temporary thing: once I lost the weight, once I was good at telling jokes, once I was good at playing the guitar, then and only then would people want to be my friend.

I went to therapy, and it helped for a while. I started questioning my belief system and I started to focus on reality, not what I thought was happening in my mind. And it was good for a while, until the people I knew suddenly started texting less and not reciprocating my invitations. Then I started blaming myself again, and here 7 months later I’m back where I started.

I got used to the loneliness. To the walking around and seeing groups of friends eating and laughing together, to people hugging and expressing their excitement for each other. I just want someone to be excited about seeing me, I guess. But that’s not going to happen, at least not for a long time. 

So I’m lonely. It’s just how it is. I talk to myself, laugh with myself, eat alone, study alone, celebrate my birthday alone. Secretly I’m dying inside everyday, trying to be better everyday. But no one sees it, no one knows it. It’s solitude in its most cruel form. I long for the future, but only the present can bring change. It feels like a cruel joke.

1675,onetimeuseaccount__,1650494266,1,"I am from the middle east, and since I was very young I always wanted to travel and study abroad. We didn’t have enough money to afford that. I worked my ass off at school to get a scholarship, finished with 99% applied for so many universities so many times, I was rejected every time for many reasons, language, having good grades not enough, you have to do this and that and some bullshit tests. I got into university there, kept applying and I kept getting rejected. When I was got 20 I started working beside school, volunteering for a humanitarian organization and did SAT and TOEFL to increase my chances. I finally got accepted from a very very good school in Canada. I felt like I own the world. I got here and I was so excited, the school is hard but it’s okay, I got hit by the responsibilities of groceries, cooking, cleaning, studying when I have no one besides me. It’s also hard because all of my classes are online and I couldn’t make any friends. 
For the finals in the first semester, I worked so hard because I have to keep a GPA of 3 for the scholarship, didn’t leave the house and I was so tired. Couldn’t wait for the break so I can chill a little bit and see the Christmas in a new country. However, I had a boyfriend back home who cheated on me because he’s an asshole, they started a curfew and they closed everything. Spent the break at home alone. And then I started the next semester with a shitty mental health, depressed and bored. Could not study as much as I have to, still trying to heal the insecurity I got from my ex. It started to get better, started studying but I am so tired of everything I just want to sit and not do anything. I booked a flight home in the summer and I am excited about it, started to study more. I have done two finals so far, they were extremely hard, I will probably fail both, but the f school is keeping its f high standards. I will fail the one I did yesterday, and because of that I will have to take it in the summer in May and I can’t study anymore. I will have to change my plane also but the tickets are way too expensive so I will probably stay here and not go home. I have no one to talk to, I talk to my family, and they’re just telling me that I am not doing anything and my only job is to study, and that I am not doing enough. Oh and also,my scholarship funding might stop if my GPA got below 3 which probably will happen because I failed a course.",lonely,I am so tired of everything,2022-04-21 08:37:46
1676,PFFlikeyouneedtoknow,1650493773,1,"Hey, how ya doing? Better i then yesterday, i hope. Is this a good place to talk about my story? Well it better be, because I'm going to do it anyway! P

I've never been diagnosed with depression before because my parents never cared enough for my mental health to get me checked. I've only ever had therapy once before and it was only when i told the both of them that i hate them.

I only said that to set the scenario. I always denied the idea that i was depressed because who wants to be depressed, right? But i was definitely fucked up in the head. I never got into things like self harm or drugs fortunately, but what i did do was isolate myself to a point where I'd go to school, be annoyed by everything, then go home and sleep. Hygiene was pretty bad i wont lie to ya.

I still remember when it started. My dad was having an affair with multiple women and it really hit me when they would be arguing all day every day. Luckily my dad never hit my mom but he did treat her like shit. And she projected all that negativity on to me whenever she'd take me on car rides to school.

To give you an example of what the ride was like :"" People are snakes. They don't really care about you and take advantage of you because they think that you're gullible and naive. Don't be fooled by foolish people. Everyone who acts like they're your friend has an ulterior motive. People are evil"" trust nobody, etc etc. Basically, every car ride I'd constantly be reminded that nobody truly cares about me.

The pressure of the threat of my parents splitting and those negative subliminal messages really hit me man. I was depressed for 2 years and told nobody about it because i believed the words my mom told me. I pushed away alot of good people man. I'm doing what I can to mend those relationships now and I'm trying to help my current friends who are depressed.

One day i was set on killing myself, but someho god sent a smile my way or some shit and my crush at the time called me. I picked up the phone trying to act slick and confident but i know she could tell i was doing shitty. She really saved my life dude. That's crazy to think about sometimes. She's also going through a rough time now so I'll do my best to be there for her aswell because i really care about her ( she isn't my crush anymore, just a good friend now) 

How i got over it?  I don't even know to be honest with you. My feelings kinda morphed from depression into hate. I hate the way the world is. I hate that people suck. I hate my parents and the way they nade me feel. That hate is probably what drove me to taking action. I'm really petty and competitive, so i like the idea of murdering any motherfucker that stands in my way, and making my enemies suffer or proving them wrong. For like a year ( whole of last year) I've just been working on self improvement. Working out, learning to fight,  meditation. I wanted to feel powerful, and now i do. Nothing can stop me as I am right now. I'm in grade 12 btw:)

So after that year of development, my feelings turned from ""i hate everything"" into ""man I'm really awesome"" I've got so much love for myself it's kinda scary sometimes. I still hate my parents though! Fuck those motherfuckers I'm gonna find a way to sustain myself and cut then off of my life.

But yeah man i feel really good. Everything seems so clear to me now. I don't cry anymore, and not because I'm holding it in or anything, i just feel like all i gotta do when life puts pressure on me is beat the shit out of life. I love me dude. I'll do my best to help my friends feel the same way about themselves, so wish me luck. Nobody deserves to be depressed.

I don't even know if my story made sense 💀 I'm gonna copy and paste it into different communities because why not. This is really just a brain dump and i want to put it in everyone's face, whether they'll like it or not.

Find yourself man, fuck life. Life's a bitch. Would you really let a bitch get you down though? I know its tough but keep ya head up king/queen. I feel like i can say i love you guys. I don't know why I'm usually very careful with who i say those words to. But we're all trying to get through our shitty feelings, right? I feel like i can kinda bond with all of you over those shitty feelings. So yeah, i love you guys xx",lonely,Can i talk about how i overcame my depression here?,2022-04-21 08:29:33

I'm battling through the worst depression of my life but given that I use humor to cope I still think I make pretty darn good company, assuming of course our senses of humor vibe. I'll throw some info about myself below; feel free to respond in the comments or DM as you like. If you read this but don't I still wish you all the best in your quest to defeat loneliness.  


**General/Dudes**

I'm 43, and I game on Xbox fairly regularly so that could surely be a shared activity. Have a good-sized library of games with some range, and was able to score a Series X last month. Other hobbies include cooking, fishing, gardening, getting back into shape (yoga/stretching, walking, weights, etc.), dieting and breaking said diet to try new restaurants...I have a deep love for sushi and tapas in particular. Additional possible points of conversation:

* Mostly politically liberal, though I have *some* conservative leanings around family ideology. Honestly I think the American system is effed in the A, I greatly admire the Nordic countries but don't dare invoke the ""S"" word.
* Parenting - Two kids, 20(f) and 15(s). Daughter lives away from me but regularly visits, son is week on, week off with mom. Being a dad is what I believe I did best with my life and one of the few things I will ""brag"" about myself on.
* NBA - Huge Celtics fan, don't follow the broader sport as closely as I used to but still know a decent amount. Son plays hoops so it's kind of our thing hehe.
* Relationships - Hindsight is always 20/20 but I've learned everything possible from my mistakes and enjoy hearing the opinions/perspectives of others as well. Have also been told I missed my calling (as a counselor) so if you're in a bummer relationship I'd be happy to provide an ear and outside perspective.  


**Ladies**

I don't envy y'all, as much as it sucks to be a lonely guy online (I'm forever running into lame bots/scammers across a multitude of sites; it's like I'm lonely and depressed, not a fuggin' idiot haha) I could easily see the opinion you have it worse. Unsolicited advances (or even worse pics), your own scammers/bots and I'd argue imagery shredding your self-image is far more pervasive and impactful.

I'm not here looking for a date or relationship. I would not be OPPOSED, mind you, doubt many of us on this sub would be. I'd simply NEVER be the one to **initiate** flirting, *let alone* *anything* *else*. We're all just lonely humans seeking some sort of solace and possibly connections. I've always got on very well with women in a friendly sense and often times that's enough.

About 6 years ago, I started eating really healthy , taking vitamin supplements and excercising.  The improvement to my general outlook was  pretty dramatic within a short period of time.  I live alone, my kid is on the other side of the country and we chat monthly.  Retired during the seige of 2020 and just kept a low profile.  I have casual friends that do stuff I do for entertainment, but it's not like they are real friends, just first name basis people.  In my earlier years, I was always surrounded by people and got pretty used to having to find time alone... now I have nothing but time alone.  I try to use that time now for my interests and hobbies, researching stuff out of curiosity, involved in as many unsafe sports as I can manage and generally try to find ways to satisfy my intellectual curiosity.  I've been poking around starting to write a story that's been percolating around for a very long  time.  All  in all, I value my time and peace and quiet, but it would be nice to have people to chat with that are somewhere within the same wavelength.  I don't even think I'm interested in a relationship... I mean, I'm told I snore and that shit drives me crazy, so if I do, I prefer to not have to hear about it.

1771,thomasthehipposlayer,1650434985,1,"We live in an age of incredible technology. It’s easier to connect than ever, and yet people are measurably and scientifically, lonelier now than we were 30 years ago. Men report only having half as many friends on average now. Even the amount of sex people have has fallen. People feel disconnected. Younger generations struggle with social anxiety and real life interactions.

Unfortunately, technologies that make it easier to connect also make it easier not to. We have endless entertainment at our fingertips. We have a constant stream of infinite stimulation. We can drown our boredom without having to so much as get out of bed. But maybe, just maybe, we needed that boredom. Boredom was nature’s way of getting us to go out, meet people, make connections, do stuff. Now we often use our easy communication power to conceal on the few plans we do have. Being a recluse is now easier than ever.

And the constant stimulation has left us restless - we’re overstimulated. It’s harder to find the energy or drive to do things. Instead we watch other people do exciting things on a screen while we ourselves do nothing. We let others do our living for us.

We talk more than ever on social media, but we don’t form interpersonal connections. People are much harsher online, and it can harm peoples confidence to be exposed to constant negativity. Our quantity of communication has skyrocketed, but our connections with each other have plummeted.

I don’t know what the solution is. I love modern technology, and it has a lot of wonderful, good, and useful applications. I just wish we could change it to connect us meaningfully instead of constant-surface-level interactions with no deeper connection. The way we use the technology is just human nature, and we can’t change that, but maybe the technology itself can change in a way that encourages us to connect. I hope so.

Anyway, that’s just my two cents.",lonely,Technology that should connect us is making us lonely.,2022-04-20 16:09:45

To see what it's like to be truly celebrated for the big, and small accomplishments. To have someone you could turn to with every little thing, every feeling, every rant, every good and bad thing. Who you could just live life with. We were able to do that for the little bit we were together. But then, things came to an end. It felt so abrupt. Without warning. He was taken from me just like that. 

In us parting, he said some pretty hurtful things. While I on the other hand, tried to do everything in the kindest way possible. I made many mistakes. But we all do. We're human. We aren't perfect. But the longing for someone to love me, want me, cherish me like he did. Or like others in the past who turned extremely toxic. I want something. Someone. Who will last. And will give life that meaning I've been searching for for years and years. Is it too much to ask for? I feel like my expectations for someone are too high.

im 22 years old. i've had a few ""best"" friends in my life. had one from 3rd to 8th grade. we did everything together. she was the light of my life, but she replaced me with someone else. i watched it happen in real time. i remember she had an end of school pool party at the end of 8th grade, and she invited all of her new friends over as well as myself. i remember her and her new friends all laughing on one side of the pool playing chicken fights or whatever and i was stuck on the opposite side of the pool hanging with her sister. i would try to speak but i was just ignored. like i wasn't even there. i called my father crying and asked him to come pick me up. he came and i broke down crying. that was when i knew i lost my best friend. she didn't even see me leave or text me afterwards. she went to a different hs and i never saw her nor heard from her again. 

after that - i found a new group of friends. these friends were more ""nerdy"" like me, and i really enjoyed being around them. i didn't hate the fact i wasn't popular, because i had this cool group of friends that all shared similar interests. this group lasted through all of hs, and then we graduated, and suddenly no one talked to me. the friend group still hangs out with everyone else, but not me. i never was invited to hang out again. i tried to send texts and in general be friendly, but they went ignored. it crushed me. the only person i still talk to is one girl, whom i love dearly but we rarely talk and we always say we'll meet up and we never do. we talk maybe every 5 months. but its clear we are not as close as we once were.

since then, ive had a few friends that i call close friends, but they don't consider me to be their best friend. i know this because they never reach out to me. its like i only exist once a month and i get sent a meme every once in awhile (which i don't mind, but whenever i try to have a conversation they suddenly stop responding).

college, same thing. found a friend group, met my bf, and now only my bf talks to me. i was never the person to hang out with their bf over their friends (in fact, im the opposite, probably because im so desperate for friends and connections). 

i started working and met some coworkers and grew close with them; then i moved in with them and now they pretend im not even here. i tried to hang out with them but, alas, my advances were shut down. now i stay in my room and try not to bother them. 

switched jobs. met new people. im trying to be their friend. it has been 6 months and i thought i was getting somewhere and was genuinely excited. but i guess im just...not a fun person to be around, because they are very...nice to me but don't try to put any effort in being around me, if that makes sense. they don't invite me to things. its like im putting in effort and not getting any in return.

now im sitting at my computer crying because i have no one to talk to. my boyfriend is asleep and i can't keep relying on him to support me. i feel like this every night.

i just dont understand. i always go above and beyond with my friends. i always cover them when theyre low on cash. i give them rides. i listen to their vents and make sure they are safe. i always answer right away. i give them nice things. and im not saying they owe me anything, im more than happy to be that person (i am a people pleaser and always will be). i just don't understand why i can't keep a friend. i know its me, obviously. there's something im doing wrong. maybe i just come across as tooo desperate but i really do love to be nice to people. i value my friends more than anything. 

i think i should just accept that im not best friend material. ill always know people, and people know they can rely on me, but that's it. nothing more. 

its affecting my mental health so much. getting to a pretty rough point that im sure will come to a head.

I met a guy and we were really good friends but never really dated and I never really called him my boyfriend. I got pregnant and we got married.  He became physically abusive and beat me often. He also became addicted to drugs. When my son was 5 I left him.  Again never really coukd say I was in love with him. That was 13 years ago and I've been alone ever since. Never dated, no sex,  nothing.  I did everything you're supposed to do. what they tell you to do. I focused on myself, on my career, on my education and degrees.  All the while I hoped and prayed I would meet someone eventually. Then lastbyear everythingchanged. My freind of 3 years had separated from his wife. Ater 3 months I finally asked him why. He said it was because he was in love with me. I never wanted to admit it to myself but in that moment it all came flooding over me. All the memories and conversations over the years and it was so obvious that we were in love.  I should mention that he is he is from the UK. That is where his wife went back to but he stayed here in the US. Even though it became obvious to me that I was totally in love with him too and probably always had been... It didn't do anything for another 3 months. After all he was still technically married and I wanted to make sure he was really seriois about a relationship with me. After 6 months of her living over there he said they were getting divorced. I let myself believe that it was finally happening for me. I never felt a love like this for anyone.  Every minute with him I felt amazing. We talked of our future and I was never so happy. After 9 months of  Feeling the best I've ever felt in my life, dreaming of a wedding and living the rest of my life with its amazing man..he told me he couldn't go through with the divorce and that he was moving back to the uk. 

It's been 6 months and it's still very painful. I'm so lonely and I feel like I'm trying to accept that this is how I'll have to live the rest of my life.  At the same time my son is turning 18 and he will be going off to college. I went from thinking my whole life was coming together and I was going to be married to now having an empty house and understanding that I'll probably be alone forever. I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I ended up losing my job and Going on various  anti-depressants. Nothing helps. I'm so lonely and I think about killing myself everyday. I just dont understand why it's happened for everyone else but not me. All my friends are married and happily married. If feel like the odd person out and no one really understands the pain that I feel. Sure I keep myself busy all day but at night when the sun goes down and everyone's on their couch with their significant other watching a program or whatever I'm just here alone. I will go to bed alone and I will wake up alone. I'll eat breakfast alone dinner alone and go on vacation alone. I just don't know how I can keep on. This excruciating pain I'm feeling and fear of going another 40 years like this is too much I dont know what to do.  All the remedies say to lean on your friends and make plans with people but what do you do when everyone's busy with their family. I'm just so lonely.",lonely,Not sure how much longer I can keep hanging on,2022-04-20 11:38:18

1834,tetrismaster16,1650415984,1,"Hey everyone, this is my first post. Last year I got accepted to university, and this past fall was my first semester. I was originally excited at first to meet new people and experience university life(I have three friends from home that go to uni), but it devolved. I rarely saw my three friends at university except for one, but once he got a girlfriend he stopped hanging out with me. I decided last semester to join three clubs, however it genuinely felt like no matter how social I was, there was nobody I could match a wavelength with, so I stopped going to clubs. However, one of my friends from home that attends the same university as myself, I fell in love with her(I'm 21 M). However, right when I was going to confess after the club our conversation got cut short, and now she has a boyfriend. We're still good friends even after all these years, but she got a boyfriend in December so I can't tell her how I feel. In addition, I had formed a crush on my RA and asked her out beginning of March, and she rejected me as she just wanted to focus on school and stay as friends. I understood, but it just pivoted my depression further. I know everyone says to love myself and work myself, but that's something I'm always doing so I feel that advice is meaningless. The only things keeping me sane at university is homework, sketching, watching anime, and playing video games. I don't have a car so I can't drive anywhere which sucks since campus is legit in the middle of nowhere. In any case, going to the gym and exercising regularly temporarily helps, but it just sucks I've been here for a year not being able to find friends, romance, or any happiness. At this point I've learned to stop ranting to my friends back at home since I know they don't wanna hear it, so all I've been doing is putting on headphones and playing music as my escape when I go out of my apartment. Sorry if I didn't elaborate as much or explain some things in more detail, it just feels horrible.

Start planning to ask her out and then... She stops replying. How fucking delusional I was again for thinking she would decide to give her attention to me when there so many better people in her dms. I am not even ugly but I I have come to understand that my personality is probably a turn off to all women. I already knew this were gonna turn out this way as soon as I downloaded tinder again. But there is always that sliver of hope that a miracle will happen and I will meet someone.

But like does it ever feel like any accomplment or anything you do in life just feels worthless and meaningless without someone in your life.

Could be a friend or a girlfriend or boyfriend 

Like I have my family so I’m a bit better off than other people 

But like I could accomplish anything and everything I would want but none of it feels worth it without someone to love.


I have dreams and such and have fantasy’s of getting married one day.


One thing I’ve always wanted to do is cuddle with my hypothetical girlfriend while watching a movie and whisper random trivia.


I never got to do that with my ex.


I feel like I’ll never find someone else again 

I’m too weak emotionally,I’m ugly


Sometimes life doesn’t feel real. I feel like I’m in third person.

It drives me fucking insane like I have moments where I just wanna spontaneously do shit like I wanna scream at the top of my lungs and laugh like a mad man.

I’m so desperate for love and companionship 

Not just for kisses or cuddles or even sex but just to love and share with someone

Like I’m not asexual or anything nor am I really ashamed of being a virgin either. (Or honestly really care)

So don’t take this the wrong way but I’m not the kind of guy who would stick his dick in anything that moves.

That isn’t me trying to shame anyone but it’s the best way for me to describe how I feel  

I’ve always been more interested in love and companionship Vs sex. If I ever get lucky to ever have sex I want it to be with someone that I trust and they trust me, we both love each other and care for eachother.  

Not that I don’t like attractive people y’all are beautiful but I’m more of a personality kinda guy.


I don’t make enough money to pay anyone to at least pretend either

Even if I did I just wouldn’t feel right.

It wouldn’t be real.


I get envious of people I see them and I’m just like why can’t I be them power to them but I want that love and companionship to.

I’d dedicate my life to someone if I had to.

I just feel pathetic and alone and I wish I had something to take my mind off of it all.

I got members of my family who drink, who smoke weed.

I’m a lil envious cause I kinda wish I had that but I kinda don’t want to be dependent on it.

I don’t like the taste of drink,

I never tried weed before nor really has it never been mysterious to me cause it wasn’t hidden or demonized in my house

Also like I’m too embarrassed to ask for help.

Like I really do think I need to talk to a professional I’m just to embarrassed to ask or talk to my parents about it

I know they’d listen without judgment and help anyway they can but I can’t get past myself to ask for help.

Sometimes I think my spirit animal is a squonk.

It’s this creature from Pennsylvania that is always upset and or crying about itself cause it’s lonely and ugly and just wants to disappear. It seems to be stuck in its head all the time 


Sleep is my only relief but it’s a curse also cause I always feel tired I apparently always look tired or sad and if I have a dream where I meet new people I wake up feeling just like the rug was pulled from under me

Hope you're doing well.

  
I'm writing this post just to vent I guess or try to talk to someone or something. I just feel like I'm super left behind in life (I guess this is where a lot of you start to roll their eyes). I'm currently going to uni and have a few months left on my placement year. Now hear me out, I know I just said I go to uni, and I am doing a placement year at a company. But, my social life is pretty much none existent. I know no one in my uni and yes, I finished my second year lmao. My life outside uni is super dry, and I'm not really that close to my family either. I'm still in my early 20s, and after I finish this placement year I'm off to my final year (in a studio apartment). And, honestly, after work or uni stuff I have no one to go back to/ talk to. If I wanted to go out, who am I suppose to go out with lmao xD. When I hear about people's experiences in uni and school in general, I'm just unable to relate. Just goes to show how rubbish my experience in school/uni is with one year left (where everyone probably already have their social circles, with their lavish lifestyle). It just puts my down in the dumps. Recently, I kinda started a self-improvement phase I guess and wanted to do sports (ง︡'-'︠)ง I'll be starting in next month or so (left details out for personal reasons. Lame I know. lmao) as well reading books that help (self-improvement ish books). These are some things that I am going to incorporate in my life. But, honestly. I feel like I'm trying wayy too hard to find friends, and sometimes I feel like I'm dabbling in these things to try to escape. But, for some people they have a lot of friends and experience in life, and it's not something they really worked hard for or something it was just natural. It's not like a holy grail wish or something you battled out of an IRL squid game to get. I just don't want to spend my time watching Netflix/ some show or playing some game all the time (I usually hate shows with school tag in it now. Not all, but pretty much most.). 

  
 I usually have an uplifting spirit and like to meet people, and whenever I do I never really stay connected or hang out with. And it's like damn broo, this is really killing me. I think it's just that everyone has people they already go with, and I'm like ᕙ(\^▿\^-ᕙ) I'm over here too feeling left out. No One wants that, and at the same time, I have no one to go with. It just turns into a pit of loneliness, and unwontedness, like bruh. I have free time right now, and I'm just spending it writing this down...

  
It like everyone my age has already experienced a lot in life and now the work life is going to take over and I'm just thinking. Did I miss out on my social life. Like this is just too trash and sad to think about I just don't know how to go over it. Any Advice??",lonely,Yoo,2022-04-20 04:28:28

1901,GoobytheNooby,1650386255,1,"I've recently been struggling more than usual when it comes to dating and it has made me do some personal reflection on the fact that I've never had a longstanding girlfriend before. As I'm getting older (currently 25), my mind has begun to wonder into dark territory as I watch so many friends and family members get married and even begin to have children. I've begun to look at myself in the mirror and realize that I am looking more beat down and unhealthy, which is only exacerbating my fears. I work alone often, or with several other men (I'm a PhD student studying metal solidification science), so my likelihood of meeting people, let alone romantic partners, is limited on that front. Furthermore, my favorite past times are videogames, anime, and movies, meaning many of the friends I interact with the most live far away from me. I can literally go days without seeing another person in with little change to my daily schedule. If I hadn't made the effort to come into the office rather than work from home every day, this potential could become a reality.

This has left the dating front entirely to dating apps, which I've only had some luck on. Nothing permanent has ever come from it either. I feel so detached from people that I recently realized that despite my single status, I haven't had a crush on anyone near me in around 3 years. Though this doesn't really mean anything, it just accentuates my feelings of disconnect from others and my fears of being alone most of my life.

I know the solution would be to try and begin something new, enter a new club, and/or begin going to the gym, but I've always been an indecisive person who struggles with build habits; not to mention that many of the clubs I'd be interested (primarily videogame ones) in joining are unfortunately predominantly male. I'd love to try and do something like an intermural sport, but I can't do many cardio based sports as I often get violently ill afterwards.

I know this has come off as very ""neck-beard"" like, but that's not how I feel. I really just feel that I've reached a stop-gap when it comes to building connections with people, both socially and romantically, and I'm struggling with how I can get out of this rut. I'm feeling lonely more often than not. The social groups around encompass either people much younger than me or much older, which has made me nervous about joining as I want to meet people my age. Furthermore, I'm very much a creature of habit and changing my routines is often rare and temporary (another reason I haven't been able to keep up a healthy gym routine).

So I guess the point of the self-pitying ramble is that I need advice. How can I get out of this social rut? What can I do to put myself out there? How can I keep it up? What can I do to get rid of this omnipresent feeling of loneliness? Basically, I need help...",lonely,I've never had a long standing romantic relationship and I'm getting scared that I never will.

1907,Pancakesapriori,1650383612,1,"I've learned to never mention being lonely to friends or family, because all I ever get is a toxic and/or canned responses.

One such response is, ""keep your head up, everyone is worthy of love."" No, no they aren't. Everyone has made it clear that ""everyone is worthy of love"" is false. My point is not some kind of humanitarian one, though. Of course everyone deserves love, but like other humanitarian concepts, it just doesn't turn out that way. Slavery, sexual assault, and genocide are wrong, and no one should have to experience them, but they still happen. Freedom (whatever that means) should be available to all human beings, but it just isn't. It's how the world has shaken out. 

There is also a family of responses that aim to place all of the blame on a lonely person for their being lonely:
""If you had a better attitude...""
""If you dressed better...""
""If you talked to people more often...""
""If you didn't smoke...""
""If you lowered your standards...""
""If you weren't so negative...""

The people who say these things either don't understand, or are making a mistake. First of all, it's likely that people who have a diminished attitude, diminished fashion, diminished social engagement, etc, haven't diminished in these areas and *then* become lonely as a result. Rather, they were lonely all along, tried all these things, found out that even *with* these things that they are not seen as worthy. Then, these things diminish....caused *by* that loneliness-- not vice versa. Then, these toxic people use their mistaken understanding of the time order of these things to place the blame onto the lonely person which results in a vicious cycle of unworthiness and invisibility. They run their mouths to each other about how it's always the fault of the lonely person, which makes more and more people understand it this way, and guess what,  lonely folks are that much more unattractive from the get go. 

Another: when super attractive people who have little trouble with loneliness (comparatively) say, ""everyone is lonely [at some point/ much of the time]. Yeah, I really love it when desirable and lovable people put in a two cents like this. Fuck you, you have no idea. Spoken from a position of being consistently wanted, you do not have the same access to the same experiences. It effectively trivializes the experiences of a lonely person, and it's toxic. Period. This makes me think that sharing anything about loneliness is simply an over share. Why? Because they don't understand, can't understand, simply have this canned response, and now they think *I'm the one* who doesn't understand. So, mentioning it effectively makes it worse. 

Lastly, I recently deleted my dating apps and made the mistake of mentioning it. Granted, I expressed it in a stupid way. I said,  ""I never get anything out of them except disappointment."" So, they immediately mentioned that ""love isn't a transaction, bro."" 

I couldn't help but think, ""wow, do you really think I'm that stupid?"" Of course it isn't a transaction. I'm not mad that I don't ""get fucked or invited to a relationship in every match."" But, dating apps are objectively changing the way people think about intimacy and courting, so you can put in effort and just be ignored (often very suddenly--ghosting practices) even when you've done nothing wrong. For example, the last 3 times I got excited about a conversation with someone, they suddenly just stopped communicating. Now, I'm not one of those weirdos that makes stupid sexual comments right off the bat, and I'm not a douchy ass hole either. These are all conversations in which a decent vibe was present. My only theory is that it's much easier to go for the cuter (or otherwise more attractive) options in these apps without having to engage long enough to learn about a real person. It's way different in the flesh, when a real human being is next to us and engaging with us. It's not that I expect something every time, like a transaction, and the fact that this person concluded that is ridiculously toxic. 

I'm just going to stop sharing. There is no help anywhere, and the shittiest part about it is that people who aren't lonely don't have to care. It gives them a foundation for their apathy.",lonely,Nothing but toxic responses to loneliness,2022-04-20 01:53:32

1909,Key-Sheepherder-7176,1650380648,1,"So, to start off. I'm adopted by my mother's husband at the time. My mother passed when I was 8 and he's been legally my father for my whole life since then. I've been living with him my entire life with my sister who's a good 11 years older then me. She moved out because of how abusive and manipulative my father can be. He offers no support, he belittles you, he insults you, you're never good enough no matter how hard you try, he rarely says I love you, he never will give you any open support on what you want to do with your life or what makes you happy, he's always negative, and doesn't listen to criticism and or takes accountability for his actions ever. 

It's so bad that my sister moved out within 2 days, not even caring about the place she was moving into. The mental and physical abuse I've been experiencing throughout the years like being beaten and isolated from the people I love and care about has put more trauma on me then I ever realized. I take anti depressants and for the longest, I had no idea why everyone around me looked at my ""father"" weird. 

My boyfriend of 8 years told me continously that my father never acted like a father. That he was obviously just a guardian because I never had that bond or relationship with my father like everyone else usually does. I've realized that my relationship with him is near to none as I'm 19 now and I can't talk to him about anything; not even things I'm passionate and happy about. If anything I'm more terrified of my ""father"" more then anything as I tried to talk to him about moving out and all he did was complain about money, how am I going to college, how I'm brainwashed with trying to move in with my boyfriend. He makes me feel like shit, but I guess him sh*tting on my dreams and goals was the last time I gave him a chance at being a ""father."" 

He broke me. I have emotional trauma that I'm going to have to live with my entire life until I can get actual therapy. I thought this man was decent, I was too blind to see that the ""love"" my father had for me. Wasn't love, it was him using me for money. I found out my father received money all of my life for child support and for me going to school which would've been a good 1,000 a month but, I never received anything besides a small $70 after I hit 17 after I started my first job. I've told my father multiple times how I'm depressed and he's never cared, one time he even told me to kill myself; that he'd dump my body into a dumpster when i was 17. That night, I ran away to my boyfriends house for a few weeks. 

My father never approved of my sister's boyfriend even though when he lived with us, he cooked and cleaned and made sure to help as much as he could; even being a father to kids that weren't his. My father still called him ""useless,  a worthless bum"" my sister moved out shortly afterwards. ((I'm sorry for jumping around so much. It's a lot to catch up on. )))  My father would threaten me, threaten my sister, put his hands on my sister who was pregnant at the time (never apologized to her) and has never been there for either of us. Me and my sister wish my mother was still alive, she wouldn't have let these things happen. She knew what kind of monster he was, she tried to leave but, it didn't go well. In the end my mother had to die right beside a man she was trying to run away from for years. 

As of right now. I've disowned my father. He's abusive mentally and physically. He demands me to baby him, to try and suck up to him. I've always done what he wanted but I'm sick and tired of his rules and him treating me like a roommate rather then his DAUGHTER! He's never said he's proud of me! If anything he calls me delusional and brainwashed or stupid. I'm at a point in my life where I've finally woken up to see how toxic he is. As of right now, I'm trying my hardest to get my own place. But, it's hard when he never taught me things I might need so I'm depending on my sister who's 30 now for advice. 

My boyfriend has been staying with me because he got into a fight with a sibling of his he was staying with. So he's with me right now. It's a lot of other things my father has decided to do but, I'd be here all day typing it out. Anyways, I'm not listening to my ""father"" anymore. I have my own job, I'm stable on my own without speaking to him. And legally my name is on the lease so I can do what I want unless he takes me to court which he likely will never do. I'm tired of him being abusive to me and my family for more then 10 years. 

It's time I take back my happiness, my mental well being and stand up for myself for the first time ever in my life. This is a terrifying thought but, I am determined to put an end to his control and abuse even if it's the last thing I do. He won't control me anymore. 


I was wondering if anyone could give me any advice on the situation. He's threatening me due to me not listening to him about my boyfriend being over. My name is on the lease so he can't kick me out , right? I've done a ton of research on it. I just need help please. I need to get away from him. Once I do, I'm never looking back. I feel sad deep down that I could never get him to love me, but sometimes life is hell. And having a supportive and loving boyfriend, sister and friends I know things will be okay.

It's been proving quite hard to reach this post-cynical stage concept I learned a few months ago. Dividing myself into multiple minds back in 2015 seems to be hindering my growth nowadays.   
 

Everything I learned so far doesn't seem to be making a difference and my trust in the process is at an all-time low. I feel capable of watching negative thoughts from a distance but when I'm required to act, I feel extremely burdened. Perhaps I need to find a method for reaching a no-mind state.   
 

This might be some temporary, childish stream of thoughts - however - I cannot help despising the life I've built for myself so far. The dissonance result of such non-synergistic perspectives brings into question, which are the paths of least / most resistance. The lack of synergy appears in the notion that even if I understand how silly a thought may be, it doesn’t stop the physiological response that tightens the region around the neck + diaphragm, makes it hard to breathe, cold sweat and the likes. My most deep, animal interpretative framework signals danger too easily. The aftermath of these stress responses, grow an uncontrollable drive for escapism behavior towards hyper stimuli such as coffee, gaming, and many other dopaminergic related activities. The overload lefts me unbelievably tired, restless and susceptible to faulty lines of thought that leads to pits of hopelessness since I depend on a messed up social environment.   
 

Maybe I should have given those monastic impulses more credit rather than disregarding them as another disguised, escaping mechanism.   
 

Somewhere along my upbringing I learned to hate arrogant personalities. It pains so see this in myself as I navigate daily life observing people falling further and further into spirals of mindless indulgence - while at the same time - maintaining the facade that everything is under control.   
 

What seems like equilibrium now can very much cascade into chaos given enough time. Society has overdosed on psychological opiates, entered a trance of numbness and all it can do is postpone it’s coming down from artificial highs + withdrawals. I feel for every sucker out there in a non-arrogant way. Such realization gradually destroys me even though I’m only being told a very small part of the whole story.   
 

I see how rubbish is to be stuck in these trains of thought but what can I do? People around me don’t take my non-traditional substance use seriously enough to offer effective help. My brain chemistry + microphysiology adjusted itself to this dreadful point partly because those responsible for the kid let him overcharge on sugar, pain-killers, caffeine, salt.  


My capacity for engaging in complex problem-solving sometimes get hi-jacked by the needlessly negative planner side of this identity I construed to enter early-adult life.  


I've been in a dynamic battle, reading depressive-avoidant mind material for 6+ years, applying every word of advice on the book. I feel like I consumed so much biographies of every shape and form, on the internet, that I lived far longer than my actual age.

1916,badbiitch21,1650376878,1,"I met my best friend on bumble last year. We went on two dates when I realized that we were better off as friends. We would talk to each other all the time.

He only sent me a text and a snap of his meal. I would say things jokingly bring me a plate. Keep in mind I live like 9 hours away from him. He has visited me twice to hang out before he got back with his ex. We would roast each other and we always joked around with each other. The next day he sent me a snap saying that his gf was saying that I have a crush on him like what. Can you please tell her that you don’t? Why don’t you tell her? She’s your gf. I don’t even know the girl. I told him i don’t. We’re friends. I decided to ignore him because I didn’t want to deal with drama. I had a good time with my family on Easter. Yesterday he messaged me around 4 in the afternoon. I left him on seen because I was busy at work. He said are you mad at me? And again I didn’t want to be caught with my phone at work cause my manager can be a bitch. He sent me this tiny paragraph, I guess so even though idk why Ashley think you had a crush on me even though that’s not true. You even said it yourself but she didn’t believed me that’s why I texted but whatever. I told him well we are friends. Last message he sent to me was I guess not you don’t even want to talk to me.

I have been in a relationship for 18 years. I was a 16 years old boy, she was 20. We met online, we chatted every single day, we have fallen in love, and we were excited about our future together.
We met in person for the first time a year later, and another year later we moved in together, I was 18. It was very hard, I had a complicated family life, and being on my own with the person I loved was my way to happiness, I thought. But as soon as we moved in things really changed. We were young, never been on our own before. She had a hard time adjusting, she was angry and depressed because her expectations were not met, I did what I could but I was just limited to how much I could do. I think I went through a lot of emotional abuse these first years, but I was afraid if being alone.
And then she got pregnant, and my daughter is the joy of my life. I thought things could be different with a baby on the way, but they were somewhat, but she went from anger and depression to just apathy and numbness, and as the years have passed, we are just more and more growing apart.
I don’t want to hold against her the fact that she has been dealing with depression all these years, but I hold against her refusing to seek help, after years and years of me begging her. I also hold against her the years of emotional abuse and neglect. And now, after all these years, I’m overwhelmed with feelings of pain, emptiness, sadness, and loneliness.

I made my local newspaper's front page. I made it onto a bigger city's (my hometown) TV news broadcast. My towns local FB page made such a mockery of me and even completely fabricated parts bc I guess the truth alone wasn't bad enough?

I have almost 5 years off illegal drugs. I overdosed bc I received fentanyl that I believed was heroin. I got custody of my kids back years ago (they didn't make this easy and shouldn't). I didn't start using drugs to party, I had 3 kidney surgeries before opioids even entered the picture. It started off as pain scripts then progressed to heroin. I took subutex for 3 years then Sublocade for almost a year and been off that for over a year now. This was never a joke to me is what I'm getting at.

But people still make comments every once in awhile when my name comes up or I say something they don't like. People that I don't even know talk on social media about how I only got my kids back bc I cheated drug tests (I didn't and couldn't, they watch and make you pee again if it looks diluted).

I chose this topic because I personally found myself resorting to TikTok at times when I was lonely and even developed some connections with the people I interacted with on TikTok. It made me less inclined to socialise IRL with my peers which in turn I guess made me even lonelier. I am creating a study now which aims to kind of prove that this association exists as there has been so little research done on the effects of TikTok usage particularly on loneliness. I need some more participants so if you are a TikTok user and have 5 minutes to spare I would really appreciate if you could help me out by participating!

Something really awesome happened to me the other day, and I was trying to think of ANY possible friend or person I could tell this good news to, but I just ended up sitting there coming up empty. I don't know why I have become so fucking awkward that I cannot make simple friendships that I used to have. The people I used to call best friends have probably not thought of me in years.

One of my old college buddies regularly posts here from time to time and he's making me worried. I found out on accident as he uses the same username for everything online. He's convinced that no one will ever love him and that he will forever be alone. This made me reconnect with him so we could do things together. The problem is if I get tired working 9-5 and can't play games with him or meet up then he starts posting about suicide and how every friend he has ghosts him. His depression gets worse after every post. What should I do? I feel like confronting him about these private posts would be out of line.

I got a lot of “oh that's great” and “wow!!”  It feels as if no one sees me and the hard work that I do.

1939,MrFraG07,1650357030,1,"I need somewhere to let myself ventilate and i got a lot on my plate.

Over the years , i have contemplated lonelyness in all its forms. Ive never been always that lonely in my life tho, had several girlfriends , had wholesome friends.

But everything comes and goes at some point. 

In June, it will be my 26th birthday. I will spend alone. Just like the past 5 years. 

Everything was on point 5 years ago. Had a beautiful girlfriend, lots of friends , even like a little group of friends that would get with each other often. Had people asking everyday how i was , people were looking after me and i looked after them back.

Then me and my girlfriend broke up. We had several mutual friends so it was a situation of ""whose are you on"" when it didnt need to be. Of course she was a woman and i was a man , men can stand for themselves right ? 

At first it was hard , conpletely alone with my thoughts. Needs unfufilled. Letting myself go like never before , the break up didnt help either. Saying that i was the one who broke up with her. Knowing , i wouldnt have done it , not to be with her but just to have friends around who cares , people who dont just ask for favors or talk about work.

In the next 3 years i began to work on myself , training and developing hobbies. I was reconnecting with myself. 

That didnt do anything. 

Since then i moved out to another town, hoping for maybe a little change ? It got worst.

I am right cohabiting with my ""best friend"". However these days/months he deosnt really talk to me. I see him regurlarly having chills with his friends. His friends knows i exist but nobody thinks about me in the slightless. I even gone to the point of confronting him with this. The only answer i received was silence and a beautiful ""sorry we didnt think about it"" 

Since i moved here , i was actually making friends. Girl-friends. 

At some point , girls being girls , a routine dispute broke between the two girls i was friend with. I tried to intervene and it backfired. All agreeable and all i received from one of them was "" your my friend when i need to talk to you about something i need to talk about , nothing else"". Cold and straight to the face.

Family side is even worse. In the 3 years where i isolated myself to perfect myself , my family stopped all communication. I decided to wait for a call from them.

Im still waiting.

The only person that sometimes wants to talk to me is my dad. But its just to see if im doing okay money wise , if i have food and a roof over my head still.

Me and my step mom dont go along. So even if i was on the street , she got my dad by the balls , so i couldnt even help me. And dont worry , i had the discussion with him and he confirmed it.

I experience true lonelyness. I live in my room when im not on the job at a corner store , playing video games to keep the thoughts away.

Death is on my mind a lot and i hate it. Im too damn curious to see how my life is gonna end without killing myself. Dont worry i dont need help. When i think about death i think about how maybe people would think about me for a while , but it would fade very fast so its not even worth it.

With self retrospective i tried to see if it was my personnality but it is not , i might be too agreeable soemtimes but other than that i dont see the problem. Still , people always make little talk to me and dont really care about me. Knowing fully well that people has meaningfull relationships between themselves and me right here , rotting in my room with heaps of trash beginning to pile up again. At least my personnal hygiene didnt go away... Yet.

I fear things will never ever be the same. Why people would ? All cozy in their little circles , in their little bubbles. Their own little world.

At least i have some people who still talk to me online. However , i fully know its only to play games , good around , nothing more.

I still hope things gets better and i will still work on myself , even tho it doesnt do anything at all.

Hope is the only thing i got left....",lonely,Lonely forever,2022-04-19 18:30:30

Basically the title hints it: I centainly believe I will never ever have a relationship again. For the last few years I have come to the conclusion that I will never find a suitable partner for me. To avoid getting too deep into it, I think I can find a woman that can share my beliefs, but not have a compatible personality, or a woman that has a compatible personality but doesn't share my beliefs. That means I will never be able to find someone with whom I'd truly like to share my life.

Also, right now the only woman that shows some affection to me is a friend of mine who is eighteen, and with whom I know for sure I don't want to be. I have many friends, and good ones in fact, but that doesn't keep me from feeling a crushing loneliness that is slowly driving me insane. I think of my future life and the only thing I see is a loner that goes out with friends, and feels genuine joy, but that will go home to literally no one, that will go to sleep every night in absolute darkness, silence and loneliness, that will be greeted by no one coming from work, that will never rest his heart at that special other's arms, a loner whose arms will never confort anyone.

I am always relatively lazy and slim and i get body shamed everytime from everyone. Idk why I actually eat more than any member of my family or friends but always remain slim. Many think that I suffer from some disease. They always mock and berate me. Recently i suffered dental problems and i may get possible Molar extraction. Every one in my family berates me. I know that I may not brush properly but I always tried my best to keep my oral health good, however dentist (which is just pathetic and always mocks my health) said that you had lots of tartar and need cleaning.

Also I have dark complexion and many racist fools always mocked me since childhood. Some in my family literally advice me to keep my face somehow bright and fair instead of dull and black. I also like to keep my hair long but you know family always berates to keep my hair short because I look like animal. 

I am just tried of all these things. Whenever I get any minor health problem, they start lecturing that I am bad and lazy idiot etc. Because of this i sometimes don't even tell that I have some problem. This backfired in dental health as I knew something was wrong with teeth but it took a long time for me to gain courage to take me to dentist.

1945,SiriustheBlackcat,1650351293,1,"I don’t make friends easily. Most of my friends from work have settled down with spouses and kids, and I’m still single and child free. Hanging out now takes advanced planning and they’d rather stay home with their families anyway. Even friends who don’t have kids are wrapped up in their SO and never initiate conversation with me via text, emails, etc. Half the time my emails don’t get responded to even when I email first. It’s like everyone’s moved on from me and I can’t identify because I don’t have a family. 

I reached out to old friends, but they’re indifferent. Same with my family. My siblings are all having kids and don’t have time for me. Now, I grew up the eldest of five, so I know how much of a handful kids can be, so I get they have responsibilities. I just miss video chats with my sister, or playing quick online games or going out and doing things. She’s tired a lot from kids so she doesn’t want to chat much anymore. I live out of state now, but when I lived 45 min from her, I’d visit every week. I was fine with that. I’d play with my niece and it was always a good visit. My parents use to live 90 min from me, but I’d be the one to always go down and visit too. They’ve come up to see me twice in six years. They’ll fly to East Canada from the West Coast to visit my sister and her kids, or go out of state for grandparents, but one state further is apparently a burden. All the times I lived out of state (12 years) only once has a sibling visited. No one else had, even though I fly up all the time. It’s made me feel very isolated and lonely. It’s gotten to the point where I’m ready to not spend anymore of my precious vacation time visiting them and just want to go do my own thing. It just makes me feel like a bad daughter and sister. 

As for friends, I know I have to find single people who can relate to me and be in the same life stage, but at my age, it’s gotten difficult to find them. I just feel exasperated because I could literally have a heart attack and die in my apartment and people likely wouldn’t know for days when either the neighbors complain of a stench or work actually visits my home looking for me. What am I doing wrong where no one has time to message, text, email, call, or visit me? No one knows how I feel, since I feel bad like I expect everyone to drop everything for me or that the world revolves around me. It doesn’t and I don’t expect people to drop everything or cater to me. I just wish someone would reach out to me for a change.

1955,bigbeansguy,1650346345,1,"I couldn’t find the right words to write for the title of this post as I lay in bed about to fall asleep.

This post is long, scroll to the bottom for the tldr.

I am trying to keep anonymity so I apologize for some vagueness. This is my first real post to reddit outside of a meme I posted once.

Im really a regular guy (21). Im told occasionally that I am attractive even. Physically, I am told I am tall and strong. I had a successful career for myself as a collegiate athlete. I once raced and trained alongside some of the fastest people in the world in my sport, some names you would see in the Olympics. I am currently trying to go into an area in the finance industry that is extremely well paid at the cost of long hours. I work a job related to the field currently as I finish my undergrad and soon will begin my masters. I am expected with the way that I am currently working, and through scholarship, to have no debt even after my masters. I live at home still in my hometown and I hope to buy a nice small house in a couple years after Im out.

What is the point of me mentioning this stuff you may ask? It is because I wish to tell you that no physical success can alter the truth that being lonely is something that cannot be cured with something physical. Nor is it something that can be cured simply by being around others, but Im sure some of you have felt that too. I struggle with both childhood trauma, relationship trauma, and most of my time when Im not moving around I spend alone in my room trying to distract myself with digital things that I cant stand, but its either that or sitting in my loneliness. Even when I am doing something there is so little interaction with say my team that I am forgotten more times than remembered. For years I was talked down to and bullied by people that made me feel so inferior for no reason at all other than to boost themselves up. I only ever wanted to be their friend.

Fast forward after 2 relationships 1 which was very unhealthy emotionally as i let myself get stepped on and gaslit, and the other ending due to my lack of ability to really be present. Im not a good guy because I let these feelings of loneliness and anger and confusion manifest into a sexual addiction in which I either please myself by objectifying women or try to find someone to hook up with to make me feel wanted just for the time being. Neither of these things are what I ever wanted to happen and it has fried my ability to hold a strong relationship due to my ability to not make connection with people that really genuinely want me and are not just hooking up with me for their own reasons. Whenever I do try to start something I am rejected constantly and just have to move on as per usual, which doesn’t even hurt anymore. I try not to say things to make them uncomfortable or put pressure on them and encourage openness. But truly I feel that I am invisible to everyone, and even sometimes my immediate family.

In some time soon I really feel that I will be hitting a dead end in my life, and just be shut out from things that I had always felt capable of. In some time, not even my immediate family will be physically present around me. The people I work with will never question anything about me, the few friends I do have will fade into their own business as they go far away into their own places in life. All that will be left is myself and the weight I put on my mind which has been killing me slowly for years. Its like I could yell with every ounce of my being and still be unheard.

If you read all of this, you are the kind of person I wish we had more of in this world for really taking in what I have had to write. 

Even if you just read the TLDR, I appreciate at least your thought of looking at the subject.

TLDR: physical success cannot change the way you feel internally, nor can it change how some relationships work/don’t work. Im approaching a dead end that will soon be void of the few people I have in this world.",lonely,"I am a guy who from the outside who looks like I have a lot going on in a good way for myself, but I am invisible",2022-04-19 15:32:25

Hm, instead of questioning everything all the time I should probably just relax, but even then I'll feel like I'll get attacked by something unexpected in life.

Same friend group, I'm the only guy there. Eventually, her friends figured out that I like her, and they all encouraged me except one who blocked me. Anyways, she has told me that she doesn't like anybody. Her friends have asked her same questions and told me the same thing. While I know she didn't like anybody, it was alright. Since prom was coming up, and her friends told me that she will probably agree to go with me, and the upcoming hints seemed promising. (I got a gift from her but the only guy who got it from her. She would voluntarily walk with me and approach me and stuff, and she tells me secrets that her other friends don't know.)

Then, just not too long ago, one of them told me that she will most likely agree to go with me because apparently if she doesn't findanybody, her dad will go with her and she doesn't want that. They also told me that I shouldn't worry about any other guys as I was the only relevant suitor. I was hyped up for a bit. I planned to ask her to hangout tomorrow and ask her then. I thought I had a good chance.

However, today after school, one of her friends came rushing to me to tell me the crushing news...Her friend told me that the girl wants to go with someone in her art class to prom. (I do not share a single class with her.) I remember her friend from art class even told me there is nothing to worry about, I guess I was wrong. So she doesn't want to go with me. I guess I was never even relevant. The friend asked the girl if she liked the guy, but she denied it. Doesn't matter. I lost.

So I guess I won't be going to prom. I was only gonna go if I had someone, so I guess I don't have anybody. I even asked the girl if she wanted to hangout tomorrow, but I just canceled it. I'm broken. Was I not the guy who was always there for her? Who gave her gifts and presents just as she did to me? The only guy who even gave her valentines flowers? Why? I guess I will never know why. Gonna binge in Fade To Black as I die internally.

My 'best friend' I will message and try to be super friendly and she acts interested in the first few responses (ie 2) and then doesn't respond to me or look at my stuff for weeks. And then rarely tries to reach out to me. All of my other friends don't really want to talk to me either, it's basically the same situation where I try to send stuff and be like ""hey this reminded me of you"" or ask a genuine question about how they're doing and it feels like they think it's work to communicate with me. Even my boyfriend doesn't really like texting me that much and only gives me true attention when we're together. I get that most people don't like to be glued to their phones, but is it really that hard to respond to someone? To show that you care? I feel so empty and invisible. At the end of the day, I know the only one that will actually be there for me is myself, but I'm so tired... so tired of helping others, being their friend when they aren't a friend to me, and being there for them when they can't do that for me in return. I feel like no one is interested in me or what I have to say, I think I've always felt this way. Nothing matters. A classmate of mine just unalived herself and everyone is still very confused as to why she did it. She was loved by everyone around her(those who knew her personally and not), super involved, had a bright future, just a genuine person. And everyone it seems like around me is affected by her death, myself included who I barely knew her. But I can't help but wonder if I unalived myself if others would have the same reaction towards my death?... the answer is no. No one's life would actually be that affected by my passing. If anything just an annoyance. I have enough money for my parents to use it for my funeral if need be so it wouldn't cost them anything. My boyfriend makes enough to cover the rent at our apartment. People don't talk to me enough to really be missing anything in their daily lives. I have nothing to offer anyone other than my organs for those who need them. Nothing matters.

1972,leftonvioletstreet,1650339809,1,"I mean this post in the sincerest way possible and do not intend to put others down in any way. I harbor no negativity towards others. I wish love, light, and joy on absolutely everyone and that is the truth. But my problem is that I have absolutely zero mental stimulation from any other human being in my life. It is breaking my heart and has been for years. I'm blessed to have loving friends and family members but none of them, except for maybe one or two people I've met in my life, have the ability to connect with me mentally. 

I understand that \^ is pretty vague, so if I may, please allow me to dump all of this out for you, friendly stranger on the internet. 

I (30F) am a phd student studying history (military history, specifically). I've always been a bookworm. Many things fascinate me and I haven't quite figured out how to turn my mind off, or not marvel at the world around me, or not meditate on life's toughest questions, or stop reading, or satisfy my hunger for learning. I love to collect books, and stare at artwork, and listen to old music, and visit ancient places, and read archaic writing, and reach through the annals of time to try and touch parts of our story as human beings that make us what we are. My soul is ten thousand years old. I've filled hundreds upon hundreds of pages with every kind of reflection you could imagine. I stretch and contort and mould and bend my mind into any and every shape possible reading about countless subjects. I want to talk about space and physics and oceanography and meteorology and architecture and poetry and philosophy and medicine and sociology and life after death and e v e r y t h i n g. There is no thought I won't entertain and no discussion I won't have and no idea I won't hear and no friend I won't make and no meaningful conversation I won't enjoy. 

But I have no one to talk to. 

And worse, I get silence when I *try* to talk to anyone about anything substantive. I've been blessed with rich friendships and loving relationships but they're all with surface-level people. Everyone in my life spends their days watching reality tv, scrolling social media, or staring at football games. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with people relaxing and enjoying their time in whichever way they choose. I believe everyone's creator made them perfectly, truly I do. But they simply don't think. Ever. About anything. So maybe the reality is that creator (if there is one) designed *me* wrong. I don't know. The only thing I do know is that I am so alone. 

The kind of alone where you feel it most when you're around a lot of other people. 

There is no way to get these words out without it sounding like I'm putting others down and I wish that weren't the case because I truthfully do not mean it that way. But every guy I've dated has eventually hit me with lines like: ""I just can't compete with your brain, OP, sorry."" There was one guy who worked at the same office I did a few years ago. He was wonderful and gentle and very multidimensional too. We secretly had a small fling for each other but never admitted it. One day he told me something to the effect of ""you're a cute girl but your brain is the loveliest thing I've ever seen."" We were dating other people at the time and he moved away shortly thereafter. I think about him often. The point of this is not to flatter myself. Or him. Or anyone else. The point is to express that I almost wish I weren't this way. 

I feel good about myself. I am educated, have built a good career, have my life in order, treat my loved ones well and with respect. I've checked all the right boxes. I am just so achingly lonely. 

Like I'm in a world packed with 8 billion people and none of them speak the same language I do. 

I wish someone wanted to read with me, and share their writing, and tell me what they learned recently, and ruminate on powerful poetry, and muse about all the things they don't know, and ask all the questions they're certain no one has answered before, and have the courage to be wrong, and be tempted by the opportunity to exercise their mind, and be awestruck by the night sky, and humbled by the ocean, and be softened by art, 

and be each and every single thing that makes humans, human. 

Instead of spending all of their precious and limited breaths sitting in front of a tv screen. I mean fuck, meeting ANYONE who can even talk about the kind of history I study would be an absolute gift from above for me (especially if they *enjoy* it too, I'd faint).   

These are the things that make me lonely. It's been this way my entire life. But reader, if you've made it this far, you ease the sting a little.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, on to bitching. I have a crush again, unfortunately. I haven't had one for a while, because I was so distant from everyone that I didn't even know anyone well enough to fantasize about them, at best I'd be fantasizing a made up character that looked and *maybe* sounded like them. But there's a cute girl in 2 of my classes, and cuz I sit in the back, I see her quite a lot. Don't know to what extent it's mere exposure effect or something, but I think she's pretty cute. Have since I saw her, actually, so maybe MEE isn't a big part... Anyways, she doesn't really know I exist, cuz no one does. I'm just the sad kid who wears black and can barely string sentences together if you force him to talk. Nobody gives a shit. I mean I guess my lab mate kind of almost does, but that's cuz he's older and is in the compassionate dad stage of life, I think.

But yeah. So me and my lab mate were talking in lab. He asked me what classes I'm taking in fall, and I told him. Then the cute girl joined the conversation just to talk to me. She had joined our conversation once before, but to talk to my lab mate. This time, she wanted to ask me how I fit those classes together on the schedule, and offered a suggestion of taking a physics class over the summer like she is to make it easier on me. That was it. And obviously, any sane person would think nothing of this, but it was the highlight of my fucking month. She knew I existed, she thought perhaps that some knowledge I had could make her life better, and she cared enough about me to give me knowledge that she thought could make my life better. Again, no sane person would get excited over such a stupid thing, but here in the stupid bitch journal, I'm not sane. It was thrilling.

And it's been days now. Think that was Thursday that this happened, but I still am thinking about it. Like I said, I haven't had a crush in a while, so I had no scenarios even close to realistic that I could fantasize about while trying to fall asleep. I've been having to settle for pretending various anime waifus love me, because at least I can watch the anime they're in and learn some about their personality. And it's not like I know much at all about this girl, in fact I honestly know nothing. But it was unfortunately enough to jumpstart my imagination, and for the past few nights I've been imagining that she cares about me and loves me despite how fucked up and worthless I am.

It sucks. Because as easy as it makes going to sleep, it makes waking up that much harder, and it makes seeing her harder. I see her about 6 hours a week rn, and it's hell. It's just me fighting against my own fucking creepyass self wanting to stare at her, all the while lamenting that she doesn't like me. And now I get even more self conscious of my hair in lab. I have long hair, and I have to put it in a ponytail for lab, but because one of my fucking sex chromosomes is broken and I'm a male, I have bald spots that make ponytails hard to do. Some days they just literally don't work, and you can see my fucking putrid scalp through my hair. God, I wish I was just born XX , so I wouldn't have to put up with this.

Tangent: Isn't it funny that Greeks thought women were deformed males, but now we know that everything starts off female and it takes one of our chromosomes being stunted and malformed to make us male? I think that's just scrumptious, I would love to see the look on their faces as they learned that if we could go back in time.

Yeah, but anyways, this sucks. I have so much shit going wrong in my life, I have so much shit I need to do but I don't have a single gram of motivation to do any of it, and that mostly because knowing how fucking unloved I am makes me apparently unable to love myself. I didn't ask for this bullshit. I was actually happy as a kid, when I was under 12, I didn't give a shit about what people thought of me. I wasn't interested in finding a mate. All I fucking cared about (if I filter off the religious indoctrination) was having fun. And I was pretty damn good at having fun. But then fucking puberty came, hormonal changes I hated making my body wrong happened, but the worst of it was the fucking biological need for a mate. It feels like that's all that's been in my head for 9 years. I just wish I could go back to when I was aroace and was happy. Everybody says that love's the best thing about life, and they are probably right, but fuck it if you can't have it. If it's the best thing ever, then watching others get it effortlessly while you know you can never even know what it's like is the worst torture ever.

I'm so fucking jealous of everyone. I'm jealous of everyone at school who has friends that I don't have, I'm jealous of couples who have love that I don't have, I'm jealous of girls who have beauty and attractiveness that I don't have, I'm jealous of aroace people who have a level of self dependency I don't have. I just hate this. I never asked for this, I would've said no if I was asked.

1985,Affectionate-Back579,1650332752,1,"Here's the TLDR version straight up: I [23M] already feel hopeless and done with life. I've moved to a new country away from the handful of the people that I knew (and family but they don't play a big role). Life sucked there, and now that I'm here, it is really really tough. I'm not saying I didn't know what I signed up for, but I didn't know it was going to be THIS bad. I've tried making friends but apparently my 'race' has a bad reputation (maybe sketchy in a way that the native residents try not to get involved), so all of my efforts are in vain.

I don't know what I'm working for, what I'm doing, why I'm doing it or... Oh and the 'Hey do it for yourself man you're so young you have a lot of time left' is just bullcrap so please just. Yeah. 

I wanna marry someone and get settled. I haven't even talked to anyone cause of this 'image' that I'll create in front of anyone that - 'oh hey I have a friend/acquaintance/family member, he wants to get married. He's only 23 tf? 🤣'. I can't do it alone anymore. What's wrong with being married and still studying/having a job? Even if I find someone who is still studying, doesn't matter. It's not like we're gonna buy houses and cars and condos the moment we marry. This'll take time but it'll be fun cause we'll be doing it together. 

Here's the fun part - Relationships don't work anymore, marriages don't SEEM to work a lot either. Plus being this lonely for a long time (6 years), I'm going to always be paranoid about stuff that is not even worth worrying about. Neither am I sight for sore eyes lmao so there's that. Easy to be cheated on. 

I've only said this to my childhood friend. Not my best friends cause they think I'm going through a phase (they're really amazing people but still like tf is a phase) so there's that. Yeah so much for 'TLDR'.",lonely,Mixed feelings,2022-04-19 11:45:52
1986,GothClovers,1650331844,1,"Hey there, I'm a 22yo struggling with BPD. I just wanted to vent about my recent problems with loneliness and hope someone could read this and relate. Sorry if it's pretty long but I wanted to get everything out. Up until about the start of this year I had around four good friends that I could count on. It was a step down from the amount of people I had even just half a year before but I was still happy to know some people stuck around but then things quickly changed. These past 4 months, I've lost every single last friend in my life except for my girlfriends but I fear I'm losing her too. I even tried to reconnect with one person recently that I still care so much about but I was just completely ignored. :/  


I just constantly think about what I can change in my life to make new friends and have meaningful connections again. I try over and over to meet new people and open up more. I try my hardest to keep things as interesting as possible and not let conversations just die out right away but it feels like hardly anyone cares. I don't cross and boundaries or say anything disrespectful, I try to show interest in the things in their life but it just goes no where. I genuinely feel like there is something wrong with me. Well, there is cause I have BPD which makes things harder but I don't really show people that side of me so sometimes I doubt it's that. I think I'm just boring or unlikeable. It's hard dealing with the thoughts that I'm never going to be able to make more friends.  


The one connection I do still have is with my girlfriend, but I don't know for how long... I regularly get on her about how we barely spend any time together. I bug her about how little we've been talking. Anytime she chooses to spend time with her friends over me, I get so upset with her and myself and I know she notices. I think she blames herself for how upset I get, but it's not her fault. She tells me that it's okay but I can't help but feel like any recent divides between me and her are due to that. Recently I learned I'm about to lose my job and I tried talking to her about it but it felt like she cared about a League tournament more than how stressed I felt in the moment. It really hurt even though realistically I should give her a break cause I know she had those plans for a long time and would be there for me if she could. I know she loves me but I jump through so many mental hoops to convince myself she must be losing feelings. I know it's just due to BPD and that if I could real it in I could begin to show her I see that love she has and let her know I love her too. I could stop getting upset when she hangs out with her friends. I could stop with the jealous feelings that she still has so many friends while I struggle to make one. I don't want to lose her, she means too much to me. On the times we can talk more or spend time together, I feel at peace and like we'll spend our life together but I'm just not sure how to deal with things other times.  


I don't know what I could do to combat all these feelings. I don't know how to break free from this lonely feelings. I don't know how to deal with the vast amounts of stress over life I've been experiencing. I'm just so lost and I have no one to go to. I don't speak to my girlfriend about half these things because I feel like lately I only go to her for all my pathetic sorrow feelings.

1992,ShishilanPasalan123,1650327390,1,"She and I are close friends in HS. I've liked her since last november. We eat lunch together and we talk during breaks. Same friend group, I'm the only guy there. Eventually, her friends figured out that I like her, and they all encouraged me except one who blocked me. Anyways, she has told me that she doesn't like anybody. Her friends have asked her same questions and told me the same thing. While I know she didn't like anybody, it was alright. Since prom was coming up, and her friends told me that she will probably agree to go with me, and the upcoming hints seemed promising. (I got a gift from her but the only guy who got it from her. She would voluntarily walk with me and approach me and stuff, and she tells me secrets that her other friends don't know.)

Then, just not too long ago, one of them told me that she will most likely agree to go with me because apparently if she doesn't findanybody, her dad will go with her and she doesn't want that. They also told me that I shouldn't worry about any other guys as I was the only relevant suitor. I was hyped up for a bit. I planned to ask her to hangout tomorrow and ask her then. I thought I had a good chance.

However, today after school, one of her friends came rushing to me to tell me the crushing news...Her friend told me that the girl wants to go with someone in her art class to prom. (I do not share a single class with her.) I remember her friend from art class even told me there is nothing to worry about, I guess I was wrong. So she doesn't want to go with me. I guess I was never even relevant. The friend asked the girl if she liked the guy, but she denied it. Doesn't matter. I lost. 

So I guess I won't be going to prom. I was only gonna go if I had someone, so I guess I don't have anybody. I even asked the girl if she wanted to hangout tomorrow, but I just canceled it. I'm broken. Was I not the guy who was always there for her? Who gave her gifts and presents just as she did to me? The only guy who even gave her valentines flowers? Why? I guess I will never know why. Gonna binge in Fade To Black as I die internally.

I told her other friends about the devastating news, and they seemed kinda shocked. Apparently, they were so sure that she would want to go with me, but I guess not. Life sucks. My life sucks.",lonely,Just found out that the girl I like probably likes someone else,2022-04-19 10:16:30

I had a best friend from kindergarten to grade 9. We were inseparable at school. Everyone at school knew that we were the bestest of friends, never left each other’s side, and always hung out… at school. At the end of grade 9 I started hanging out with a new group of friends. I had so much in common with them, talked with them every lunch, and worked with them in class because we were all pretty smart. But that was at school. The pandemic hit at the end of grade 12 for me, and immediately we never spoke again for the longest time. 

I’ve always been a good student and a good person. I don’t mean to toot my own horn but that’s what everyone tells my mom at the bank she works at when they found out the woman serving them was my mom. Tons of students who I went to school with, telling my mom how awesome I was, how nice I was, how pretty I was, just to show up at school the next day and not even look at me. 

I’m in university now, haven’t made many friends due to classes being online, but I have made some. I did make one good friend who did ask me to hangout quite a few times, but she lived 2 doors down from me. She’s moved back home and has already started talking to me less.

I missed out on friendships and very crucial experiences associated with that age. At this moment, I have never been kissed and have never had a relationship. 

In theory, I could still do all these things but in a way, they are now much harder to achieve and it will be very different to the experience that could have been. But in truth, different is not what I want. I just wanted what everyone else got. 

I know I can have ""friends"" but it will not be the strong friendship one experiences in their upbringing. The thought of having friends and being in a relationship is not nearly exhilarating now. I think no matter what happens, I'll never be happy with whatever human relationships come my way. I mean it when I say it. I want to be a teenager. I would kill to have friends that are college-aged. Unfortunately, that's not how societal norms function. 

That's what I truly want. I think that's why I am so obsessed with people like Olivia Rodrigo; I wish I had a life and friendships like hers. She seems so close with her buddies. Again, I know I can have ""friends"" but I can never have something so close to the friends she has. 

When you get to adulthood, human relationships become very different in a not-so-good way. The energy just isn't there. 

I have accepted my loneliness at this point. Somedays, I wish I had people but I do remind myself that at my age, having friends will definitely not be the way I want them to be. I can see myself resenting friends that are my age and older in the long run. So, I am better off alone, and admittedly, there's peace in that knowing someone will never inconvenience your day unless it's work-related.

I had a small group of friends, but for various reasons grew apart from about a year ago, but wasn't massively close to by the end. My last of my close friends, whilst I still hold very dearly, I do not see much after I left the place we worked at mutually. 

I don't feel low as such, I am generally content with most aspects of my life, besides feeling very lonely. I don't feel close to anyone besides a very few people, but then they are busy with their lives, as I can be with mine. I have had meaningful friendships last years before, but recently, I've not had any kind of friendship that's platonic and I feel very hollow and just really f\*cking lonely. I'm quite shy, but not to the point that it stops me from forming relationships with people. 

I guess amidst my rambling I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on making friends as an adult?

I am questioning what I could have done differently. Why does it seam that dating and getting close friends are so easy but for me it feels impossible. All I can do is think about what I could have done differently. 

In some ways I just need to accept the fact that it will never happen not with me. It hurts and I hate it but it must happen. I will just have to accept that my crushes will find someone else and I will be on my own. I will probably not have a life worth living just one that I am surviving. 

I makes sense in a way who wants to date someone that is broken. I have been abused and probably will again. I just feel like everything wrong is my fault and the world would be better off with out me. I am sick of living if all I feel is pain. I don't know what to do. How to make this pain go away. 

Pretty much my dating experience is developing a crush on someone and finding out that they are in a relationship with someone else or are not interested in a relationship. Repeat a lot of times and I just feel pain. I am losing confidence in my self with being alone so much of the time I am finding it hard to love my self.

I have never been in a relationship which must be extremely rare at this point. Whenever someone asks me, I have to just say that it's been a while out of embarrassment. 

I would say I dress relatively well. I plan on what to wear and wbat goes with what. I like to buy a wide range of clothing items.

My height is average so i dont think that would be an issue. I am currently unemployed as I am attending med school. Everyon here seems to be either married or already in a relationship + there isnt that many people to begin with.

As for my personality, it would be a bit biased if I said it was good, but I am taking this from how others have acted around me. Everyone seems to be pretty comfortable with me and will tend to share things. I always try my best to treat people with care and respect. I am open-minded and like to see things from different povs. I have had people tell me im really nice and it isnt hard for me to make friends, but nothing more. I also try volunteering on a weekly basis to try and hep those in need. I still feel like an irrelevant side character in everyone else's story.

2032,60_year_loser,1650309725,1,"Wow! This really turned out to be a book of a post. Whenever I post something on Reddit I only get a single comment or two. 

TLDR: I just lost a great friendship because I’m fucked up.

I am so lonely. I recently turned 60 years old and the only constant thought I’ve had is that I don’t want to live anymore. It’s not that I want to kill myself, although that has been also been going through my mind.  The reason isn’t because I don’t want to die, it’s just I don’t want anyone I know that I am hurting so bad. I’ve had depression for most of my life. No one understood how sad I’ve been. 

I’ve been a disappointment to everyone. My Mother and Brother love me, but they don’t seem to respect me at all. I’ve have three college degrees and have been a professor for about 15 years. I’ve traveled around the world at least three times seeing about 60 countries. I’ve lived in the US, India, Dubai, Malaysia, and Taiwan. I’ve even written three books, and a fourth is on the way, about my experience traveling. No one, none of my family or any of my friends, seems interested. I had to force my best friend to look at it, and she spent about 30 seconds flipping through the pages. Nobody has ever asked what it was like to see so much. In fact when I was trying to talk about traveling through Russia to my brother, the subject was abruptly changed on how my brother went down to Arizona. He even gave me advice on how to travel.  He has also given me advice on how to teach a class. He once taught a workshop on photography, so when I told him that I had been teaching for ten years, he got upset that I thought I knew how to run a classroom. 

When I got my first degree, my mother said that she was so proud of me, even if my major was really easy. When I got the next two, no body congratulated me. I haven’t had a birthday cake in over 31 years and I have received only one birthday present since then. 

My marriage failed back when I was about 29 after my wife found someone else she liked more than me. I understood, we got married young, but I was hurt that I was losing her and my best friend. When she left, all she wanted was her bike and her clothes. She didn’t want any memories or photos of our 8 years together. That was rough. I couldn’t believe that she disliked me so much that she wanted to erase me out of her life. 

I haven’t had a romantic relationship since my divorce that lasted more than a year. There have been years that I didn’t have a girlfriend at all. I think my record was about 10 years without a companion. There are several reasons that I blame for this. All of them seem like excuses, but since I’m unloading here, I might as well mention them. The first is that I don’t know how to be in a relationship. My mother got married when she was 16 and was divorced when she was 24. She had lots of issues from her parents and struggled on her own. Imagine being that young and divorced, with two boys. Well, she didn’t handle it very well. She used to verbally and physically abuse us over very small things. She told my brother and me that she wished she had never had us. That we were the root of her problems. There was one time that we were on the freeway and while she was screaming at us, she threatened suicide. She stomped on the gas pedal and aimed at the side of an overpass. I was about 4 years old at the time. She told my brother and me that she wanted to ship us to our father except he didn’t want us. She had many boyfriends, so many that I only remember some of them. We’re talking like a dozen… no big deal, she was still young. The problem was that they would live with us for about a few months and then they would move on. I never understood what a family was by so many men living in the same house as me.  One time I mentioned to one of her friends that, “My mom hits really hard.” I get it, not the thing that she wanted others to know. When her friend left, she called me upstairs and said, “you want to know how hard I can hit?” And then hit me in the mouth with a closed fist. I was about 8 years old then. I was kicked out of the house when I was 18. Her method of letting me know that she wanted me out was to start hitting me with a coat hanger as she screamed that she didn’t raise a wimp. 

I know, if you’ve gotten this far then you realize I’m just a whiner. Whiners are weak and I hated myself as I was growing up, when I got older I got a tattoo on my hand to remind me to never be a wimp. 

So, why am I writing this to a group of people that don’t care about me or how my life has gone? The simple answer is my last relationship. Bear with me a bit and it may make more sense. I had a great friend, she is much younger than I am, but we spent a lot of time together. She is married and I made sure that I never crossed any line that could be considered romantic. I wanted to keep her as my friend for as long as I could. I knew that the odds of a long term friend were against a person like me. I also respect marriage and didn’t want to even tempt her into doing something that she didn’t want to do. To give you an idea of the type of friends we were, we talked every day, messaged almost every night. She would come over to my house and hang out. Sometimes we drank and talked one time we just watched Buffy. She was convinced I would love it if I watched it. Other times she just needed to vent about her marriage. Because she was spending so much time with me, her husband and sister started to ask her if she was having an affair. We never did, I knew that if we were messing around she would have to lie, and I didn’t want that. I wanted her to be happy.

Then it happened, after over two years of us being great friends, I caught feelings for her. It changed everything. I acted different and she caught the change. I ended up telling her how I felt and told her that we couldn’t be friends… there’s much more to it than that, but that’s the gist of it.  After a couple of months she tried to rekindle the friendship and I ended up agreeing so we went and had drinks. We were back to being friends again. Two weeks later I’m back to thinking about her all the time. About a month afterwards she stopped being around me. She wouldn’t immediately reply to messages, and basically stopped being my friend. Last week I made a really bad comment and told her that I didn’t want to be her friend anymore. She told me that I was being territorial. That I was a friend, but not a close friend. This hurt me so bad I can’t explain it. Earlier, before the first blowup, she told me that I was her best friend, well actually she said her sister was her best overall friend,  and I told her she was mine. 

Conclusion. My whole life I don’t feel that anyone has really cared about me. I wonder what the point of life is if I am destined to live alone forever. Death would be a blessing. The only thing stopping me is that people would consider me a wimp. So, my plan is to take some risks that maybe I can end this nightmare of a life. I told someone that I wanted to buy a kayak to go on the local river. No less than five people have told me to be careful the river is very dangerous. One guy told me that two people he knew were drowned there. Friday I purchased a kayak.

Because how do they say they a  population of 7 billion that grows every day some so identical to me and some so different from me some better and some worst

I still can't find love and this saddens me to my soul but with this realization come the that embrace of  loneliness yet again but form this I get the occasional jolts of inspiration to better my self until I realize I probably will never be able to grasp the concept of betterment and so this saddens me 

So I turn to faith,enlightenment fantasy,luck,hope,zodiac signs,personalities types,poetry, pulling me down even further down the pit of loneliness and this saddens me 

And with this  knowledge of this  cycle is to make any man cry but I do not because I am strong but because I can't. So once more I come to the conclusion that something is wrong with me not we not you or them it's me maybe a sin that refuses to fade or maybe because I was meant to die without love or because I am scared of it or maybe because I chose knowledge over amusement and for this I am branded as awkward,weird,boring ,small minded

If u connect with someone for a relationship.. loneliness will vanish as long as you both are in love. But one argument or difference of opinion will cause cracks in the fragile relationship causing either of you to become lonely again, but this time it will feel untolerable after the dependency you develop on a person.

It just seems to remind me of how far distant i really am. I havent been able to jerk it to porn either for a while (again, not that i did it much to begin with) because i cant imagine myself in any sexual situation. ill try and turn myself on, but then i cant escape the thoughts telling me that ill never have that, and then ill get too depressed to relieve myself. I know i shouldnt focus on this aspect of myself, but i feel like part of my personal identity that other people get to explore, that being my sexual identity, is something that never developed. And i know people will say i have time left, and sure, to an extent its true, but considering how far gone i am, and how long it would take for me to conceivably get over myself, it will be another few years at least before i even start exploring. And obviously no one wants to put up with a mid 30's something dude who has to learn everything for the first time, so maybe a few more years of dating to find anyone remotely compatible, then im basically the 40 year virgin, which as a movie concept was supposed to be satirical and ridiculous.

And decided not to use the app frequently and lost the hopes since it made me doubt myself more..
I was trying to do better , since 1-2 days , I know I am trying , I know I am lonely but I don't feel it unless I see them or someone makes me realise.

I'm sorry about your pain what keeps you awake at nights. I feel u, the feeling of being unloved, forgotten and alone. But well you're not, it is just the wrong people will always make you feel that way. after a while, the hurt hurt less, you start to see reasons, you'll understand everything, why they did what they did. Learn that not everyone you meet will stay in your life forever, and this is okay because not everyone is meant for you, they all teach you something. But it is important to learn and to see the necessity to let them go, even if you don't want to. And it will hurt. The kind of hurt that follows you everywhere, the hurt that leaves you thinking if you ever meant anything for them. You can't except them to love you back the same way you love them. And this is the same with love Sadly this is the truth. This applies to both friendships and relationships, as we hate to admit it. You have to learn live without them, without goodmorning and goodnight.
This is life and it is what it is. Shit is gonna happen. It's gonna get complicated. We're gonna get relapse, were gonna be weak, were gonne be strong. were gonna break down and beg some people to stay in our lives. but we cant give up, we have to keep going, even when it is scary. We have to keep picking ourselves back up because every bad things will pass, and we will make it through. we've made it this far, we can make it through whatever comes next!

Someday You will find someone who will stay by your side i promise. In this world there are things you can only do alone, and things you can only do with someone else. Its important to to combine the two in just the right amount.

I was never good with women in the first place, plus I'm not a guy that stands out looks wise (for better or worse), and she was a prime catch. I'll never do that good again.

So I stopped going to them. I haven't hung out with a friend off of the internet in years. 
I have dating profiles   and I rarely get matches but when I do, I start with a shitty pickup line that I think is funny and 80 percent of the time the girl just unmatches without responding.

months went by and i still couldnt get out of that weird depression dream-like dissociative state where all the days blend into eachother and time flies by, i couldnt speak to people because nothing they or i said made sense. i was too busy planning my next attempt so making friends wasnt really a priority, having no friends is no use if i'll be dead right?

so its now april and its hard to decide on a date to do it. maybe on my birthday? anyway, i thought maybe i'd give life one last chance but making friends at this point in the year is impossible and embarassing. i dont know what to do. the more time i spend alone, the more i feel i hate everyone around me and that isnt good. i dont think i'd be a good friend anyway, i'd bring them down with myself being a depressed suicidal mess...",lonely,no friends,2022-04-18 17:53:09

Think of all the people in a loveless marriage that was derived by an unplanned pregnancy, where the child 
(Or children are) is reluctantly looked after by two bitter and neglectful parents who come to the realization they’ve taken a path they despise after it’s too late and too many people are effected as a consequence. Think about how Unequipped some people can be to parenting, then ask yourself if it’s something we all innately want.

If people look at you as defective for being single or not having any friends, look at marriage statistics and divorce rates and how common it is for adults to be in therapy as a result of their parents. 

What if you have a partner who is a white collar criminal or a degenerate gambler? Or maybe your partner is simply inept and not giving you what you want? Maybe both peoples lives are worse by being in the relationship? No true loner has ever been snuffed by a death cult or lead into a life of crime by being recruited into a gang.

2111,SaraleeOF,1650263216,1,"*Less than human*. This is the only phrase that accurately describes how I feel. There is something wrong with me. I feel an unbridgeable gap between me and other people. Something about me is just off. I don't know if its autism or social anxiety or something else entirely. Whatever it is, I can't think of a time where it hasn't been there.

It's like I'm wearing a person suit but the cracks are starting to show (or have been showing) and it's so obvious to everyone else that I'm not really human. I go through the motions but my performance is uncanny and scares people away. When I talk to them it's as if I'm following a very stilted script. Inevitably, there comes a time where something comes up that is not covered by it and I draw a blank. There's the opportunity for an interesting conversation and eventually a friendship. I want that more than anything, but I have nothing to offer.

Sometimes I can put on an interesting performance. I can exaggerate my idiosyncrasies, play up what little drama there is in my life, or talk about my interests. Sometimes people are receptive, but the cracks show through and any chance at becoming more to them than momentary entertainment is squashed. Alternatively, I can get them to share things about themselves, but as much as people enjoy talking about themselves it doesn't get them to like me. It's not just a lack of social skills. Something in me is empty. When people speak to me, there's nothing in me that speaks back.

Meeting people isn't the hardest part though. I have a few friends. I'm in love with one. They all mean the world to me. Yet all my friendships are one-sided. I initiate everything. For them, I am a second thought—a periphery name to be invited to the big events but nothing else. They don't come to me for anything. Talking to me is like talking to a very sophisticated machine instead of a person, so there's no reason to confide in me or become close to me.

I ended up in the hospital a few weeks ago, stopped cold turkey smoking marijuana (smoking every day for a year but started smoking all day every day a month and a half before I ended up in the hospital) and taking klonapin daily when I was admitted. 

The withdrawals from the both of them suck. Not only that, I just feel so lost and confused in life.

And a person I opened up to, who I had romantic interest, she, didn’t say anything to me. We didn’t have the best experience last time we saw each other, faults on both sides, but I walked out on her basically. 

She was honestly a jerk to me that day. I replay it in my head multiple times, and after everything I had been through, and what I’m still going through, I am just a shell of myself. I can’t do much physically activity, I’m now having to drop my college semester, among the crippling anxiety that I’m having.

I’m gonna go get help, but, this is a time I really needed somebody by my side.

All I wanted was somebody to talk to, but she just stopped communicating with me. And I don’t know how she feels because she won’t tell me what’s on her mind so I just had to stop talking to her.

2134,Jealous-Tea4559,1650250871,1,"*long post, need to get things out*

I was speaking to a doctor after I had long term covid problems including memory issues (I'm ok now) they wanted me to speak to a psychologist they knew and although nervous I agreed. I internalise alot of my problems and thoughts and sometimes what I say and what I think are two very different things. 

I get the call and the female (may not be relevant, but women are more empathetic) psychologist started talking to me. As it was memory related we talk about the last 10 year's and things that have happened and the more she asked the more she got upset. The tone of her voice at the start of the call was bubbly, but after 10 minutes she was quieter and started to add longer pauses. 

I asked if she was OK and she didn't answer and instead started to ask how I felt. I said truthfully that there are good and bad days, but I learnt long ago to handle pain and rejection. She started to say I must feel negative emotions (I forget what she said exactly) and I said no I felt great and positive after nearly dying to covid.

She began to reassure me and said it was OK to be sad and again I could hear she was sad. I asked her again if she was OK and she said yes and laughed at the irony of a patient asking her if she was OK. That made me laugh, we laughed, and then the call ended with her saying she thought I was amazing.

I'm not someone who receives compliments so I was  smiling ear to ear for hours after, but since then it made me think about how I feel and whether I'm being genuine to myself. I started to think back at different times in my life not just the last 10 years and I'm amazed I'm not worse than I am and i sometimes wonder how I get through each day. 

What we discussed: 2008 was made redundant. Boss lied to me and I lost a big job. In anger I took redundancy and then fell into depression. I had moved back to family home with mum and brother as it was cheaper. Due to a tax mix up at old job I owed tax. The bank was sending letters to old house so I didn't know and the amount owed got larger. 

I'm a big guy so in a way to change my life I decided to get weight loss surgery. Was a band so reversible. Paid £14k and had the surgery then the place I had it done disappeared. I wasn't able to get the band tightened to work and the NHS back then was very anti-fat. ""If you're fat just lose weight"". This didn't help. 

In 2009-2010 I met a girl and it was going well and in 2011 she asked me to move in for her and I did. I found out a month later she had slept with her newly divorced boss a week after I moved in so that was that. I also had just got an interview at her place working for her boss, so hell no to that. 

2012 my step dad died of cancer. I had just started seeing a woman too and at his funeral she kept messaging and calling me to leave to be with her. So buried step dad and broke up with her. 

I also got a job in a call centre and got a friend who had similar interests. He lived near me so we'd hang out after work, go drinking etc. It was a good way to forget women and move on etc.

2013 he was killed by a car that hit the pavement and crashed into him. I wasnt there and I didn't know his family. They didn't tell work when the funeral was so we couldn't attend. 

I had another friend too and we were going to do an IT apprenticeship. We both applied and was to be told if we got it. She got it. I phoned the college as I hadn't heard back and was told I had got it, but they forgot to email me. (Email was to be sent Wednesday I called the following monday). I said it was OK I'll do it, but they had a meeting that Monday with all apprentices and as I wouldn't be there I couldn't do it. They had a meeting with me a few days later to go over some higher level apprenticeships starting soon, but as I didn't meet the requirements the only solution they offered was to reapply for same apprenticeship the following year.

End of 2015 call centre job shut down. The campaign we had was sold to another company. We had the chance to go there to see the centre and the town and the company would take us as we were experienced. Id have to relocate though. Was to be two trips by coach. First trip I stayed behind. We weren't taking calls but we were still open and i was a deputy manager and we still had email work to do. My manager needed me to man the call centre and  I'd go second trip. Second trip didn't happen. Only 3 of us didnt go the 1st time and they didnt want to pay for us. I couldn't afford to travel there so didn't go and took redundancy again. Fortunately I found a better paying job within a few days.

 2016 my uncle died of a heart attack. I didnt like him much, but he died in my house and I found him.

2019 my mum died. Found out she had cancer in November 2018 and died the following February. 

2020 I got covid. Oxygen levels fell to 67% and I had to go into hospita Christmas day. The first night i only remember being told to breathe and to lay on my front, but i couldnt. Then sitting and breathing into a mask looking at a monitor.My lungs were white on x-ray from the scars and I was on oxygen until Jan 1st. I didnt know until I left that when I was told to breath and to when I was sat breathing I had passed out and oxygen went to 40- something % and then went to 67 after they helped me. If it fell to 65% they would have ventilated me and being blunt they didn't think I would make it.

But I did and Jan 3rd I went home. I couldn't talk, think and would be out of breath after a few seconds of moving, but I'm here. My scan in April showed most lung scarring was gone and all that was left was the brain fog/ memory issues. Which brings us to the psychologist. She was happy that I'd be ok and sure enough my memory is back to normal.",lonely,Psychologist got upset for me,2022-04-18 13:01:11

I've just started my 1st year of uni. It started bad but I made really good friends along the way and recently I've been in the most healthiest and greatest mindsets I have ever been in my life. I have some amazing friends and ones that I'd die for.

But right now, I am in bed, right after Easter at 2 am and not catching an ounce of sleep. And I'm in this subreddit for a long time and I come back here whenever I feel this way. I'm surrounded by people that I know care about me yet I feel so alone. It might be intimacy that I lack but I really doubt it, it might be stress? I'm mostly venting here but I don't really know how to feel. I thought of a question tonight, quite a famous question but one that I couldn't answer, ""If you were to die tomorrow, who is the one person you'd call?"".

Well, there are my parents and my close friends. But I couldn't pick out one specific person that I would really kick myself for not calling. This doesn't mean I don't love the people I know, I do. But I feel like there isn't anyone I can actually go to for these things. There isn't anyone I can communicate with when I'm lonely.

Today I spent my day just chilling, I was calling with a close friend of mine while enjoying some of my hobbies. Today was actually great, I did a lot of things that I love to do. And I did it with family or my friend. But I really don't understand why I still feel like I'm so alone that I'm living for nothing. I really strive towards my goals because of my family and my future. But tonight I've been feeling I'm just on some sort of solo mission.

So, I began trying to be more social. I joined clubs, got added to a couple of groupchats, but still spent my free time alone. I would ask people if they wanted to hang out, but any proposition i had quickly got shot down. 

Now, in college, everything is repeating itself. I still technically have ""friends"" but the only times i hang out with them are when we accidentally go to the dinning hall at the same time. I have the uncanny ability to silence our groupchat for several hours by simply asking if anyone wants to hang out.

A few weeks ago, I came across this video of some teenagers going to ikea to buy sharks and just messing around and having fun. It made me realize how much i missed out on. I never went on adventures like that with my friends.

2164,PassiveVoidResident,1650240185,1,"I have been coming on and off this subreddit for a good while now and something that I have noticed is there are frequently 2 types of posts being made here;

1. Venting posts - Talking about the horrible things going on in one's life or past.
2. People trying to help by providing 'virtual' hugs and other means of support (like the 'DM me for a chat if you are lonely' posts).

Personally, I deal with a good amount of loneliness in my own life, it sometimes keeps me up at night, or makes me not enjoy things for a few days at a time.

I do not have a problem with those 2 types of posts, and I really appreciate the people trying to help the others. With that said I think that we as a community can do a much better job at helping each other; Some of us here have been experiencing loneliness for very long periods of times, and as someone who has been dealing with it through a majority of my life, it brings me much pain to see others going through the same thing.

Something that I see a lot on here is people usually validating (WITH GOOD INTENTIONS) the negative beliefs and opinions of others, for example posts about people saying how horrible human beings can be, and the replies saying that human beings are sh\*tbags.

I think there is a lot that we as a community can do to not only potentially save lives, and help others, but even share our own experiences to help ease the pains of our fellow human beings. Here are some of my suggestions;

1. When we reply to venting posts, we should do so with the intention of letting the person know that they are not alone by sharing our personal experience with them, suggest coping mechanisms, or give advice on how to overcome their situation.
2. Try to minimize the negative beliefs towards others, since these are most of the time based on subjective experiences.; like saying all psychologists or parents are horrible.
3. Making posts about personal wins and maybe how/why you feel better than usual.

One thing that I am sad to see is the lack of positive posts and the downvoting and silencing of people trying to be helpful. When I was a regular reader on this subreddit during some of my darkest times, it felt like an eco chamber of people saying how horrible life in general is and making me think that perhaps I will be lonely my whole life.",lonely,My thoughts on the state of this community and its users.,2022-04-18 10:03:05
2165,Frosty-Complex-9996,1650239426,1," 

Sorry for the long post but I literally have never shared what I've been dealing with anyone and I felt this would be a good place to start. I am a 25M and have been dealing with social anxiety my entire life. I have older brothers who are 5-7 years older than me and are extremely outgoing and constantly talking about the fun things they do. They invite me with them sometimes but I just feel like I'm in the background. I am very shy around people other than them and my couple of friends. Most weekends I stay at home and smoke. I never really go out unless it's to grab food. I do like to hike and camp and travel but it's not easy to make friends doing those things. I have one friend that I chill with and we never do anything. We are both socially awkward and too anxious to ever go out anywhere.

This is the big thing that I really never talk about because I am too embarrassed. I have never been with a girl or even kissed. I don't feel like I will ever get the chance. I do go through depression but only with this. I get so beat up over the fact that I'm a 25 year old whose never even kissed. I feel so left behind and that I can't relate to anyone that I would meet. The friends I do have I have been with since high school. I went to college but no luck and haven't made any friends through work. Whenever I talk with people I get so anxious and usually say little to nothing. I want to talk with them but my mind is blank and I literally can't come up with words to say.

Everyone in my family and friends that I know are all in relationships or getting married. Maybe this is why I've starting feeling worse about myself, but it's helped me realize that I want to be with someone and start a family of my own. I just can't stop thinking that it's not possible and that my future will just be me.

I've always been unable to connect with my peers at high school because I want meaningful conversations, whereas they're more interested in living the moment and having fun. This isn't a bad thing, but my lack of meaningful connections with others bothers me.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I met an INTJ and we had an 8-hour long meaningful conversation, but it wasn't a friendship. I also recently began an operation and emailed every single student at my school a Google Form to identify who could be a compatible person, along with getting statistics to show people tend to form groups by gender and color. I was given a 1-day in-school suspension for violating the acceptable computer use policy (as I lacked the common sense to realize there could be an issue emailing 1.8k people). Anyway, there were a lot of rumors about it and she unfriended me that day, which is fine people do that a lot, but I kept having dreams where she refriended or at least discussed why, but none were true, and its been messing with my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm here to find SOMEONE with whom I can have a meaningful deeper connection and discuss things. Something more than ""how was your day"" as the only question. I'm done with high schoolers. My guidance counselor said I'm beyond the maturity level of high schoolers and would have to wait for college, but I'm done waiting. I keep posting everywhere in the hopes that 0.0000001% of people would respond to me. The few that do are incompatible.

I had only one guy who i considered to be a good friend. He was my best friend who i met online a year ago. Always had trouble making friends in real life since I have been bullied most of the time. All I ever wanted in my life was a friend who atleast cared and try to understand me. After multiple attempts of trying to find someone online, met this guy.

We vibed with each other pretty well. I didn't hesitate to open up about my struggles with him since he was non judgemental. He did tell about all of his struggles. We both met at a time when we weren't doing well in our lives.

While his life seem to have become better. I'm still stuck in the same phase. But I'm happy that he was able to get through all of the shit.

Without a doubt I still consider him to be my best friend but he started moving apart from me. No longer puts any effort in the conversations and it hurts to see all this go apart. My hopes were high with him. But he just finds me uninteresting and uncomfortable to talk about any stuff. 

He made it clear that there is no chance of our friendship getting any better and that it was all a fallacy that things would work out. I feel so heartbroken. Don't know what to do. He doesn't mention any reason as to why our friendship changed but is adamant that this friendship is of no benefit to him.

It's hard for me to accept the fact that he had no interest in me. All I ever wanted was to feel the essence of a true friendship but i guess I'm wrong to believe that people care maintaining a good friendship that isn't all about checking on how it benefits them.

My mind feels disturbed from my current situation. I may have to open up to my parents sometime later about the friendship that once made me happy thinking about it, is all now broken into a million pieces which cannot be fixed.

Don't know whether it's even worth to find a friend anymore. It's exhausting when it doesn't work out inspite of putting all the effort. Idk just feel lost and lonely again and wish someone would be there.",lonely,[Friendship] It's All Over,2022-04-18 08:55:05

Hi, i will try to be short somewhat and not give all my story, but basically i am in a very bad spot mentally at the moment , thinking back at everything my life was/is and i have no idea how to start fixing it.

I feel like an absolute weirdo, a freak.

So, my entire life except school and stuff i was forced to do i never connected to anyone outside that activity i did, i just went back home and did my own thing, this for 22 years

i had decent relationships with the people that i knew , but i never went out or did anything with them and when i say never basically never. (not as a child either, i was always doing my own thing after school or whatever ) once i did a high school trip and had some fun and that was in a period where i had a girlfriend (met online, 1 year after meeting her we met in person and went well, broke up eventually but that was the only ''real thing'' i had ever going for me with any other human being..) so i suppose i was more outgoing back then. But that's it, i have 0 irl friends and never did bond with anyone, my friends are only in discord and i have ''plenty'' of them since im very loud and out there and seems people like me and i know plenty, but i basically just sit inside all day on my computer and pretend it is all ok, while i actually have nothing else going for me in the real world.

i think it also comes a lot from the fact that i have a problem at my jaw that is not visible unless i eat (malloclusion, i keep my mouth shut in an unnatural position to make my face look normal) , but i also avoided activities that involved it wich can basically be anything therefore i did not do anything . I do think i am attractive if i do not eat so my face looks normal, and i have received overwhelming positive feedback on my pictures, going as far as calling me a gq model, but that did not help at all apparently my disgusting mental health. --- Ah and to elaborate on the girlfriend part, we met only 3 times irl since long distance, she saw me in pictures mostly, irl i made sure to never eat near her. So it went all fine as far as insecurty goes, cannot imagine having had to meet her every day...i probably would have not even tried to get together with her in the first place.

So yeah...no one knows either this , i pretend that i have a life, i think my social skills and the way i speak or behave also are pretty normal if not even above'' average'' whatever that means, so people expect me to be a pretty popular guy or atleast with something going for me... but here i am, alone in my bedroom like almost every other day since i was born. And i have absolutely no idea how to fix this, whenever i think about going out and meeting people, like next year at uni for example, something in my head just tells me: '' what if they ask what you do in your free time ? what if they figure out you have no life, it's not worth it! You will be exposed, don't talk to these people...you will be made fun of.'' So i always avoid everything...its a vicious cycle.

I speak to people casually but never bond or connect, because i am scared the fact that i have no life might come out or they might figure it out , and i keep living like that.... plus the insecurity about my looks from above.

I have no idea what to do anymore, i have been feeling overwhelmingly bad lately,this especially because some pretty girls apparently like me from university, but i am scared shitless to approach them or even dare share anything about myself with them , OR eat near them.

i don't even know what to do to actually meet new people or do other activities, i just always talked to these people and then went on my way when whatever we did in common ended.

Even now i am scared of people that i know online that might read this and figure somehow out it is me, i keep smiling and behaving like i have the best life ever, meanwhile i am miserable half the time, thankfully i am still a very positive person and manage to find the good in my life and that kept me going for all these years... but it's time for a change, i cannot keep going like this.

Sorry, it is still an advice post, but i felt the need to vent too...",lonely,"isolated all my life, never went out almost for 22 years, help.",2022-04-18 07:18:11

I don’t know where to start, I feel a bit embarrassed to write this even though I know many posters have made similar posts. I’m 22, from Ireland, and I don’t have any friends at all. There’s nothing wrong in myself (I don’t push people away, have any issues that would effect my social ability, etc). The only connection of consistent communication I’ve had recently was my ex-girlfriend (whom is no longer a part of my life). I just never had a stable long term friendship or friend group growing up. I never really had friends in school except 2 people, both of whom ghosted me / made excuses for not meeting up when I tried to reconnect with them in the last few years (we didn’t have much in common/hang out outside of school so it wasn’t an outside friendship). There are a few people I hang out with in college, but outside of the degree we are studying, we have nothing at all in common (they are late 20s/early 30s, into guys things, have many friends of their own outside of uni).  My course is very small and aside from those I mentioned above, nobody really comes in to lectures. I tried to organize some drinks after college for a course that shares a lot of our modules but again people have their reasons for not attending. My course won’t get any bigger over the next few years.

The gist of my long post here is that I'm suggesting to the mods or anyone who's able to open a server just for us, where no shaming takes place regardless of age, sex or whatever. It's really helping me and maybe it will help you too.

I decided to create group for people that are looking for answers, explanations or solutions regarding long term loneliness. Take it as a book club, but without the book. The goal would be understanding our own loneliness better (how we got there, how to get out of it, why have we been struggling with it for a long time) by exchanging experience, knowledge, perspectives on the topic.  People would meet once a week or once every 2 weeks and talk about it constructively. Those that arent comforable speaking are welcome to just listen in or participate in the discussion via text.

Since I have a little bit of practical and academic knowledge on such disscusion/support-ish groups (no cheesy/cringey AA stuff I promise) I would be the one leading/moderating the meetings in the beginning just to keep them balanced in terms of dynamics and include everyone.

2228,mr_hotcake,1650215666,1,"English is my second lenguage, sorry if theres any mistake. Im 19 y/o and i met this girl in a summer camp, i was 17 y/o and she was 20 y/o. When i was 17 y/o i was diagnosed with depression, I felt that I had a lot of confidence in her and I told her what was happening to me from the first moment, our friendship was good but since 6 months ago i started noticing things i didn't like (at that moment i had only 2 friends). She lives in another city and she did not answer my messages for weeks (Now I'm realizing that this is a sign, but at that time I had practically no friends and she was the only person I had that could be considered a friend), she updated his social networks without answering my messages, i felt her so distant. more than once I offered to go to his city so we could see each other at least before the end of the summer but i had no answer. more than once I asked her what was going on and if she wanted to continue being my friend but her answer was that she was very busy and that she did not have time for social networks (it made her anxious to maintain a cyber relationship with someone). I remember that many times she updates her social networks where she went to a party, got together with other people from her city, whit his new boyfriend, etc. I didn't know what to do at this moment, I wanted to continue maintaining the relationship I had with her because she was my only friend. So, about two months ago I had an episode where I felt very bad and I needed to tell someone what was happening to me and I went to her. I told her that I was feeling very bad emotionally and was having bad thoughts because of my mental illness. I remember his response was: Have you taken your medications this time?. Then the conversation continued for 2 minutes and I received no more answers. It should be noted that I always tried to make the relationship as reciprocal as possible in order to generate some space of trust (I wanted her to feel that if she went through something similar she could tell me the same way). A week ago I thought that I no longer deserved to be ignored and I told her everything I thought, I told her that I thought the relationship was very one-sided, I felt her very distant and finally I told her that I expected some kind of emotional support when I felt bad. I feel like this offended her. she told me: ""you don't know what I felt at that moment, or if I was going through a similar situation"" At that moment it's true that I wasn't thinking about that, but it's because she never told me, I always wrote first, then I began to think that she was right and that maybe it was very selfish to put my problems before hers. Honestly it's sad, I would have liked to be her friend and I told her, I have mixed feelings, she told me in that same message that she appreciated me. sometimes I think that we are just not compatible for a friendship relationship, I find it hard to think of someone lying about their own mental illness thoughts but someone told me that this could be their justification for ""ghosting"" me.",lonely,I would like to know your opinion about this,2022-04-18 03:14:26

Maybe its because i dont really have a family that is warm and loving growing up, so im trying to make friends and make my own family, but i am being patient cuz i understand how friendships work and they take time.

I've been by myself since yesterday when my roommate went to go home for Easter. As an introvert, I do relish in my alone time, but it does have its limits. 

I spent most of the time just chilling, but also going around to various online dating apps and sites just so I wouldn't feel a bit less lonely.

Well, since I'm here already... I know we just met, and this might seem crazy, but I would love to get to know you! You know, my train back home only leaves like in a couple hours, and I don't really have anywhere to be or anything to do right now, so what do you say?



Awesome :)

Hey, wanna hear something funny? Well, on my way here, I passed by lots of people who looked that they were just minding their own business, going about their daily lives...And as I passed by each and everyone of them, I thought to myself ""I wonder what that person is REALLY like"". You know, beyond how they look, how the walk, how they talk... Like, inside. What they really think. What they really want. But knowing how most people nowadays have become so desensitized, I think that if I just straight out walked to one of them and asked them that same question, I would either get punched right in the forehead or decimated with a pepper spray haha! So I guess what I'm trying to say is... thank you for not doing either of those things!


There you go! Now that's a smile I would like to put a frame around and hang it at my place so I could look at it every day :)

So I wonder... Is there anything you like doing so much that it just makes you smile just like that? Like, even if it's something seemingly ordinary? Please tell me about it!




You know, I think it's really the smallest things in life that give us some of the happiest moments. Like, see that little bird up there just standing at the top of that tree? When I look at him, I think about how great he must feel being that small, yet being able to have the whole world at his feet... From up there, we must seem like tiny ants to him haha! And really, good for him, I'm totally rooting for him! Just goes to show that if such a little guy can do such an impressive feat, what's our excuse for not being able to follow through with our dreams?

Oh, by the way, what would you say is your lifelong dream?


Wait, that ain't right... Scratch that. Now that we're friends, I feel that I can be honest with you. I don't think ""dreams"" aren't really attainable, because, well, they're just dreams! It's just something that we see and that we want, but can seemingly never get close enough to it to live it. So, I think it would be much better if we just started calling our dreams ""goals"", because I know for one thing goals can be achieved!

So, let me ask it this way... what is your lifelong goal?






I know that sometimes that kind of stuff can truly seem like a dream, out of reach, with life constantly throwing us those obnoxious curveballs... And it's during those times that we usually feel lonely, especially if there's nowhere near us to cheer us up a bit. I know I know, it sucks. I'm no stranger to it. To live in a world so full of people and yet feel completely alone, that's... really painful. Many times more painful than any injury. I hope you don't mind me asking you this... but... what do you feel is going wrong with your life right now?






 
You know... Back there when I was coming this way, I felt like that. Lonely. No wonder, I don't know anyone around here and people on the street just don't seem like they would be very enthusiastic about making small talk with a total stranger. But then I saw you sitting here, and I just had this strange feeling that you were feeling the same way as me. I mean, not exactly due to the same reasons, but just... the way it feels. Though I must admit... I kinda had forgotten about all of that stuff since we started talking, so I'm really happy we met :)


Wow! Look at the time! We were having so much fun that I completely forgot about my train, time has passed so quick! Well, I'm really sorry to run off like this... Tell you what. Here's my profile: it's u/Hugs_Ahoy. Shoot me a message if you talk about stuff or just elaborate a bit more on what we just talked about! I know probably my cell connection will be a bit spotty during that long as hell train ride, so maybe I won't get your message right away, but I promise I will do my best to read it and reply as soon as I can! 

So don't be a stranger! See ya :)





OH SNAP WAIT! How could I forget...








We didn't hug goodbye!!! Gotta take one for the ride home!

None of this information is personal enough to know anybody mentioned unless you are one of them.
This is not a personal ad.
I am not suicidal, just in a bad place.

All my life I’ve been a loner (3-5 friends max) and I’ve been fine with that. About a month ago I realized that I’m terrified of being alone. Every relationship I have is close to fading and I’m scared.

First up my parents. I already have almost no relationship with my mom other than living in the same house (I’ve tried connecting with her but she makes no effort). My dad and I are really close but because of his hours we see each other maybe 3 hours a day. I’m also about to move out so that will hurt it.

Next my friends. I pretty much started fresh in September because I cut ties with everyone I knew in late June (bad LSD trip, panicked, plus drama I wasn’t there for). I started talking to my friend again in September and he introduced me to some new people. 

There’s 6 of us and we are definitely friends, but without the main friend we don’t talk much. He’s moving in with his girlfriend soon so he’ll be less active. Down to 5 (I don’t think it’s a bad thing at all, I’m very happy for him, I just still recognize that ONE downside) His girlfriend is also in this group she’ll be less active, down to 4. One of them is shipping out so, for the better part of a year, down to 3. Another member is going to study abroad for a year, down to 2. This guy is kinda cool but we aren’t close at all (definitely friend of a friend) down to 1. Just ME

Finally, “relationship”. I don’t have a partner. I’ve talked to a few people on dating apps but no one wants what I want. Most only want a hookup, or just to chat, or drugs. Out of the few I’ve talked to, one ghosted me, one was a scam, and one was confused when I said I like her. 

I’ve had a clear image for years of me being happy, with a wife and family. And in that image I’d still have my friends, at the very least there’s some overlap. 
Now it feels like any chance of that happening is gone. 

I can’t find someone who wants this life no matter how hard I try, I barely have a relationship with my parents, and I can feel my friends moving on to better things.

I’m not ready to be alone. It’s gotten so bad where if I even see a meme remotely referencing the concept I breakdown. 

I know everything I’ve said about my friends is selfish but it’s how I feel. There moving in to the next part of their lives while I’m stuck here, no job, no school, clinging to them as long as I can.

Please don’t tell me how I “need to grow up” or I need to “stop being so selfish” I  know this already. I hate myself for the situation I’ve put myself in, but I’m in it and I can’t get out.

TL;DR I can see every meaningful relationship in my life move on without me and I can’t catch up.",lonely,I’m coming really close to being alone and I can’t stop it,2022-04-17 19:37:55

As my final year in college is ending, I've been reminiscing about all the friends I've made in the short but meaningful years. In combination with the pandemic and just preparing for the real world after college, naturally we all started drifting in different directions. 

I still have friends and who's to say that we won't be in touch in the future but in this moment, the lack of emotional connection is where it really hurts. My roommate (whom I was and still am very close friends with) is moping around trying to figure out what to do after graduating has not spoken to me in a couple of weeks. My other friends that I have invited out to grab food is too busy and even my long distance boyfriend has been distracted with MCAT studying for the past few days. I haven't seen my family in months.

I go to the gym everyday, I try to go to bed early. I socialise a lot

This week I’ve met an old colleague, yesterday I went out with another old friend and on the day before I met a new girl in the area and we chatted and spent the whole day together

Despite all this socialising why do I still feel so lonely and anxious ? 

I have some tasks to get done which might help. I’m not super occupied in my job as it’s a bit slow, and we do work from home. Potentially I need a new busy job 

I’m 28 , female , live with parents and older sister. I do use social media a lot like TikTok , Instagram , Twitter to occupy myself . I listen to music on spotify

I’ve recently started dating apps, and becoming more conscious about how I look. Eg I have fat on my body which I don’t think will go away and is just a result of aging, I have quite obvious eye bags maybe from lack of sleep due to anxiety. 

I play sports . I play football once a week and socialise with them after. I have one friend I talk to from that group who is probably the closest to a genuine friend I have. 

I don’t feel I can develop any deeper connections especially living in London. With most friends you will see them maybe once a month. They’re mostly old colleagues or uni friends.

I guess I’m less optimistic because I’m at an age where people will be settling down into marriages and kids

I have never naturally desired a romantic relationship or kids or experienced a romance. I am dating to see if I do eventually feel that way, but struggle to feel attraction / romance and it just feels platonic 

My only goal currently is buy property in London but there’s no rush. I might try to travel but none of my friends are available to travel. I’m too scared to go alone as I have little experience 

I have had therapy but never found it helpful . It costs so much money so would rather not

I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. I'm currently at the end of the semester and taking 5 classes ( Just 5 weeks or so before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the summer! I'm also open to voice chat as well but there's certainly no expectation. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. It would be great to find some good company.

I used to feel like I always had my shit together. I always knew what I wanted and how to get there. I had great self control and discipline. After turning 18 I made a huge mistake that hurt some feelings and changed my relationship with lots of people. 

I started to question myself as a person since it was unlike me to make mistakes like this. It definitely was a traumatic experience. I’ve been dealing with extreme anxiety since then. It’s gotten better but I still wake up wanting to scream and also feeling like the world is ending. 

I’ve been arguing with everyone since my mistake. Lately I just feel misunderstood and not heard at all. I feel like I talk too much and I’m never saying the right things. I feel like this huge burden that no one wants to deal with. I’ve never felt I needed validation from others until now.

It sucks to be talking and feel like nothing ur saying is being received by the other person. I always feel like I say so much and thoroughly express myself. It never feels as though what I’m saying matters or holds weight in this world. It feels more like no one wants to actually hear me. It hurts of course. It makes me feel really lonely.

2286,beerbelly01,1650173814,1,"Every body has their reasons for being lonely. before anyone judges or gives advice like get out and go out it's the weekend, type of advice, I'm super lonely on this Saturday night, not like i haven't been like everyday before but it almost seemed different this night. Last year around end of September I saw a girl at work. We were both working and happened to go to the same office building to drop off some paperwork. So we caught eyes in the waiting room but couldn't speak to each other because she was called to the front to turn in her paperwork first and shortly after that I was called to do mine in a separate area. So we didn't see each other. When I finished my paperwork I left and was walking in the parking lot when her company car was riding in the parking lot about to leave. I saw a guy driving and the girl I saw inside was in the passenger. So I figured they were work partners but maybe they were dating at work, I didn't know. They had the window down so I waved and said excuse me. I was nervous and just blurted out to the guy driving ""is she single?"" it's still kinda cringe to think about how stupid of a question that was. Smh. Maybe I was trying to come off respectful to the driver in case that was his girl/wife but I noticed in the waiting room she had no wedding ring. But still that's not a good way to ask that. So anyways I could tell he kinda felt a certain way, like the vibe I got was he was friend zoned, but he said ""I don't know she's right here, why don't you ask her"" and I smiled and they both laughed. So I looked at her and said ""are you single?"" And she smiled and said ""yes!"" While I asked her name and introduced my self, I passed my phone to her and she put her number in and then they drove off. We exchanged a few text during the day and asked if I could call her later that evening. So she said yes. Later that evening I called to set up a date for the next week and asked what she was doing and, she was like packing, she's moving back across the country back home.....in the morning! She had got a new job and was moving back, she was only my area for college. So I asked like what sense did it make to exchange numbers If she was moving and no plans of coming back to the state I lived in. I can't even remember her response because I was in shock like what the hell kinda situation is that.  I asked if we would ever see each other again or how to make it work and she told me she was not interested in long distance relationships based of a previous one. So I said ok. Well over the next two months maybe every two weeks or I initiated small talk through text, she sent a couple pics when I asked but nothing serious at all. She eventually left me on read one day after i asked how her day went so I just never talked to her again because I changed my mind with double texting after feeling dumb being left on read many times in life. So fast forward I move states to a high tourist area of the country. I've been on a journey just focusing on getting my self settled since moving so no partying, drinking, smoking etc. I'm a loner by many definitions so moving by myself was no big deal, I been through a lot of experiences in life but I have no social circle and no family in the area I moved to. I cut of my only ""friend"" I had who lived in the previous state that I moved from. We spoke on the phone a few times since I moved but that's another story but I can't help it Im just a freaking loner! So anyways about a month being in this new state, I get a new phone and as I'm transferring contacts over I see the girl name and I think of her. Of course being lonely I thought about talking to her. I started to text her but then I thought how desperate, creepy, and how much of a scarcity mindset I have, comes off to her. So I didn't. A few days later, which was Friday afternoon, still lonely of course, I text her. I say ""hey... is this you?"" She replied less than a minute later ""who's this?"" I told her I'm the guy from work that day we met in the other state and not trying to come as creepy but I got a new phone and transferred my contacts over and it would be nice to talk sometime if she didn't mind and that I recently moved to a new state. So an hour goes by and she text back "" haha I'm actually in that state right now"" so my first thought was wow. I text back and say really? That's a crazy coincidence. Then I thought maybe I texted the wrong number and someone was playing a prank by going along with my text. I told her to send a pic to confirm because that's just crazy. She replied the next day, exactly 24 hours after her last text with a actual pic of where she was and it was really her in the area. So I told her ""I would like to see you , when are you leaving?"" She replied "" just did"".... I thought what the hell does that mean, like ""just did"", like left the state, or like in a smart ass way of saying, you just did see me, meaning in this pic I sent u. I just got so frustrated and mad at my lonely life that I haven't even responded. I guess my lonely life led me to thinking it may have been meant to be because I hadn't talk to her since December and the fact she would text me back and even send me a pic.  And just the fact I decided to text her the exact time she was in my area. I thought the universe,  synchronicity, etc and things were lining up but I guess not it really wasn't meant to be.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been outgoing. I LOVE interacting with people. I even find it fun to greet strangers whether it be online or in-person.

I was quite popular in school, although I never partied. I didn’t play sports, but I pretty much got along with every group in school. I’ve never had a problem making friends, but they were never real friends.

I’m 19 now (attending university), and well… despite being outgoing and having “friends” I spend every weekend, every night, every hour alone at home.

I come back from University and poof, my “friends” are nowhere to be found. I ask to hang, but nobody EVER even wants to chat. They only like me when I make them laugh or they need favors.

I need help.

I am quite depressed at the moment, and I just wish I could have a true friend. I really don’t mind who it is, I’m not picky. As long as they are within a 2-year age gap, I’m fine with whoever.

I am asking for advice. 

Anything at all… You can tell me about your prior experiences or how to make true friends, anything! I hate being alone!

I just want to feel like someone actually cares for me, or have a friend who isn’t fake. If you actually read this, thank you.

Bold of you to assume I have friends in the first place, or at least a lot of them. I have maybe one or two good ones, and that's it. The rest don't see me as a friend, or at least treat me like one.

people often tell me so many positive things about myself. but i feel like it's because they don't know how much i'm hurting on the inside. i try to hide it and be as good of a person as i can be, and people tell me they appreciate me, that i'm helpful and supportive, that i'm a good person, but on the inside i feel like i'm crying. because if i ever show anyone how vulnerable i am, it just doesn't matter to them. so i always feel like i'm completely isolated even when i'm surrounded by others.

i just need people i can actually be myself around. if you're afraid of someone venting complicated emotional stuff then you probably won't like me. i could spend an entire day talking about my issues and i just want someone that will be nice and reassure me or be understanding somehow.

2389,throwawayp_q,1650136301,1,"After my dad passed away a few years ago I stopped talking to my half siblings along with their families. I was the youngest of my dads children. I am also his “bastard”. I only say that because for one it’s true and also they made this well known to me in various ways. It’s almost as if they blamed me for our father’s affair(s). One example of this is before he passed away I’d always see these photos on Facebook of my dad, sisters, brothers, their families all together. They never even bothered to invite me. Things like this happened often. My father and mother were both toxic. For example my mother would tell me how my father would tell her all the time how if/when my stepmom died he would be with her and we would be a family. This of course was a lie because when my stepmom unfortunately passed away this didn’t happen. She also once told me she wasn’t even sure who my father was. I was like 10 at the time. Awesome huh? A few years later after my stepmom passed away my mom also passed. I’ve isolated myself from my mom and dads sides of my family. They were all just so toxic. However even as toxic as they all were I still miss them and I’m so lonely. I often think about reconnecting with them but I’m fairly sure this would be a really bad decision that would bring just more pain. I don’t know why I’m writing this. I guess I’m just venting.

2400,Levi_Pearl,1650132847,1,"Hi, just joined this community and this is my first post here. I have always been in denial about my loneliness until now, telling myself that I am fine being alone and that I am just extremely introverted, which I am. However it wasn't until I started college and moved away from my parents house two years ago I realized just how lonely I am. I still travel home every other weekend (which is expensive) just so I can have someone to talk to sometimes. When I come home and talk happily to my parents, I always notice how sore my throat is because I haven't used my voice for so long. 

When I'm in my small student apartment I frequently take the tube down to the city just so I can see people and be among them. I like hearing people talk to each other, what people my age seem interested in and so on, so I at least can keep up a little. Sometimes I sit at a cafe on a busy Saturday just to observe people walk by on the street, just to feel a little involved. I often end up buying tons of unnecessary things because filling my apartments with things I like makes me feel a little less lonely. Sometimes when a cashier or barista is a little extra nice and looks me in the eye and smile I sometimes struggle at holding my tears in because just recieving a little kindness and contact feels so overwhelming. 

People told me that making friends in college was going to be easy, but they forgot to include that most people make friends in college at parties or when drinking, and I do neither of those. I have tried many times to get close to people, but for some reason they get uncomfortable when I tell them I don't drink and go to parties. Now I'm at that age where everyone already seems to have found their friends and grouped up, not wanting to let an outsider in. Or maybe not having the time or patience to get to know another person. I have never went on a date, never had a boyfriend, as I am scared of men. 

Does anyone else here relate to some of these issues?",lonely,Does anyone else here go outside to stores frequently and end up buying unnecessary things in order for them to replace the hollowness of how lonely you are and just to talk and see people?

2409,EERMA,1650127673,1,"Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring – it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged, it isn’t just tiring – it is exhausting. Sound familiar? 

Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small, close-knit, social lives it doesn’t mean we’re anti-social!

Not every introvert experiences anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety, though, so it is common to be an introvert with anxiety.

Here are the key signs you’re an introvert with anxiety:

· You’re more prepared than most others because you’ve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.

· You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.

· You feel you always have to be doing something – being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.

· You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.

· You’re often nervous without showing it – many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism. 

· You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight, flight, freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.

· You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‘I need to please everyone’, ‘I need everyone to like me to be a worthy person’.

· Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you’re normally sure of your facts before speaking), nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.

· You often have trouble sleeping – either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early 

Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues many therapists help people with.

My ex tried to contact me after 2 years and it fucked me and thinking about it makes me even angrier because I thought I had moved on but these signs suggest otherwise. I am curious about his lifestyle. What if he has moved on and I haven’t? I’m still here in my constant agonizing loop of pathetic. My parents are moving and I have no place to call my “own” in my country. All of my things are split at 3 different places. I am having that early 20s crisis where all my school acquaintances are getting jobs (even the ones in medical field) and I’m still here doing my graduation. All of my dear friends are in a relationship and they talk loads. I have no one to contact immediately. It all feels like my fault but it isn’t. I can’t convince myself. I seem to have lost motivation to do my regular stretches also. The weather is all grey and cold. I have this pent up frustration from no one known cause and it’s just a ball of ugly mess now inside me which is making me angry, anxious and tired. And in the end- I know the feeling of hopelessness that is going to consume me like the void of space is eventually creeping in. I tried so hard to reach this stage and I’m relapsing again.

I work out regularly to stay in shape. I’ve spent money on skincare. I spent money getting a master’s degree. I’m practicing meditation and planning on taking some yoga classes. All of my goals are about personal development and having a happy life by myself.

I’ve been lonely my whole life. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I literally have no friends. Nonetheless, I feel perfectly fine. I enjoy being alone so much to the point where I don’t have any motivations to look for friends and a partner in life.

My coworkers often told me to get a girlfriend to share good things in life. I just ignored their words. I don’t want to make friends with them, so what they said had no value to me. To me, other people’s feelings towards me are temporary. They could love me today and hate me tomorrow and vice versa. I don’t care what they think or how they feel about me.

Now, my biggest goal is to have enough savings and investments to obtain financial freedom. After that, I’ll travel the world. I’m glad that I don’t need to spend money on useless dates and friend gatherings.

Feels like beating my head against a wall because I probably need to vent and don’t have any other outlet, but in doing that, I also wind up making myself feel worse. 

I’ve probably got CPTSD (not officially diagnosed, but my therapist is pretty confident), and it’s steadily been declining for the past 3 years or so, to the point where I’m completely fucked. I’m totally isolated, no friends cause I feel like no one can really know or understand me no matter how hard I try to explain myself, my family is fucked and the only one I still spoke to, my sister, maybe the only person on the planet I actually liked, just died three weeks ago. 3+ years of therapy has only made me feel worse. Medication does nothing at all. Don’t know what to do.

So because of my isolation, I guess I just make posts to vent or whatever. I dunno what I expect to get outta it, it doesn’t make me feel better to know other people relate, and there’s no words that exist that I feel like anyone could say to me that would help either. But I still do it for some fucking reason, and lately I’ve just been deleting my posts after the first few comments roll in because I just realise that either people don’t understand, or the advice doesn’t apply because I’ve failed to articulate something properly so I have to try and explain stuff differently (which often gets read as me being defeatist or making excuses) to get people to understand and it just makes me so fucking frustrated and just compounds the isolation so much more, because even after casting the widest net I can, I still feel fundamentally misunderstood and alone.

I just don’t know what the fuck else to do. As much as I wish I didn’t, I clearly need some kinda human contact, but I feel like every time I try to find a way to get it, it leaves me feeling so much worse. I feel like the only fucking person on the planet in all ways but physically. I’m sure the chronic loneliness is heavily contributing to my crippling depression and suicidal thoughts, and overall hopelessness, but there doesn’t seem to be any solution for it that doesn’t make me feel worse than if I didn’t try at all.

I think I decided to watch it because when we were dating, I must have harbored resent towards her judgment. Love-hate, huh?..

Maybe it's helping me desensitize to everything that reminds me of her. No, songs from Heart still hurt. Or, am I just thinking that? Can I differentiate the paths of logic in my mind for longing or a grudge from their associated emotional counterparts? 

I tell myself I feel no hatred towards what happened, but I remember that many days recently, I have told myself that I am filled with hate. Am I? Maybe sometimes, but for what? Why?

This is useful information. I don't need to know everything. I can implement the effects nevertheless into characterization. Hm...

What are you actually reading this for? 

Is my heart finally hardening?.. 

Maybe that sounded a bit too edgy. Maybe my heartache is more from the vacancy than- maybe it depends on the day, but I shut it down when it's not. Ghost. You ghosted me; you are a ghost. You are a ghost in my memories, distorted and faded. Did I know at the very beginning? I blocked that out and told myself ""but this is how I feel right now, so I've got to try!"" It makes sense.

So a couple of days go with the same routine where no one is on but her we play together till everyone shows up and her friend lets call Y is starting to call me a simp for her which we all took as a joke and moved on but slowly I just felt like maybe I like her she has a lovely personality but I dont even know how she looks so I just brushed it off.

By the end of first week we were 5 playing together me, my cousin, a friend of ours , X, and Y. During one of the matches my cousin pisses of Y so much that she rage quits so I dm her for the first time since we played together and try to apologize to her on behalf of my cousin he didnt mean to and yada yada yada. The thing is that apology turned into an 8 hour chat were I got to share some of my adventures I lived in my 20 years of life and it was a lovely chat. By the end of that long chat I felt something I never felt before its like I wanted someone in my life were I could spent ling nights talking to were we share stories I donno whats wrong that feeling has been hunting me since.

The issue is after that she says she hates chatting and I am not that good with talking to girls so I end up accidentally spamming her while trying to open up a convo till one day after a week I just felt like I looked like an idiot and left her be, during this time also X and I havent been playing much due to exams and we said maybe after. Time skip a week after I stopped messaging Y we got back into talking a bit but not like that one time and I started feeling weird like I had butterflies when Im waiting for X to hop on and play together and I cant for the life of me know why. I message Y we have one of those long chats a bit about how im feeling towards X and it kinda helped me look at how stupid I am but didnt resolve the issue in its entirety but helped.

After that chat Y keeps telling me to leave her alone and I do till its night and I feel like I need to talk to someone and she is usually on playing with X and when I ask her if she wants to play she just ignores me or hits me with a no and since X is Y's friend she wont leave her and play with me and I just feel weird where I feel alone even when Im on with my friends it just doesnt feel the same even when playing with my friends is more fun.

Jump to yesterday where we all finally got to play together a large group and we were playing customs and I was with Y and against X and I failed in killing X bcz everyone ganked up on me and Y said he cant kill because you know why and that shit kinda fucked me over hard I donno what is wrong that line made me feel angry. We continued the night as usual played till everyone got off and I felt I had to ask X if she thinks Im simping for her and before that I asked Y if her friend thinks so she said its pretty obvious I kinda spammed her asking what to do I dont wanna look like that to her I dont mean to simp to her just treat it as a stupid crush or something she went to sleep so I went to X and asked her clarified that Im not and she said its ok nothing to worry about and it was over.

Today I tried to apologize about me spamming Y but she told me to stfu and leave her the fuck alone and I just didnt mean to offend or annoy her I was just trying to ask her for advice but I type a lot and fast. I keep tryingto tell her Im sorry and she say just leave me alone or I will block so right now I left her alone and when I saw X was on asked her if she wants to hop on she joins then immediately leaves to join her friend.

I have no idea whats wrong with me I feel like I love chatting with Y but she hates that and I cant seem to find another person and Im crushing X just based on how she talks I need help. Im gonna leave Y for a couple of days before talking to her or should I just leave it forever. Please help.

She consented and when i sent the money, i asked her if she'd gotten it yet and she said ""i had to fix something on my car.  Sorry.""  Ive always been the person to give stuff to someone if they need it IF they ask.  She knows this. If she had asked me, i would have given it to her.  No problem.  But without asking, she took it.  We were also engaged and i told her i had changed my mind about coming home to phoenix because the probation stipulations out there are pretty rough so i told her i would stay here and finish off my probation and come home after.

I’m struggling today and the best I could do was reach out anonymously on here, so thanks for having me.

For context, today is also the anniversary of my grandmothers death and we were incredibly close before she passed two years ago.

It is Easter weekend, and while we are not religious, it feels weird that my family is all off doing their own things this weekend. I am the only single person in my family.

I’m doing well for myself professionally and I’m well liked socially, but when I peel off the mask at the end of the day and I’m just sitting with myself alone in my apartment, I truly hate myself. I hate the way I look. I hate that I need to lose weight and cannot find the energy to do it. I hate that I am not loved. I hate how I yearn for the happiness and connection that other people feel but don’t feel it.

I feel stuck in this emptiness. I genuinely feel sometimes if I were to disappear, there would be no impact on the universe. It’s not a permanent feeling and I don’t have any intentions to disappear, but God that is a haunting feeling. Brings me to tears that I even feel that way.

I dont know how many losses and rejections i can handle. At this point, im bedridden and my esteem is zero. I find it so hard to handle. I am getting lonelier and having less friends as times goes on. I have noticed she has was replying less and less to my texts and not as open. I reached out to her to ask if she has been okay and if she has honestly been losing interest in our friendship and if i overwhelmed her. because that is what my gut feeling has been telling me and i decided to be brave and ask her, i never done this with past friends who ghosted me and stopped replying. she been a friend for about 6 years now. Now it is no longer.

She responded to me few weeks later by saying that she didnt realize it but she did feel overwhelmed and how she had many issues of her own and didnt open up because she is becoming more private and that she sadly she did lost interest but how she still cares and wishes the best for me and that she feels we are both approaching different stages in life that will make it more difficult to relate to one another.

I honestly just live life right now because I don’t want to break my only family member that I speak to heart. It’s super depressing I know and the the void that I have inside me is ever growing. 

I don’t know what it’s like to be loved honestly. I try so hard to find it, yet it escapes me everytime. Ever since I was a child I tried super hard to impress my father who honestly just thought I was a disappointment. I played the sports that he wanted me to, I gave him money, and I pretty much did what he wanted but he still didn’t show me anything. He just complained and nagged about everything wrong with me. 

From there any relationship that I’ve had I was either cheated on, left chasing them, or just felt empty. The feeling when you spend almost 2 years of your life with someone for them to say “I don’t love you and I never did” just sits with you…even 12 years later. Or when you chase after someone for over a year for them to just use you to make themself happy and be super toxic to you. 

I decided after trying dating apps and realizing how superficial they were why not try posting on Reddit to find anyone who may be worth talking to, and the few people I do find interesting, just disappear into the void after a few days. It doesn’t matter how well you get along, how much you have in common, the goals in life you share. It’s just easier to disappear on someone then complain you’re lonely. 

It sucks having to go through life like this.

2569,SeriousPuppet,1650046551,1,"Here's what I came up with. 

In the past, say in the 1910s to the 1980s... the structure of most people's lives involved:

* school
* work
* church
* hobbies
* events (holidays, weddings, birthdays, etc)

There was no social media. There were no video games. 

Now, I'm not religious, but there's no denying that church provides for social interaction. We've become less religious over time, so church as a center of social interaction has declined. 

School - at the college level, in the past there was no online learning. So with the increase of that has led to less social interaction (in person at least). 

Work - There has been an increase in work-from-home as compared to pre-computer days (ie pre-1980's), hence less social interaction. 

Events - these are facilitators of social interaction. Family gathering during Thanksgiving and Christmas, birthdays, weddings, funerals, your kid's or sister's recital/play at school, your sibling's soccer game, the school dance, etc). Have these increased or decreased? I don't know. Certainly during the pandemic they decreased though. An 

Hobbies - I'm guessing the main change in hobbies is the introduction of video games and social media which simply did not exist for all of humanity until recently.

Perhaps not any one of these alone will cause loneliness, but if you combine a few of them then it creates a perfect storm for loneliness. 

Let's say Johnny is doing school online, and plays video games for fun. How does he get social interaction outside of going out to eat?  Had he grown up in the 60s he would have been forced to be near people - that's just how society worked then. But now you don't have to. 

So my advice would be to simply try to do things where you are around people. 

Try to work around people, take a class in-person, visit a church/synagogue/temple, join a soccer rec team, volunteer at a homeless shelter, and go to events. 

You still might be a bit lonely if you can't find people you connect with. But it will make you less lonely than you are if you are isolated. The degree of loneliness matters.",lonely,Was analyzing the causes of loneliness compared to the past,2022-04-16 04:15:51

And my father has told me twice he loves me even while he continues insulting, ridiculing me and saying the worst kind of things without a second thought or a moment's hesitation.  About my appearance, about my love life and how people will never talk to me.

Yet they ""*love*"" me, they say. I don't believe them, it's a lie. It angers me. How can you say things like that to someone you ""love"" and not expect them to come to resent you? What right do you have to complain about why that person who you mock doesn't want to talk or see your face knowing exactly what follows? What nerve do you have to wave away all the torment, hardship, judgement and cruelty with a hand wave and say ""it's alright because they're family and that's their way of showing it"" I don't need nor want that kind of love, If I could I'd go somewhere far away from all of them with no way to contact me **ever** again.

2580,throwaway99108,1650040141,1,"There are countless articles on the internet on how to not be lonely and they all treat loneliness as a disability. 

In fact, from my personal experience, people look down upon lonely people. If you are lonely, you become the person no-one wants to be with. You should have already had social capital or should have been an attractive girl/guy, otherwise there is no hope for you.

You will try to attend events which are cringe and full of desperate guys so forget about forming a circle of friends. 

The solution? You should have been born in a family where you saw healthy social interaction and you were on a higher societal level. So that people looked upto you with a positive bias. That’s where confidence comes from.

Or if you can pull off a miracle where you are able to penetrate their existing circle. 

Otherwise, you will always be their extra supplemental friend in their group. They don’t need you, you need them; that’s how it will be. And anyone of them could leave anytime, so good luck going through the process again.",lonely,Treating loneliness as a disability sucks!,2022-04-16 02:29:01
2581,WhatsintheBOAAX,1650039566,1,"I’ve (28M) been alone for a few years now (no friends or gf, I only see people at work, the grocery store and family birthdays).

At first it was pretty evident that I felt lonely because my mind would come up with an idea to do something with a friend, but this was no longer possible. That ‘hurt’ felt like loneliness. Basically the lack of something I had ‘hurted’ and I thought that was loneliness.

Fast forward 5 years and I don’t experience that pain no more. This due to several reasons, but here comes the rationale behind this post:

Regularly (approx. 1-2 days a week), I’ll just experience this dread and overall down feeling. I get tired and my head gets heavy and I won’t get anything done. And nothing really helps. Most often these are days where I don’t work.

Which makes me wonder if this is due to a lack of social interaction. But.. it doesn’t feel that way. Like I really don’t want to see people. I guess at times I want their approval but I really don’t want to get to know anyone. I don’t want to do things with them. Can anyone relate to this? Can the reason I feel bad at times still be because of loneliness, even though it doesn’t really ‘feel’ that way? There’s nothing else in my life that could explain that dread. Like I’m content with how I currently live.. but I do want to do something about those days where I just feel like falling rock.",lonely,How would you define/describe the experience of being lonely?,2022-04-16 02:19:26

I'm not someone who hasn't had friends, sure, not hoardes but I usually made one or two wherever I went when I was younger. School, extra curriculars, the kids who waited at the same bus stop as me even..

But over time naturally we've moved away, some people changed and I realised that the friendships weren't healthy anymore and like I feel no ill over losing my school and hometown friends because we've all moved away for so long and that's what happens. I just thought I'd have made atleast one new one by now.

My old achoo classmates the only birthday messages I get and i just dont understand
Ive met so many people, I've jad so many flatmates and coursemates through uni and so many coworkers even. I've done research  projects where I've worked closely with the same people for years but no matter what I do the friendships always remain superficial.

I'm not even sure if friendship is the word? Acquaintanceship?

I can't call any of them, no-one texts me and when I do initiate its met with confusion as to why, with the presumption it's work related.

I never get invited to any kinds of plans and even the ones I suggest are usually denied unless it's an immediate plan for that lunch hour.

No-one even wants to get a drink after work but they'll be pleasant and joke during the day as if we're friends.

And the second I leave or move or the project ends that's it, as if we hadn't spent the past 3 years working together and having fun, sharing our lunch brakes.

I just want to meet someone who wants to be friends as much as the kids I'd meet at summer camps wanted to when we were kids.
I haven't changed I still want friends - real ones where you go out for coffees or lunches and know each others families and partners.

I'm an only child who was in the care system when I was younger so companionship isn't exactly something I can get an abundance of from family though I do not have a relawoth my parents.

Is it really me? I've spent so long trying to undo the lower self image my teens years left behind but its almost reverting as the realisation sinks in that I haven't met anyone new in the past years that's still in my life now.

I went to a therapist to see whether there may be something underlying affecting my social communication skills or maybe causing me do perceive situations differently and while I'm still working with her she doesn't seem to think my social isolation is to so with my social demeanor

Rather than being supportive in seeing if I’m doing alright or if I was suicidal or if I needed help.. his response was if your not coming to my wedding then come pick up your motorcycle at my house and let’s end the friendship.

I feel like a stranger in my own house and my parents couldn’t care less about me and just see me as a disappointment. My family are actually pretty wealthy compared to the national average but I would trade all that in a heartbeat for a supportive and caring family who make me feel loved. 

I often get suicidal thoughts and although I know I’ll never act on them they can get pretty annoying after years of thinking that way.

I'm starting to doubt whether I'm actually lonely or whether I'm making myself be sad and lonely just for that comfort or that ""good"" feeling that comes with the pain.

I’m not Brad Pitt in the looks department, and I’m gay, but I am not really that into traditional sex. I am 37 and never had a boyfriend. I have a lot of unique interests, so sex isn’t what defines me. In fact I find it rather alien, almost perverse. (There are other equally great ways to get off with someone imo) And yet, ever since I was 16 all I’ve ever wanted is someone to call me their boyfriend. I think it’s a belonging thing, that desire to finally have someone want me enough to claim it publicly, and I think it strikes a chord with my lack of acception in high school that has just somehow stayed with me. I’ve lead the loneliest life of anyone I’ve ever met. I figured this out during the first lockdown in 2020 when people were losing their minds over being isolated for a few weeks, and it didn’t change a thing in my life. That’s when I realised my loneliness wasn’t normal.
Because I don’t utilise sex as a weapon to get what I want, I don’t think I will ever find a boyfriend tbh. I could settle for someone I’m just not that into, for the sake of it, but that would make me feel lonelier than I am.

Here I am at 20 in university learning how nobody really is in control but how we are all meant to be obedient suit and tie workers for suit and tie morally bankrupt, greed fueled overlords, work the 9 to 5, go back ""home"" exhausted and ""decompress"" by drinking, eating junk food, consuming pornography or going to get wasted at a bar and have meaningless one night stands. Off to living a uniform and unremarkable life that could be replaced at any moment by absolutely anyone, the older you get, the more strings you have attached to you, the more you have no other choice than to comply and abandon everything that makes you YOU. Friendships become shallow, everyone walks in the same direction and I no longer feel any interest in any human being.

I keep myself pretty busy through out the day and even then, I catch myself checking my quite iPhone, hoping for a text message, a snap, a notification from an old friend or anything that can bring some sense of excitement into my day, haha. Having said that, if you’re up for (possibly) making a new and great friend then you better say something 😉 (yes, I do use emojis on Reddit), and unlike a lot of guys, I love cats, maybe a little more than dogs… I automatically trust and find myself way more engaged with cat people… I don’t know, call it bias. Lol. Aside from that, love books, traveling, good food (who doesn’t). I’m still a GOT loyal fan, despite the last season finale. I enjoy a lot of international films, and most, if not all of  Guillermo Del Toro’s works. 
What else shall I say, since I feel like I wrote a lot lol. Oh, lastly, not that it matters, I’m 6’1” tall, black hair, olive skin, greenish eyes, been told handsome humbly. 

I wanna take a second to thank you if you’ve made it down this far! Please don’t be lazy and send that typical, boring, weak “ASL” or “sup” type of messages lol

When I get complimented and they mean it, I get overloaded and my eyes start to tear. That's how pathetic I am. If a girl compliments me and looks into my eyes while doing so, I don't know how to process them then break down. It's past 5:30am and the sun is about to come up. I've been sitting here all night thinking about the nice things my therapist said to me. I can't help but think she means every compliment. She looked me in the eyes and came across as genuine. They weren't generic compliments either but ones that were custom to me so they weren't nice or sweet. You can use those compliments on anyone.

Don't ask me why, for I don't know. It's not like I trust women more than men- there's a lot of liars in both departments.

I like:

-Metal, but also music from the 1920s-1960s, and I like synthwave..

-Anime

-D&amp;D (never got to play it)

-Xbox (Halo and NieR are my favorite game franchises)

-3d modeling, 2d art, writing

-I'm aspiring to create a webcomic/manga (my art style's a bit similar to AOT and JoJo- please don't spoil anything, though)

2641,nullmage,1650004276,1,"All I do is sit in my apartment and it's scaring me. I realized it was getting pretty bad when my car and motorcycle battery were both dead from not being used in weeks/months. I recently graduated from college and after a year of job searching I got an offer in a new city in a different state. I was extremely excited at first and I still love my job and bosses but a little bit after moving there, the office went completely work from home again and now I'm realizing I'm basically a nobody. I've been WFH for about 6 months now and I think the isolation is messing with me. My will and drive to do literally anything even work is suffering greatly. And now I've been getting extremely self conscious about how little I leave my place.

Because of world events, and following advice from my parents before they moved back to their home country, I stocked up on everything. So now when when I try to step outside I can't help but think of it as a waste of time/money or pointless, and I have to lie to myself or psych myself up to even leave my front door to just get food from down the street instead of cooking for myself with what I've stocked.

My social life is in shambles. I feel like I completely missed out in college from just studying all the time, having never really partied or made any friends. My only two friends in this state are rarely available to hang out. I love them both but I get the feeling they've both independently pocketed me out of the rest of their social lives, something I feel like has always happened with any of my friends. My other friends out of state when they talk to me I can't help but always feel jealous. Everyone else seems to have lives so when they post online or text I get sad and feel like a creep/weirdo for never having anything going on, and that they're just talking to me out of pity. I feel like normal people live in a completely different world than me and I don't even know what they do in an average day. I tried tinder and dating apps for a while too but I was quickly made aware that it's a completely different experience for someone like me vs my friends so I deleted those before my self esteem dropped even more.

And now I feel like I lost all my motivation to enjoy things. When I try to pursue a hobby or interest I quickly stop trying because I feel like it's a waste. And knowing how much commitment I'd have to put into something before I can even feel remotely proud of my abilities quickly disheartens me.  Even video games feel extremely boring to me these days. It seems like all I do is buy stuff to get bored of it almost immediately. I know I should be going out and trying to go to meetups and bars and the like but as soon as I find something interesting I think myself out of wanting to pursue it.

So yeah, I've turned into a complete shut in and I don't even really know if I can get myself to stop being one anymore.

 I've always had a hard time making friends because of how socially anxious I am, I currently have 2 actual friends, the same Ive had since the first year of high school. It's been 7 years and I haven't made any new friends since. You guessed it, if I can't make friends I can't get a relationship either, I don't have the social capacity to do so I guess.. I know it's not because of my appearance, I think I'm generally considered attractive, and I always try to look my best at any moment because it helps me feel more confident. But while I'm alright in looks I lack in social skills. I feel so incredibly lonely and I know I can only blame myself for it, I wish I was normal, I wish I could be confident when I talk to people, and I wish people would try to get to know me. But they don't, and I don't blame them.  
 I feel like I'm going to waste my youth, while everyone else around me is having fun, going at partys, going out with their friends. Having a relationship. Telling me all those stories about their lives and how cool and interesting it is. I'm sitting in my bed thinking about how pathetic I am because I don't know how to live properly. I know something is wrong with me, I'm currently in the process of getting checked for Asperger's, I have ADHD, severe social anxiety, ptsd, cptsd, hypersensitivity and ocd. And all that mental health trash is what's ruining my life, I just wish I was normal...maybe then I would have a chance. I feel trapped in my own head. I want to be someone else.

What made me write this post. I had planned a night out with my two best friends tomorrow. And I just found out they are at a party with a bunch of friends. And they cancelled our night.

I’ve put myself out there ever since any semester started and I haven’t met any new friends or anything. On the other hand my roommate made plenty of friends and I get jealous that she has made friends with so many people while I haven’t made any since I’ve been here. I feel so lonely every night sometimes I want to cry myself to sleep but I push myself harder. I have a few friends back at home that I haven’t talked to since I’ve graduated from high school but I do have a best friend but I can’t really talk to her about any of this stuff.

2653,Depressed_Immortal,1649999254,1,"I grew up in a strict household. Even at the age of 16 I had no social life outside of school. My friends would hang out daily and I would be able to join once every month or two. After high school I wanted out of the house and got accepted into a scholarship abroad. Bear in mind I accepted the scholarship without my parents’ support or approval. 

I made a lot of friendships out there, but none that lasted. I had to transfer out of college to be closer to my parents as their health wasn’t as good as before. I visit them every couple of weeks now but my old friends no longer care for my presence when I’m in town anymore. I spend days on end without receiving a message or a call from anybody, even my family. I pity myself and I grow sad every passing day, every passing exam, every long treacherous drive home, every sleepless night. 

I never experienced having someone to talk to daily since I moved out. No one to connect with. No one except for one. Unfortunately it also didn’t last more than a couple months and it has made me even more aware and self-conscious. This post has been a long time coming. I feel like I’m slowly falling into depression. The only person that alleviates these feelings is a sibling who is constantly busy, that I barely meet.

But my immaturity and stubbornness won and i fell head over heels for her in love. She's the most fun person ever and we share a lot in common, i get lost in her eyes when she talks passionately about cars and stuff (we are in an auto-mechanic course). I thought this was nice because after my last experience with love i promised myself to not get into anything serious ever again and all my friends said that was sad and i had to get over that phase, i would randomly just sit there and smile just thinking about her. Being around her made me happier than anything else. This went on for a few days, but something triggered my anxiety and now i cant be around her, i cant talk to her, i cant look at her. When she talks with other guys it breaks my heart, when she has banter with other guys and i cant even talk to her, it kills me. I now realize that i still have baggage and i am not in the condition to be having these feelings for anyone, i dont even know if i will ever be ""normal"" again. She is such a pure soul i would never want to drag her into the mess i am.

2666,bnoipk,1649996735,1,"My life since early childhood has just been hardship after hardship, tragedy, anxiety, and depression. I’m 24, female, probably autistic, severe ADHD and social issues. I was bullied from preschool to my junior year in high school, never fit in because I was “weird” (despite not actually looking outwardly weird or acting weird, just was quiet and unattractive.) I have not maintained any relationships from childhood or school. I isolated myself at the age of 14 because I was having medical issues that left me in constant pain, plus my home life was bad, and it stunted my social development in a way that I haven’t been able to recover from.

In high school I told myself college would be better and I’d make cool friends who wouldn’t judge me, but I never found any. The whole “move away and start over” thing is pure fiction because of social media. People who would give me the time of day to speak to would suddenly ghost me or treat me differently once they got an inkling I was a loser in school because I didn’t have socials. I would have sooner cut off my own foot than admitted to anyone the real reason I didn’t have it was because in the short span I did a boy from school posted a picture of me in a swimsuit for about a hundred kids in my class to mock. Or that I almost attempted suicide because of it and don’t trust social media now. 

My romanticized idea of the “fresh start” led to this timeline:

1- start at university #1, get roommate who called me a loser to all of our neighbors and got them to partake in bullying me until I moved.

2- Still don’t make friends because people find me strange despite me being nice. Anxiety worsens because of this.

3- give up and move home.

4- go to university #2, rinse and repeat but add life difficulties like unemployment and being broke. 

One of my 2 friends (my sister) killed herself last year and I’ve struggled to cope. My anxiety is horrible. I barely leave the house. I just don’t have the energy to even try to socialize anymore, or have one to do it with. Even if I did, I have nothing to say anymore since all of my time is spent sobbing or laying in bed trying to convince myself I don’t want to die. Hard to make friends when you can’t be optimistic or fake smiles or fake conversation. The words aren’t there, the ability to connect isn’t there, I’m just a husk and everyone I meet sees it.",lonely,"I spent 5 years trying to get reintegrate, I want to give up.",2022-04-15 14:25:35

2671,Mindless-Ad589,1649995503,1," I just wish someone would love and accept all of my sides. I wish someone could just genuinely care about me, I don't even care if it's a friend or a partner. I'm such a people pleaser, I change my opinion based on what other people think and change my personality and attitude of what satisfies that person. Whenever I try being myself just remotely a little, people always call me 'weird' and make me feel like shit so I just shut down myself from others. Everyday I cry because I'm so ugly compared to everyone in my school, whenever someone comments about my looks it's always making fun of how ugly I am and even though I laugh it off, I just feel like I want to crawl into a hole and die. I'm too pathetic to stand up for myself, and I always laugh everything off so everyone thinks it's okay. Once I think I made a nice friend, they call me ugly, constantly call me 'weird' and 'different' which actually makes me feel like shit so much. I had a best friend and when I finally felt like we were like soulmates, she gets a boyfriend and new friends and spends more time and looks so much more happier with them than me, and god I get so possessive and jealous. And it's completely my fault- I'm just so terrified of her abandoning me because she's the only one who I felt like she understood ME, and I guess I just became a lot more clingier..which made her avoid me on purpose. I don't know why I'm like this, I don't know why I get possessive so easily, I'm so lonely and I wish SOMEONE could only pay attention to me which is so toxic but I can't help it. Whenever someone gets close to me, I somehow push them away and it goes back to square one.  Recently, a lot of times I've been wondering if I'm really a girl but my parents have made it obvious they are transphobic, so I've just kept all of those feelings bottled up. My relationship with my parents are so complicated- sometimes my mom is so nice and loving towards me, but when she gets angry she becomes a whole different person. I always promise myself not to forgive her when she shouts and blames everything on me and make me feel like shit, but I always let everything slide over and over again. My dad always argues about everything with my mom, and there have been times where they made each other cry, I just wish they would divorce but at the same time I don't want my family to grow apart. Me and my twin brother used to be close, but now we just don't talk anymore. I have suicidal thoughts a lot of the time which is so stupid because my situation is not honestly that bad compared to the stuff other people go through, but I just can't ever do it. Whenever I'm always at the top of a building, I seriously consider to jump off but I'm too much of a coward to ever do it. I can't imagine the guilt and pain my parents would be in. I never tell anyone I know about my feelings...I don't want to be seen as weak and vulnerable, but it's much more easier for me to talk online.

It's a struggle but I'm earning more money. This year I will see a therapist or psychologist. I will receive the help I've wanted for so long. I'm trying hard to love myself and it's been going better. I genuinely can finally stand to be proud of myself in all that I've done. All the hurt I've fought to be here where I am. 

I still struggle with the drink but I'm getting there. I'm drunk right now. I'm here to yell into the void and wax poetic when I feel pain heavy in my heart and have no where to go.

I've recently finally accepted and have become proud I'm a bisexual woman. I'm planning on coming out to my homophobic mother. I'm ready for the rejection. It's on her not on me if she cannot accept me. I could pretend to be straight and never tell her but I'm done lying to myself. I refuse to lie about myself to anyone anymore. 

I've never felt so loved in my life more than I have in the last couple of months. My partner has been doing a lot for me and I appreciate his efforts. I try to do what I can for him and he always appreciates what I can do. 

I guess it's time to yell about my pain huh? I still hurt. I don't know why. Maybe it's the years of neglect and abuse I've endured as a adolescent. The abandonment that haunts me still. Maybe it's the episodic anxiety attacks that plague me. Maybe it's that I never know peace quiet as well as when I reach the bottom of a bottle and the memory fades. 

I don't have nightmares as often anymore. They're rare. The ones about my abuse in my adolescence. They happen on occasion but I've mostly erased those memories. Tried to anyway. I hardly remembered the face of my step father who was the primary abuser. I can still hear his voice clearly though. I'm forced to endure his company once a year when I see my family in Colorado. He doesn't strike fear in me anymore, just anger and a sort of loathing. 

I don't sob as often alone for no reason. Those are rare, unless I fall into a particularly bad anxiety attack. I get anxiety when I'm left alone to my more negative thoughts for too long or when I feel aimless. I use podcasts at work to keep my wondering thoughts at bay. It works wonders. I try to keep myself busy so I dont feel aimless. Especially since I've been working more.

People yelling at me don't trigger my anxiety anymore, neither does people cleaning without my help. Loud noises also dont trigger me anymore. I don't say sorry for every little thing. I'm not sick anymore. 

I harbor hate for myself still but I also love myself. I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. The work I've put in. This is just a begging. I'm still working to a better me. One I won't loathe casually anymore. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I deeply appreciate it. I hope whoever you are you feel less lonely today. I love each one of you who reads my woes.

I was like a topper as a kid and  in high school, good in sports, a bit better than average looking, middle class, a little shy but still friendly and playing, enjoying with everyone, even talking to girls was simple. But some things/incidents (sort of betrayals) happen throughout high school and also my best friend moved to another city. I was getting distant from everyone little by little. I realize that The people who I thought were my friends they were just with me when they need something and don’t bother to talk with me when i am not needed, some were even jealous of me. I was too naive as a kid, and all of this suddenly hit me and i got introverted and distant from everyone. 

I didn’t even had a phone until i was 16, so i had no way to get in touch with my best friend, I cried for the first time and was very sad cause we were like brothers. I never got the chance to talk to him again and never had best friend after that with whom i can share my feelings.

My interest got different from others and at some point i was shut in, and now it became a habit. It’s not like i hate it or something- it’s better to be alone than with fakes, i like drawing, reading, sports, peace and nature.

Some months ago, I met this guy online, in a discord group chat, he's 5 months older than me, we started chatting, and turned out he was from my same country, he lives in another city, just 4 hours drive. He gave me so much affection that I was needing at that point bcz my parents were fighting everyday and I was failing classes due to my self harm addiction. 

Anyways we became bestfriends quick, followed each other everywhere, started voice calling and then video calling every night for hours, and it might just be stupid of me, but at this point he knows everything about me, and I know very few things about him which is clearly a red flag. I just loved his attention at first bcz I never got that from anyone before, we both have also confessed that we have a crush on each other. 

But this month he suddenly changed, he's rude for no reason, he gives late replies, he threatens to expose me, he also says he'll come and get me one day, he have started to make bad comments on my body, but I've developed such a deep bond that I just can't block him, at one point I begged him to block me but he loves to see how vulnerable I am so he wanna keep me.

Tonight when we texted, I felt he was playing with my emotions, first we had an argument, then we were being cute and flirty, and then an argument again, our arguments are just him attacking me for fun, then he demanded to voice call, I said no, but I did it, he was silent half of the time, only I was the one speaking random topics, and then later he  leaves with such fake cute replies. 

I feel so alone, I can't tell this to anyone, these things are a taboo here, my parents will kill me, I know I won't be able to ever block him or let go, and I know his feelings are also genuine though he's not expressive or romantic at all, but I don't wanna hurt him. It's very toxic, and since I've met him, I've been cutting a lot more too, which again I can't tell anyone, it's a taboo. He also knows I'm bisexual, and he knows I'm an athiest, that he is too, which will again get me honour killed in this country.

It came after months of progressively worse days, ending up with lots of call-outs and plenty of attention from HR trying to get me to go see a doctor. At a very low point, trying to push myself “just another week” until my appointment, they call me on a day I took off to give me a disciplinary hearing. Same day as I was discussing options with the same lady to see what I could do to overcome the oppressing feeling of just trying to get out of bed in the morning. Her and my boss, explaining everything in excruciating detail of how what I was doing was wrong, and behavior needed to be corrected, etc. 

It felt like such a goddamn betrayal, and I ended up leaving the company that afternoon. I understand my personal problems aren’t theirs to solve, but even a modicum of empathy and understanding could have *so easily* helped the issues I was having.

And yet, I end up applying everywhere else I can, receiving little to no replies at all. Despite my experience, despite my skills, nobody is interested in me anymore. I burned away the only support structure I had left, and now I’m floundering with barely enough to cover my rent. No friends or family with any ability to help me, since I’m the one they rely on.

Recently i started getting invited to some parties, which sounds great, but for some reason there is not even a single thing to talk about with others.

 At one of these ""garherings/parties"" i met one of my old schoolmates from elementary school. Back then i really did not care about her, but when i saw her after all those years i felt like i have fallen in love with her (Or atleast i think. Im extremely unexperienced when it comes to relationships. I have never had gf nor felt something like that to someone else before). She is incredible, and in some ways really similar to me. She even asked me to go out with her a couple of times. But thats it. Nothing more. (I feel like she was bored or something). I have never told her what she means for me. I think she got a boyfriend.

2717,cyanidesister,1649977671,1,"24F. Just getting this off my chest. I guess this is a typical wasting-my-youth-type post. When I felt like a loser outcast in my adolescence, my age was a reassurance. But they don’t really tell you about how brutally time speeds up as you get older. I obsessively take care of my skin and calorie-restrict and exercise and stand glued in front of reflective surfaces, searching for wrinkles and folds and jowls whenever the opportunity arises. Even as a child I was terrified of getting older, and it wasn’t until much later that I finally understood why – deep inside I already knew how my life was going to play out.

I’m probably turning into an alcoholic. It truly dulls the pain. I’ve spent most of my conscious life depressed or maybe even personality disordered. It’s made me into a walking corpse. It’s like lobotomy but I can still cry, almost every day. Medication is useless. I have no idea who I am, what I like, why I’m here, what I really want. It’s a very hard state to keep covering up and it creates an irreconcilable rift between you and everyone else.

I was a high achiever but now I’m more of a has-been. There’s one friend I see semi-regularly but I feel that we’re on the verge of growing apart. I’ve lost touch with most people from university; many have gone back home, and unfortunately the status of PhD student isn’t high-powered enough in our transactional circles to merit the effort of rekindling friendships. People don’t reciprocate if they don’t stand to gain much, and there’s no denying that a kind listening ear or dribbling fountain of wisdom doesn’t really make the cut. In any case I no longer connect with people and don’t have much to say to anyone anymore.

The most important lesson I’ve learned is that wanting things only brings you pain. I’m ashamed that the thing I always longed for most is this stupid chemical cocktail called love. It only ever hits me, and every time it does, I get kicked in the teeth. If I had glaring defects this would all be somewhat easier to process and explain, although perhaps well-adjusted people can smell crazy from miles away. It’s so silly but the last rejection finally sent me into a downward spiral. One moment you’re almost manic, with a reason to get up in the morning, with someone out there you hope to give the world to – not that I’d know what to do with him even if I had him. The next it’s gone and you’re back to sitting by yourself in the chilly night, hoping he’d change his mind and come after you. You cry pathetically but pretend to not hurt, reciting some thing or other about the freeing indifference of the universe, about death, the great equaliser, and all the things you have to be grateful for.

At the end of the session after she complimented me more, I couldn't take it anymore and said how I felt about her. Then the pathetic part began and I broke down apologizing to her for making it awkward. The past few weeks I felt shame because I realized, I have a crush on my freaking therapist. She said she appreciated me being vulnerable and we will talk next week. She has the personality that I always have a crush on. That ball of sunshine who lights up everyone around her. Her looks didn't even have much to do with it. She is attractive but she even said, it's not about looks for you. She knows my standards and they are mostly not looks. She said there is someone who is similar to me out there who will value me. That wasn't true but I can tell she truly believed it. I kept my head down for a while because of the pathetic site I was. A grown man in tears for someone who is doing their job. Why can't there be someone like her out there who would like me? I'm 95% sure she has an amazing BF. Girls like her don't stay single. She's the one you want a long term relationship with. Now I'm embarrassed, humiliated, regretful, and fragile due to the strong emotions I had today. Why do I do this to myself because it's almost a form of self-punishment. Remember, I've never had a gf, and she's the only person to tell me positive things IRL that I can see looking at her.

I’m angry at the people who have left me, who should have loved me. I’m angry at the people that have hurt me. I’m angry I’ll never be normal. Life isn’t fair. 

- Bargaining: I’ll try to be better. I’ll do anything. I’ll get therapy, try meds, stay sober. Anything, just let me not be alone anymore. Let things get better. I’ve started praying again, on the days when the tears won’t stop, on the days I feel nothing. I’m not religious anymore, it’s just comforting. 

- Depression: I’ve tried it all. There’s nothing I can do. I’ve been trying but I might as well be dead. No one cares, I sure don’t. I can’t take it anymore. I just want the sadness and anxiety and loneliness to end. I keep getting worse, things keep getting worse and I’m helpless to stop it. 

- Acceptance: I accept that there is nothing I can do to stop the loneliness, the depression. So I choose to move forward. I’ll do what I want to do. What’ll make me feel a bit better. I’ll start smoking again or drink or get high or whatever other vice I quit trying to be a better person. I’ll runaway. I’ll try to kill myself. There’s nothing I can do. I’m powerless.

We just exchanged smiles and glances. I was 23 at the time and I think she was probably in her 60's. I remember I had a crush on her. I am a woman, too. One day I was the one who approached her and walked up to her. I just suddenly approached her out of the blue. It was in between songs while the instructor was choosing the next song. I was standing close to her and I said...

""How are you?""

She said, ""Good.""

I said, ""What is your name?""

She told me her name and didn't ask me for my name.

She said, ""Are you leaving? Or why are you..?"" Then she said, ""Have you been coming?""

I said, ""Yes.""

She said, ""I did not come for four days.""

I said, ""I did not see you the other day.""

She said, ""I'm always late.""

Then I didn't say anything else and I walked away.

What did she think of me? Did this whole conversation creep her out? Was she put off by my random approach?

I was never taught how to socialize or flirt or how to be attractive. My dad didn’t think that was as important as going to work. He didn’t think boys should be concerned with a social life and we should be focused on work. 

I never got to go to the parties of hang with friends on the weekend. I never learned social skills and never built up any self esteem or confidence. My dad was always quick to anger and violence so I’ve always been a nervous wreck. I’m afraid of everything and everyone. I spend about 30 minutes every morning puking because I’m so scared to leave my house or that my parents will need me. 

This is where the problem is. No one is attracted to the guy that’s so terrified of the world that just leaving the house is a major fear to overcome. No one wants the soft emotionally damaged dude. I got more baggage then an airport on thanksgiving and nothing that is mine. The only thing I have going for me is my parents money because honestly I don’t think I’ll ever make something of myself.

I feel alone sometimes, but as I have aged I figured that what I truly envy when I see others being together is the the moments I see. I don’t feel like these moments are true reflection of what I envy. These moments are fleeting and not a true sign of who these people truly really are all the time. I build them up to be consistently like that moment I envy. If i get a chance to see these people interact with each other more. Sometimes that envy fades as I see the flaws. 

Their has also been times when my envy has increased. If I see something deeper in their relationships it grows. It made me realize that I don’t just want to be with someone. I want that person to be someone I like and I do not mean just as a partner, but as friends as well. 

It always saddens me that I can’t connect with people easily and thus I feel alone. I more saddened by that thought than I am feeling lonely. I want shared real experiences with people I like to be around. I don’t see a future where that is possible due to my circumstances.

Yes I know sadness and loneliness can be the same thing. But I feel the loneliness isn’t there all the time, as I experience good moments even though they are fleeting. My thought is ever present though. 

Hopefully that made sense and people can relate to this in someway.

 I tried my best but I failed , I mean there's no meaning of ""I tried my best"" if I failed . She was probably my best friend too , I used to message her in every 2-3 hrs . We met in February and in these two months we became very good frieneds , like I have friends whom met 5-6 months ago but we are not  that close .Her parents are toxic so idk what is gonna happen /happened .

Probably she's fine , probably I'm just over thinking , probably Reddit suspended her account temporarily so that's why i can't message her .

I have an anxiety disorder, and not sure if it's related but I have a major issue with freezing under pressure and I have test anxiety where I sometimes completely blank during the exam

I just did poorly on a calculus exam and Ive been crying about it because finals are in 5 days. 

I called my husband, he asked how was the exam, I just said I've been crying, I feel like I didn't do well but we don't know yet and there is still chance to make it. He seemed irritated. I apologized (because he has the attitude that I've disrupted him and caused inconvenience for him) and he said to not apologize to him. 0 comfort.

2780,Awkinox,1649938371,1,"Okay. I'm 17 years old, a cisgender female, and heterosexual. For my entire life, I have never been in a single relationship. Never even had a first kiss. The only one that I can barely remember being in was an entire freshman-senior situation, where we didn't even do anything special from when we were friends and it ended after a week because I was 15 and he was turning 18 and he actually had the sense to not date someone that young. So I don't even count that. But at this point, I'm desperate. No matter who it is, via real life or online, if it's a male and they're nice to me, I'm attracted. It's gotten to the point where when it's a random stranger that I bring up the question ""I wonder what he's like as a boyfriend"" in my mind. Every night for a while now I have been laying down in my bed, ""cuddling"" with a huge stuffed bear under a weighted blanket just to try and feel like I'm being held and given affection by someone. Even sitting next to complete strangers on the bus, feeling the unintentional contact between our legs on the tight seats. The slight caress of my finger when handing my classmate a pencil. I embrace any feeling of physical contact between me and a male that I'm able to be attracted too. I have no friends in school, and all of my male friends online seem to be around 14-15, which is a pretty iffy age gap. Even then, I feel attracted to almost EVERY SINGLE GUY I have met. My standards are extremely low, both in appearance and personality. The problem is, I feel unworthy of love. When I tried to vent about this to a guy I knew online, he confessed his attraction to me. But the problem was, he was gender-fluid and planned on becoming trans in the future. Now I could care less about who you are, but in my sexuality, my preference is either cis male or as close as you can get to it. Girl attracted to guys. I tried telling him that I wasn't sure about it, but he convinced me to think about giving a relationship a try. When I thought about it, I said yes out of pure desperation. And after that, it got super awkward in a video call and ""stuff"" was shown by him, to where I got uncomfortable but played it off as shy both to myself and to him. After that I decided to just break off our friendship as a whole due to how bad the situation was. That was the first time I vented about love to someone, and it ended like that. Now I don't talk about it anymore. I feel like I have fear of abandonment as well, plus I'm insanely insecure about my appearance and self-worth. Seeing people in relationships at my age makes me want to cry. It seems like everyone is more attractive and more worthy and capable to receive and give love than me. My sister is poly, and has two boyfriends she met via online, to which she met both of them in real life. Whenever I talk about my struggles with finding a partner, she decides to brag about her boyfriends because she thinks it's funny, or maybe she actually wants to see me in pain. I'm desperate, lonely, single and insecure. I know that none of those traits are attractive to anyone and I should ""improve myself"" or ""love myself first instead of focusing on people to love me"" in order to even have a chance. I know all of this, but I feel like I'm either too lazy or too unmotivated to do this. I'm tired of being alone. Everyone has someone, even in my own house. My mom has my dad, my sister has her boyfriends, my sister's bird has my sister. Hell, even my CATS and BIRDS are paired up. The only one in the house that doesn't have someone to love or someone that loves them is me. And I'm sick of it to the point I cry myself to sleep wanting someone to love me and I can love them back.",lonely,Desperately attracted to every guy I meet,2022-04-14 22:12:51

I recently picked up this app called waffle. It seems like its a journal exclusive to people in a specific group and be more closer to them as such. Though this app seems reserved for friend groups, I want to test the boundaries of this and make a group of complete strangers instead. Right now we have 11 participants including me at the moment. Perhaps this evolves into lifelong friendships, new opportunities, who knows. The point is I want to test what could happen with this notion of a group of strangers meeting each other and forced to bond over the next month. 

Rules and Guidelines:
• Everyday there will be a prompt for us to answer and a minimum amount of post that we have to make. Prompts will be generated by participants.
• This simulation will last for 30 days and will begin on the 14th 11:59PM, PST. 
• Participants are required to at least post three times throughout the. day. 3 pictures, 3 journal entries, both can be done together.
• This will be completely blind, after the simulation is over you can then choose to exchange info and send face pics of yourself.
• Please keep it SFW and no extremely personal photos via address and stuff. Common sense, yah?
• You will not use your real name and instead choose code names for yourselves.
• If you do not participate for more then three days you will be dubbed as quitting and be kicked from the group?

If you wish to participate. Please DM me and you will recieve the invite code to join our diary. This is the last day we are registering people. Thanks.",lonely,Interested in being part of a group simulation? (High Committment),2022-04-14 19:13:58

I can't talk to my mom or dad about how I'm feeling sometimes, especially when it's a personal topic that involves them. I get that. I can't talk to my friends either though. I feel like there's an almost unspoken rule, especially in super fun/upbeat groups, that you can be sad and sulk about something for a limited period of time. After that, it honestly feels impolite to continue to be sad because it feels like you're disregarding their advice and support. So, I don't even bother anymore. But, they offer advice and support and they're great. They're good people. Maybe I'm just ungrateful. I just feel like I'm still searching for something. I'm hurting and crying. I don't know what I want. 

I know I need to start journaling again, but it gets so exhausting sometimes. I hate writing everything in my brain sometimes. Everything is so heavy and exhausting sometimes. I don't even know how to explain what I'm feeling. 

I have a waitlist essay for a school I really want to go to due soon. I'm trying to pull myself together and work on it. I really want to go to that school. It could change my whole life.

2812,rpbed4200,1649911631,1,"7 weeks ago my gf at that time decided to leave our place and go back to her mothers house that is in another country. We had some relationship problems -mediocre stuff, serious but not too serious. she decided that she wanted some space but the plan was that shed come back 1 week later. 
My best friend also lives there and they started meeting a lot. I wasnt jealous at all because he introduced her to me 4 years ago so he was the reason i even met her and got together with her at that time. 
The past 4 years all of us together went out a lot, drinking, doing stupid shit, smoking, what ever u do when u are between 18-23 so we used to be really really good and close friends. We had 100% trust for each other, at least thats what i thought. 
2 years ago my ex and i then decided to leave the country to start living where i was born. We used to be really happy at that time but things started fading for the past 4-6 months. 
Thats why she decided to go for that 1 week space. 

Ok this is where the story really starts.

She left and we texted like usual for the past days, but i could feel that something was different. She was a lot more angry, didnt text as often, used to be annoyed quickly and she met with my friend a lot. I was cool with that because ive known him since 12 years and all that i said earlier. He even told me that he will try to fix it for me and stuff. 
She told me a lot of stuff that she will come back soon, that she really loves me and wants this to work and she just needs some time for herself. ""Lets enjoy the time we got for ourselfes now and see this as holidays"" was the motto because we literally saw each other everyday and 24/7 for the past 3 years. 
1 week passed and she told me she will stay for 5 more days. I booked her ticket back for thursdays and on wednesday she said that she will be coming friday. Then suddenly both of them stopped texting me. I was so confused, i didnt know what was going on. She texted again 3 days later saying she will be coming soon but at that point i could already feel it.
4 weeks passed, not a single text was sent. She left me waiting for a full month with my brain going insane because i didnt know wtf was actually going on, i couldnt believe they could do anything like that after all that we've been through together.

Then she finally told me she will come back to talk now.
When we met she told me that she did not only kiss and fuck him, but also went in a relationship with him without even breaking up or talking to me first.
And that from the person i trusted the most and she literally promised to me 100 times that she could never do anything like that because something similar happened to me in the past before. She really gave me the feeling for 4 years that she could do a lot of dumb stuff but NEVER EVER CHEAT. She promised it so often.
They ditched me after i spend the last 4 years with building my life around her and him.
Now Im a 23 year old ""ex"" junkie, no job, no school, and she left me alone with all this bullshit for my longest and best friend. 
Im off drugs now and im trying to get my life together on my own but this slut really fucked my feelings and head and at some point im going insane, talking to myself for hours, suicidal thoughts etc. 
I dont have any friends where i live, all my friends are in her country so im completely alone and i have to figure a way out on how to deal with all this bullshit.",lonely,my ex cheated on me with my best friend after 4 years of relationship,2022-04-14 14:47:11

Yesterday, I had what was essentially, my first real date. It was a ""let's reconnect"" kind of date with an already good friend from college [23F]. I hadn't seen her since COVID hit. The date itself was fine, we had lunch, and then went to the arcade, and of course we had a long conversation, it all went good. But, after I drove her home and I took off to mine (I live in another city), I realized I didn't feel happy, instead I was... sad, deeply sad. I felt like I suddenly had a void inside of me, an empty feeling, that I couldn't fill with anything. When I got home, all I could do was sit in my bed, in silence, and shed some tears. I felt lonelier than ever before, and it was the saddest I have felt in some time now.

I forgave him, then again I found out he was in a whole other relationship with another woman who was also pregnant with his child. She was four months further along than me. I was in complete shock, I’d see this man twice a week. I told her everything, sent her screenshots, photos and spoke to her on the phone over an hour. I sent him multiple messages and told him I’d be filing for child support. He immediately blocked me. Months have passed and the other woman he had been seeing changed her profile picture. It’s a family portrait of them with their newborn child and children from past relationships. Seeing the photo literally broke me. I feel so alone. Abandoned.

When my friends contact me checking up on me after months of no contact I completely ignore them because I’m piece of shit. I constantly disappear out of peoples lives, I’m such a garbage human. I’m so socially anxious that I won’t even talk to my friends because I want to avoid awkward conversations. Having simple conversations take so much energy out of my autistic ass that I completely avoid them all together. No wonder no women has ever been interested in me, why would they be interested? I have nothing to offer anyone. If anyone was interested in me I would push them away out of fear anyway. 

I started my third year of college at a new university and barely talked to anyone all semester, I made 0 friends or even acquaintances. I know for a fact It will stay this way all the way through graduation too. I just feel like nobody likes me and wouldn’t want anything to do with me anyway. 

I haven’t talked to my dad in years because I don’t want to deal with the awkward situation of re forming our relationship. This is despite him trying to contact me all the time and me ignoring him, I feel like such a piece of shit. Though, he did cheat on my mom, get addicted to heroine and lie relentlessly all the time. Unfortunately I’m guilty of lying way too much too. 

I feel completely alienated from the world . Everyone seems to have their social lives figured out except me.

The thing is, I often feel alone but in reality I'm not alone, I have family in my home 24/7, but I must say it isn't the best company some times, I have friends to call and chat when they have the time. The thing that I think is the core of my problem is that I lack a person to open up and talk everyday about anything.  I think that's why I want to find a partner so hard.  


I understand this is a me problem, I could open up with everyone, its just that I don't feel comfortable with anyone for some reason. Telling my parents or friends that I feel sad and frustrated... its just feels awkward to me. Its like all my relationships with people are in a thin line between the superficial and the emotional.  


Not so long ago I could open up to a friend about something that was bordering me for a long time. It feel good at the moment, talking to someone, but after a few days I felt weird thinking that I shared all those feelings.  


I think that if I could open up with everyone and truly be me in every social situation I could fix my situation. I just fear that my friends will see me with another face, or that will start to treat me different. Its an irrational fear of mine because it happened before with some ex friends.

i feel like i'm living a 'supporting role' in my own life, or spectating it, and not taking or living. i've never felt a connection with anyone my age. i grew up largely sheltered, moved out of town at a young age, and always struggled to make new friends. but i can't blame that on parenting. i just wish i could go back, and teach myself to be a normal human being. 

yet, now i'm 19, and just feel so out of depth. i turn 20 in a week + it's pure dread. i feel like i've had the world in my hands and dropped it. my life has been a perpetual series of 'until then', 'eventually' and so forth. i'm tired of killing time. 

i try to get out, but seeing people, especially those younger than me - stabs a painful jealousy + yearning for the youth i didn't have. i'll never have friends to laugh and say 'remember then?', it's just all been white noise.

Having said that, if you’re up for (possibly) making a new and great friend then you better say something 😉 (yes, I do use emojis on Reddit), and unlike a lot of guys, I love cats, maybe a little more than dogs… I automatically trust and find myself way more engaged with cat people… I don’t know, call it bias.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just a guy from around California, the USA.. I love reading, skateboarding and dancing (badly). I'm an amateur at a lot of things.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on a book (for fun) right now. It takes a lot of time, and can be a really asocial activity. While working on it, I realized I want some outlet, some person to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm fairly decent at conversing. I'm an introvert. This is my first time in a while seriously attempting to make a long term friend from the internet, so excuse me if I haven't included something I should have.

&amp;#x200B;

Random facts about me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I am mainly a lurker on Reddit.
2. I love documentaries.
3. My childhood dream was to be a famous singer. Even tho I can’t sing. Lol..
4. I love peanuts and peanut butter.
5. I will never get a tattoo.
6. I use two laptops at times.
7. I have a love-hate relationship with spiders.
8. I watch a lot of anime. Parasite and Totoro rocks!
9. I love sci-fi and fantasy and dystopian. Books and movies. Even fan theories for that matter.
10. I can’t seem to think of a tenth fact off the top of my head so I'll just type this instead.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be very awesome if we became best friends that chatted a lot. :) I am so excited to get to know you and I hope that I meet someone on here that I form a nice connection with, maybe you will become my great friend. :)

Do drop a PM! I'm nice I promise.

Government programs are a fucking joke. SNAP, WIOA, UI, all of em are fucking broken antiquated systems that will leave you to rot between the cracks.

Like, they know an incredible amount of other furries all over the place, including a bunch in the area. They've invited me to two or three group hangouts, which was cool at the time, but I kind of noticed that each time no one interacted with me at all, not unless it was doing the talking, and even they would sometimes just straight up not even look at me or react or anything. They were nice to me, and I liked all of them, but at the end of the day it's like I was mostly invisible to them. I hoped that it was just me being self-conscious and that maybe one or two would message me later going ""Hey, it was cool meeting and hanging out with you!"", but that never happened.

On top of that, I've been a part of this friend's chat group basically since I met them, and all these people have never once responded to anything I've ever said or posted. As an example, someone posted this cool drawing of their fursona today, and like five people responded to it including me - I said something like ""Oh, that's awesome, they have a great art style!"" - but I was the only one who they didn't reply to. I've decided to just back off and not interact anymore, since I'm either annoying everyone or I'm just too boring to even bother with acknowledging.

These two friends that introduced me to the group are straight up some of the coolest people I've ever met, and they've said some incredibly sweet things about me that have almost made me cry, but they're sadly moving in the next few weeks. They've mentioned two or three friends of theirs to me that I should get in touch with, saying stuff like ""You should talk to _____, they're really good people, you two would get along,"" and I just say yeah, that I'll try saying hi, feeling too guilty to tell them that I already sort of have and none of them seem interested in me.

It's weird, for the first time in my lonely-ass life, I've actually been surrounded by like-minded people, which is what I've been looking for my whole life, but it somehow has me almost feeling lonelier than ever. I always had these self-esteem issues thinking I was just not worth being friends with, and I'm really feeling that I was actually right about that this whole time and that meeting these two friends of mine was a one in a million fluke thing.

Where I’m from if you’re not married / don’t have children you’re ashamed for it and my mom goes by these values. My mom and dad’s personality is similar but the problem is my mom overthinks everything + causes most of the problems in the house by accusing him of cheating or something like that and goes all explosive or gives us the silent treatment and doesn’t give us dinner while my dad on the other hand is financially incapable.. he always get a new credit card, spends above budget and then we have to live in a really tight space for the next few months because of this. My mom also hates me. She thinks I’m a bad influence is the main reason for their problems. 

Because of all this, me and my sister grew up adjusting all our life, watched as our aunts argued with my mom and the bitter rivalry between them.

I just work 4 days a week at a lonely job. I have no friends IRL, Never had a girlfriend or even felt the touch of another human being, and my mom reminds me how disappointed she is of me everyday. And all that I still can't find the motivation to make my life better. I have no desire, no drive... Nothing.  I spent last year trying to better myself and how I look and dress and speak but now I don't even care about anything.

I felt good, I felt fulfilled, I felt stable.  But now I realize how wrong I was.  I have a friend who keeps talking about how unfulfilled he is and how much he desires a relationship and he keeps talking about how happy all of his friends are and it strikes my heart.  

I know I'm 21 and still have so much time but being surrounded by it and feeling pressure from media to believe that love is the only way to feel truly fulfilled just has its way of convincing me of its urgency.

I’ve always been a bit of an introvert, but recently, it has gotten so bad I feel like I’m wasting my life away. 
It started out small, talking to less and less people until I was only talking to my core group of friends because I’d lost a few of my extended family members. Then, I experienced the deaths and rapid declines of both my grandmothers in relatively quick succession as well as a sudden break up with my semi long-term boyfriend. I clammed up entirely after it happened, I stopped going out and slowly stopped talking to all my friends. I only consistently talk with my parents and 1 online friend now.  I mostly fill the days now with school and video games, but it’s not like I get much human contact on either. I take online classes due to COVID and never talk in game chat anymore due to my crippling fear of people. 
Logically, I know this is a trauma response. I know that I’m shutting out everyone first so they can’t hurt me or leave me, but I can’t stop. The idea of being left again terrifies me so much I genuinely think I’d lose my mind if I went through it again. 
I also know that most of this suffering is self-imposed, that if I reached out and got help I’d be given it in a heartbeat, but I just can’t. Every time I try I always convince myself it’s stupid, or the fear gets so bad I can’t even think about sending someone a message saying “Hey!” without cold fear staking me in the chest.
In fact, my fear of forming connections with people is the only thing that has kept me from spiraling into full blown drug addiction because I’m too scared to go to parties or text my dealer. 
So instead I try and fill the hole with games and assignments, I stare at my phone and scroll through an endless stream of content just so I can drown out my own thoughts. I take my meds every morning and night, go to class and walk my dog like a normal person. I don’t know what to do anymore. This loneliness is crushing, it’s the greatest pain and greatest numbness I’ve ever felt in my life, but I don’t know how to stop. I don’t know if I *want* to stop.

It’s been a struggle to fully get over my ex. It’s been several months so I would’ve expected to move on by now but there’s something from the relationship that I can’t seem to detach myself from. It’s not that I miss her, I just miss the feeling I had around her, like someone actually liked me for me. 
It’s also the simple gestures I miss most like hand holding and how she would hold my arm and lean up against my side while sitting at a table. This made me indescribably happy because this is the first time a girl has ever been somewhat intimate with me. The reason she even left in the first place was because of my depression and self harm which she didn’t know how to deal with, or so I’ve been told by a few friends. 
Looking back, I was also kinda clingy and relied on her too heavily for my happiness which I suspect drove her away.
I would also be a coward and rarely reciprocate her physical affection despite how much I wanted to. I just couldn’t get myself to do it because initiating that contact made me uncomfortable and I would always make things awkward and felt self conscious. This might tie into my fear of vulnerability. I’m afraid of showing people how I truly feel to avoid being taken advantage of.
I would wake up every morning happy that I had her and I’m just chasing that feeling again. So in a nutshell, I just want to feel comfortable with showing love to someone. I’ve been on self-improvement and focusing on myself to become more desirable and further improve my mental health.

I've been having a hard time trying to make friends online, it probably stems from my anxiety of trying to meet new people and not trying not to embarrass myself. Every time I look through the friendship subreddits, I get a feeling of dread and I just give up. I don't want to put myself out either since I don't think I could match what a person is looking for in a friendship and essentially waste their time. I'm a downer, socially inept, text like a werido, and a boring person that doesn't even have much matching interests with most people. I rather not try to bring someone down with me. And yet because of that I've just been alone, scared of even trying to talk to people. Maybe I'm just not in the right place to even be talking to people but trying to better myself as a person alone is tough. I know I have a lot to work on, with self-esteem, social skills and just being generally most interesting and happy, I don't oppose to talking to new people, it's just I feel so inadequate, and I don't want to put in time that I just destroy good relationships in the end.

At this point ur whole general mood change ur developing like this happiness and this pleasuring enjoyment feeling but keep in mind it’s all coming from the person ur inlove with or attached to or like etc

So this person is making you feel like this every single day the feeling feels extremely good… and even when there not talking to you for a couple days that “happy” feeling is still there cuz you know there gonna talk to you sooner or later

Then one day they break up with you or ghost you or lose interest in you and they never talk to you again and now ur back to square one…

2941,weepingseed,1649818300,1,"the lore: I have several diagnosed disorders. I’m a pretty mentally unstable, traumatized &amp; unhinged person, but I do my best. I think that my moral compass is pretty strong, my intentions are pretty much pure gold for the most part. I’ve always actively tried to be a better person, but I get sucked into these pits of molasses. it’s hard to climb out of, but I do it relentlessly. I come out every single time, but each time I come out, I’m worse off than the previous time.

social aspect: there are people in this very world who claim to be my friend (2), &amp; my significant other insists that these people are not lying. I do not like being deceived. I treat them as I would treat a friend, but I don’t know if I’ll be healthy enough mentally to be able to consider them true friends. it makes me feel like a prick, because I’ve picked up one of them from cancer surgeries before, &amp; they have both assured me that they have no ill intentions for me (before the cancer diagnosis). my skepticism is on the back burner until we get an all clear diagnosis, because I can’t let my friendship incompetence interfere with chemotherapy appts. (there’s more important shit afoot to worry about than my sniveling feelings).

romance aspect: my significant other is a true blessing. I could not ask for anyone better to share my life with, &amp; they are so patient with me. I love them with all my soul. I would love to marry them &amp; begin referring to them as my spouse as soon as possible, but I know I am not in a fair enough place mentally, so I will be waiting. we are homeowners &amp; have been together for years, but we will not make anything wedding-official until I get better at the behavioral implications of my disorders.

the result: I have contemplated suicide for many years, &amp; began fantasizing about it when I was seven years old. my psychosis is out of control sometimes. without setting aside the proper amount of finances for therapy, I have been managing on psychiatrist appointments to get medicine alone (which I do feel is primarily working to my mental benefit, but without a daily or weekly beneficial connection I’m only working with puzzle pieces here).

thoughts: I think that part of my problem falls into the more social aspect. I can’t trust people socially due to friend related trauma, even if two people claim to be my friend. I want to be able to go out &amp; experience life alongside true friends, or even have someone to look forward to talking with on a daily level via internet. I don’t think I have many things in common with most people, I don’t think I’m particularly fun, but I do make an effort to be engaging &amp; positive at the correct times.

corrective actions to take: I would like to take better care of myself on a physical &amp; mental level, take care of my space more, &amp; pray more. I would like to learn how to trust the people who call me a friend, find a therapy program that works well with tight finances, &amp; maybe gain more open ears.

Hello, Im in college and just recently discovering myself and who I really am, and dealing with my mental health. Sincerely I feel so much better than my suicidal self, but I really do believe that by being peoples friends I take their life force, there is no one I have been friends with that has any need to be my friend anymore, I am just so apologetic as a friend, I don’t know how any platonic relationship or non-platonic relationship should go. It seems as though I genuinely hurt people by spending time with them, I make them uncomfortable and always end up enjoying myself when im alone better. I have decided to not make any friends at school (I already don’t have any), because I truly want everyone else to be happy and I know that that can only happen if Im not in the picture. I think it’s a fair sacrifice for others to be happy.

Out of those three messages, only one message was a happy birthday wish and it was for my mom. Then I posted on my Snapchat story that it was my birthday and probably got around 4 to 5 more messages. I've been trapped in a hotel room for the past 2 weeks and have had minimal contact with people because I just transferred working locations. Within those two weeks of only received 15 to 20 messages and they were emails. I was hoping that I would meet new people today and hang out for my birthday but I've been stuck in this hotel room all day. The reason why I'm in this hotel room is because I'm trying to find a house and I had scheduled an appointment on my birthday just to get out of this hotel but the plans fell through. I did leave the hotel once today but that was just for me to go outside because it was a nice day. I typically feel like I'm a pretty popular dude, but today I took a major blow to myself esteem. I usually don't post much on this forum. I just use it to boost people's confidence and to show love words needed. But now I'm hoping that people will show love to me.

2965,depressedandpositive,1649809132,1,"This is my first time using reddit so I'm sorry if this is not the right place to post this or if I said anything wrong.
Also I apologize in advance for my bad writing.

First, I want to say that this message I more like a testimony than anything else, I don't expect any particular response, I guess it's really just a way for me to vent.
To give some context, I think I've been feeling like that for a few years now (I'm in my 20s btw), probably even before highschool. I don't really have any friends left, maybe one or two on social media but I don't really believe in online friendship (I really don't trust people on the internet). 
I'll be clear, I know I'm the one with a problem here, not the others. I guess we could call that introspection, but basically I know that I have a hard time trusting people: I will always have this feeling of being a bother, that people don't really want me around, that everything I say might get misunderstood, etc... and when I'm in that mindset, nothing can convince me I'm wrong... Even when I'm the one who know it's wrong. This was the main cause for me loosing most of my friends before finishing highschool.
On top of that, I know I can be a quite needy when it comes to friendship: when I say that I mean that I'm always the one engaging the conversation, caring about the other, etc... and well, people usually don't return the favor (From what I've seen it's pretty common feeling for some people with the same problem). I know that, well, they have their life and that they probably don't have the time to chat with everyone but still I have this feeling of unimportance. Again I'll be clear, I don't crave for dozen of friends or popularity and I hate drawing attention (I hate the idea of posting this here for example), but having the impression that no one actually cares about me is a bit painful and this thought can make me really depressed, I'd still like to have at least one close friend.
Recently, I tried to talk with people in the chat of a small twitch channel I liked (this might sound stupid but this was a first for me, and I precise that I'm not so much of an introvert, I'm just really shy but I like talking casually with people), and at first it was nice, I even began to send in the chat kind messages because... well even a few kind words can make the difference (clearly something underrated today). Again I want to make a precision: I didn't do that to draw any attention, I just want to give people a bit of kindness and positivity, nothing more, nothing less.
But after a while when I tried talking to them again, people just started ignoring me. So being the idiot that I am I tried to find a non-existent reason like ''Did I do something wrong?'' etc... to the point where I even think that my messages were actually the cause of me being ignored which might be the case but is also less than improbable when I think about it. All that to say that yet again, after trying to make some effort, I feel everything I do doesn't matter, that anyway people will never appreciate a person like me etc...
I know that I'm not the only one feeling like this (that's why I'm here) and that my case is not the ''worst''. But I don't really know how to end this, so I'll try to finish in a more positive manner:
Even after all that, I still want to be better and to try to ''fight'' those thoughts that I have and to trust people a bit more, so I won't feel lonely anymore. And I also believe that all of you can also succeed. Remember that you're not alone, there are people who feel the same way as you do and there will always be people who will be there to help and/or support you if you ever need to.
And finally, learn to appreciate yourself, and take good care of you and people around you.

2969,Just-Eddie-481516234,1649804311,1,"Hello, reddit! Late 30s, single American male here.

I've worked with lots of psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals throughout my life. It's been unanimous that my loneliness is attributable to the family divorce when I was seven-years-old; birth order (I'm the ignored middle child, between two sisters); my susceptibility to anxiety and depression; and my sensitive temperament.

Then a couple years ago, another doctor put my history into a larger bucket: ""PTSD"" from childhood trauma. I said to her: if anyone in my family could overhear what she said, they would say: ""that's all made up, it's just a lie. He's exaggerating. Everyone else in the family did/does just fine. What's he have to complain about? Get over it!""

I'm not necessarily struggling with family boundaries, finding coping strategies, etc. I get along with my family, even if I don't feel intimately close to any of them. And I've had other valuable ""chosen families"" in my life. 

But, for example, I just got an invite to an upcoming family gathering. I turned it down, because this particular get-together will be too emotionally triggering for me. But I'm too scared to tell them that.

So in that sense, being the ""identified patient"" feels like a permanent burden. It will always be a curse, not a secret gift. The hurt can get *better* but it can't permanently go away, right?

If I do get out, I'm usually going to skate, but I don't have any friends to skate with, nor friends to even hang out with. I've tried making friends online, which I'm no stranger to. Most of my friends throughout my life were online. Anymore though, no one wants to be friends. No one wants to do anything that requires any more engagement than snapchat. No one wants to have actual conversations. No one wants to play any games. I've tried going to bars in my area and have been told by almost all of them that I don't fit in, so they kick me out or don't let me in.

Three quarters of a year ago I made the biggest mistake of my life. Was in therapy afterwards because it just tore me apart and I made it out of there. I have good days and bad days. Not as many bad days as in the beginning, but they are still more frequent than I would like. I just don't show them anymore because I have built a shield around myself. I keep it up all the time, but on days like these it just completely tears me apart. I just think karma wants to fuck me and that may be okay, but when is it going to stop?

Ive just recently tried to reach out and socialise and its flew back in my face 

So i work in a factory and usually dont socialise with people much, i had to take a step back to care for my wife so really just go to work in body and not so much in spirit, i go in do my job then go home.

Anyway we have alot of agency workers who come and go, this worker (F35) had been working there for some weeks, i never spoke to her or made any effort to talk to her, our paths didnt really cross and i dont make any effort to speak to people.

However last week she was put on the production line i was on, again i kinda avoided conversation and eventually she kinda made an effort to start conversation, we talked alot, the next day she was put on the same line as me again and we pretty much spoke all day, the next day she was placed somewhere else but made an effort to try and talk to me again and seemed genuinly happy to see me.

sooooooo.............. i care for my wife whos really sick, i told her this and we talked about it alot, i get really lonely most times and she was the first person in a long time that i actually spoke about all the stuff in my life and it lifted my spirits, i could really use a friend and we seemed to get on quite well so i sent her a friend request on facebook

She accepted so i messaged her just generally ""hey"" and if she was working etc just normal convo stuff

went into work today and although i seen her i didnt really speak to her but our paths didnt really cross and like i said i usually dont make any effort

i was messaging someone else and seen that she wasnt available to message anymore, searched for her profile on another account and it was live meaning she blocked me but i cant for the life of me understand why..................

2999,jodie_somewhere18,1649793410,1,"Hey, i am just gonna use this sub reddit like my notes app for today and write a diary entry. 

TW: social anxiety, self harm, toxic relationship 

In 2020, i met a girl and i fell head over heals in love with her. At that time, i was already having huge problems with my self worth and i had problems with self harm. But I still hung out with ppl and texted my best friend and all and i genuinely had a normal social life. I trusted my friends. 
The girl - let’s call her Malou - and i got together just after a few months of talking. We had a really intimate relationship and i loved it. She showered me in love basically, she wrote me letters and gave me presents and texted me all the time and i absolutely felt so great and loved.

It was foolish and childish, but we always fantasized about getting married together and living together in the future. She wrote little stories about us as a married couple and all. I had high hopes. 

But that ended quickly after just two months of dating. Something changed but she didn’t talk about it. I always asked her to tell me why she was so sad, why she ignored my texts for days, why she was so distant so suddenly. She didn’t want to touch me during the daytime anymore, just have sex at night (i felt awful, like she was annoyed by me and only wanted to have sex so i would stop asking her questions). This went on for 6 months. Everyday, i asked myself what i did for her to suddenly act like this. I was at the absolute lowest, i cried everyday, i had panic attacks, i didn’t went outside for days, i was struck by fear every hour of everyday. My best friend seemed to be better friends with my gf and with me. I talked to my best friend abt my thoughts and how i was feeling but she didn’t care. She shrugged it off. I stopped talking to her - she never texted me until today. There was no goodbye nothing. 
My gf broke up with me last year, may 2021. I was destroyed, i felt betrayed, used and so lonely. My whole life revolved around her and ik that that’s not her fault, but she never talked to me why she changed so drastically. I asked her whether she still loved me for months on end and i got an angry “Stop saying i font love you!”.

She broke up over text and said “i lost fellings” 
This rlly felt like a joke. 

Fast forward to today - i have 0 friends and absolutely no trust in anyone and no self worth whatsoever. The relationship was toxic and i always blamed myself for everything. I thought i was the reason for her behaviour. 
After the relationship ended, i went to see therapist for the social anxiety. I had a great few months with him, i felt at home and that i could trust him. But one day - he cut me off. He said that this was the last session, i did not know that.   

The insurance prescribed me another 60 more sessions and i was told i had depression episodes and social anxiety. I did not feel ready at all but he said he could not help me anymore and that i was “too far gone”. I cried that day, a lot. I cannot trust anyone anymore, i cannot talk to anyone, i feel so so so alone. I want to feel like someone loves me, but i am too scared of being thrown away again. I always think it is my fault that people leave.

We live in a world where it's frowned upon to wear your heart on the outside. A world where it's near sinful to show humility. And because of this many people feel alone. 

We believe struggling with life is a failure to live which in turn reinforces self doubt and a deep feeling of inadequacy. 

Good news though. You are not alone. Life is hard. Real hard. Anyone who says otherwise is fooling themselves. Not that I blame them. Looking at the harsh realities of ones life can be unnerving to say the least. 

In life we all experience adversity and oppression. We experience fear. We experience heavy loss and carry deep wounds that stain our hearts with burdensome memories. We experience deep pain and lock the doors to our very being, shunning the world away from ourselves. 

We have collectively created the loneliness that is bleeding humanity dry. But the truth is we aren't truly alone it's just an illusion we've given birth to in order to fake the appearance of perfection. Which is something that is unachievable.

I see you and I feel you. Although the source of our pain is different I do understand the depth of what you're feeling. Don't give up and don't give into dispair. 

Stay humble. Stay true. Stay you. Don't be afraid to wear your heart on the outside. We are all forged by the same fire. We are all human.

3011,EmotionalSupportBun,1649785592,1,"Hi. My friend posted on Reddit in r/KindVoice seeking a kind listener. Her self-esteem was low, and I was not available to chat with her, due to class.

Prior to this, she was in a week long relationship that ended badly. The other party distanced themselves while assuring her they were still interested, then after mentioning their own trauma with being deleted off of friends lists, proceeded to delete her off of theirs. My friend mentioned that she was traumatized by the deletion in her post on r/KindVoice.

A person who responded to her post said they could relate to what happened to her and assured her that her feelings were valid. They added her as a friend, exchanged a handful of messages, and then deleted her. When she confronted them about it, they blamed her for not respecting boundaries.

My friend types a lot, but she reads my messages carefully, even double-backing to make sure my question from a few minutes ago was addressed. I’ve never had to ask her to be quiet, simply because she never crossed my boundaries.

It’s inevitable though — that the other person and I have different boundaries. But my friend is not a mind reader.

The person who reached out to her and said sweet things, only to delete her in the end, did not even hint at boundaries being crossed. They deleted her without a word, after she sent three short messages asking if they were still there. “Hello? Are you still there? Did I do something wrong?” was what she asked.

She called them out about the deletion. They accused her of trying to make them feel guilty about it and replied that she should be grateful they messaged with kind words in the first place.

3025,nekoreality,1649780883,1,"I'm at the end of the line. Always trying to climb and climb out of the hole I dug myself into but it only seems to be getter deeper. I know, this was my fault. My several comorbid mental disorders make me act out, and not just a little bit. I disgust myself with the things I do and say. 

But is that really an excuse to never talk to me on your own accord? When my friends say time and time again that they forgive me and still love me despite it all, but never show that, what does that really say? If they just told me I'm a terrible crazy psycho then that's fine. The fear of abandonment would set in and I'd have a blurry few days where I type up angry rants in my notes app but then I'd be able to start to let go. 

I have already made so much progress, I slipped up recently and directed one of my episodes at someone else and I haven't been able to sleep right since. The guilt is overwhelming. I try so hard to express it in a healthy way, to express all the bad stuff in my mind to a brick wall, somewhere it wouldn't hurt anyone, but I still feel as if I always do.

Maybe it isn't my fault, but I think it feels better if it is. If I did something, then it's logical. But, if I just lost novelty or people got fed up with dealing with me, are annoyed at my autism, are annoyed by my humor, are annoyed because I don't do drugs or drink alcohol and see me as boring... Any of those things would be worse. Because then the problem isn't something inside of me, then the problem IS me.

I tried online ways of making friends, but it seems every single person stops replying after a while, or it's people who have no desire to engage in a conversation, only to respond to the things I say. It's exhausting to try so hard and to get nothing in return.",lonely,What is wrong with me?,2022-04-13 02:28:03

I mentioned this in a previous post, but i’m not ugly, I live in a great apartment in a great apartment that everyone in the city knows. I have not and still do not problems finding hookups, but all they ever tell me is how god the sex is.


I know i’m a guy, but i’m so much more than sex. I have depth, dreams, fears, and feelings. I’ve chased that feeling of being loved for so long and the want has only gotten stronger. Every day I was in college and every girl I hooked up with made it worse, and now all I’m wanting is a partner. 


I’m exercising, listening to music, working, and loving my time alone, but the only thing that’s not there is someone to share it with. i don’t understand how I can be in the happiest i’ve ever been in my life and still be so sad about one aspect. 


I think I mentioned this in my previous post, but dating apps are no help, either. Like I said I can only get hookups. I’ve even messaged girls on reddit to no avail.


I’m not an incel or anything - i’m a well-adjusted young man who is kind of coasting through a part of my life that I worked incredibly hard to get to, I’m just bummed that I don’t get to share it with someone who wants me in that way.",lonely,I’m addicted to the feeling of being loved,2022-04-13 00:35:15

The truth is people like me when I'm sick because I'm more fun and unhinged. But that's because I've lost all care in the world, it's not cool. None of it makes me cool.

When I went to school, I never met any girls because girls don't want a guy who's getting ass kickings all the time. I was autistic and weird. An easy target for bullies. I never got the feeling of being wanted by touch. As kids, you are hugged by your parents, or even your siblings. My sibling hated me. If I touched her, I would get an ass kicking. I got ass kickings anyway because she wanted to be an only child and she resented me for being born. I never had someone to hug or as an adult, cuddle with. I thought touch starvation was only from being an adult but the more I think about it, the more I realize, it's been happening since I was a little kid. Touch starvation is rarely talked about and only on forums such as this one. Now it makes sense. I crave touch because I've never had it. My therapist has qualities that are uncommon for most people, and that's why I have such a crush. Have any of you been touch starved since being a kid? You never got the attention other people got.

I joined the Navy back in 2020 and i never thought how much i would lose joining the service. I had a beautiful girlfriend, parents that would still care for my needs, a sister that i would hang out with once in a while, my grandparents that i would visit every Sunday and friends from college i would hang every now and then. But ever since i joined i basically left that all behind me so i can be independent &amp; have a stable job since where im from, i just couldn’t find a single job ANYWHERE. No matter how far or wide i would go to find one.

And its just been downhill for me emotionally.
My Girlfriend &amp; I broke up RIGHT before my first deployment, my college buddies have been more focused on work and there own lives, my sister found a new boyfriend so i barely talk to her anymore since her job, her boyfriend &amp; her co-workers pretty much take the majority of her schedule. And I still facetime my parents every now &amp; then but not having them physically here is pretty shitty. 

I just feel like i made a horrible trade. The opportunity for a job &amp; excitement of exploring the world in exchange for your normal life. I never thought how lonely i would feel giving the fact that im on a boat surrounded by 1,000+ sailors and i just can’t connect with them at all.

Ive tried dating apps too but every chick i would match just seems very superficial in there needs and every time i would offer them a coffee date or a hangout at the mall i just get hit with “sorry im busy” every single time.

Sorry if im not giving much context here since ive already told this story numerous times to Chaps &amp; my Chain of Command so typing it here feels like im repeating myself.

I would rather be able to own my memories and feel happy about them than live my life, alone, in the shadow of previous trauma.

Most of the time it isn't really special, I just remember the places and see the sights again. But sometimes it's much more than that. One of my symptoms is disassociation, and there are times when I feel like I'm reliving the memory. I remember what talking felt like, I remember what the weather felt like, I remember the feeling in my body. I went back to a Thai place this weekend and I could remember her face, usually it's blocked out of my memory, and feel the feeling of having a conversation over dinner. 

Writing about it like this makes it sound like something I think about a lot. I don't even seek it out, it just occurs to me that I can do this and I feel like going out, so I do. 

Before this weekend I took another walk, and it occurred to me to walk past our old apartment. When I arrived I realized I was right next to the place where she screamed at me in public to move all of her stuff. She just followed me, berating me for not doing enough after I had come home from lifting milk crates. This bullying lead to a spinal injury that I still have today.

That was the last relationship I had as an attractive young man, but I still had no self worth and let myself be ruined by abuse. What a mistake that was.

I am not entirely sure what to do.  


 I always feel so alone, and lonely. And even though this is all of my own accord, I just want these feelings to cease.     


I realise that relationships are futile devices--romantic and otherwise--and it all seems so superficial and you're never truly loved for you. You provide something, and when you're wanted, you're wanted because there's something about you to want and not just because you're you.  Whether you're hot as fuck, and charming, and witty, and women can't help but want to be with you, and/or screw you, etc. Or if your humour makes up for what you may lack. It doesn't matter.  


 And the drama that comes with everything and insecurity, and jealousy, and obligations. Second-guessing. Overthinking.   


  
 And I don't understand how everyone seems so heedlessly okay with the person whom you supposedly love the most having been with others in more ways than one.  


 When I was younger I had romanticised romance, and had gotten my hopes up, but we all just fuck random people from tinder one day, and declare love for another some other day and it's absurd to me. And those words that are said are bound to be said to someone else years if not months from then.     


Given my hopeless romanticism, what first broke my rose-coloured glasses was advice from a friend in a relationship.    


'Body count mustn't be disclosed; it must never be disclosed. It is only bound to misery.'   
He didn't phrase it like that; I took the liberty to rephrase.    


I realised how inconsequential it all is.  I thought to myself, how much depth can romantic love have, if it's precariously perched atop undisclosed track records amongst other things?     


And each time I had been held, or held someone, I had always felt detached in some way. I've kept thinking about how many men before me had been in this very position with the very same woman.    


Before I had first gotten intimate with a woman who had experience, I thought till then that I had been ready to yield to her despite her past.  


 Alas, my cock was no longer erect. Despite my efforts to avert this penile inertia, it was clear wilt had befallen it. My monumental apparatus had fallen into hibernation.  But in truth, I don't care about 'body count'.  After all, what makes acts more significant, if it doesn't change physicality? What makes acts more consequential than thoughts, and feelings?    
This is all a lot of rambling, and it's clear I'm sick. I just don't know how to deal with this.   


Not sure how to rectify this. I don't want to be heedleslly okay--just like everyone else--with these sorts of things. I'd just like to permanently be heedlessly okay with arrant solitude.",lonely,"I am alone of my own accord, but can't help but sit in self-pity.",2022-04-12 11:16:00

I'm recently feeling really lonely since semester 1 ended. Semester 1 was going great but afterward, I just have been feeling really down. My current friends are fun and all but there's nothing meaningful to it. I want to make friends with some girls who are Chinese, but by nature of group formation here (where White and Chinese people are the main ethnic groups, and I'm Indian by ethnicity), it's pretty much impossible for me. I don't look anything like them, and there's no one who shows any actual interest in talking to me. Hell I even created a research survey to collect data on who people prefer to be friends with and more, and the trend is that they are perfectly happy with people who look like them (female and east asian), and would feel uncomfortable being friends with someone like me. It just really sucks how I'm unable to make friends with any of them because of physical barriers to entry.  I don't know what to do, and I'm pretty upset over it because I'd like my ideal highschool life to  come true, and its unfair that it's like this.",lonely,Sick of barriers to entry in homogenous groups,2022-04-12 07:19:24

3172,ilovetodrinkcyanide,1649711303,1,"It's like I need a reminder. Why am I here? Why do I exist? I constantly feel like I don't belong. Neither in society or my body or humanity. I feel alone. I hate the fact that I have to change. Why do I have to change? I know my behaviour is bad but why wasn't I just born a nicer person? My mental illness is what destroys my life, what did I get to deserve it? Why are some people healthy and get to live their life without suicide on their mind, but I'm not? Hwy do I have to try so hard but others dont?

But suicide left my mind long ago. Right now I see myself just existing but I feel empty. I'm visible but I don't wanna be. I wanna seperate my physical and spiritual form because I feel like I am not in charge of myself and my behaviour. Every mistake I make, later leaves me questioning ""why did you do it"" as if I'm not in charge of my self. I don't think, I just do, which leaves consequences. And those consequences hurt people that I love. So naturally they leave. Which I understand because I would do the same thing. 

But after so many fuck ups they stop affecting me. So I walk in a new relationship (platonic), ruin it, and leave unaffected while the other person is hurting. I'm hurting too but for some reason it aint getting to me. It used to make me hella depressed but now that I expect it, it dont. And its not that I dont learn from my mistakes, it's the fact that I do. I learn from a previous one but after each one, a new layer appears. 

And I dont feel like human because of it. How can I walk this earth? Just hearing myself and how self pitying I am is hilarious too. I dont even know my true personality anymore because I constantly change it. I alter it based on a person Im talking to because people always told me I need to change, though with every change a part of me dissolved. Like a broken mirror. Shattered into thousand of different pieces. And those pieces are my personality seperated. (i dont have DID tho)

I cant multitask. I cant change one thing and keep the other. If I put 2 puzzles togheter, and on doesnt fit, I completely lose focus of the other and pay all my attention to finding a replacement for the wrong one, that I end up forgetting about the right puzzle. And now that puzzle is lost because I accidentaly threw it back into a pile of others. And the cycle keep repeating, never forming a complete picture.

I don't have a lot of friends and I don't see them that often. I've never been in a relationship and at this point I'm pretty sure I'll never get into one. I've always lived with my family and it gives me most of my social interactions. Our relationships are far from perfect but it's okay. If you remove these from my life I have almost zero interactions besides professional ones (my collegues are nice but we just don't share the same interests).

So basically in a few months and for the rest of my life I will have near-zero social interactions at all. I don't have any way of finding new friends because I don't have any passion. The best that could happen would be to keep the few friends I have forever but I guess we'll lose contact with the years and we don't see eachother often anyway.

Whether they realised it or not, there was a clear dividing line that anyone with half a brain could tell where they fell on which side of the line. One group they talk to every day, hang out, laugh and joke with, and do things together regularly.

But for people like me, on the other side of the line… I need to reach out to them and ask (and follow up) 2 or 3 times to even get an answer about whether they want to do something together. Or we only talk once every few days, maybe once a week. No laughs, no new memories.

Guys complain that girls rejected them and broke their heart while I had to deal with bullying and harassment I couldn't stop for years and had no support while also overly feminine girls didn't like me. I learnt to hate male attention and girly girls and make up, because I didn't want to be a wh0re like the other girls. But guys love wh0res. Not for sex, most teens just holds hands and are extremely sissy. It is like their partner is a shiny new toy. Real relationships involve sex, communication, dates, and a lot other things than just holding hands. Guys choose girls based on sexual attractiveness, and it doesn't matter if the girl is chubby or thin, if she isn't a sex doll, they won't choose her. Guys that have normal looking women are usually above the age of 25. Whxih is why I always liked older guys but after beign harassed by 50 year olds I stopped having libido all together. This is why all men are trash. 

""you always go for the hot guys"" bro, I literally fell in love with any boy that didn't bully or touch or insult me and tell me to kill my self.

I had never cared about having a boyfriend until people made fun of me for it, but not having friends killed me and made me cry because people excluded and rejected me. Guys try to compare a girl rejecting them romantically to my dead parent, and physical and emotional harassment for over 8 years is not valid. 

And no, I am not negative and bitter. Why don't you try to get told you are ugly and no one loves you, daily too, your spirit will get crushed and you will be depressed too. It is like guys have never seen normal looking women without make up and just see them as ugly. Real women don't use tons of make up and hide and lie. We all have insecurities but usually girls that wear make up, in my experience are really mean. Same with guys that play football, emotionless psychopaths.

I understand that in most situations this is how communication works you either have something to contribute or something to be gained, when starting a conversation with someone, or in some cases your exchanging knowledge or information with one another.

I mentioned I cannot spend 3 days (weekend) as the single one in the group, aka 7th wheel and we agreed for him to invite only one other couple and we joked around me being the 5th wheel now but I love my friends and I need this weekend away.

Yesterday he called saying he accidentally invited the 3rd couple but I don’t feel I can take being the 7th wheel for a full weekend.

3281,Poeticpolitics85,1649651853,1,"I say in the car knowing there was no human presence to greet me with a hug or kiss, I walked into a shell of a house that is void of love, I cook only for myself, I eat a slow cooked dinner while watching a movie where only my laughter resonates off the silent walls. It stormed the other night and there was hail but I was alone in a pit of a lonely hell. 

A wind blows against the trees as I lay alone in this house, only the haunting creaks accompany my thoughts of a love I'll probably not again experience. I miss hearing the orchestral heart beat of another human, I miss feeling the warm embrace of passion, this loneliness is as if I'm climbing Everest without any gear and I'm on my last breath. 

There's a muse out there that my poetry calls to but here I am, alone in an empty house. Today I got a Facebook notification, a bunch in fact but not a single message or text

3282,dontwanttobealone1,1649651238,1,I have so much on my mind and no one i can really tell it to. Dont have very many friends any more. My ex made sure of that and even after breaking up trying to mend those friendships is hard when youre the only one trying. Ive managed to make one friend while streaming. Shes always in my streams when i do stream which isnt very often and im alwayd in hers. Weve become good friends over the last year. And of course ive developed a crush on her. Which would be fine if she wasnt half way across the country and dating some one already. Even tho the guy shes dating is in my opinion just bad for her. On another note ive had this weekend off and ive just kinda been spiraling. You ever have some one who has ruined you from your past show up in your life? This happened to me twice in one week. My last ex contacted me over stupid shit and brought the toxicity and turned it to 11 as always. Mean while im having ptsd flash backs of how horrible i was treated during that relationship. I try to block out and forget everything from then (unhealthy i know) usually it works but seeing that name pop up in a text message and seeing how she hasnt changed just made this weekend worse. Ive tried to keep myself occupied from everything by playing games but i had no one to play with and i just ended up pretty much staring at my screen for a hour and then going to lay back down in bed. I dont know what to do any more. I hate working because the place sucks but i hate being off since most of the times i just feel so damn lonely. Laying in bed alone just wanting some sort of contact from some one. Just to lay in bed watch dumb movies or anime or something and just cuddle. Id give anything for that again. Hell id settle for having some one to talk to every day. Anything to not feel so alone any more.

Also dating apps are a thing as well so I can try those out more seriously since dating while being a full-time student I feel it's hard to feel like anyone would be interested in me in the first place.

I have realized that I should just accept that they're not in my life anymore but it hurts knowing they're out there happy without me. My girlfriend is in the same friend group and is still friends with them. I often feel jealous. I envy that she has a close relationship with with them and I don't anymore.

I also feel like I can't open up to her because I don't want to put her in a position where she has to chose sides. I'm scared that I am relying on her for my happiness. I have tried making new friends at school but everyone is so busy with work or they already have other friends. I have also tried various hobbies but nothing seems to stick.

My kid isn’t in daycare but will be starting kindergarten soon. His dad is so fucking inconsiderate. I started my cake decorating business 3 years before I even met him. So essentially my business is my baby also. I feel like I’m constantly running around between my son, cakes, running my household, cooking, cleaning. Then standing in the kitchen for hours to finish my orders. I think my sons dad is jealous of the success I’ve been having the past two years and I really don’t get why. Like stated above, I run around all freakin day just to make sure I have enough time to squeeze in the 2 hour nap (most times less than that) so I can work overnight. And it’s not like I can just get up and leave for work like he does...  no I have to carry a sleeping 4 year old to the car and then go pick him up for work just so that I can make it there on time.  I get off and sleep for maybe 3-4 hours depending on the day. He makes me feel like I’m absent, when I’m trying to rush through orders he standing in the kitchen talking to me about God knows what, with him being in the kitchen my son of course has to run through the already small kitchen. He watches me work 8+ hours on my feet and doesn’t lift a finger to help unless I’m yelling about it. Which I hate. But today was the kicker, I was filling out some tax stuff for my business and it was stressing me out because I didn’t understand some parts. made it worse with him sitting there watching me struggle and continuing to ask me to look at photos and videos on his phone and talking my fucking ears off about his coworkers. Then my son comes over and he goes “mommy doesn’t like us right now.” LIKE WHAT?! Being jealous is one thing but keep my kid out of it. Then I explained to him that it’s annoying being made to feel bad for following the same dream I was chasing before I met him and how it’d be nice if he could be supportive or atleast pretend to be. It just doesn’t make sense. I support everything he’s ever brought to my attention but the second I tell him something I’m excited about he literally will say “what do you want me to say to that?” It’s the same thing when I’m upset.

suicide is not something i would ever consider but sometimes i just wish i never existed. i didn’t ask to be created so it’s not fair that i have to be alive when my life sucks so much. if you’re not good at something, for instance sports or video games, you can just quit and not do it anymore. that’s how i feel about life. i’m clearly not good at it, i’m not playing it right, so it would be nice if i could just cease to exist. if i ever die i know my parents/family would be sad that’s why it sucks that i have to be alive.

The reason is because my father raped me for the earliest part of my prepubescent childhood for at least a decade. My mother and three older siblings took his side and decided I’m crazy, delusional, and a vindictive liar. I think they are all bad people who do not deserve to be in my life.

I don’t regret severing connections with them, but it’s been an emotional blow (1) thinking I had love my entire life but I never did, and (2) I lived over 3 decades of my entire life never knowing the feeling of another human loving me.

So a little bit about me, I'm 25 and a guy who has been in a solid 4-5 year relationship where I pretty much gave my life to, literally, gave her all my attention, love and time to which made me unaware that I was losing everyone around me. It was a long distance relationship but I made it work by travelling constantly to see them.. things seemed perfect in person, I couldn't have asked for a better relationship, we seemed in love... but as soon as things turned back to 'online' she was different. Without going into too much detail, she cheated multiple times, argued with my friends, didn't like me having friends who were girls but I still allowed her to have friends with guys even though the flirting got to me a bit (as I gained trust issues). We ended things eventually, and I know now that I was wrong to be in that relationship after all that but now I feel like it's changed me. I feel alone, which makes me think of the good times I had with her where I didn't have this empty feeling, that I want that again and miss her. I think what my mind is trying to tell me is that it's not the person I miss, but the things we did together and if I got that with someone else then I could feel whole again. I'm quite a stable person (which may be a surprise from this thread) but when it's nights like these where I'm alone with my thoughts I can get a bit down and instead of seeking friends, I just drown myself in my thoughts.

I remember when I attended the graduation of the class above me. She already knew then that I ""liked"" her. I told her two weeks before. My mom and I were standing together and the teacher saw us and she talked to us. She was smiling when she saw us. Everything seemed normal. She talked to my mom and she asked me how my school year went, since I wasn't taking her class that year, asked me what college I was going to, what I wanted to be. Then my mom took a picture of her and me together. Everything seemed alright. But then.....

When it was time for the graduation ceremony inside the church, I was standing in a pew close the center, so that I could see her. She was walking in the procession, and I was looking at her. I was so in love with her. I was floored. I was smiling at her and looking at her like the way people do in movies.

When she made her way in the procession, she was looking at me, but she wasn't smiling. She gave me this look like she wanted to kill me, cremate me, then burn my ashes. We just had this silent moment of just looking at each other, but her look was a look of hatred for me.

That was the last time she ever made eye contact with me. That was the last day that she ever spoke to me. What was that look for? Why did she look at me like she hated me? What happened just an hour prior when she was talking to me and my mom and everything was fine? Was she just pretending in front of my mom and I?

I don't act like that anymore. But still one of those nights where that old self comes back which is scared of being with others, scared of improving or change.

3379,Hmmmm1997,1649609207,1,So I've been going through a crazy divorce since the beginning of the year and I've been trying to put myself out there again recently. Last night I went to a work party. Got wasted. 4 drinks in a hour then some stroh 80 immediately after. But the reason I'm posting is because a girl that I've always thought was hot ended up sitting next to me randomly and checking on me and talking with me. She asked me a bunch of questions and me being stupid af and shy I didn't answer great. At the end of the party I ended up talking to her again and she basically told me she feels like I avoid her at work (it's kind of true because how shy I am lol) then I continued talking a bit more and got her Snapchat. When I got home I sent a text to me friend who took her and he said that she went home with a guy. Presumably for a hookup. She accepted my Snapchat request this morning and I messaged her basically saying thank you for checking up on me last night and she replied immediately. But all she said was basically of course and don't worry about being dry. She then continued to say that she'll talk to me in a few days when I'm back at work because I have a few days off. I thought she was kind of interested last night but I guess it was just the liquor. This sucks. My question is should I even try with her when I go back to work or should I just let it be? At this point I don't even know if I deserve a relationship or her or anything like that.,lonely,less lonely last night but more this morning.,2022-04-11 02:46:47

I will never manage to get into relationship, experience a hug or just how it feels to hold hand with somebody who cares about me(or any physical contact at all). I never had girl look my way and smile or hear ones voice while excitedly talk to me, I do not even have any friends, and I am afraid I will not experience any of these things in the future because of my SA and how awkward I am because of it, while others have it so easy.  
Is there anybody who can relate? Or have any advice on how to better cope with it, I kinda feel really sad, lonely and touch starved because of it.

**SERIOUS PEEPS ONLY, THANK YA!**

Hey there. Call me Mal,  I’m located in Europe and I’m in Uni! (That awful student life hahaha) Tried making friends in the past on Reddit but it wasn’t very successful. If you’re interested in building a long term friendship, based on common interests and creating funny memories, I’m so down!
Let’s just say life hasn’t been so kind to me for the past few years.. and I lost a lot of people very dear to me, but it’s okay! Let’s just say, sometimes emotions make the most rational human being act childish, out of stupidity..that’s kinda what happened to me. I voiced this vulnerable and hurt side of myself, the fuel of my insecurities and I ended up in a vicious cycle that isn’t so easy to handle. Im getting better though, small steps but I’m getting there..I know everything will fit right into place at some point though! 

 ● I am so very into baking, I make sweets all the time (most of my family have a sweet tooth but I always make pastries too!), I love jogging and working out, hiking/swimming.

 ● I play some games, though not as many as I would like! I love animal crossing/Minecraft (pretty basic, I know) but I will gladly get into some new games :D

 ● I love going out with my friends and spending time with my loved ones, they make me so happy. I have this..odd fixation on making people smile, so I’ll do my best to put a smile on your face, dummy! (Yes, you, the one who decided to read this nonsense). 

 ● I am very honest, I am also a great listener, it’s what I do really. I love listening to people venting all their worries, I enjoy helping people as much as I humanly can. 

 ● Oh oh oh! I also love gardening, I have a flower garden and I can’t wait for spring to fully come! I’m going to plant my new cuties and take care of them as long as I can! 

I’m sorry for opening my heart up from the right beginning, I hope it wasn’t too much. :,)

P.S: If I didn’t..bore you and you aren’t rolling your eyes, sighing in relief that this has come to an end, send me a DM with a **introduction of yourself**! 
If the introduction is missing, I will ignore the message, too tired of the “hi hru”
(If you speak **Romanian**, that’s a plus, I practice it and I’d love to flex my not-so-wonderful..writing.)

Also please excuse the NSFW mark, I comment on venting subreddits!

Take care, stranger.",lonely,Would you like to be long-term friends?,2022-04-11 01:11:02

Hi

Some introverts suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety.

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them.

You can find the Zoom link here:

My dad severely abused me growing up, held me captive, sexually assaulted me night and severely physically abused me every day. I ran away when I was almost 18. He always told me that I was intrinsically unlikeable and that no one would ever like me. Well, I guess he is right… no one likes me… 

My absolute dream is to be hugged and comforted by a girl. I’m an ugly lesbian so that is never going to happen. But every night I dream of having a really pretty girl hold me when I’m crying, rub my back, and whisper “shh, it’s okay darling, I’m here” repetitively. I’ve never had anyone be gentle or soft with me but I cry at the thought of it every night. 

I don’t think life is meant for me… what’s the point on anything if I’m always alone?

3427,Inevitable_Hope6331,1649580063,1,"After the death of a parent in my early 20s  I crashed pretty hard. I have spent the last few years rebuilding my life in the wake of the poor decisions and mistakes that I made afterward. Things are much better now but I am absolutely behind the remaining friends I have and people in my age group as far as social and economic status is concerned.

I dated pretty regularly throughout my teens and into my mid-twenties but that came from a lot of organic social interaction. I don't have that anymore. The remaining friends I regularly converse with either have much more successful careers/social lives than I do or have started families.

When I was younger striking up conversations in class, at bars, or parties was incredibly easy. That isn't really an option anymore; at my age the only option is to date online or find a club to join and the years of isolation have made me quite anti-social in those respects. 

In the last 6 months I have spent time with (excluding care of a handicapped parent) two other people. One an ex and the other a friend from high school. I have seen both of them once in that amount of time.

It's without question that I need to keep working on myself to become a person that brings something truly positive to relationships with others. It is a bummer having to go through such a difficult span of personal growth alone.

My biggest fear is that by the time I am worth dating again i'll have become so detached from other people that any connections I make will be superficial at best. The gulf I feel between myself and the people around me when engaging at the grocery store or at work is growing at a rate that makes me very uncomfortable.

3436,BostonianNewYorker,1649575066,1,"1. Social life friend lonely 
2. Love lonely.

Mostly people suffer from love lonely, those who have never experienced what it was like to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend suffer the most. 
Those people want to feel wanted and loved, they want to feel the loyalty and something that no friend or family can show. Love. They also want to experienced sex. 

""work on yourself"" ""talk to people"" ""take showers"" has to be the worst advice ever, people are just telling you to do basic stuff.

Its not easy, it's mentally draining. Working on yourself is basically isolation. Most of the time, lonely people don't bother. 

Say if you see some crackhead guy that has no talent, no skill, but is tall, handsome, has a Greek God of a jawline and he attracts girls like moths to a flame,

While you can sing, play the guitar, is healthy, fit, cqn break dance, can do all the tricks on a skateboard like Tony hawk, you get nothing. 

In the usa, you get made fun of for being a virgin, I believe that causes some people who can't get laid to go mentally ill as well. Ive seen memes of teens from the 1940s learning what sex was and all their faces looked shocked and disgusted.

I don't know man, im just writing on what's on my mind.

I really wish I can do something to help the lonely people. But all this ""text me if you want to talk"" bullcrap is not going to work. Both people, the helper or the sufferer will ghost no matter what.

I like Learning languages too. I am learning French German and hebrew as of now. Added Bengali cause it's kinda interesting and has good literature. So, why not. I am thinking about learning arabic too but not sure of the dialect. It's gonna be levantine or gulf. Suggest which one will be relatively easy 

Well I have started to read books and read a couple of books. They are kinda fun, well I mostly read it in school to pass time and no one says a thing also to improve my English I guess. You can suggest your favourite books too. I am thinking I will start the adventures of beluda 
 
I love comedy, horror and true crime/mystery stuff. So, I listen to podcast, and watch some shows. I am watching some murder documentaries lol and reading books too also I watch random stand up videos to pass time. You should listen to simple ken. It's a great podcast I guess. 

I started learning random skills, as of now started origami and Sketching. I suck at both of them. 

I like to talk about religions too
I like knowing about other cultures. You can talk about the history of your country too etc

We were meant to be going today for 2 days, for a few days I’ve been feeling slightly off like I have a cold and stupidly I did a covid test and it came back positive. I didn’t wanna lie to my friends so I told them and said if they were comfortable with me going then I still would. They aren’t. I’ve spent the day none stop crying in bed. 

I’m so depressed because 1. I never get invited to anything, 2. I haven’t seen any of my friends in months (baring in mind I only have about 2 friends anyway). All I’ve spent my time lately is at work, at home, or with my boyfriend.

Now my mind is spiralling at the fact I’m usually just a temporary person in everyone’s life and that everyone leaves me eventually (basically every friendship has, I’ve had 3 bestfriends in my life and all are now distant or gone). So what’s to say my boyfriend is going to stick around? Without him I basically have no one. 

I’m not even particularly close to the girls I was meant to be going away with which is why I was so excited and wanted the opportunity so bad. I’m never gonna have a girls trip again.

3484,onamonapiaa,1649557573,1,"I kinda had friends for the first part of elementary school. By 4th grade my autism was too obvious and I started getting bullied. I then made a best friend and had a couple acquaintances through 8th grade but everyone went to different high schools so I basically never saw them again.    

I went to a small private high school that was known for having a lot of bullying and cliques. My parents knew this and even though my autism diagnosis said I needed an IEP to help with social skills, they only yelled at me when I begged to leave. I wasn't openly bullied (although the second day freshman year I overhead about half of my grade making fun of me behind my back). But nobody talked ot me. I kind of inserted myself into a group of people my first two years but they didn't like me and in junior year I just kinda stopped talking to them and they never talked to me again. I didn't have any social hobbies. I treid joining clubs but they were all focused on school spirit and stuff and nobody talked to me in them either lol. Sometimes people would pity me and invite me places but then they would never talk to me again after them even when I tried. Taht even happened when the principal asked some kids to sit with me at lunch one d ay.    

My only hope was college.... and by that point, it was too obvious. I was too far behind socially. I joined so many clubs and I didn't know how to talk to people. It just stressed me out. I don't know how to have any conversations. I don't know how to relate to people. And it exhausts me to try. People misunderstand everything I say and then get mad at me.     

There are only two ways for me to get social interaction: online and creepy men. online is fine but it's just not enough, idk. And then when they meet me IRL they're so weirded out they never talk to me again. Men always fall in love with me, idk why, and I used to not let it get past friendship (they'd eventually just cut me off because they said it was too painful to talk to me). Now I just let them do whatever because I want the social interaction more than i care about them touching me all the time. I've started to resent them so much. I know this makes me a bad person to lead them on but eventually they'll get sick of me and trash me like everyone else. Right now it's one guy who is too embarrassed to have me around his other friends and is going to go off to get a normal job while I'm going to crash and burn.            

I'm so far behind in social skills and life in general that I'm pretty sure I'll never be able to handle getting a job. I can't take care of myself in any other way either and I'm going to be stuck living with my parents forever.     

One of my biggest hobbies is learning languages in the hope that I can move somehwere else, start over and finally make friends, but considering I couldn't handle moving out for college, that's never going to happen.

Like at this point, it's so much less stress to not have any social interaction. I'd rather just sit at home alone so I never embarrass myself again. But I crave it so bad.

He cried in my arms scared he was going to lose me, scared I would fall out of love with him while he was gone. But that was never going to be the case. I wasn't controlling or a flat out b****.  Nearly 2 months ago he told me he felt numb, he felt nothing towards me or our relationship, so me not wanting to lose what we had I suggested that we take a break so he can collect his thoughts/feelings. There was no more 'I love yous' no more sweet unexpected kisses or hugs, the love was just gone. Eventually a little while into our break he ended it. I was devastated and my heart felt like it shattered. I talked to him for closure to see why things weren't working out and all he said was good things about me and our relationship, he said he doesn't know why he went numb but he was angry at himself for it because he knew he loved me. He said that after us he was done dating. Not even a week after we broke up he starts dating a girl he would regularly hang out with. I'm happy that he feels something, that he is happy but I hate what he did, I hate her. She knew we were together for 3 years, he talked to her after me and him broke up, then she asked him out a few days afterwards. I don't know what upsets me more the fact that she went and asked him out after he went to her for comfort? Or the fact that he said yes to her? To me it feels like she preyed on his guilt or am I just jealous? I talked to him sense and he's made it clear that he ""loves her"" and that he will  block my number bc I in rage said some unnecessary things about the new girl. He was my only support system for I don't have any friends. He's made it clear not to bother him and if I so much as try to plead to him I'm going to get blocked. I haven't been to school for nearly a week due to my anxiety and a increase of suicidal thoughts. On Friday he texted me to see if I was okay, I told him I don't want to talk to him or see him anymore all he said was okay. I love him, I really freaking do but he hurt me and I'm done trying to prove, trying to plead to him to start over.

3529,Contrary_Pariah14,1649543851,1,"\[25M\] Feeling frustrated mostly, but very lonely. More lonely than I have felt previously, as I've always been introverted and asocial. Have noticed, unfortuantely, that I've been very subtly becoming clingy and needy-- almost as if I'm afraid of abandonment or something.

For some background, I experience pretty much everything very vividly and intensely, and part of this invloves me becoming so strongly, emotionally, attached to others-- even only strangers I've been DMing with on Twitter, for example, for over a month. One such person, to whom I'd grown attached, and for whom I held immense adoration, suddenly wasn't on Twitter anymore... no warning or anything. I wanted to react like that guy on 300 who's son is killed.. Like, it was that bad. The connection's gone forever with no warning and no possibility of rediscovery.

I'm very isolated. I was deregistered from school in October-- have applied to return, though-- my cat died over a year ago, and so it's just my mother and I.

I have had difficulty finding work for nearly ten years for a few reasons at least, and have been rejected by seemingly around fifty women in the same amount of time-- even though I've been told many times how sweet or handsome I am. (Is it 'cause I have no money or lack adequate confidence? It seems I'm somewhat of a cougar magnet, too; the amount of thirty or forty-somethings that give me a look is something, at least...)

So I just stay in my room all day, sometimes questioning whether my friends are really friends at all. They claim to always be busy, but no one is so busy that they can't say hi for a few minutes per week at least or hang out for half an hour on a Saturday...

I'm trying to get into some kind of coding online, but struggling. In my off time from that, I'm an aspiring musician, poet, philosopher, and short story writer.

Ten years of difficulty attaining even my first job or GF, added to my isolation and lack of drive or feelings of usefullness have been getting to me. I feel inferior when compared to my friends or anyone else my age, and I clearly have some ""issues"" requiring a counsellor or therapist.

I fear I've become toxic merely because of my prolonged isolation. I don't see anyone IRL but my mother for days, weeks, or sometimes a few months at a time. I'm concerned about my mental health overall, though all I can do is hope.

I'm very spiritual, too, so I suppose I have that. (Though the arrogant skeptics and empiricists annoy me to no end...)

Not really looking for any further connections, as, of course, I get too attached, but I just wanted to put all this out there, really. Talking with me might be good practice for me in terms of how to healthily process relationships and attachment...",lonely,"Lonely, Isolated, and Feeling Useless",2022-04-10 08:37:31

3532,BEARHUGKAIDO,1649543094,1,"Finishing the story I accidentally started on the wrong account.

I’m 20M and I was born in Bronx NY. I moved to FL at the age of 3 because my parents didn’t want my siblings and I to witness the things they did as kids in the area. I lived in Florida for about 16 years and I only knew the inside of a home. My parents were overprotective and denied me freedom/privacy of any kind. I was always bullied in school (not physically) and mostly silent. I was eventually placed in homeschooling. For the most part, the only hobbies that were pretty much forced upon me were games and tv. I severely lacked social ability so I never really knew what to talk about. Please don’t misunderstand me. I’ve had friends back in school, but they all left after they discovered social media and people who follow trends. Dec 18 2019, I moved back to the Bronx and I’ve finally gotten a grip on how to explain myself a bit better with people, but the problem is that they never stay because I’m kinda weird to them since I don’t use up to date slang like “No cap”. It’s not something I’ll ever do as I am my own person and will never hop on a bandwagon to impress or be apart of a crowd. I’m not saying people who follow trends are bad people, but everyone I meet is so quick at attempting to snatch me out of my comfort zone to make me act like them. It’s like being yourself these days is illegal or something. I remember there used to be a larger variety of people when I was little, but it almost feels like people are afraid of their former selves because they understand it’s not likely to be accepted today. I need a starting point and am looking for someone around my age who is as lonely and as hurt as I am. I’m looking for someone who is healing and willing to be healed. I’m not a bad person and I love to give. I’m always ready to help as long as I’m not being taken advantage of. I’m very thoughtful when it comes to gifts (just not good at wrapping them) if I know enough about you. I’m always willing to listen and can be a very consistent friend. I just need someone that I can help so I can feel useful. As of now I feel stuck and have no desire to move forward until I meet someone who has interest in caring. I don’t care for achievements if I have no one on my team. I have much more to say. I ask that someone reach out to me if they wanna talk.",lonely,Need someone to listen,2022-04-10 08:24:54

All I can hear is the sound of the interstate on the other side of a big concrete wall. I have a good job. 6 days a week is tiring, but it pays well and keeps me out of the house. Keeps me connected to the outside world. I’ve found even on my one day off I fall into this hole. I feel completely cut off from the world. I feel hopeless. All in a day. I had top surgery 2 weeks ago and it already feels like a lifetime ago that I’ve interacted with the outside. Every morning my mother helps me change my bandages, and I can see it in her eyes that she’s disgusted by me. She’s always been disgusted with me being trans. I hate being so vulnerable in front of her, but I can’t change my bandages on my own. The days are blurring together. I spent most of the time lying on my bed, starring out the window. I like to imagine the lives of the people on the interstate. I miss my friends. But they don’t miss me. Only one has checked up on me, and I’d never admit it to her, but it’s been getting me through my days. Just barely though. I can’t stand it. On their end it’s just a “how are you” every few days. On my end I’m staring at my phone, watching their online and offline status change. Wondering what their lives are like. Sad that I’ll never be a part of them. Fact of the matter is, my friend don’t need me, only I need them. They have their own favorite people. Their own families. I’ve been waiting so long to have this surgery. I thought it would make me happier. I’m not saying I regret it, but I was expecting a huge wave of euphoria, relief, something. But I don’t feel anything anymore. One of my friends at work is the only one that knows my situation. I consider him a father, I guess. I asked him to check up on me while I was away. It’s been a week since he’s checked in. I know it’s irrational to be angry. You don’t have to tell me. But sometimes I like to imaging what my life would be like if he was my real father. He’d probably check in on his real kid more than once a week. His kid that just had a life changing surgery. But anyways. I guess that was all over the place.  I just don’t know how to handle 4 more weeks of this. 4 more weeks of staring at my ceiling. 4 more weeks of waiting for a text. I’m  afraid I’ll feel like this always.

Most of the time, I have nothing to say and most of my friends only really bother to talk to me when I actively reach out to them. I can't create a dating profile for shit despite giving it my all, and the rare times I do match with someone, they don't even respond

I've decided that I'm done. I'm done putting my heart and soul into trying to get this to work. I'm an extrovert and thrive on human interaction, but if I'm the only one that will put in the goddamn effort, then just fuck everything. Fuck my barren ass dating life, fuck friends, fuck my desire to have a social life of any kind. If people on campus seem to not like me that much, if I'm really not approachable despite my best efforts to be so, then.....just.............what's the point?

What's the point of trying to change your fate when it's clear that you're just not lovable? People only seem to care what's on the outside. All that ""it's what's on the inside that counts"" bullshit doesn't seem to matter when all of your autistic quirks make you too weird to even be approached. And hell, I wouldn't know how to appear approachable anyway despite all of the research that I have done to make that happen.

The one guy i used to play videogames with 4 years ago never did sport and was playing lots of videogames until really late night. Despite that he was good looking enough (jaw, blue eyes, he was tall and thin enough), he stopped talking with me since high school, the last news i got from him is that he was invited to multiple parties and got multiple girlfriends already. (When i was hanging out with him it wasn't rare that a girl from my class was obviously flirting with him)

Whereas i do 5 to 7 hours of physical exercise a week since the beginning of highschool 3 years ago. I take care of my body and eat healthy food. I still have chubby cheeks and im riddled with acne scars (despite puberty kicking in pretty early). No girls ever tried to make contact with me and i was alone during all my primary/high school years.

What's worse is that even my younger sister is doing better than me, she often goes outside to see her friends and do sleepover, she has a boyfriend and puberty did impact her less. She doesn't care at all about school, the only class she is good at is english (because she keeps on watching american series when not outside). Her boyfriend (who's a pretty nice person) is genuinely interested into her english skills and whenever i hear their discussion it's always the same thing, they're talking about their day and then more of their day and more and more, always talking about the same thing without ever forgetting a detail (despite these details being pretty useless most of the time).

While i am confirmed bilingual by my school i am actually better than my sister who is still making some beginner's mistakes, i maintained good grades during my whole high school grades (5th best average in my class of 23), im greatly cultured, i know a lot about Internet, Languages, Litterature (french one at least), Im learning history and geography in my free time. I can maintain a basic discussion but even with all of that, people always dodge discussions or try to cut off these discussions as quick as possible because of what?

plz don't comment trying to be moral or anything, i've never emotionally abused anyone without their consent (because i don't enjoy it if it's not consensual). this is just a vent of a unique issue, and yes i am a bad person to most people, i know it and i try to work on some things that i do (though not all)

keep in mind i'm a sadist who seeks out masochists, and i am no angel

no one loves me like i love them, like i used to be really psychotic about breakups with a select few close to my heart (creating accounts after getting blocked, paragraphs, crazy toxic behavior) altho i've chilled a bit since i haven't been letting anyone get close recently, as to not trigger those behaviors (cuz i hate them as much as anyone would, to be completely honest)

i tried to work on myself to get better, and to be less toxic, which kind of worked in one of my past relationships (which ended due to them pretending they enjoyed it, and i hate it when  people lie about this stuff, as i don't really want to hurt them in a way they don't enjoy it), but i realized that limiting myself is not something i want to do, and instead i wanted to explore my toxicity with someone who would be able to reciprocate it in a way where they enjoyed it as much as i did

i've just been feeling incredibly down recently way more than any time in my life, because of my difficult behavior. i thought i found someone, but it ended due to them being way too busy (i think attention is the best gift, and it was just right person wrong times). it's just so hard to find someone who likes my kind of behavior (although it's not like it's impossible, i think i'm just going to try harder). it doesn't help that i probably have an undiagnosed mental illness, cuz i don't think this behavior is normal (i'm definitely a sadist, or maybe a sadomasochist, but many of my behavior is symptoms for a mental illness i researched)

3606,shiripiitz003,1649515887,1,"This is literally the first post im making after using this website for a couple of years, just never felt the need to post anything ever. But today I have reached a point where I cant keep these feelings bottled up anymore.

I feel like i have hit rock bottom in my life, I have felt sad and down at other times in my life but now i feel the loneliest i have evr felt .

Starting from the beggining, i guess ill start with how i came to live in country i call home now, Australia. I moved out here when i was turning 15 with my family, it was hard at first, having to adapt to living in a country where the way people live their lives isnt all that different from my own country, Portugal, but different enough to feel alianated. Naturally, English wasnt my original language, but i had learned enough as kid through videogames and movies that when i moved here it wasnt very difficult for me to master the language in a way that would let me speak comfortably with people. However i Stills had difficulties making friends. I have always been the kind of guy who is very shy at first but once you get to become friends with me i get very confortable with the friends i had made. Ive never been the kind of guy who liked having too many friends either, just a hadfult was enough for me, but the more the merrier. I am also a pretty big guy, even when i was younger, right now im about 6'2 and i am also very broad shoulders, also my face is what a lot of people would call a ""resting bitch face"", its just what i look like and cant do much about it either, it also never really annoyed me when people would make fun of me for it except for one time or another. Bit after about a year i had made a couple of friends at school. I thought i would never have to deal with year of loneliness for the rest of my life.

That is until 2022. Since 2019 i have been loaing friendships left and right, and i whilst i felt sad about I always got back up and said, 'oh well guess it just wasnt meant to last"". But it kept happening, I started noticing that all the frineds that i had made were just dissapering without a trace. I would call them and ask them to hang out or to go play some games or something and i would always hear the same answer, "" im busy"". After asking them a couple of times I had gotten the message, it was done. 2020 and 2021 were terible years i said, but 2022 has been even worse and were not even halfway through the year. Ive lost my job that i had worked at for 5 years, where i also had a lot of issues that im not gonna get into cause i dont feel like writing a whole novel. My parents also lost their jobs, and since we are still living in Australia with a working Visa we were running the risk of getting kicked out of the country, thought that situations seems to have calmed down a bit though. Since i lost my job all the friends that I had from work have just distanced away from me and i was barely seeing them, and now its been 1 month since last i heard from them and my best Friend witch i have know for almost 6 years now is giving the ""im busy"" line. 

I dont blame any of my friends for being ""busy"" they have their lives too, i understand that. But I feel like I have been there for them when they need me, i wasnt a saint who saved their lives obviously but listened and tried to help in the best way that i knew, and now im feeling down but i feel like no one cares, ive tried talking to some of them about it but they just didnt care, i guess for them it was over and they had better things to do.

ive tried to accept this but i just cant, when im not working in my new job where i dont know anyone yet, im at home feeling like shit. I realize that there are people out there dealing with a lot more serious stuff than what im feeling right now, but i cant help but feel like i deseve more, im at the kowest i have ever been and no gives a damn, my parents love me of course, but this isnt something that i could just easily talk to them about. 

Over the years, where i feel like i have lost so much, i started feeling and acting like i dont give a damn, making myself look strong and dependable in front of others and i guess thats where thongs started to go wrong, ive tried to change myself many times to seem more presentable to other people so i can seem more aporachable, but its only short lived, i guess after a while the cravks in shell tha i encased myself in start to show and people see for how weak and anatractive i am. So in the end they always leave. Losing my best friend has definitly got to be the point at which i cracked, i felt like i had someone i could trust with my worries and would understand me, i had been there for him multiple times as he was talking about his frustrations and listened, paied attention, but lately it was feeling like when it was my time to talk he just didnt care and  would chane the subject to be about him. Im not the best person alive, i feel jealous at times and hate like any other person, but i am still human, however i cant understand how and why people just end up leaving me, if it werent for my parents i would truly be alone, and for that i am thankful, but i am going to be greedy and say that i want more, in fact i want things to go back to how they used to be, but i guess thats just useful thinking.

I guess thats about it, this is already super long, longer than anything i turned in for a school assignement, and I dont want to bore you guys with the story of someone youre probably never going to meet. No ones probably going to read this long ass essay length sob story, but i needed to vent my frunstrattions somewhere. I am also sorry for the people who read this mess, i just wrote stuff as i was going but yeah thats about it. Thank yo to the ones wo do read this.",lonely,Just Venting I guess,2022-04-10 00:51:27

I found out in one of his friend's story (they were going live) that he was at her house together with a male friend. I only peeked for not more than five seconds and exited the app the moment I saw his face. He was smiling and seemed having fun.

I used to get secretly jealous when he goes out  at her house even if they are just friends and they have other friends there as well. We live very far from each other thats why we dont hangout often.

I dont know if I feel jealous right now because I still have feelings for him or maybe it was because this was my body's normal reaction since Ive gotten used to it (i have obsessive thoughts that make me feel really anxious, but i think it has slowly faded since the breakup)

I dont really have any desire nor curiousity to continue watching the live video. My heart is full of rage and grudge that I dont even want to look at his face for more than five seconds. I dont even watch our pictures anymore. I cant delete it either because I dont wanna see and be reminded of our memories. Or maybe they are just too sentimental for me since he was like the first person I made so many memories and experienced things with. I dont also have any plans on messaging him. I cringe every time I am reminded of him or our memories. I am not depressed either since I get to do the things Im passionate and I am happy about it.

3629,rianlei04,1649497650,1,"I don't know if this is the right sub but I just have no one to talk to about this.

I've been with a couple of guys before. One was abusive (verbally and physically) and one was pretty good. I've learned a lot from these relationships. I knew that I have the tendency to never give up on someone, that I'd go through whatever hell there is just to come through for the people I like/love. 

I've been single for quite some time now. But I'm talking to someone who is amazing, kind, caring, and just awesome. I like him a lot and I've been trying my best to make it work (whatever it is that we have). I'm not that good at expressing my feelings but I just hope that he knows how happy and thankful I am to have met him. He lives in a different country. But I'm trying my best just to see him. 

Whatever this is that I have with him, I'm loving it.

3639,Sufficient_Window_31,1649493395,1,"I don’t know if this counts as “trauma dumping” but yeah that’s pretty much what I’m about to do so please don’t read further if it bothers you. 

Maybe I shouldn’t be talking to anyone at all but that just makes my mental health even worse and makes me see anyone who shows me even the slightest amount of care as someone greater than they really are. 

Most people I met through the app just wanted sex. But it takes a lot for me to be intimate with someone and because I’m such a lonely person, I just give in to that because it’s some sort of affection. I’ll put aside the first 2 guys I met, but this one. Oh man

I had been seeing this guy for two weeks and he had already said he loves me and started calling me his girlfriend. (And even though I am needy as shit I still found it weird) 
So one time we were having sex and I started to feel like he was being too rough with me, which I didn’t like (I’m a very small person). And when I say “no, stop” they have to stop, right? This person just keeps getting aggressive with every word I say to try to stop him. “Just relax” he says. So I just stopped saying anything. 

By the time he was finished, I ended up bleeding. It was pretty embarrassing, for him. But I don’t think he even has the right senses to realise what he did. I went to the bathroom and checked. That was definitely blood. I asked him to check his sheets, he didn’t even seem concerned about me or anything, just started cleaning his sheets immediately. And left me in his room. He didn’t drop me home either, although we didn’t live that far from each other. I took the bus home and cried the whole way because I let him treat me like this. Or maybe I deserved it. 

I just want to be considered as a human being. Why does it seem so hard for people to see people as human beings? And he never even apologised. I never went back to his place again. 

So is it better to just be lonely? What am I doing wrong? Should I just stop looking for a romantic partner?",lonely,I crave affection and a romantic relationship but too scared to go back on a dating app because of my past experiences,2022-04-09 18:36:35

So I did it, I did it all. I exercised to appear fit, I landed a six-figure job to portray stability, I honed my charisma, and artificial confidence. I flung myself out into the terrors of social circles and friend-groups. I developed hobbies and interests, and some semblance of success according to everyone who had ever given me such sagely “life-advice.”

It was all in insignificant. I can’t say life hasn’t improved, it has, and I now get to appreciate my misery in luxury, but that doesn’t dismiss the fact that every “self-help” trope society sells is a lie. The harsh truth is that “self-love”, “acceptance”, and all that other flaming garbage is quite literally impossible to just conjure up intrinsically. Somebody else has to identify those things within you.

You can try and put yourself in better situations, better prepare for the right opportunity where someone might see something that you can’t find yourself. This may work for some, but there is a sad reality nobody likes to talk about; some people just don’t get those opportunities.

I became less and less important to her even though she said otherwise. I got less attention, less priority, she wouldn't even talk to me about anything that was going on. Instead, she talked to her guy friends about it. She left the first time because she said her depression was in the way. Even though I told her she could ttm about ANYTHING because I've been through so much, I understand far more than I would like to. We talked about it after I had started to get over her and was talking to the girl I was talking to before her. ""We"" decided to get back together, and she said she was going to make changes and ttm and stuff. Yeah, broken promise. We got back together like three times before I realized I was being used and manipulated and it put sooo much stress on my mind that I was breaking and after a whole thing where she was on ft with the guy who I thought was my friend and she used to like for hours at night but was talking to him about her problems and one of my close friends at the time, who I had to leave bc I found out he does drugs, told me the guy on ft (Jesse) liked Izzy and I confronted him on snap but he laughed and said I couldn't do anything because he was transferring schools the week after and it stressed me out a ton. Izzy lost her temper on me and said ""ARE YOU REALLY MAD AT ME FOR FACETIMING ONE OF MY GUY FRIENDS WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE OKAY WITH ME HAVING GUY FRIENDS?!"" (btw I only said I was okay with it because she said ""\[I\] would just have to get over it because \[she wasn't\] going to change"" idk why I didn't leave then). The worst thing is the girl I was talking to before, she was the perfect and ideal girl for me but I didn't want to date yet because High school relationships never work and because I went back to my ex so many times, she moved on to this other guy at her school and is or already gone to the dance at the school with him. She keeps saying ""It's fine"" or ""It's okay"" when I apologize for leaving her in the dust so many times but I not it isn't okay and that me apologizing will never fix it. She said something that hurt really really bad but I don't think she meant it to hurt because she is SO sweet and kind and doesn't want to hurt or upset anyone and literally won't turn down people that ask her out because she doesn't want to hurt them. She said ""It's fine, I knew you would always go back to her"". And my dog was really sick since she had puppies, she wasn't eating a lot and was extremely skinny and never played anymore, just slept. We couldn't do anything else to help, we tried so hard. We had to give her to the Humane Society because they have the resources to rehabilitate her and I'll never see her again. All of the closest bond I've ever had are gone I barely have anything left, no one to turn to and I can't do anything in school and my grades tanked for the past week because I just sit staring at the wall with my music full volume and try not to cry if I'm in school. I loved that dog more than anything and I was her favorite person, she would sleep with me, check on me every once in a while, follow me everywhere, if I started crying at night she would come and let me hug her. I cared about Izzy more than anyone in the world, I would've taken a bullet for her, but she wouldn't do the same. And now, I'm at my computer crying where I can barely see the screen with no one to help me, no one to hug me, and no one to understand.

But where do these people who desperately need help find the time to do that because if they do try to seek help they lose everything in their life which makes everything 10 times worse for them which only makes their mental health that much worse.

Even if they find the time to get help they have already lost everything like their car or the place they're renting or all of their belongings by the time they get out because they couldn't pay. What do you think happens to them next?

When I still attended school and college, I'd usually always have at least a few people that I would talk to, joke around with, play with and so on and in my eyes, those were my friends. But outside of school, I never hung out with any of them. Now I realize that they weren't really my friends. They were just other people I spent time with because we happened to be in the same class and we had to get through school together. Those were usually the only things I had in common with them. They were not actually ""my people"". And outside of school, I also never had any contact with other people I considered a friend of mine. I didn't really mind, since I'm quite introverted and I was always completely fine with spending all of my time alone. Btw I also don't have siblings or anything, so I was literally always alone aside from my parents.

But now after realizing I never had any true friends, I feel like I missed out on a lot. Which is kinda weird I guess, since I didn't feel that way when I was younger. I don't remember feeling lonely or wanting more than what I had. But now I wish I had at least one friend I was really close with. Someone I could have bonded with, someone with the same interests, someone who knew all of my quirks and with whom I could have been 100% myself without fearing that they would have judged me, someone that was my go-to partner by default whenever there was some kind of project/group task and someone that would always have my back, no matter what. Because that's what a true friend is. Not someone you just spend time with because you kind of have to.

3721,BurnerVol_2,1649457106,1,"Hey there, I have a question for y'all. Do you get invited to things? Because I just realized that after i entered University something funny happened. I ""switched"" my group of ""friends"" because the others did not share my schedule at all. So I did this move and well, just realized that I'm basically that guy that's just there like a fucking plant for literally everyone. 

I know every single one of them for at least 2-3 years already. And recently there were 2 BD and they decided to do a party. Literally everyone was invited except me. Ok, not the first time and certainly not the last one either that this happens and I can deal with it. Then I started scratching my memory and realized that I've been the only one that no one has even thought about to invite; I'm the only one that no one texts; the only guy that no one wants to be there (literally, if I go they just let go but if any other goes everyone goes to make company). Well, that's not it. I've have not been invited to do things in the last 4 years (at least that I can remember). Hell, even my ""Best Friend"" just rejects every single plan that I propose, or she just ditched me.

3729,yeetcuzynot,1649454893,1,"Note: Redacted some names. \[A\] was my high school crush, \[B\] was an example of a popular kid, \[C\] was one of my ""friends"" in early high school that I thought I had even though he basically forgot about me as soon as we stopped sharing classes, \[D\] was a friend I had since elementary that had almost completely drifted apart by then, and \[E\] was an old middle school crush that was way too popular for me to have a chance with.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past few days, I thought I had a chance with my crush, \[A\], but I am now beginning to realize that thinking that is not just wrong, but silly. Come on, get a grip. She doesn't want you. She doesn't even interact with you that often, she's just in the same group as you. Why would she ever want me? I don't know anything about the rest of her life, as I'm only with her for two classes. Is she popular? Does she have a boyfriend? Does she go out with her friends? Based on her interactions with others that I notice, she seems to be pretty socially successful, which is basically the polar opposite of my depressed and lonely situation. No matter how much I want her, I have to put her out of my mind, because my level of obsession is getting ridiculous, and she has so many other options other than me, the short and quiet kid that can't talk to people and wanders around alone at lunch. 

Other guys, like \[B\], have girls always surrounding them and hovering around them like their own personal harem, but I'll never have anything like that. Many of my old friends from middle school, even the ones that seemed like they were in my situation during middle school, have become social butterflies, sharing fun experiences with their friends that they'll look back fondly upon. I'm not popular, I'm not athletic, I'm not cool. I'm just less than them. And I'm not even sad about it, I've just accepted the status quo at this point. But i just want to be able to be friends with a girl. But how can I do that if I can barely maintain my friendships with boys? This isn't working. Nothing in this school is working. Other kids have extracurriculars and friends and clubs and social lives, and I'm barely getting by doing only my schoolwork. My friend \[C\] went to the National Chess Championships last weekend. Imagine the resumes and college applications of some of these kids. Will I have any of that? No. I'm just not good enough. And I'll be rejected from all the colleges I want to go to, I'll have to settle with some community college or working a minimum wage job after I graduate high school, and be a disappointment to my family and my father. Forget about a social life, I'll be the kid that always studies in the dorm. The others--they'll just leave me behind. 

Imagine how \[D\] is doing. He probably has great grades and a fantastic social life compared to me. Maybe even a girlfriend, I wouldn't put it past him. He's always been better than me, in everything really. I'm the worst that I know. Well, there's nothing else really to say. I was just destined to fail. It was clear when I first went to school in Pre-K and was terrified of other kids. It was clear in elementary school when I had bad social skills and needed \[D\] to carry me through, as he was always the spotlight and the center of attention. It was clear in middle school when I was a complete outcast, sitting at the edge of the table and just wishing I could be one of the popular ones, obsessing over \[E\] and wanting to be part of all the stuff they were. And it's clearer than ever now, in high school, without friends, without a social circle, without love, without confidence, even without the decent grades that I used to have. And it will be clear until I die.",lonely,"Found this old online journal entry from a few years ago, when I was in my freshman year of high school.

 I have never been one to know which way the wind was blowing. Social queues, and expectations have never made sense to me. Constantly I find myself concerned if I am acting in a way that is correct. It will never make sense to me I understand now. I am not what one would consider an average sort of person. I dare believe I also am not what one would define as a weird or peculiar person. No not I for I do not have such a memorable affect as the strange do in our minds. 
 I dare say I am much more like a gnarled tree you see when on a walk. When you see it you recognize it. You notice very clearly it is not a normal tree. You may debate if the tree is ugly or beautiful, you may wonder how it became so gnarled. At the end of the day you will walk away from the tree and will think nothing of it unless you see it again. Should you see it again you may think to yourself, “It’s that gnarled tree!” then again after you lose sight of it. It is gone from your mind again. 
 It is a rare person who looks at a gnarled tree and becomes fascinated enough to sit by it, or take its picture. Just as it is a rare person who can love a person as strange as I yet so normal. A patient person must love me as I am unable to understand the world around me with the clarity others have no issue noticing. 
 It sounds like such a curse to love me. However, I am a selfish and greedy person who welcomes the curse as it benefits me greatly to be loved. Human nature demands we are loved. I may not understand social cues, expectations, or mannerisms. I daresay I understand what it means to be human to a greater intensity than many. I have not forgotten the language of my lungs that demands I sing with the birds in the morning. I know the dance my blood dances as it travels in my veins.  
 I do not understand society. I do understand the world. It is because of this understanding I know without a shadow of a doubt I do not belong in it. I belong in the ground amongst the living world. It will greet me a hello one day I am sure. For now though I do believe I will indulge myself in the curse others bear to love me. At least until they have conquered the curse enough to stop. The ground will keep.

I havent had someone in real life matter whom isnt long distance - and at that time theyre the only irl person in my life - so my life is empty and dysfunctional (especially when u dont see the long distance once even once a month) thats zero human contact a month. Not exactly; but I feel zip from shallow interactions with cashiers and delivery guys. I have zero idea how they do with others. But I know Im part of the problem as Im not that interested in the beginnings of friendship. Its really hard for me to be fake and positive and upbeat - and to pretend little things are SO amazing… like sunsets over the same city I live in. I feel that magic when Im on vacation though, and the sunset is over a beautiful place and not a city I feel trapped in. I think Im sure Ive lost it. As I feel trapped and that existing is not enough. When you barely speak from sun up to sun down and beyond aka when youre at home at night. I dont get the point of my life. Just “surviving” really doesnt cut it for me. And I ask these questions to my therapist and they dont give answers- and all I want are the answers. I dont want someone to just listen. I want concrete solutions to try to change my life. Ive barely got 4 hrs of activity a day in me at this point. Comparable for 0-1hrs before finding a working anti depressant. But Im old and finding a new career that pays a living wage will take 5 years of work from zero to what. Its hard to believe it will work. Plus I have zero interest in being social at work - its the worst place for me. I can focus on work or socializing but I cant do them in tandem or back and forth through the day. I dont want to say hi and bye to someone I see 5 days a week for years and years. Whats the point? I just want the money. I dont like the shallow stuff; having nothing actually in common and pretending personal stuff is something I want to share (zero family so no I dont want to talk about fam tv shows or my pet w ya, I just want to work at work) Ive over heard so many coworkers in the past talk about stuff that directly conflicts w my values and makes them horrible ppl like bad moms upset their 4 yo gets attention over them or someone whom says the reason they wont become ft is they like living off welfare or coworkers making fun of immigrant accents from the place they are from (i mean wtf) or the coworker whom says they dont like their job and want to sell tea full time but theyre still there 6 years later (literally) or someone whom dresses like a nun criticising a cropped sweater I wore with a dress and it takes all my strength to not say I wouldnt be caught dead wearing anything Ive seen u wear let alone anyone in your dept. or when I wear makeup to work and then all the women in my section dart to the washroom as soon as I come in… and I go over there to see what happened and theyre all putting on make up (all of which are over 45 yo minimum) and other pathetic adult tendancies that I expected all adults would be over as were all supposed to be constantly trying to self improve but this sorry bunch is always like… scraping the bottom of the barrel.

I’m an only child who is more than used to it - Being alone and being lonely are very different. But I just feel like the world doesn’t really get me. People see who they want to see. “Confident black guy? He must be ok!” But it couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m on edge literally always and the only reason I haven’t taken myself out is because my best friend beat me to it a couple of years ago. And part of all this is straight identity crisis. I lost 120 lbs like 6 years ago and I’m still not used to the guy I see in the mirror. And that fucks with me heavy. But nobody wants to hear that at 2am when the drinks and drugs are flowing. They just wanna hang with the guy that “seems fine” but it’s like everyone wants to party with me but no one asks me how my day is. And I do not want to take away from the ppl that are truly physically alone, but in a city with upwards of 9 million; it feels so counterintuitive to feel so lonely. Idk. I just needed to vent.

3817,pixels01727,1649400346,1,"So I'm just going to start with this, I know I am majority at fault here, I've done this one to myself (mostly)
So few years back, I started chatting with this girl, different country, time zones are whack (10 hour difference) things got flirty, we got close, normal stuff
The issue is I just randomly stop talking to people for no reason, doesn't matter who you are, I get distracted by the daily life stuff that until it becomes routine (I reply if I see a message but she made it clear she wouldn't want to intimate chat), odds are I'm going to forget to talk to you for a few days (I also have no sense of time, weeks go by without me noticing) this happens a few times till she's fed up, with me obviously losing track of things and her eventually unfriended me (I tried to add back immediately like an idiot, wasn't my finest moment)
She tried to add me again back in November, I didnt  see the notification due to where it was sent, twitch friend request of all things, I saw it mid last month
She starts by going on how I've been on her mind, and what not, and when I bring up trying to get to know each other, she starts going on about how she's not interested in a relationship at all, or anything sexual with me, that I lost my chance at any of that, but she wants to slut around, and all these guys she's talking to
Im pretty sure I get what's going on, she's trying to frustrate me, get back at me for essentially ghosting her, I get that I should just stop talking to her, intentionally this time, with everything else this is weighing hard on me mentally, but I'm obviously still interested in her, and I'm letting this happen, and feeding into it
Again I get I'm doing this to myself, that if I'd just been better at keeping up ( or just not staying interested in someone like this) this wouldn't be an issue, I brought this up with a friend ( who has a similar issue of just not keeping up with people) they say it's abandonment issues, where if things are fine then it just kinda slips thru my mind, and if there's a risk of them leaving or something similar, it'll be on my mind constantly

3828,Artemis-TheHunter,1649394668,1,"With my 30th birthday around the corner I have been going through a lot of different emotions. Some have them have been deep to the point I’m crying over things that happened in the past. Some of them have been kinda on the surface because they are still kinda new. With me working overnights and being the only person awake in the building you have a lot of time to think to yourself and just trying to figure out where the emotions are coming from and when did the emotions start. Then I think back to when I was 27 and I was going through what I thought was hell. I was not living a good and productive life. I was drink heavily and just out partying on work nights not paying bills and jus going down a dark and lonely path. Until a close friend saw my pain and asked me if I was “OK”. How do you even answer that with all you have just bottled up inside and not sure if you should let it out. So I just sat and cried my out. My friend told me “ I know what you going through and you won’t be alone in this I’ll help you. He told about a phase in life that many people just think it’s a trial or tribulation they or going through. It’s not, it’s called Saturns Return. To sum it up basically it’s a phase from 27 to 30 during this time Saturn is in the same place as it was when you was born. What this brings is all the past emotions and feeling and just things you have done over the years to now and it makes you really deal with them if you haven’t already. Most people only go through this twice in there life time some are lucky to go through it three times. But during this time you really feel the emotions you have and the cut deep. You really feel alone when you have never felt alone before. You really feel sad for things that normally doesn’t make you that sad but with all this going on you get so caught up in these emotions. When it’s really time to feel certain emotions with events that take place you sometime ls even for get to show those emotions when it’s needed. I said all this to say this yes I love my alone time I love spending time doing what I want to do even if that is just to sleep all day long. Yes I am feeling alone for the first in my life. But I’m ready for wherever my life takes me when I turn 30.

i don’t know how it’s so easy for others to just ask anyone who they feel like hanging out with to do something. i know i have this horrible fear of rejection due to previous situations in my life where my “friends” secretly disliked me and i was too dumb/desperate to stop making an effort with people who hated being around me.
also due to my previous fake friends, i am constantly paranoid that all my current friends secretly dislike me as well. if a friend acts seemingly distant or quiet around me, i assume the worst and it’s giving me near-constant anxiety when i’m around others. as i write this, i’m 95% convinced my roommates (i’m 22f, college apartment) all hate me and are avoiding me. i haven’t even done anything to upset or bother them or had any fights, at least not any time recently. but i still feel this way and haven’t had a enough conversations with them lately to feel out their vibe towards me.

3835,Upset-Passion1457,1649393930,1,"A lot of shit has happened this week. I used to live near my university and had an apartment and lived independently pretty well. My apartment lease expired (I wanted to extend, but my parents pressured me to reliqunish it) so I had to move out and go back to my parents' house temporarily, which does not make me happy. It is possible I am moving to my parents' hotel ASAP which is mid-way between home and my university after talking it over with my parents, but with the recent turmoil, I don't even know if that is even possible. My parents try to aggressively influence my thinking by bringing in religion as the solution to my loneliness and isolation but that doesn't work for me, no matter how much I try, because I am not anywhere close to their personality and patience. It's funny really, they don't believe in what I have and forced me to come back while acknowledging what I have, and their only solution is eating at cheap places and using religion as the solution (no hate, just doesn't work).

Furthermore, it turns out the company I really wanted to work for and had a Superday for declined to proceed with my application, so here I am, desperately looking for a job despite getting a positive response after a Superday. I had planned out a life and what I can do living away from my parents with my own income and building a life out with fun activities, pride in working hard and working with purpose, and connecting with people (I desperately want to connect with people!). Now, I have to go through a lot of interviews, which is great YIPPPYYY but it is gruesome. 

But the thing that really sucks is this...a group of colleagues, a few friends, and I assembled together to study for this exam. We all couldn't meet at the same time, but we did have a group chat. The more prominent the chat was going, the more people were added to a total of around 15-16 people from our class(es). The exam happened earlier this week and the grades came out tonight. I passed, and with that enthuaism, I shared it and asked how everyone else did. My friend, or so I believed (after much convincing that he is a friend), basically wrote this ""Go work for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ already \*my name\*"", then ""Imma beat your ass at \*place\* kid"" and ""Analyze that"". Since one of the colleagues who is a good acquaintance laughed about it, I was still feeling lost but decided to laugh with it. Then he wrote ""So \*name\* you get \*grade\* punches"" so I decided to joke by responding ""How many on each side?"" to which he responses ""Kids got jokes."" ""\*divided the grade by 2\* on each side"" and ""Had to pull out calculator"" to which I felt like it comes across a joke, but the way he was serious about his grade, it didnt sound entirely like a joke. I felt disrespected, especially in a group chat of 16 people including myself. I felt bad that they didn't succeed well despite the best I could do to help them by providing notes and what I understood, but like that was not kind and it really fucks me up.

I feel so lonely inside, isolated to the point that I am stalking Snap Maps and seeing all the parties out there, and extreme sadness because of the way things happened tonight. I overthink about how if this friend literally said that way, even in a way of a joke, that it messes with my reputation and my value.

(wouldn't my mother be so proud) If you'd like someone to chat with, I'm pretty much open to talk about anything you'd like. You can tell me about your favorite or newest hobby, about your favorite book, or you could even vent to be about what a dork Bill from accounting was this week. (Darn Bill!)

Incase you'd like a sense of who I am, here's some fun facts about me:

* I live in the midwestern region of the USA.
* My favorite food is pasta. Just give me noodles plus an absurd amount of sauce and I'll usually be happy.
* My newest hobby is game development. Very early into this, but I'm learning a lot!
* Sadly I have no pets... Not allowed to have them where I live but I'm real close to sneaking a dog into the situation.

My wife and I are not close.  Shes been struggling with depression for most of our 17 yr relationship.  She lost her job 4 years and shes become even worse.  Shes never been a true partner in our relationship and much of the work of home care, finances, social events, kids activities fell to me.  She has no friends and not close with her family.  Her family life consists of my sister and my relatives and the occasional phone call with her mom.  But she made good money and worked hard as the main breadwinner. She enjoys cooking so she at least contributes to meals and is a great cook.  

We stopped being intimate years ago and was awkward for years before that.  We stopped talking about our relationship years ago after every attempt led to an argument, mostly her getting offended or defensive about something I say.  Somehow it always seems to be about how I am criticizing her or putting her down.  Even when I was trying to offer support or encouragement.  I stopped trying to talk to her.  I basically leave her alone.  Our conversations now are about mundane things.. kids, dogs and dinner.  Superficial and emotionless.  We don't sleep together.  In fact we dont do anything together except the occasional fight over kids.  

My kids are teenagers now and being the typical self-absorbed young adults that they are, they dont need dad to hang out with anymore.

Our finances are bad with my income alone so that's a heavy weight that is on me every day.  I wish I can hang out with my friends more but it became more cost prohibitive.  So I save all money to pay the bills.

I have nobody to turn to and resenting my wife.  But I know that my wife is struggling too.  I feel guilty that I cant give her what she needs.  She seems to think that medication will help her.  But whatever she thinks she needs, its surely not me.  

So I'm stuck being miserable and lonely.  And feeling guilty that I dont have the strength or energy or love to help my wife through her pains.

Mom is emotionally abusive, sister is emotionally and physically abusive.

I can make friends when I am in social situations, but the depression means I am not in college or doing anything social apart from going out rarely with some old school friends, which is limited to drinking and doing drugs.

I remember being excited to just to go to school (K-4th grade) and see all of the same friends that I had already seen yesterday I didn’t have any problems making friends as a kid it was like the easiest thing in the world, I’m sure everyone feels the same about that thought, but then I moved just when I had started middle school so to me it was a huge change but the real change was the people.  On my first day I was instantly picked on and bothered by 98% of the other kids, and when I told my parents they told me it was just because I was the “new kid” and it would blow over in a few weeks or so. But it didn’t.  The real reason I was picked on was because I have mild Tourette’s, I was never a disruption in class even while having vocal tics (you couldn’t really hear me unless you were close to me) but I always chose to sit in the empty row of seats in the back of the classrooms.  I also have a few motor tics and those are noticeable but in my old school, the kids just kinda passed it on as normal and never mentioned it.  So with being made fun of a lot at a young age, I kinda stuck with the being alone thing through the rest of middle school and all of high school year. I met my best friend my freshman year and to me it was a complete shocker that someone actually wanted to talk to me.  She never cared about my tics and has reassured me that they will never bother her no matter what and for that I appreciate her.  We’ve gotten along great for 5+ years, she even lives with me so everyday was always an adventure but then she got a girlfriend.  In all honesty I don’t mind her gf, I actually think she’s a really nice person and I’m happy that my best friend has found someone for her but ever since they got together, I never get to see or hang out with my best friend like we used to.  Like I said before I don’t mind her gf but it bothers me when she is here 24/7 and they do the cuddly, lovey stuff constantly and it’s like a constant reminder of “you’re gonna be alone forever” replaying in my head.  In my opinion I feel as though our 5+ year friendship means nothing to her now that she has a girlfriend and we’ve seen each other through thick and thin so the fact that she acts like I don’t exist anymore really beats me up emotionally.

Hi everyone.

I am a 22-year old, Polish guy, without any friendship, relationship or sexual background. I was born with a condition known as cerebral palsy. My mother did not want me so she wanted to have an abortion, which failed, damaging my brain in the process. On top of that, after the attempt, she kept squeezing herself tightly around the stomach so that no one could see she was pregnant. Those factors made it that I was born dead. The doctors managed to reanimate me but told my family that I won't be able to see, walk or talk. After around I believe 15 surgeries I was able to see but ended up with a lazy eye and glasses. Obviously, after I was born nothing has changed and my parents still didn't want me, so I ended up in an orphanage. Being in such a place doesn't really help to socialize with anyone and I have to say that those have been the worst 10 years I could imagine and wouldn't wish anyone to be forced to live in such a place for a week, let alone for a decade. After that, I got adopted by my own grandparents, although I have no idea why bother to do so after such a long time. Regardless, I thought it would be a much better environment, but it couldn't be further from the truth. My grandmother turned out to be a tyrant and my grandfather a long time alcoholic. I spent another 10 years there. 10 years of being called a failure, abused and getting beaten up constantly. Sure I had food to eat and a place to sleep, but I was treated accordingly to my grades. If I got a good one, there was no screaming and no beating. I'll let you guess what happened after I got a bad one. I got so terrified that prefered spending the night outside to coming back home. Even today when being a student at a university and hear something will be graded my heart is ready to jump out of my chest. Having no one to turn to I spent those playing video games and reading books in my room, without any friends. As a teenager, I've never been to a party or anything close to that. I didn't even know to talk to people and to be honest I still don't think I do but will come back to that aspect later.

Now, for the walking part. It was a little bit more tricky. Spent most of my childhood in a wheelchair or crawling on my knees, because I wasn't able to stand up on my own. The wheelchair itself caused me not to have any friends because I couldn't take part in any activities that 10-year old usually get into, like playing soccer or riding a bike for instance. I started to walk when I was around 15-16 years old.

Managed to get out of the wheelchair with the help of a gym, which took me about 4 years. After achieving the goal of being able to walk I stopped working out. When Corona broke out it got me motivated to start again. Went from 45 to 65 kg since it started 2 years ago. I managed to build a pretty decent looking body, which I am pretty proud of. I've also managed to move out of the abusive family and currently living in the Netherlands. As previously, I thought changing the place will erase my problems, sadly it didn't. Even though I am currently able to walk ( the walking is pretty specific to people with my condition, so it doesn't look normal) and have a decent physique people still treat me like I am a freak. They always have been, but I was hoping it will change after my appearance also changes.

I can't get out to the city without people staring, laughing or mocking me for how I walk. After I started to work out again I've been bombarded with sentences like: ""It won't change anything. You  
are only compensating for your walking and won't be able to find a girlfriend anyway because you are weird."". I've obviously tried to date, but every single one of them ended on the first one. I was getting rejected for 2 things: My height (5.7ft or 172 cm) and how I walk obviously. The last girl I was dating for about 2 months told me that she was only hanging out with me, because she felt sorry, not because she liked me. Some of the potential ""friends"" I've met told me that they don't want to do anything together because of feeling ashamed of being close to me and that I scare other people away.

All of the things I mentioned in this post really discouraged me from attempting any human interaction. Not even mentioning talking to girls. I feel really lonely sometimes, but don't want to go through all the mocking and rejection, because it really hurts. The worst part is that the thing that people judge me on cannot be changed and it's not my fault. It's not like I am overweight and can go to the gym to fix it and be accepted again.

Thank you to anyone who decides to read this and have a good day!

PS. My only friend I had left decided she doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore just a couple of minutes ago :(

3902,cusipic8,1649357925,1,"Hello, I'm posting this because I remember seeing a similar post a while ago and it gave me hope so hopefully it will help someone(and also because I feel the need to share my thoughts tbh)

When I was around 15-16 I fell into a deep depression, isolated myself from everyone for years, in which I also developed severe social anxiety since I wasn't talking to anyone except my parents. I wanted to kill myself, was self harming in all possible ways, refused to even look into mirrors because I hated the way I looked so damn much, the idea of dying was so damn appealing to me but I'm lucky that I'm a damn coward and couldn't do more than cutting, burning and sometimes ripping hair out of my arms, head, etc.

I didn't have anyone willing to help me, no friends since I pushed everyone away, my parents were only yelling at me everyday, my dad was also depressed but it was manifesting in a more aggressive way, professors from school were only calling me lazy for not being able to focus or study, I was bullied by other kids, you get the idea. 

Now, I don't encourage everyone to do this unless you actually love animals and are able to take care of one, but I adopted a kitten that was almost dying(she's a healthy, very playful grown up lady now if you're wondering) and the bond I created with her it's what I think made me want to recover from all of that stuff. She gave me hope and made me feel not so lonely in this horrible world, she was literally hugging my face every time I cried, slept on my pillow every night next to me, I cannot thank the universe enough for making me find this cat in the trash. 

Slowly I was starting to feel a bit better, the suicidal thoughts started going away little by little(they are still here when something particularly bad happens in my life but go away quite fast). I started socializing little by little with people(mostly online tho) and then in real life, especially since I moved in another city and had the opportunity to meet some amazing people and it made me realize not all people are bad and judgy. Managed to meet my now best friend and some other few friends I have now that I can hang out with. 

However, I went through 3-4 abusive relationships, went back and forth again with the suicidal thoughts, went through drug addiction(left it only at weed now), developed abandonment issues but at least now I had like 3-4 people that were checking up on me, dragged me out of the house and helped me get over shit.

I learned to like myself more, learned not to care so much about other people's opinions, learned how to say how I feel(not very good at it but it's something), stopped self harming(tho I now have to live with the fact that I'll never be able to wear short sleeves around people and that I get weird looks during summer), started coping with my anger by playing video games instead or just smoking some weed(I'm not pushing this on anyone, it's not a good coping mechanism and not good to do it every day, but way better than hurting yourself tbh and it's the only thing helping me sleep).

I know I typed A LOT and maybe not everyone is willing to read the whole thing, but I'll conclude here for anyone getting this far(thank you and sorry), I got better eventually, compared to the person I was 10 years ago, I am WAY better. 10 years ago, never thought I would have friends, never thought I'll take a picture and be confident enough to post it on instagram, never thought I'll have people that want to hang out with me, never thought I'll be able to live by myself(even tho my salary is not enough and I still struggle with money every month), never thought I'll be able to be as social as I am now(I was stuttering constantly even at the supermarket when I had to pay) and never thought I'll be able to stop self harming. 

Maybe life will never be what you want it to be right now, but it CAN and WILL be better if you're willing to try and if you can think of any way that can distract you. I'm still depressed, still have anxiety episodes here and there, still can't act right in some situations, but I now have hope and no longer see myself as a worthless piece of shit. Even if you fall back at some point, you can get yourself up again.

Hang in there and just trust yourself, you are worth it and I hope you all will be able to see the good in this world and will be able to at least accept yourself the way you are. Lots of love and if anyone needs to talk, vent, anything, you can text me if you want to.",lonely,"I'm making this post as proof that things can actually get better, even if not exactly the way you want.(LONG READ, SORRY)",2022-04-08 04:58:45

I know a lot of my piers are into hooking up, but I really don’t understand it. I am a profoundly sentimental person, I have always found casual sex to be repulsive and barbaric. I am 20 and I have never been in a relationship, I really want my first time to be with my husband. The #1 thing that I want in life right now is a SO. I do not enjoy being single, I never have. I do not thrive as a single person. Perhaps being single might be more bearable for someone who already has a strong support network, but I have no one, I’m completely alone. My relationship with my family is toxic at it’s worst, and superficial at it’s best and I have no friends to speak off. I just wish I had one person in my life. Someone reliable, someone that I can depend on, someone who will never abandon me. I don’t think that’s too much to ask for, but in today’s world, men like that are impossible to find and gentlemen are a lost breed. I think as a society, we have lost something precious. That which was once beautiful and pure has long since been perverted. Romance is dead, and hookup culture has taken it’s place. Idk, maybe I’m just old fashioned, either way, the knowledge that I have is a burden. All I want in this life is to experience true love, that’s literally all I want. If I can have that, I will die a happy person. My heart will be content and I will feel as though I truly lived life to the fullest. I feel incomplete, like a part of me is missing. I yearn for my other half. Ever since I was old enough to know what love is, it’s all I’ve ever wanted. I hardly see the point in living anymore, nobody gives a shit about me, they aren’t gonna miss me, so what’s the point? If no one cares about you, then what meaning does your life have? To exist without a purpose is as good as being dead. Many years ago I saw an anime called Darling in the Franxx. I feel like that show resonates with me now more than ever. Those of you who have seen it are probably familiar with the Jian. The Jian, also known as “the bird that shares wings” only poses one wing. Unless a male and female pair lean on each other and act as one, they are incapable of flight. They are imperfect creatures, born incomplete, but for some reason their way of life struck me as profoundly beautiful. In many ways I am like the Jian, I cannot fly without a partner, but perhaps one day, I will find my other half and my dreams of flight will finally be realized.",lonely,"All I want, all I have ever wanted is a SO.",2022-04-08 02:50:41

I don’t know about you but I can sure use a good, nice, friendly, and engaging chat with someone who can (hopefully) keep the conversation alive past the first 10 messages… basically past hi, hello, and what’s up! The boring icebreakers…! 
It would be such a relief to finally converse with someone out of the ordinary, wild, fun, with a crazy and upbeat personality…. I mean, anything that can alleviate the gloom of this cloudy and cold day will be super awesome. 
Here is a really brief and to the point breakdown of my personal menu, or what people call online; my interests: books, traveling, good food—always—, animals, pets, little tigers, sports, the beach and a good, delicious cup of Italian coffee! 
Not sure if it matters, but I’m 29 (so please don’t kill the vibe and ask again lol, or you can), 6’1” tall, black hair, olive skin and greenish eyes. I’ve been told that I have a great sense of humor, and easy on the eye, humbly! 
I personally find some much common ground with someone who’s witty—some sass is okay too, if used right lol, intelligent, classy, well educated and confident! I think after being sophisticated, confidence is the most attractive trait in person, at least that’s what I think! 
Oh! Lastly, before I forget, please don’t ask rhetorical questions like why are you posting on Reddit… here is your answer now, cause the pandemic ruined my social life and I don’t know about you.. but making friends after college has been a miserable journey lol!

Recently matched with a girl on Bumble that was honestly way out of my league, but apparently she loved the fact I sing opera and she really like my voice and my looks, for whatever reason... or so I thought, she just unmatched me overnight and I have no idea why. We talked a lot and I shared a lot of music with her, which she honestly seemed to enjoy a lot, and she was surprisingly kinda flirty, which is admittedly really alien to me. She said she was kinda busy currently but really liked the idea of meeting and me singing something to her. My stupid ass even recorded a few pieces because she wanted to listen to me. If you REALLY want a good laugh, check out my recent posts, especially to /r/opera asking for romantic repertoire recommendations for my voice type. It's a shame because everyone was really helpful, but it was all for nothing, lol. I can't even say I at least have a lot of new rep suggestions, because I really don't feel like learning any of it anymore.

I've only had two actual partners my whole life (I'm 35), both were friends of mine for quite a bit before even dating me, and one was really a FWB deal; thinking about it now, they probably took pity on me or something. I'm going through the worst time of my life, and honestly the shit this girl pulled was the last thing I needed, especially because... for the first time in years I was actually happy and excited for the first time. I thought I'd met someone who liked me again, and I loved the idea of getting to sing for someone. I don't even have friends anymore. It really hurt. I just said ""fuck everything about this crap"" and deleted my dating profiles. I guess I have to make peace with the fact I'll always be alone.",lonely,Deleted my dating profiles,2022-04-08 01:04:44

I’ve never dated,never went out with friends,went to any dances or prom,football games, none of that. I wish the last 4 years of freedom in my life wasn’t going to be forever remembered as being insanely depressed and lonely with no friends.

The knowledge that you are a worthless being who brings nothing but pain to everyone around you no matter how hard you try to just make everyone happy, the understanding that love, the only thing you ever wished for, is something you'll never have or deserve.

3953,itsatelekineticissue,1649325574,1,"i just need to vent.
i am tired. from the bottom of my heart, i am tired.

for years, i have been constantly daydreaming and pretending specific people are there with me, because they could never be here with me in person. i have done this every chance i get, which is every night/day i’m alone. it was my way of ignoring the sadness and loneliness i truly felt. music, constant daydreaming, and acting like people are here with me was/is my way of coping. it’s pathetic. truly pathetic, i know. but i feel like this keeps me from doing bad things to myself. it’s really the only reason i am still able to smile, laugh, and joke around.
but it’s getting tiring, and it doesn’t work like it used to. when i face reality and realize that the people/person i want most isn’t actually here with me, i feel overwhelmingly lonely and sad, while also feeling incredibly stupid and pathetic. i stay awake doing this all night, and go to sleep when it’s almost daytime feeling extremely distressed.

i also have to get my life together… i have to get my driver’s license, and a job, so i can save up money to move out, but… i am always procrastinating. i have more than enough free time to do that, but i can’t… i feel so exhausted all the time even though i don’t do anything. i want this so badly, but i can’t find the motivation to study for it. and i obsess over this every second. it’s constantly in my head that i need to get my shit together, yet i still haven’t. as much as i obsessively think about it. it has never left my mind. it’s there every day, every millisecond. and that’s exhausting too… i’m tired of worrying about it, but i’m doing nothing when i could be using this time to study…

and then there’s insecurity…i obsess over my weight. i know i’m not fat. i’m only 110-115 pounds, which is a healthy weight. but i still want to start working out to lose weight and get fit, but i have no motivation to do that either… i feel terrible and guilty whenever i eat or drink anything else than water. i only eat once, sometimes twice because i sleep all day. and my siblings “jokingly” call me fat every single day, which is making me feel worse… i’m tired of hearing it, but they won’t stop. because they know i’m sensitive about my weight. i have always hated my body, as well as my appearance. i obsess over the way my body looks, and that’s tiring and exhausting as well.

and then…i am losing the most important person of my life. the person i love more than anyone and anything, the person i would live and die for, the person who is my life…will not be here much longer. this is destroying me and tearing me apart more than anything right now. it’s all i can think about, so it is constant sorrow for me right now. (and no, it isn’t a significant other, family, or a friend.)

there are so many other things, but my mind is too clouded by grief to even think about everything that’s bothering me. i’ve been trying so hard to avoid my emotions, but the pain is too much to avoid. my mind is all over the place. i don’t even know what to do anymore.

i’m so tired of feeling these emotions, and if this is all life is, then i don’t want to live it.

It’s also not to be confounded with being useful as that can be nice but you know deep down it’s just cause you can provide a service/are helpful and you’re just making their life easier.

3970,Lost-Object-9701,1649316674,1,"This may be a kinda random post, and maybe it's because I'm still getting used to reddit.

I often find myself 'hovering' here, feeling like posting but not knowing what to post. Like all my thoughts would become split into multiple subreddits if I tried to really make a post with everything I wanted to say to the people I wanted to say it to. I don't even know. Reddit seems to be a great place for likeminded people on a topic to quickly connect with a community, but a lot of subreddits that are based around emotions, mentalities and social themes themselves are kinda narrow in scope, when there's a lot of interconnectedness between these themes. I understand the logic of why subreddits have narrow rules, but, at least for me, I feel like my posts about loneliness, anxiety, depression, breakups, and relationships, etc need to all be a smaller, more catered to a specific subreddit. I feel like this subreddit is the sort of middle ground between itself, r/anxiety, r/breakups and r/depression. But even then, I still feel like the potential for lonely people to find exactly what *they* need on an individual basis is inefficient and not optimal. Not trying to bash any of the aforementioned subreddits, though, as again, I understand the logic. I just feel a bit of the irony. 

Hm..... keeping this personal to myself, I guess what's best for me to say is that even though my life could be considered to be stuck in 'development hell', it's a waste to someone out there, somewhere, specific but undefined, for me *not* to listen to what they'd have to say, with whom I'd feel I can personally have a meaningful connection with. 

I think that a prominent aspect of being lonely is not talking to people frequently, but sometimes I see posts where people either don't understand that loneliness isn't treatable or curable in the same way for everyone, or they attempt to demean those that don't connect with them. The truth for many (but not all) people on this sub is that they post here, but the type of person that would best suit their emotional needs, to fill that loneliness, is something predetermined. This is why there are posts by people on here who say that they talk to people, or even have a significant other, but they still feel lonely, let alone lonely enough to post that they're lonely on r/lonely. It can be a need for a specific type of close friend, or it can be an issue of heartbreak, though this sub only partially caters to the latter, like many, rather than fully to the former.

I hope that this post resonates with some of you, and doesn't get taken down over a technicality. Remember that although this is a great resource, it isn't perfect, and sometimes isn't even great. It's situationally useful, and there's luck involved, and chemistry. And I hope that everyone finds what they desire, or what they didnt know that they needed until it comes along, in due time.",lonely,"Subreddits, Subdividing Thoughts &amp; Misconceptions about Loneliness",2022-04-07 17:31:14

I will never be good enough no girl will ever want me... And why would she... Health problems, depression, losing my hair, small dick, not great in bed. I have nothing to offer. Except one thing that I will be there for her with everything I got. But that clearly doesn't matter. All that matters is to be good looking, have money, good in bed and that you can play the game. That I has been really clear. My life is fucked on all fronts. Everything is going to shit and I can't do anything about it. Doctors words “you have done everything by the book and you couldn't have done anything differently “ so I sit here no hope whatsoever. I wake up every morning feeling shit physically. Feels like I got hit by a truck. Every single fucking morning. And being a man in all this means that no one cares. If I just tell a girl 20% of what's going on in my life she is gone. So if I can't “ provide “ den I'm not worth anything ha? And don't even get me started on tinder... Is It to much to ask for to be treated like an human being? That all I fucking ask for!! But no. And Reddit.... This place has caused me so much pain. The very very few that answer my posts this I what I get. “ I won't ghost you “ if I don't write I never hear from them. “ you have been beyond annoying “ after I hopped up that I'm not feeling good at all. I'm just fucking done. I have nothing absolutely nothing. And will never get it...


I have hydrosefalus. It has to do with the water that protects the brain. It's constantly changing. But my water didn't disappear they wey it should. So I have a small pump whit a small plastic tube implanted. And when everything works as it should. I'm normal. Sadly it malfunctioned so I ended up having six surgeries in one year 5 years ago. And because of that I now have brain tiredness. And that changes my whole life. I have to meditate every 2 -3 hours, I can only walk 200-300m now after a big setback, I can't be in a large group of people. And if a push too much I risk collapsing. And for the past 5 years, I have had so many setbacks. A half a year ago I was up on 700m two times a day. Now it's only 200-300m two times a day. So it feels like it doesn't matter how much I fight I always end up on step one again. I tried some meds a few months ago that would both give my brain more energy and to prevent big setbacks. Sounds good right? But no. 32 days in my pulse is between 130-94 ( when im in bed ) stopped with them So now I'm back on step one again and in even worse conduction than before. So everything I try fails 7 years of fighting has taken me nowhere. I have never been a lucky person and I never will be. I play all my cards right play by the rules.

3982,SeriousPuppet,1649312660,1,"I met a girl recently. I went for a casual meal with some friends from our rec sports team. They said the hostess was into me. They nudged me to ask her out. I told them I'll come back another time and do it as she seemed busy (which I knew I probably wouldn't). Long story short I got up the nerves to ask her out and we've been hanging out the past few weeks. 

But, had I not been on this rec team, I would not have gone to that restaurant. It wasn't even my idea. I just tagged along. 

So yeah. If you're not sure what you can do to ""get involved in something"" my advice would be to start with a team sport. soccer, softball, volleyball, anything. Something super casual of course if you're not athletic. Or heck I guess you could try a book club or cooking class or something like that. I'm sure there's lots of stuff out there, I just happen to do sports because I think it's good to move the body and it's fun. But I get it if that seems intimidating. 

But do something. Don't just sit at home playing video games and watching youtube videos and then complain that you never meet anyone. You have to go out and do stuff. 

When I first started playing casual sports I didn't meet anyone. It took a while. Don't rush it. Just go out and try and keep doing it, week after week, month after month, year after year. You just might end up making some friends or even better, find that special someone.",lonely,"My advice: get involved in something, get out n about",2022-04-07 16:24:20

4007,chubbywubbyx,1649302421,1,"I think the reason why I’m so lonely now is because of the past relationships that I’ve been in. Not just romantic ones but friendships also where people used me until they didn’t need me anymore. Because of that I noticed that I have developed a mindset now when I do meet new people or even people that I am already kind of close with that I try to keep things to myself as much as possible. I restrict myself from talking  unless I’m spoken to and even then when I do talk, I don’t say much because i’m afraid that people will take advantage of me or that I’m being too much of a nuisance. Guess it’s a way for me to cope now in order for me to not get hurt again.  I know it’s not a healthy mindset for me to be in which is why I finally came to the realization that isolating myself wont make anything better. I have told my mom about how I was feeling and she told me to just take chances. But taking chances to me is such a scary void to be in. I think I need to work on myself a little bit more in order to fully understand what I want in a romantic relationship/friendship. I do know that I am pretty shy/ submissive when it comes to speaking my mind or setting boundaries. I think it’s because of the  people pleaser in me. I really don’t want to upset other people because of my wants and just because confrontation is such a scary thing to me. I’ve noticed now that this is quite detrimental to my mental health…

Before bed I always imagine in a perfect world where I’m in a healthy relationship with someone, someone that understands my struggles and is there for me when I’m working on them. I also want to be a helpful person in that sense too for someone. But I doubt that will ever happen to me.. If it did, I know this will help me become a little bit more out spoken and such and that I can grow to become a little more confident in my personality, the way I look and more. I know this is going to be a hard journey and I guess I’m ready to take it on if I do find that spark in someone. I just need a bit of a push. But I’m scared at the same time..

4028,panda_paul_45,1649295028,1,"This is a long post and also my first.I don't know if anyone is really going to read this but just know I writing this just so I can talk to someone. 

Just turned 21 and have no friends. I lost contact with them when they went to study at uni and have not talked to them or anyone since. Its been 3 years now and they have enjoyed themselves going out to partying socialising and being independent. I live with my parents but I'm just a burden on them.I go to college come home and stay in my room.Just what I deserve.  I didn't go uni because of the bad grades I got.Im am an embarasment to my family. This obviously what I deserve but I cant stop this feeling of sadness. Which I am angry with myself about because I did this to myself even with all the privilege I have.Me pitying myself became a thing then getting angry at myself to think i can do that even with all the advantages i have in life compared to someone in a worser situation.This thinking put me in a loop of pity and anger at myself to the piont i have just given up. I am just useless and feel lost. I literally don't feel anything anymore. 

I try to give myself reasons for why I have done this to myself like my parents being strict, not allowing me to voice a opinion. Not being able to answer back to my parents if something is wrong.If I wasn't in the wrong for something, I don't really say anything and take the blame. Being scared of my parents. Being so introverted.

These things may sound bad but I didn't think I was able to ask for anything or speak up because I did so bad at school. One example is when I came back from school I would say I had a test results and I got a B. Being me i would be so happy with myself becuase i worked hard.But my father would say why didn't you get A then .He would complain to me I'm always on my phone and not doing anything.This happened so often I gave up trying to study. A poor excuse I know.I know he wants the best for me.

He would say this when he gets back from work or on weekends 
Father: what have you been doing since morning 
Me: studying (This is a default response i had to make becuase i found out anything else i said  he would get angry at)
Father:so you have been studying for 6 hours
Me: no i studied 3hours
Father: what time did you start
Me: 11am 
Father: really are you sure(he would say in a sarcastic tone).What are going to do now
Me: study


This would be the general conversation I would have with my father since I was a child.
This would be so constant I would just say study if he said what I did today.If he would ask how did a test go I would just say OK I wouldn't even bother giving a result.With this I became introverted staying in my room so I wouldn't be criticised asoon as I got home from school. Now it's all I do.


But these are all just excuses I make for myself i had a ton more but I just forgot about it like I do for most things because nothing seems important to me anymore. 

My parents are good people they came to this country wanting better for me and i have just thrown all their hard work back at their face. Since I was 14 I have just given up and I don't think I will get better.
They aren't bad people i dont think my father knows how much his remarks a berating actually effected me even now.They do support me but their is only so much they can do.To be honest im at that piont where they would disown me and i would find some sort of peace in it.

To sum up I'm just lost in life and I want to get better.Iv become lazy and antisocial I struggle to even brush my teeth and get out of bed. I know this is a long post but I really want to talk to someone. Anyone really. I don't want to say I'm depressed because I don't really feel like killing myself but I have somewhat given up on life.",lonely,Just turned 21 and have no friends.Lost in life,2022-04-07 11:30:28

4032,NorthGrand5694,1649293124,1,"So I've been talking to a person from uni for a few months now, we get on really well and we have a lot in common. Were are both pretty awkward and kinda have an understanding that all our interactions are going to be that way.

Anyway, she's super nice and I like her a lot, the problem is that I can't get my work for uni done. Every time I try and start work, I go back to the previous conversation we had and rethink everything that was said. It's got to a point where I'm unable to write because my thoughts are so clouded with my own negative judgments of what I said. I've never been a social person, if I'm honest before her I only had 1 friend who I've known since I was 14 (I'm around 20)and that's been the norm for me, I'm not used to talking with anyone else and the stress of having to socialise with someone new is destroying me, I started having anxiety attacks which never happened before I met her. She knows about the attacks but I lied about the cause (for reasons that should be clear).

I don't know what to do because I love talking to her but at the same time it's hurting me. I'm used to a very isolated existence, people didn't care about me and I didn't care about them and that's how things went and she changed that by actually showing an interest in me and mentally I can't deal with that, it goes against everything I learnt growing up and I doubt the sincerity of fact someone else could care about me. I feel like going back to isolation is the only option so that I can focus on getting my qualifications which I wasn't even sure I was in a position to get a few years ago.

There's definitely something wrong with my thought patterns and I understand that, but at the same time, there's no way I'll be able to sort through all of that before it starts to ruin my uni work and I destroy all the hard work I've put into this. The only possible short term solution I can see is to stop talking to them so I don't have anything to think or I overthink the previous stuff to death and become unable to think about it anymore.

I’m , a senior in high school, and made a new account just to kinda have my own little world to vent and talk about my feelings without bringing in my hobbies and interests I suppose. 

I was diagnosed with moderate clinical depression and separation anxiety disorder in November of 2021, so still getting acclimated to having a label on my issues 

My mom has always been a strong person for me, but she isn’t always enough when it comes to issues like this. I have an older brother (22) but him and I don’t really open up emotionally well with one another. 

My dad has basically always been in and out of my life since I was like 4 or 5, basically as long as I can remember. Wether it be leaving my mom, leaving to work in another state, or being incarcerated, I’d say the longest he’s been around is probably 3 months at once. 

I don’t really have many friends, nobody seems to share my interests or wants to put up with my emotional rollercoasters. My therapist thinks my dads volatile family relationship has a lot to do with the issues I have. 

Having a real father figure is one of the biggest dreams I have in life, because I’ve essentially had nothing. I’d love to have someone to talk to with life experience who can give me advice and be kind and nurturing. 

I’d also love to make some new friends who have gone what I have gone through and are maybe more understanding that the average people I meet on a daily basis.

4050,Draynior,1649284063,1,"I always had difficulty making friends because of severe bullying when I was a kid and parents who acted like they only had a daughter and left their son on his own.

When I was a teenager I basically got adopted by a friend group but never really felt like they saw me as their friend, over the years they drifted apart from me and only two continued talking to me but I think I just lost both of them in a very short time.

One of them had a girlfriend and never had time to hang out with me which I understand, we also stopped playing together because of that but I still considered him my friend. A few weeks ago he got married at 23, after we had a few beers and he told me we probably wouldn't be able to hang out for some time but we would still talk through texts. Of course I understand that now he has other priorities but it still hurt a little.

The other is a huge super hero fan like me and we went to most movies together the day they released, but looking back he never really initiated conversations, I was the one who always invited him to hang out and saw him posting about being out with friends but he neve invited me. Basically for the last three movies we were interested in seeing I felt he didn't really want to see them with me, for the first movie he said he didn't have money but I offered to pay for his ticket since we're friends but the entire time I felt he didn't really want to be there, for the second I ended up going alone because he had a thing the day I suggested and never responded back when I asked if he wanted to go another day, and today tickets for Dr strange 2 started selling and because I don't have anyone else to see it with me and felt horrible going alone last time I sent him a message and he told me he was going to see it with other people. At this point I just feel like an annoying idiot who just now got the hint.

The worst thing about all of this is that I basically can't even say hi to someone I don't know so even though I'm still young (23) I feel like I'm doomed to being a loner, and wasting my life away until the day I can't do it anymore.",lonely,I don't have friends anymore,2022-04-07 08:27:43

So I'm looking for friends that have hobbies in common with me:

\-I like reading manga, I'm re-reading Spy x Family in anticipation of the anime.

\-Im a big fan of videogames I mostly play single player jrpgs, but I would love to play something together (Xbox, PC, switch, ps, I don't mind.) I would be fun to voice call and play.

\- I like horror movies, maybe we can hope on a video call and watch something together.

\- Are you a fan of dumb jokes and puns, cause I'm all over them.

\- I can also speak Spanish, if you're interested.

\- I have 2 dogs and 2 cats so expect a lot of pictures.

It's an inescapable weight that just sits there on my shoulders like some chain that's connected to an anchor. I hate it. I've felt lonely before, he'll I can't remember a time when I didn't feel lonely. I've always felt lonely my whole life. I've never felt like I fit in anywhere, not even with my own family. I've never felt like I belonged with me family. I always felt different than them and that because of those differences they didn't like me and that they only put up with me and have me around because we're related and because of what I do for everyone. I feel like if weren't related no one in my family would have me around. The only time when I didn't feel lonely was when I was with John and on love. It made all the loneliness go away. Now that that relationship is gone I feel more lonely than ever. Now that I know what love and company feels like, the loneliness feels worse than ever because I know what I've been missing this whole time. Now the loneliness doesn't feel like something that's just there and can just be ignored. Now it's always present and I can't just shove it aside and ignore it. It's all that i can think about anymore. I don't know what to do. I just miss having someone that I could completely be myself with and actually be emotionally vulnerable with. Now that I know what I'm missing I want it again so badly but I don't think that I'll ever find that again. I always thought that I'd be the luckiest person in the world if I found love once in my life and I did and I thought that I found the person that I'd spend the rest of my life with but that obviously didn't work out. I don't think that I'll be the lucky enough to find it again and that's the most depressing thing in the world.

4087,grinninglikeadevil13,1649270107,1,"when i started college last year, I joined a few weeks late due to which I had a hard time finding ""my people"" since everyone had already made friend groups of their own and also the crowd in general was very different from the one in my school and not like the people I was used to hanging out with, which however, was something I was ready to accept. slowly over 1-2 months I found myself as a part of this already existing group of 4 who had all met each other the first day of college and had grown pretty close by the time I was introduced into the group, so naturally, it took time adjusting, getting closer to them, trying to fit in but i never did mind the fact that the four of them were closer to each other than with me because it was understandable and I was sure i'd get there with them eventually.  

now, almost an year and a half later, I still find myself in the same place despite having done everything I could and being there for them in every fucking way possible. I just feel so remote at times that I get overwhelmed with tears. it's like they find me unlikeable or something but for no apparent reason. I feel like what if i'm just imposing myself onto them and annoying them with my presence and making them uncomfortable. we hangout together all day long, they have come over to my place for sleepovers numerous times, we party together, I've been to their homes which is literally in a different city, been to trips and one would say that we were a pretty close group for that fact, yet here i am feeling alienated, like i'm a part of the group just as a formality. I also found out that they have a separate group chat without me calling themselves the og, this was like the final blow, it hurt for some reason, both the fact that the group chat existed and it's title, like why would they need to talk in a separate group chat if not about me? do i make them that uncomfortable? I am also always left out from important details and discussions and sometimes it's like they just forget bout me even when i'm sitting right there with them. it's like my presence or absence doesn't make a difference.  

friends have always been a huge part of my life. I'm one of those people who get way too attached, way too quickly. but seeing that they don't reciprocate the same attachment towards me makes me question why it's just me, why it's 4 vs 1, why is it so hard for them to consider as much a part of the group as the rest? and all of this just leads me down this overflowing train of thought every once in a while and i end up feeling so choked up on emotions and start to cry alone. they make me feel like shit about myself. all of this has been so bad for my mental health for the past few months and has made my anxiety even worse. it's like i'm walking on eggshells around them, fearing that anything i say or do will make me even more unlikeable in their eyes. and i have never faced such an issue, I have always been very lucky when it comes to friends, it has always been so easy for me.

a friend suggested that the best I can do is to *emotionally distance* myself from them for the sake of my own mental health, but i just don't know how, like i said, I get way too attached.  

*tldr-* despite being together for almost 2 years now, I feel like my friend group (who were all friends before i joined the group) dislikes me or just isn't affected by my presence or absence in the group.

4097,yummyyummytrash,1649266460,1,"My experience with making friends for the past many seconds...

I meet too many people that have no interest in getting to know you. They ask empty questions and get empty responses, without ever connecting with you on an emotional level of any sort. An example of this is someone I knew, whom every time they hit me up, they'd just ask me the equivalent of ""how's your cat?"". Literally what. Why do people like this exist, should I give you my cat's number instead of mine, if you're not even here to talk about me but rather my goddamned cat. That's just an extreme example of course. Others will have you as the center subject of conversation but with no real substances - asking you questions as if it's an interview and never speaking to you again afterwards,  because they based their impression of you on something like your career choice I guess, rather than learning about who you are intellectually and emotionally.

The other side of this madness are individuals who put no effort into molding their new friendships. They will hope everything will fit perfectly right off the bat. If anything is off, they will call it off. It's so incredibly easy to ditch people on the internet and move onto the next person, as if friendships are mass-produced or something. If someone says something nonchalant, then things get awkward very quickly and people give up instantly. They don't try to communicate their feelings, they don't try to establish any boundaries, things just fall apart immediately because people don't have any mental integrity for any sort of inherent awkwardness that comes with socializing, no, rather they have some romanticized ideals that they get from Disney movies, on how interactions must go down.

I'm no stranger to succumbing to this kind of madness either, social anxiety gets the better of me all too often and I become too frightened to try and mend the awkwardness. Sometimes I find the energy to try and endure storm, but people often show little interest in trying to make this friendship work themselves. If they get awkward and less talkative, then quickly hopelessness will ensue and the desire to keep persisting dies off, all because we could not communicate our thoughts clearly enough the first time around. 

This is the main reason loneliness is so predominant in my life - people are too unwilling to try because of their own ideals and anxieties.",lonely,Why am I still lonely?,2022-04-07 03:34:20

4109,JimmyTheDoomed,1649261615,1,"38/M here, used to lurking on Reddit and finally made an account the other day.

I guess this is all a culmination of my experiences and choices and I'm worried that it'll be like this forever.

My life has been marked by long periods of loneliness, even as a kid. A quick rundown of growing up: oldest of 5, life with the parents was as cliche as it gets: drugs, alcohol, me on eggshells and some fear. I was the black sheep to my 'father', I took to books and solitude unlike my siblings. Foster care at age 7, then again at 15 (aged out of the system).

I never connected well with friends or family growing up on that household. In junior high and high school, I was that 'friend' that followed people around like a puppy and often ran into manipulative people. Worst of them was M, who stole from me and punched me more than a few times.

Fast forward to 19, my first major relationship ended (and even after talking to her 15 years later, I'm still not sure why) and I turned into a freeloader on couchs. The one guy, R, who actually was a friend eventually kicked me out and I completely understand why.

Ended up living with my father again, cue that fearful eggshell feeling. First thing he said when I moved in was ""You can get a job and we can get all the kids back together again."" Meanwhile, he was pouring a bottle of Jim Beam into a stryofoam cup of Pepsi. That stuck with me. At a time when my self-esteem was pretty much tanked because the break up and losing my job prettyuch days apart.

I ended up with the company that I'm still with after 17 years. During that time, my loneliness got the better of me and I started internet dating this woman who lived in another state and was 20 years my senior (at the time, I was about 21). I eventually moved into my own place and moved her in with me. I found out afterwards, that the whole time on the internet, she was in a relationship and living with that person. But when I found out, it was pretty much too late.

We were together for about 7 years. To boil it down to its basics, she wanted someone to take care of her. I worked, cooked, cleaned, etc. I had no friends, it was just the two of us. If I was late coming home (didn't have a mobile at the time), I'd come into her crying, that sort of thing. We married briefly to get my insurance to cover her. I was extremely miserable.

Miserable enough that I did something I never thought I would. I asked for a divorce. Three years prior, I had transferred from an office of 500 to an office of 11, and they had no problem making it clear that I needed to do something about it. Lots of getting cried at, angry calls from her family, but I figured it was going to happen.

After the separation, I spent some time getting in touch with some guys I rolled with back in high school (not the best choice, I ended up smoking again; no longer talking to them for other reasons). Lost a lot of weight, felt good about myself for once. Started dating eventually, that destroyed those good feelings. E, wasn't over her ex (completely understandable). A was a serious relationship, until she met someone else (she has no problem telling later about all her... partners during our relationship, mind you I was led to believe it was monogamous). A few first dates that never went anywhere and my self-esteem tanked again.

I also started working. A lot. I became a 'star employee', dedicating everything to the job when it was really just to fill time. I honestly believed that all I was going to do was work until my time was up. I had no friends. I should note hear, I tend to spoil friends because I don't want them to leave like they do, and of course, the only people I had were because I spent on them. Once I started clamping down on that (I nearly lost everything on a couple of exes), they obviously went away. I stopped trusting people's motives. And I ended up in a rut, just working and sleeping and feeling miserable. Sundays, I ran errands or played video games and watch the clock.

And things were to turn around. Or at least, I had hoped.

I managed to get in touch with family I hadn't talked to in 30 years through one of those genetic ancestry programs. They had moved across the country when I was about 7 and of course, with my parents the way they were, I lost contact. My cousin convinced me to get out of that rut, especially the working myself to death part (I was usually at work at least 6-6 everyday, not counting Sundays). My aunt opened a room to me, so I transferred across the country (stuff was getting crazy with management where I was, so two birds, one stone).

I suppose being so disconnected from people, family, the world, I got too clingy. Always wanting to hang out with my cousin (she gets my sense of humor and we like similar movies), wanting to be a part of the family, wanting to contribute. Stressing them out, stressing out their way of life. They've shut me out. My uncle (lives in a different house but over everyday and reminds me way too much of my father) very clearly laid down rules to me, boiling down to 'don't talk to my cousin', 'sit down and shut up', and (I quote) 'just stop trying', and 'don't respond with anything but ok' (I had to force myself to delete those texts because they were making me sick to my stomach).My sister (the only other sibling smart enough to get away from our father) thinks it's because he sees me as my parent's kid, I don't blame him disliking them, they weren't good people. Family out here doesn't talk to my sister anymore either.

Side note here: found out I'm not biologically related to my 'father' (my 'mother' had another boyfriend at the time, according to my aunt). Would explain why I got the worst of it growing up, because apparently he knew about it the whole time.

So now when I'm not at work, I sit quietly in that room, listening to all of them laugh and talk and do stuff and I just stay miserable. I'm working on buying a place (one of the reasons I moved, couldn't afford things back where I was from) and I suppose getting away from that might help my loneliness a bit. My cousin tells me we'll stay close after I move, but that awful lonely gut feeling points at all the people I've lost despite trying so hard. I'll trust her when she says we'll stay in touch, it's all I have.

Here I am now, in a state I'm not familiar with, no social circle (at least back there, I had a former coworker I stayed friends with, spent holidays with her family), just myself. 

But looking over all that, I keep thinking to myself: was I just never good enough for people? Is there any point in trying to associate with others? Did I make a mistake going through with this big life change? Is the rest of my life loneliness due to a life of poor choices and poorer experiences?

I guess this ended up more a pity party than anything else.",lonely,38 and I don't know what I'm doing.,2022-04-07 02:13:35

There's a HUGE cemetery near my house. There are graves from the 1700s to present day. Maybe even older than 1700s because I haven't been through the whole place.

I'm willing to bet some asshole will say they were my friend if I died but yet I haven't seen them in years.

We had a good conversation and then they suddenly turned nasty. I apologised thinking it was something I said wring and they said it wasn't good enough and started to gaslight and get agressive. I told them to stop calmly multiple times and said I didn't understand what was wrong. They then reacted childishly and said to work it out. I said I felt stressed and that they were overreacting and I was sorry for any misunderstanding. Again, not good enough. So then they kept saying lets move on when they saw I was feeling upset, because I really can't handle any stress or drama. I said lets, but they kept going on and on. I have to eat lunch soon and someone else started to message me about problems they were having so I started to feel overwhelmed. I asked them to stop again and said I'd talk later or I'd babe to mute them because I didn't want to argue. They then said I was being shitty for saying that and kept on still. So now I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack and had to just tell them that and that I'll talk later  they messaged again but I've just ignored it to give myself room to breathe.

I had these big aspirations to make a big friend group and go to football games and party but I was just fooling myself with how bad my social anxiety is.  I haven’t made a single real friend. A few weeks ago I nearly died from a Xanax overdose. The friends I did have back home turned away. My best friend who I love more then anything called me a crackhead and they offered no support. She sends me half ass snap chat convos  like once a week and I’m trying to remain strong and ignore her because she broke my heart and left me at my lowest. I am alone. I live alone and am trying so hard to appear friendly so people will talk to me. I had a psychedelic trip last week that changed my mindset. Simply I found god. I want to let you guys know that you aren’t alone. Two weeks ago I believed in no god. I thought if there was one he had turned his back on me. But I was wrong. I turned my back on him. It still sucks to be alone but I try to find strength through Christ. I don’t mean a man in the sky with the beard I mean the energy that connects us to every living thing on this planet.

4144,fit-n-happy,1649240194,1,"According to [The hierarchy of needs](https://imgur.com/a/NpPTpBM) some sense of belonging is essential for even reaching the ideal amount of natural motivation for personal growth.

I think thats kind of bullshit. I don’t want to be constantly distracted by some subconscious caveman needs. I have actual passions that i want to focus on, and having friends is not one of them. Like sure, wouldn’t that be nice. Maybe it will happen one day. But I don’t think I really have that much control over it, so it would be nice if i could shut my stupid brain up until then and just focus on what I actually care about.

I’ve read of some people having just a stronger motivation to belong and those are the people who feel the least statisfies with their current relationships, are more prone to loneliness and seek the approval of others the most. Idk if I’m one of those people, it doesn’t matter. But I would really like a way to become less like them. I don’t want to want to belong. 

Loneliness is such a dumbass emotion, humans just are dependent on something they don’t physically need and is a lot of times unachievable and feel like shit until they’ve got it. If some alien species starts using as a pets we’d have to be sold like guinea pigs.

4154,PachuliKing,1649232138,1,"I enjoy a lot of things in life, but I think my Achilles heel is love, and I mean love in general, but mostly in a relationship.

*I love love*

I never had a lot of love in my life. Apart from my group of friends and a girlfriend (now ex) that is the best person that will ever exist, I really never had what can be even considered the minimum of love in a human life, so I know what I'm writting here can be nothing but the frustrations of a loser. Still, I love love. I love everything about it. When I was about to accept that maybe I'm here not to have love, I simply couldn't. That would destroy me.

Seriously, there's nothing that can make me happier than human affection in the form of love. I even love to see it when I'm not receiving it. Watching random couples at the subway, families at Walmart, groups of friends being stupids together... that just fills my soul.

I'm jewish. I trust Hashem's wisdom in everything he does. I used to feel a bit upset to him and disappointed and even reached depression. Now that's over, I don't feel like a useless object because I know the Creator loves me, but then when I'm not looking at him, head up, and I look at the society, head down, I'm practically unexistent. Yet, I love love.

*I basically hate people*

I think I have a lot of awesome things to share with people -isn't an important part of love to share?- but I've never felt like a person ever really cared or realized how awesome they can be. 99% of the times people talk to me nicely just because they just have plans on how to take advantage of something they know I have. They make me feel like the most fucking useless piece of shit ever. That my role in this world is basically to be there for other people like an old coat. Damn, I even dated a girl (we didn't turn to become a couple) for a year and a half that knew I had a lot of problems trusting people and feeling like nothing, and when I needed her the most and told her that the world broke my heart she simply fucking told me: well, that's how everyone is, so don't expect nothing different from me. How am I supposed to trust people when literally almost everyone is that shitty?

So I don't know what else to do. This feels like the ultimate fight between my heart and my brain. My religion says that the brain should rule the heart and so I think and practice, but I can't just tell my heart to stfu. That's just who I am. I've had to change a lot of things of myself just because of shitty peoplem, just because I don't want people like that hurting me again or because they left me traumas, but this? I'm not willing to change something so important to me in order to fit better. And when I fit better I'm talking about basically taking my heart of my body so I can't feel anymore.",lonely,"I just love love so much that I can't stop searching it, but then I hate people so much that I don't even know what to do",2022-04-06 18:02:18

Some might think like ""If they really love you, they would understand what I'm going through"" or something like that but I think those kind of relationship will most likely end breaking us more because the idea of relationship is just to relieve sadness, loneliness.

So I moved back to my home town in an apartment by myself I have a couple of close friends that I talk to everyday from high school but they are all men. I can't truly explain it but it feels like my purpose has vanished I kept telling myself that it will get better once I get a new job and start talking to more people. But here I am with a new job some new friends still feeling hollow as if an essential part of me has been lost. How can I regain what I have lost? Will there ever be another person for me like Adr?

I don’t give myself credit for the things I have accomplished all of the time. Then when I think about love and life it’s self. I ask myself am I good enough and then think of the past and see that maybe I should have given the past relationship another chance and maybe I wouldn’t feel like this. The way I see it is like this I saw a video when I was just coming out and had my first break up. It was about compromising in a relationship. Eartha Kitt (May she Rest In Peace) she was speaking to a reporter and he asked her would she compromise in a relationship. Eartha Kitt laughed in his face and said and I quote “ Compromise, what is compromise? I don’t need to compromise anything. I love myself enough to want to share myself with someone. No compromise.” That video plays in my mind often especially when I think of am I good enough. Am I wrong to think like that i don’t think I should compromise for anything. Now yes In the past it’s been hard for me to love myself but I’m getting there now. Shouldn’t that be enough? So am I good enough for love?

4185,SubtleSerenity,1649217540,1,"sorry in advance for my poor grammar, I've never been good at it.

I'm so tired of this constant loneliness. I have this constant feeling in my gut that just gets worse when I remember how alone I am. I live alone, I work alone, I go to bed alone, I wake up alone, etc and I'm just not okay with it anymore. I got my own place about 5 months ago after having lived with my mom and brother until then. I didn't realize how much I valued and  liked having them around until after I moved out. I've been pretty anti social since high school and never had a group of friends and that is still true today. Other than my mom and brother I have no one I can turn to in my local area. No one I can laugh with, no one to talk about hobbies with, no one to turn to when I'm upset or need someone's opinion, etc... And more than anything that is what I want most, an emotional connection with someone, a friend. I do have a gaming group but I have never felt like “part of the group” if that makes sense, and I know an only online friendship is not healthy for that to be my only social interaction . I also have someone named Chris who I also met while gaming. We've known each other since middle school and I cherish having him in my life. We've only met up a couple of times, but each was some of the best fun I've had. But since he lives on the other side of the country meeting up isn't something we can always do.

I'm trying to get over this rut, but I don't really know where or how to start. Anytime I want to put myself out there I remember just how socially inept I am. I feel like I’m just this monotone boring person that no one will like and just move away from if I go to any social situations. I'm getting into therapy next month and I'm really hopeful that will help and I'm really looking forward to it. On my days off I keep having the desire to go out and just do something whether that be seeing a movie or going to a museum. Just doing anything to get out of my apartment, but I never do.

Maintaining them was never hard either, but now I question why I feel like there's sonething missing.

I feel guilty for feeling like something is missing. But there is this frustration I have when all my friends go to a concert. I never know who to ask to the concerts I want to go too.  There is this frustration I have when I want to go do anything like try a new restaraunt, go to a bar, because I know my friends don't want to.

And i try thinking well its fine I can try their interests (which i do) and which i enjoy at times but i feel like im pretending. And i just feel tired. So more often than not I skip out on their group hang outs with stuff I just cant pretend I like doing. 

I want more friends/ new friends but I also feel guilty/selfish that I can't be happy with what Ive got? And that im never going to find anyone who likes the same things I do (who won't leave). 
Like Ive made new friends in the past couple years who moved away, ones who I thought ah finally someone new experiences common interests. But they moved so i just yeah.

I think itd be idiotic to bring this up to my friends who i feel like im growing apart from.

I dont want to lose them.  But i also dont know how to just make sense of how im feeling. If this is just a phase or are all friendships doomed to be outgrown?

This was basically my life. My ""freinds"" would do stuff together all the time and I would feel extremely left out. They always spoke to me as if I had brain damage. They would always be nice to me almost as if they pitied me.

But because it was long distance, and I just got too used to her, I think I started taking her for granted. I wanted to tell her I wanted to break up with her for a long time, but she brought it up to me first. At first I was relieved to be alone again, had some time to myself and my friends. But now that she's gone I'm really feeling like something is missing. We're still friends and we talk every now and then, but it's not the same, and it hurts. I've also forgotten how horrible the dating scene is, and why I wanted so bad to get into a relationship in the first place. These women do not try at all to have a conversation, because they have hundreds of guys in line to take my place. I'll get over her eventually, but falling asleep these days really suck. I should stop but I still fall asleep hugging the pillow she got me, and have kept all the stuff she gifted me. And it seems like she already has moved on, because she sent back almost everything I gave her, and she doesn't seem to mention it much.

4212,Eequal,1649206998,1,"Loneliness isn’t the greatest thing in the world. Guess what else isn’t? Eggplants. I mean who would want to eat those weird plants let alone drowning them in a pot full of grease? And the skin… ugh. What makes my mind at peace is finding something I hate, and looking for something else I can hate more so that I can distract my mind from the root issue. Because living in denial is one my key skills as a functioning adult. But I digress. 

Being hornely (horny and lonely) made me appreciate aspects of my life that were so easy for me to ignore. Take for example the creative ways of hiding key evidence after consuming pron. Although there’s one true method of doing so, the mind is constantly at work to find a new, and a better way to conceal the murder weapon. Nature never ceases to amaze me. Speaking of nature, do you know that my brain sometimes encourages me to seek solitude and stay away from nasty, angry, poo poo people, because they might say something hurtful about me and I’ll hide so fast the continuation of what they wanted to say will be in my… imagination?

Honestly, everything about me being lonely and horny makes sense. I never seek people out. I mean who would want to go out with someone like me? I’m not rich, or good at conversations. People feel awkward around me, and stop talking the moment I make my grand appearances. I mean if I’m denied relationships then why won’t someone send me, via email, the reasons I got rejected? 

“Dear Eequal,

You are bad. You are so bad at this. Please be good. Because good is better.

Stop begging for clues. 

Yours,
Nature”

If I got signs from whoever it is about my performances, I may be in a situation better suited for relationships. Like out of my room? Away from my computer and video games? Yeah, but that’s an impossibility. Nature doesn’t give out free evaluations to randos. Maybe it does? Maybe life is just a dream, and we can mold this dream to our likings. If I started to think too hard about something, and focus all my mental gymnastics in that one thing, it’s ought to manifest in one of those dreams, one night. Or it may give me a sleep paralysis… Nah, that’s just me being superstitious.

That’s all what I wanted to say. Loneliness is horrible. But you know what else is? You guessed it. Egg-fucking-plants.",lonely,Making fun out of my loneliness,2022-04-06 11:03:18

Fortunately my grades haven’t been suffering but it’s hard to for me to feel like any of it is worth anything if I can’t make a single friend who actually cares about me.

The worst part about it is that I had a close friend group in high school and a few of them go to the same college as me, but they all very quickly found their own friend groups. They have no use for me anymore and probably wouldn’t notice if I died. Every single time I come across them it’s just a constant reminder that they’re better off than me. I can’t even bear to look at our high school group chat anymore because whenever one of them talks about whatever stuff they’re doing with their friends it just feels like a punch to the gut. This obviously isn’t their intention but it still makes me feel like shit.

I feel like I just am severely jealous of them for having what I don’t, but being at the same college makes it very hard to avoid that fact. In some respects I feel like I should be happy that I have any friends at all, but the way things currently are I feel like it’s hurting me more than it’s helping.

I'm open to talk about anything you'd like :D

After I left college when I was 18 I stopped talking to people I went to college with unless they spoke to me in the first year of leaving college only got one or two messages I grew accustomed to not talking to people. I got my first job after leaving college doing seasonal work in a factory work for about 8-9 months of the year had the other months off, it was a good job for me who wasn’t interested in making friends and the staff turnover rate is very high the person your working with one day you might never see again after the next day. I still work in that factory now got to know some of the people who work there all year round but wouldn’t really call any of them my friends they don’t know anything about me and I don’t know anything about them just come to work, work together have a chat mostly about work then go home. About a year ago I changed jobs in the factory came off the shop floor and moved to work in the office all year round. Whilst training for this new job the girl that was doing at that time was training me she was only a year older then me and had a lot of similar interest during my time training with her (2 weeks) I grew quite fond of her looking back I wouldn’t say I was romantically interested in her but at the time I was thinking about her a lot I believe this was because she was very kind to me even though I only knew her for two weeks she brought some food to work for me due to a celebration/holiday from her home country, praising me for understanding my new job quickly just generally being a nice person to me something I don’t experience a lot of. Now this girl was leaving work I know that before even meeting her but I grew very fond of her so when she did leave I felt very down and lonely something I haven’t felt before didn’t feel like this when I stopped talking to people I had known through out my entire education or when I left college and stopped talking to this girl I was very close with who I hanged around with after college everyday. I felt like this for a couple of weeks lost my appetite lost motivation to do my hobbies I even talked to someone at work about it to try and get some help. I tried messaging this person and it did help a bit but it was a very small conversation and we haven’t spoke again since then. After a few weeks the feeling subsided and I got my appetite back and back into my hobbies and my normal self of not really wanting to get to know people only talking to them if they talk to me. But my problem is now it’s happening again met another girl at work this time quite a few years older then me about 8 I think, she does the seasonal work and has just left and now I’ve got the same low feelings, she was also nice to me and someone I actually enjoyed talking to about anything on her last day instead of going home at 5 like I usually do I went to go find her and talk to her until she finished a few hours later.

4242,TemporaryAdvanced,1649187261,1,"21M here. I feel this constant mental stress from seemingly everything in my life every day. From lacking both friends and a romantic relationship.

I have basically no friends. The couple of ""friends"" I have, have been trying to get to play some online game that I don't care about. I thought I might give it a shot anyway just to have something to do with them. We play a bit, I'm not that intrigued but I don't hate it either.

A few days later, I check Discord, 2-3 of them are playing without me. A couple of days later, they mention each other on a server to see if they want to play. Not one of them mentions me. I decided to tell them myself that I'm joining for one game. We play, they get mad at me for playing poorly even though they're the ones who told me to play with them in the first place.

I wonder why I'm playing poorly in this game that I just started playing a few days ago, still don't fully understand, and my account is at a low level, hmmm...

Ever since, I just see 2-4 of them playing on Discord almost every day without me. I stopped playing. Most of them stopped talking to me.

On the relationships side. I knew this girl a couple of year ago from college. Haven't talked to her in a while since we choose different paths in college. She seemed nice. But I never really expected to have anything meaningful with her. Even our friendship was fairly surface level. So, I never told her about my feelings for her.

A few days ago, she called me. Where I live, there's a bit of a national holiday thing happening so I thought she was just calling to say happy holidays or best wishes or whatever.

Last time we had an online chat was over a year ago. Last phone call was even longer ago. Apart from some happy coincidences running into each other in college and chatting for a couple of minutes, we haven't talked much in a while. So, for obvious reasons, seeing her name on a call on my phone came off as a real surprise. One that made me happy for a few seconds until I picked up. And she said that she called me by mistake lmao.

That's all she could say after we haven't been in contact for this long. To alleviate some of awkwardness, I said happy holidays, she said the same, and we hung up. I guess I was naive to think I had a chance when I saw her name on my phone before answering the call after this much time had passed.

Anyway, I'm not sure why I wrote all this. I went to a therapist a while ago, and got somewhat better. Guess it doesn't last forever considering that I feel low enough to need to vent like this.

4247,THE01X,1649183255,1,"TLDR: Me venting about not making many friends in a foreign school, and I think it's because of  my personality and how I express it.      

Since I got graduated from high school and started studying engineering in a foreign country, I wasn't able anymore to have friendships that last or friends that feel really close and genuine. The only friends I have now are the ones who took the same path as me to study in another school. However, due to the distance between where we live/study, they got new friends, and it's like they created a new life, we don't see each other that much, and I feel like I was left behind.

I've talked to many people and worked with many others in some projects, but as soon as these projects end it feels like they barely know me, and it's rare to get a ""Hello"" from them when they walk by me in the school hallway. I started having self-esteem issues because I think these people I talk to don't find me interesting. Despite not being a talkative person, I always tried to take initiative in being interested in others and asking them questions about themselves to initiate conversations. However, I'm an introvert and that's really tiring, especially when I feel like they are not interested, and recently I don't do it anymore, and I just sit there.

I thought about it so many times now, people don't get interested in knowing me because of the way I express myself, I think I give off the vibe that I am boring and uninteresting due to my expressionless face and weak voice even though I'm a big guy I have a very little presence. I'm jealous of people that just walk in and can say something funny with a big wide smile and huge positive energy and everyone gathers around them. If I was able to do that, maybe people will want to spend more time with me and like me in general, and might get to have meaningful friendships and some social attention. The only way that I made friends before was because we were in a small class and I saw them almost every day. But now it's harder because the people around me change occasionally, and also because it's difficult to make casual talk in a foreign language...

There are many things on my mind that I wanted to say, like not having a significant  other and feeling that I'm not loved enough... I didn't want this venting post to go that long.

Thank you for reading this long post. I just wanted to get some off my chest.

I love you.",lonely,How do you make friendships that last,2022-04-06 04:27:35
4248,verylikelydepressed,1649183170,1,"Despite feeling so alone, I can't help but push people away. I feel like all I do is hurt the people around me, and I don't want to subject them to it any further. My very existence feels wrong. I don't deserve to be loved. I've somehow tricked people into thinking I do and the guilt feels like it's clawing away at my throat. 

But I'm drowning in loneliness. I get up, stay in the same four walls day in and day out, and barely have any interaction with others. I'm so tired, I can't bring myself to try anymore. I'm past the point of being able to care to try again. What's the point? Everything I do still makes me feel this way, I've never been able to shake it off. I'm always going to be this way.

4249,cooblat,1649182398,1,"Like, for real. I was blindfolded by my activites since 3 years, and a month ago, on a boat trip, where I had an enormous amount of free time, of course it was nearly impossible to talk to my friends irl, but, I'VE GOT NO ONE TO CHAT WITH. 

(20m for context)

I have some friends, but let's be honest, among them, only one would take new from me if I disapeared for at least a month, the others? Hell noooo...

Since my parents got dicorced, I moved 3 times in 5 years, and holy fuck that already made social life hard to me, as a relatively shy and introverted guy. 

My first and only relationship? Lasted 3 months before having to move away suddenly? Great feeling honestly! 

My family? Thinks that I'm emotionless and have absolute no feelings, I cry at every movie and watching a bee miss her flower makes me sad...

I don't know what to do, I got my car recently, but I'm 20 and I already work, unlike every fucking person at my age, it makes it so hard to meet new people...

I was hapoy before, I am very lucky, got everything in life to make me happy, a cool work, enough money, great activities and hobbies, energy, hope... 

BUT I FREAKING CRAVE THE ONLY THING I DON'T HAVE.

Friendships and relationships, honestly I'd give a lot tl have those... 
I feel like my heart is broken although I've almost never truly fell in love. 

And here I amw finding myself listenning to a violon melody at 2 am, dehydrating my whole body just by crying... (THAT SONG IS FIRE THOUGH hmu if you wanna share sad music) 

Like idk, I have great moods, but sometimes, It's hitting hard. And I never really felt that, at the point where I feel stress and heat in my chest when I think about it at night! 

Idk...

4250,antinataIism,1649181041,1,"I've been longing for love for a long time. I try to focus on myself, I try to self-improve, do hobbies but the only thing that is truly missing is love. I know I am young but so far it hasn't been great, I've put a lot of effort into dating and haven't found anyone for me.   


I feel like I am missing out on young love, and I know I might find someone in the future... but later there will be more responsibilities, expectations of having children (and I do not want to have kids) and overall tiredness of everyday life.  


I dream about just the regular lovey-dovey stuff. Touch is my love language and I seriously enjoy cuddling, it changes my mood a lot for better. But I haven't cuddled in years. I love cute things and I would like to go for picnics, bike rides, trips, bake cakes together, listen to music while cuddling and kissing, touch each other's hair, talk about everything, make jokes and laugh, stare at the stars... You get it. All of the cliche romantic stuff but what's funny I don't even really watch or read romances. That's just how I always imagined a relationship for me.

I struggle with insecurity about my appearance as well as with low social anxiety. I don't think that there is anything really wrong with me except of my height. I am short which makes me figuratively and literally invisible to most women. A 5'5"" man was short 100 years ago, and today? It's ridiculous how tall people are around me, and self-affirmations, faking confidence can only do so much when you feel like a hobbit surrounded by giants every time you go out.   


I work at home and I don't have many opportunities to be around women, and everytime I go out for walks, I feel anxiety when I am around people. It's manageable and I do everything OK but I am non stop tense in public and I prefer to avoid routes with people if possible.  


I know love isn't a fix, I know many relationships are bad or even turn abusive, but being perpetually single and lonely isn't fun either, and hanging out with male friends, doing hobbies, etc. just doesn't fix that longing for a relationship.

Also, I always seem to fall for women who don't reciprocate my feelings. I feel a spark towards them but they don't feel it towards me.

I’m not trying to gatekeep anything here, you can absolutely still be lonely around people, obviously.  But I feel like my situation is slightly different.  

I have no friends.  The last “friend” I had barely talked to me and then asked me to borrow a large sum of money (which I didn’t have anyway) and then ghosted me.  I would never feel comfortable asking an acquaintance money, let alone a large amount.  It felt very insulting. 

 I work in a completely different building than all of my “coworkers” that I am basically managing myself 5 days a week.  Foot-traffic for customers is extremely slow.  Most days I don’t get a single customer or phone call.  The main building is 40 minutes away regardless.  If I had coworkers to interact with I would be 70% less lonely I’m absolutely sure.

I am not dating anyone currently. (Nor do I really want to because of my depression anyway, I’d rather wait until I feel better)

4261,Delicious_Jaguar_690,1649173738,1,"I said earlier that I am not lonely because I have no relationship.

I do not know how I grew up as a child, From the point where my memory started from when I was young, I should say i was not sociality, but there was not much of it.  So I did not have many friends.  I just do not get along with people for some reason.. There were many times when I was alone in elementary school.  I did it a few times in middle school.  It is not that I can not make friends, it is that I am not good at maintaining relationships that are friends.  We got along pretty well in high school, but my friends almost did well in their studies, so they went on to some really good universities.  So, while I was in high school, I was not good at study that much, so the friends sometimes ignored me.  I quit all my high school friends because I thought they did not suit me.  Even when I was in college in Korea, we did not have a good relationship.  With the exception of the guy who was studying and working on a project with me, I was at a level I knew almost nothing about.  I think that person was also with me because I got 2nd-5th grades in the college.

I live abroad.  It is better here.  In Korea, I have no friends and only a few classmates, but here I have people to hang out with even if I am not close.  I do not know why, but even here, meeting Koreans does not work.  A good relationship does not develop with my own country.  At first, the other people approaches first, but after time passes, they leave.  Here, when i travel, there are people who invite him to play together.  But the hardest thing here compared to Korea is that when I meet new people, the other person will be racist or I will be reluctant because I am an Asian.  There is a strong perception that Asians do not speak English.  For example, in Korea, People really tend to not make friends with people from countries such as the Philippines or Uzbekistan.  Because people thought they are just workers. I thought that This human relationship or relationship with people would make an effort, but it was not.  I thought it was because I had not tried hard.

“So when I walk alone or eat alone, I feel very lonely.” But people with a lot of people around me are really strong even when they are alone like this, but I am not like that.  Fortunately, my family works in another city, so we meet occasionally, but it is far away, so we have to take a plane.

Especially at the end of the year, I feel very lonely.  Everyone else is with family or friends, but when I am in this country, I feel more isolated from that society than before.

Or, I doubt that I was originally destined to be lonely.

Not sure if it matters, but I’m 29 (so please don’t kill the vibe and ask again lol, or you can), 6’1” tall, black hair, olive skin and greenish eyes. I’ve been told that I have a great sense of humor, and easy on the eye, humbly! 
I personally find some much common ground with someone who’s witty—some sass is okay too, if used right lol, intelligent, classy, well educated and confident! I think after being sophisticated, confidence is the most attractive trait in person, at least that’s what I think! 
Oh! Lastly, before I forget, please don’t ask rhetorical questions like why are you posting on Reddit… here is your answer now, cause the pandemic ruined my social life and I don’t know about you.. but making friends after college has been a miserable journey lol! 

I hope you enjoyed reading my post/rant, and talk soon! Can’t believe you haven’t dmed yet lol 

Cheers",lonely,"29M. No need to be lonely when you can make a small effort to meet/make a (new) friend! It’s not easy, but I’m here too… so! 😊",2022-04-06 00:34:36

I know this because I stayed in an abusive relationship 6 years too long (12 total), thinking I could love him out of the awful behavior.

I’ve done the work on myself, I’m trying my best to find love and wouldn’t dream of even doing these things to a partner? I’m discarded by good people for no apparent reason. The consistent rejection is awful. I’m now in my mid 40s and have now lost the luxury of youth as well.

When people think intimacy they think hugs and kisses and one on one time with a person you’re attracted to and having personal time with them and over time that thought to have someone to share your imperfections with and your time has been just running through my mind like crazy.

Maybe it’s the thought of wanting a gf or hooking up with someone but it kinda just sounds like a nice time sharing such a private space which is yourself with another person that may want or enjoy your company. The idea that you don’t feel as alone as you really do and to feel something you feel like you’ve been lacking for so long just seems to me like a experience of a life time. To some who may have that intimacy all the time it may sound weird but everyone’s different as some do have that ideal aura around them that makes it possible and some don’t 

I don’t

I’m a very touchy, very affectionate and needy person. My girlfriend is down for sex whenever and almost never says no, but when it comes to cuddling, just holding each other or kissing, she has been largely absent, except on the whims of her mood. 
I’ve also been very frustrated by how messy she is, like doing laundry and leaving clean clothes in baskets for months on end and cluttering up the room instead of just putting the clothes away.

I’ve talked to her about my frustrations and my needs now time and again for the last 4 years to no avail.

Her grandmother recently passed away and she had to fly back to the Midwest to say her goodbyes and that 2 week break I think was very much needed. It also made me realize just how incredibly alone and empty I feel, and how often my show of affection is not reciprocated. 

Since she’s been back she’s noticed a change in me although she’s having difficulty pinpointing what exactly that change may be and for once in her life she’s been consistently affectionate but it honestly feels like it’s too late.

I’ve thought about going back solely for making friends because what I wanna do in life is gonna be lonely I think. I want to do music, social media content stuff like that. It’s a slow start and I feel it’ll be lonely and hard to corporate with my full time job. So I figured get a degree in something as a backup in case the artsy stuff doesn’t pop off.

My mind is clouded, and my baseline anxiety is doubled or tripled. For 5 years I mainly talked to one person. And vice versa. That was the way that I could feel comfortable. 

I feel like I'm glued to my screen and expecting the same type of emotional stimulation that I used to be able to get. 

I'm sitting here for a few minutes not being able to formulate what to say. If I think too deep about it, I just see her face. I am the type of person who has always, after a breakup, seemed women with a similar facial feature or another (though the result wasn't always related to a similar physical trait). It's so stupid, how something so simple and genetic can cause me to feel a certain way so quickly. I had a panic attack a few days ago after installing Tik Tok to talk to someone when I saw a tik tokker's face that is extremely similar to my ex's. Everything was extremely similar, I briefly questioned what was real. Scarily similar, it was a very strange set of emotions and confusion. I value personality a lot, but I'm so attached to certain random things. It's embarrassing but I feel like saying the truth. 

The chances of me finding a correct person, that I can be correct for, feels so far away. It feels like the ship has sailed. I don't have the excuses I used to have. This feeling has been within me constantly.

The friends I grew up with were narcissistic, but they were fun, and they used my patience and forgiveness to their advantage. Now, I find myself having very little trust in people, and sometimes even blame myself for those friendships falling apart. I try to tell myself that it's better this way, because I resented how they treated me, but it hurts when the people with their own agenda seemed to be the ones most active in your life. I seem to keep attracting the same kind of people, albeit in milder forms. They like to gossip and it's just not for me, I take that as a red flag that they probably talk about me behind my back. My current partner and I got into a fight and he said my poor relationship with my family and my struggle with friends is an indicator that maybe I'm the problem. Is it really my fault, or is it just that difficult to find people to truly connect to ? I keep trying to tell myself I don't need other people to be happy, or need someone to comfort me. And I am trying to have boundaries because I lacked them before and was treated poorly, but now I'm perceived as a closed off, bitchy person. I'm just not sure what to make of this and I've been trying to find a therapist to talk to just so I have someone who is there to listen without judgment. Is this just me ? I don't mean to be critical of people, I'm nowhere close to perfect, but it seems difficult to have standards and also have friends. I'm also just not sure how to start a friendship on my own, people seem bored of me or that they think I'm weird cause I March to the beat of my own drum.I know there must be people like me out there, and my inner voice is begging me not to believe that I'm the problem.

I'm 27 and I've been happy pretty much for the first time ever.

Of course, this all had to come shortly before a big move that I have no control over. I had this brief 4 month stint of experiencing a social life and I have to already give it all up in May, where I'll be living in the middle of nowhere trapped in a basement bedroom with nowhere to go, nothing to do, no one to meet. It's too rural to build a new friend group, I know the area very well and it's totally devoid of my type of people, or really anyone my age at all.

Why did life have to do this to me, give me so many years of hurt and sadness, then this brief moment of happiness, only to push me backwards into an even worse situation? I haven't even moved yet and I'm already feeling that black cloud of depression fall over me, and this time it's back with a bit of a vengeance.

I met my best friend in college and we honestly naturally hit it off from the start. He was so cool and I never met a guy that genuinely just wanted to be friends with me, like he never flirted with me, it was all the way platonic for a while until it wasn’t. Eventually, I did fall in love with him because of the way he treated me, i loved how well he knew me and it was just so crazy. Before i would send him a text he’d literally be typing exactly what i was going to say, he’d take the words out of my mouth before i get it out, it was something so rare and commercial-like honestly. A love you only get to see in movies, and we never really had any issues until recently. I had told him I didn’t want a relationship and he said he didn’t want one either, and I thought okay this is great lol. I wanted to still date other people but obviously that was stupid being that I literally was living with the guy and the girls he would date did not like the concept.

I’m still confused as I am typing this, I’m 22 and I know there’s more to life but he kicked me out because another girl he dates told him too. His exact words was “you think I want to do this, she made me do it” and I told him to stop taking because it broke me knowing he cared more for her than me, his best friend. Just a few days before this argument he told me he loved me and i was so happy because we’ve never said it to each other, then a few days after he said he loved me as a friend, and then he said he was confused. When he told me I could no longer live with him, he watched me pack my stuff and didn’t even help and then he came to be and asked me to stay repeatedly but i couldn’t do it.

4350,Retardedqueefs,1649120337,1,"I’ve lost everything and everyone.

Please excuse the name of this account, I try to mask my pain with humor. 

Here’s the rundown of what I’m facing right now:

1. Raised by narcissistic, abusive, drug addicted single mom who hoards and is incredibly poor

2. Make it to 24 years old living with her, meet my boyfriend, move out, start a business with him, start to feel like there’s light at the end of the tunnel 

3. Get in car accident last year. Not my fault. Hit head, get traumatic brain injury so bad I can barely function as an adult anymore. Memory issues, auditory processing issues, depression, PTSD so bad that even the sound of a car door closing suddenly makes me feel and hear the impact again. 

4. Get in second car accident a month later which also wasn’t my fault, crash kills boyfriend. Gives me even worse head injuries and a broken foot. Uninsured driver. My insurance only covered 25k. My fault for having sub par insurance. Blame myself. Business fails, finances are utterly destroyed, max out credit cards, medical bills go to collections, can’t fulfill old orders to paying customers who are getting ready to call the police for theft, and now about to be homeless. 

My life has been obliterated. I have no will to live. I am too young to know how to navigate this. Nobody has ever taught me shit about fuck in terms of how to be an adult. My family wants nothing to do with me, I have no irl friends, I have nothing and nobody. I’m autistic and can’t hold a job. I’ve tried everything. I don’t want to live a life on disability. I can’t bare the thought. 

I don’t even know if this is the right subreddit. I just needed to vent because I have nobody to talk to. I’m completely alone in this world and for the first time in my life have been having intrusive thoughts of suicide even though the idea of killing myself terrifies me. I was set up for failure since the day I was born.

The other side is a bunch of two faced girls that I thought were acquaintances but really they don’t like interacting with me… even if it means making eye contact.

I used to have a crush on him and he basically used that to manipulate me (at least that’s how I see it). So I decided to put my phone on voice memo, leave it in the classroom, and go to the restroom (try it if you think something suspicious is going on). When I came back, I found out that the entire class was falsely accusing me of cheating and the teacher technically condoned it by holding conversation with the students. Then I realized they were talking about me picking a song to listen to while taking a quiz 🤨, with my phone flat on the desk for everyone to see. Yep, that’s a clever way to cheat. But anyway, I told everyone calmly that what they did was fake and entire class went quiet. But I know they didn’t give af because that was their entire plan.

Im looking to make friends in real life, but I’m not attending uni due to anxiety, I have too much coursework rn to look for work, and so spend all my time alone in my room. Sometimes it’s like hell on earth. I try dancing to music, watching movies and going for walks to occupy my mind, as well as keeping up with coursework.

For some reasons, I can't seem to find any of them irl. Every times I think about socializing at school, everyone, and I mean *everyone* is constantly talking to one another, hanging out with people, having friends. Not even a single alone person who I could even try to befriend. It truly feels like I am the single person in there to have no friends at all, not even an acquaintance. And if you dare talking to literally anybody who's with somebody else at all, you can be pretty sure that you'll get bad looks and mocked behind your back if not insulted, even if you're just asking if something or someone is right there or not.

Today's my birthday, I'm in me early 30's, and I can't handle it for another 30+ years. This year is going to be my change, the kick in the seat I need to be happy, or its going to be my last or at least one of the last. 

I don't want to be lonely and empty anymore. My two biggest motivators are fear and anger. I'm angry with myself that I am the way I am and I fear how bad my mind has become because of the loneliness. I have 9 months to turn this shit around. 

Goals for the year:

-see a psychiatrist and find out if it's depression, ADHD, or cPTSD. 

-lose the weight and become comfortable in my body

-get a healthy social circle and possibly a functioning relationship (romantic or platonic)

These are the bare minimums for me to become healthy and to be able to continue living. I'm deleting reddit, other apps, and video games from my life because they're a huge distraction for me and I can't get myself to focus on the things I need or want to.

They just kept going on and on about how they partied, how there was a ""kiss or hug"" multiple times, how they drink pre-workout before parties so they feel more energized.

I’m a bubbly person, I feel good about the impressions I make on people. Yet somehow, I’m still alone and at the end of it all I still end up ruining friendships, relationships, everything you name it. It makes me question my value and self worth, if I felt so good about myself, am I really that great if no one ever stays for long? 

I feel so defeated and out of luck, my 1 year relationship ended, and when i finally got the motivation to start being me again, I was lucky enough to find someone amazing. Within a month or so it’s back to feeling that same pain. They told me they’d rather remain friends in fear of ruining our friendship.

I just don’t get how I could ever keep trying like this for the next 20 years of my life, it hurts too much. I can’t keep going into depressive states ruining my life. Days just turn to weeks, I finally get back on my horse again and everything repeats itself. Being alone feels like some sort of debilitating curse.

4461,indigonights,1649064490,1,"You would think by getting ghosted over and over and over again, one would have gotten used to it, but it always always hurts so much, especially when you were friends with them first. Anytime ive been asked out or i ask a girl out, it always ends up with the other person ghosting me after they agreed to date me. It makes me spiral into a horrible mental state and i overthink and overanalyze. 

I wish people treated me with the same respect I give to others. But they never do. People always treat me like the background character in their lives. Not that I fault them, people got their own lives and their significant other obviously takes priority. I just wish I was someones first priority for once. And you know what i hate about myself the most? That I empathize with all the girls that have ghosted me. Either they were probably traumatized by a past experience or something else. Either way I never take it personallyeven though its a shitty thing to do. I always put my self in their shoes, even when i dont want to. Im an INFP and i overanalyze everything and am hyper aware of the stigma of being a guy. At the same time, Im tired of being empathic when it never gets reciprocated. I wish people were just straight up with me and just say they aren’t interested in me so i could get closure and move on. Instead, i end up being sick &amp; tired of wallowing in self pity. Tired of feeling sorry for myself. Tired of feeling embarrassed for putting my heart on my sleeve. 

To compound this loneliness, i turned 30 this year and realized all my friends are in long term relationships. Im so envious of them all, building their lives together, sharing intimate experiences with each other, and forming such a deep connection with another human being. I crave that so so much. But ive come to terms that i will never get that feeling. 

Ive only had one official relationship after many ghosts and failed dates, and that lasted only lasted 2 months before she turned incredibly toxic and emotionally abusive towards me, so i had to break up with her. Ive always had horrible luck with dating. My close friends constantly tell me that any girl would be lucky to have me, but eventually those words become hallow and empty. 

Im tired of people saying to not give up and keep trying. Nope. It hurts too much. My heart is too fragile. Ive gotten back on the horse so many times and it always ends up me getting my heart hurt when ive been nothing but kind to others. 

I tried really hard to set healthy emotional boundaries to not get hurt when people ghost me over and over again,  but it never  works. It still is so painful and takes me days to weeks to get over that person and move on without getting any closure. As an introvert, it takes so much energy from me when i put myself out there. I just can’t do it anymore. Ive always been a content loner. I enjoy being alone and doing my own thing, but this is probably the first time ive felt this lonely. As I grow older, my close friends are slowly transitioning into their own separate lives. They get kids, get married, move, or form closer friendships with other groups or couples. Im just the little wallflower stuck in the dark watching from afar. Luckily i have really ambitious goals and passions to work on to distract myself with. 

Idk why im posting on here. No one will read this or truly care, how could they? Im just an anon redditor. Actually i find it cathartic that no one will read this. I just wanted to emotionally dump all this somewhere to not burden my friends with my issues. Sorry for anyone who reads this. I wish everyone in here the best.",lonely,Got ghosted again.

When I find someone I click with, I hone in; I give my all to make them feel good and happy and be on their side and support them. I just want to be a good friend and make sure they know they have someone who sees the goodness in them. I always think “treat others how you want to be treated.” Well, it hasn’t worked for me in my 25 years of life.

I had an ex I broke up with as nicely as possible. I let him meet up with me a month later because he wanted to get closure. He berated me for two hours and I didn’t say a word, I tried to be as nice as I could, so he wouldn’t feel bad about himself. I hate that I did that.

But see… somehow I give to all these people and then they get mad at me because I can’t give MORE. At least that’s the only thing I can think of. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

4474,ShishilanPasalan123,1649054680,1," This is my alt account because well, he found out my main. Anyways, the thing is I'm an active member of [r/applyingtocollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/applyingtocollege/). As you can see I'm a HS Senior. I moved high schools, and one of the post on the subreddit asked what person were you shocked to see get into what university. I commented a former classmate of mine who got into Harvard. For context, nobody from that school had ever gotten into Harvard before. None of the alumni did. I knew she was good, but whatever. I was being a bit salty ofc. I congratulated her nonetheless. My friend bombarded my reddit account along with his friends.

The point is, I used to have a really good friend, we will just call him Taco. I knew Taco for 10 years, but we didn't really become friends until middle school, so we were friends for around 5 to 6 years before I left the school. He used to cover up for me when I got into trouble and I did the same. We weren't best friends, but we were really close. On the year that I was gonna leave, we became a bit distant and he would somtimes make fun of me, but I forgave him because of the fun memories we used to have. We didn't leave on such good terms imo.

When I moved away, I was soon banned from the class group chat, and their exclusive discord, both by Taco specifically as it told me who banned me. I was shocked, but I thought maybe because I left the school so whatever (Not true as the other kids who left the school were still part of the group chats.) I talked with Taco a few weeks ago and I just thought it was nice to reconnect.

I applied for colleges. I didn't have really good stats, so I didn't have high expectations. I got rejected a lot and ultimately decided that I will settle for Community College and then transfer as I didn't like any of the schools I got into. Taco was no longer part of my life. I just remembered him as a good friend I used to have.

Now, I'm somewhat active on reddit, but my friends never knew about my reddit account, including Taco. I posted that comment on the post, and boom, I saw that I was swiftly downvoted (ok, it happened before), but I recognized the usernames. It was Taco, and his new friend (we will call him Mango.) Mango transferred to the high school after I left, so I actually never know who Mango is. Taco and Mango harassed me for being salty, and that I was a crybaby for not being good enough.

I couldn't believe it. It's not the Harvard thing that made me mad, but that I used to be such good friends with Taco, and he did this to me. He insulted me. I shouldv'e known when he started making fun of me on our last year. Mango, I didn't even know who this guy was, joined in the fray. I wish I never see Taco again. He doesn't have very good grades as well, but he's a violin virtuoso, so who knows. Now, they know my entire reddit history. I didn't want them to know where I was going for college, But I guess they do now. They're probably gonna tell the girl what I said. And they may tell the entire class, who will tell their parents and tell my parents.

That was the last thing I needed. Now, Taco is dead in my hearts. He used to be so good, so fun. Right before we left, I should've known when he started making fun of me for not watching porn like a normal teenager. (Ok, I did a couple times, but I felt disgusted by it and the last time I did it, was like 7 months ago.) RIP Taco. I'm probably salty, but yeah. Why, Taco? Why? I'm gonna go terminate my main account tomorrow, and use this as my main now. I don't ever wanna see anybody from my last school ever again except one of them who I still talk to often. Now, they all know I'm going to community college and laugh at me for being jealous of the top girl going to Harvard. My life sucks.

We had some issues over the years but always worked it out. We had a falling out a couple weeks ago and she dumped me. It’s not gonna be resolved bc once she’s done with people she’s done forever and also I’ve been so hurt that I don’t know if I would be able to move past this and forgive her even if she did try. 

I have no family living near me. I have almost no friends. I have a couple of unstable and rocky friendships that could end at any moment. I am not working at the moment (unable to) and 99% of the time I’m just home alone now. When she was around I was always out doing something with her, almost daily. 

Now I feel I don’t really have anyone who cares about me. My mom died a few years ago and she was the only person I truly felt cared about me. If I suddenly died I am sure that it would take weeks, probably months until anyone even noticed my absence and eventually I would hope someone would have the police check on me. I often think about how if I did die then I would just die all alone and my body would just decompose over months. The only situation I can imagine that someone might check on me is bc my landlord wouldn’t be getting rent anymore so would likely try to find me for that. I have a lot of health issues, so I could die. Just so you know I’m not being paranoid. 

In some ways I’ve come to accept that I am all alone in the world. I’ve tried making long term friends so many times and they never work out long term. It takes so much effort and energy and disappointment for me to go through that over and over and still ultimately end up alone. The guys I’ve tried making friends with usually have a sexual agenda and the women just don’t seem to be interested in a friendship for very long. I’m really not interesting or intelligent or funny or anything really that would draw someone to me or make them want to stay around. I feel like just to actually spend time with people I have to give them sex or favors and then I’ll have temporary people at least. I can’t stand spending all my time alone. 

How is one to cope living a life when they don’t have anyone they’re close to and who wouldn’t even notice your absence if you suddenly disappeared? It’s awful to feel so unloved and uncared for.",lonely,How is it possible to exist when you’re completely alone &amp; no one cares about you?

After a brief convo, she pretty much asked me for my snap &amp; to go to coffee with her out of nowhere. Any shy guys dream, right? 

After many dates, countless hours of cuddling &amp; talking, &amp; months of snapping everyday, let’s just say I screwed up &amp; we broke up. We’ve since talked about it, patched things up, and both agreed to be just friends. 

Now, when I talk to her in person, things seem fine since we mostly keep it light and just joke around. However she’s made it very clear that she does not want to get close to me as a person anymore beyond a couple brief exchanges. I’ve tried talking about my life, my problems but she doesn’t give a shit at all.

4483,ramen_and_ragu,1649050951,1,"I hate how it'll tell me I wasnt good enough, or I was being really weird/awkward when I have a ""bad"" interaction with someone.  
I hate how it'll tell me that I should never talk to anyone because im not worth their time, even though the person im talking to doesnt think that way at all.  
I hate how I always come up with these crazy scenarios of bad things happening to a person I'm interested in (or want to talk to), when they tell me that they were just talking to another person, or that they have other people they're going to be busy playing games with.  
I hate how it just wont let my past go, especially with how my relationship with my brother and sister has gotten so much worse over the years, and what it has done to me.  
I hate how it'll tell me that my brother or parents never loved me, or ever wanted to be around me.  
I hate how it'll tell me that I will never be useful to anyone, no matter how hard I try.  
I hate how it'll tell me my problems aren't as worth as much as someone else's, which is probably true for me since I personally think I'm a really bad person due to what I've done to others in the past.  
I hate that no matter how much I try to impress people, it'll always tell me that I'm an absolute sicko to them and they'll hate me for all of eternity, even if I slightly think I did a good job with talking to them.  
I hate how it'll tell me I won't be able to find anyone to talk to, since my mentality is that of a 13 y/o. (, already almost 1/3rd of the way to being 18.)  
I hate how it'll make me overthink things 24/7, never letting me catch a break.  
I hate how it'll always make me feel so lonely and ignored, my ""efforts"" of trying to establish good friendships with people always feeling stale and bland.  
It always makes me feel like I'm just a plain and basic person, since I'm not into any bands at all or music with lyrics.

I just feel like I won't ever be able to find someone who won't mind how excited and weird I can be.  
I just want to find a quick escape from feeling so unloved, even if it's by shoving myself in horrible relationships, where the other person probably doesn't even love me. Just pretending they do  is all I would need since it's the only thing that will give me comfort these days.  
It's even worse how I don't know how to find certain groups of people that fit me, all because I'm too afraid of rejection or being looked at in a strange way.

I just want to be free from this wanting-attention-and-feeling-desperate-24/7 hell I've put myself in.  
I just want someone who I can be with where I can truly be myself. Not this dumb stuff where I have to ""sorta"" be myself, but really act like how I would if I were talking to a certain person in real life.

At this point it just feels like I won't ever be happy, or satisfied with what I have. I want more, and I hate that I'm such a fucking needy person.  
Is it because of my past relationships? Maybe it's karma coming to bite me back from how harshly I used to treat them? I don't know. All I know is that I'm a terrible person deep-down, and that I always end up making myself think I won't ever be able to get out of this downward spiral I'm in, just because I feel like I deserve this, and that I should never be genuinely loved or cared for, ever again.

I just wish I could be someone else, a more interesting and fun person to be around. I mean, some people say that I am fun to be around sometimes, but I'm talking about those laid-back people who have a deep voice and sound like they've got everything sorted out for themselves. While I'm there, just in the background laughing and being weird as fuck, not adding anything to the conversation whatsoever. Just being a fucking burden.

I just feel like I never had a chance to begin with. I was doomed from the start, to rot in hell, for what I've done. I can and never will be forgiven for being so unfair and horrible to the people I've been with. I'm sorry.

I'm such a mess. I don't know why anyone would want to be with me anyways at this point. I mean, they probably shouldn't since I'm still pretty young and I've got a long ways to go to sort out my stuff, but holy shit does it feel hopeless as hell. 

Sorry if this wasn't the right place to vent, I didn't know where else to go, so I'm just hoping this is fine.

I’m a sophomore now and entering my freshman year everything changed. New school, new people, new chances. I made so many mistakes, did so many things wrong, did so many awful things in 8th grade. It’s almost as if the world knew this is what I needed to stop being me. One of my best friends dropped me and it was my fault. I still have the other one but it’s not the same. He will always be my best friend and he’s basically the only reason I haven’t left this world yet, but even with that I feel so alone, so empty. My freshman year I didn’t talk to anyone. I sat in the back quiet. I did that for every class. After a while got a gf somehow and we dated for a bit. Broke up. Dated again entering sophomore year and broke up again. I made a few friends but none of them feel this void I’ve had since 8th grade. I don’t even consider them friends.

It's all empty. I'm tired of all these empty conversations, of spilling my heart out all over the floor for someone hoping they'd do the same ultimately for them to choose someone else or keep themselves at an arms length. 

I'm tired of saying anything besides ""good"" when anyone asks how I am because what's the fucking point? If I tell them how I really feel it's not like they'd give a shit. I'd just get more ""aw man, I hope it gets better""s. I can hope things get better by myself, what I need is people who are actually fucking there instead of all these empty catchphrases people use when they don't care. Even then it's not like anyone else is responsible for how I feel so I'm just supposed to suck it up. Find what makes me feel better and be self-reliant as if I haven't been doing that for the last 2-3 fucking years 🤪

Everybody says that you should be vulnerable but the only thing I've found is it makes people think you're either stupid or unreliable. You should be vulnerable because then other people will be vulnerable with you too! It's all shit. Shit shit shit. People are self interested which makes sense, therefore I have to be self interested too right. I have to walk the lone road and wait til those right people come right? Well shit now that I've learned people suck, no one is gonna want to put the effort it takes to get through all my walls when they can just find someone else. I don't want to put my walls down because I'm fucking tired of being disappointed. I'm so sick of it. Sometimes I can't even help but get my hopes up and I'll end up breaking my heart over fucking nothing. 

I'm just ranting but I'm so tired. I see everything in front of me and I just want to be done with it. I'm tired of worrying about being close to people or wasting time and energy on empty relationships. I don't want to be self-reliant because it feels like I've had to be for so so so long. I want to feel the warmth of another person's body and personality. There's no guarantee that when I find the people I love I'll be happy anyways. There's no guarantee for anything.

I failed my first final semester exams and this semester is way harder than the first. I never gonna pass it.

Idk how people can go up to people and just start a conversations out of nothing.

I feel emasculated as fuck writing this but i'm 20 year old man that has never even held hands with a girl/woman. I don't really have a boring live and I have some fun hobbies and sports that i'm passionate about. The thing is people tell me all the time that i have a fun atmosphere around me and that i'm not ugly still i get 0 attention from women. and its not for a lack of trying, I've confessed that i liked a girl that I was quite close with a few years ago (told me ""no"" and that is acceptable) but afterwards she showed half the school our text messages, what kinda made me scared of interacting with women (yes i know its pathetic). Since then I never really dared to go near a girl to talk to her since I was so scared to talk to them in fear that something similar would occur. This means i have no real close emotional bonds and don't have anyone to talk about how i'm feeling emotionally and/or mentally. Its becoming more and more difficult to manage, it gets even worse at night. There are days where is just sit in the shower staring at the floor for a couple hours just being sad. I feel like i deserve better and i'm working to become a better man and athlete day after day, but it discourages me that I don't see any improvement in my dating live.

4555,verylikelydepressed,1649026170,1,"Even though I have people in my life that love me, I still feel so alone. I've tried to force myself to be around people, I've tried to throw myself into relationships, I've tried multiple forms of therapy, I've even tried to just be content with my own misery. Nothing works. I could be in a room full of people and still feel like I've never been more alone in my life. There's no happiness, there's no joy. It's just going through the motions of what I'm ""supposed"" to be doing. That's all I do, pretend. I have to force myself to smile, to laugh where appropriate, to mask my own unhappiness by being a glorified jester. As soon as the mask slips a bit, people leave. People don't want to be around me unless I am being entertaining. I wish I could say that's anxiety talking, but it's happened time and time again. 

I ruined the only relationship I've ever had that mattered to me. I hate myself for it. I know that your worth and happiness shouldn't be defined by other people, but it's so hard to tell myself that when this person really was the only thing that's ever made me feel complete. They made me feel like an actual human being, not a disgusting creature. They made me feel actually seen and understood for the first time in my life. But I ruined it. 

The loneliness is killing me. It's gotten to the point where I'm considering putting myself in situations where I'm bound to get hurt by toxic people, just because I need human contact. I was assaulted recently and I'm still stupid enough to consider being around the person who did that to me. I think I'm trying to tell myself that that's how they showed me they want me, which I know is so idiotic. I don't know how to explain it, I'm just so desperate to feel something that I'll take anything, even if it negatively impacts me. 

I just want to be held, I want someone to tell me everything will be ok as they stroke my hair. I want to cry in someone's arms and let out everything inside me. I want to feel someone's touch and not feel fear and anxiety. I want to feel like I actually matter enough to deserve human contact.",lonely,Stupid decisions,2022-04-04 08:49:30

When my creativity grinds to a halt, it's very demoralizing, and I tend to get brain fog. I'm also paranoid that people will plagiarize me. It's probably stupid that I want someone to see me as a creative genius, and despite my low self esteem, I sense that this comes from some sort of narcisism.. But it's not the only reason- I really do feel my last chance as a human is to make something great. I am multi-talented with next to nothing finished to show for it, nor things that I'm comfortable showing.

I haven't really dated anyone that enjoyed, well... this kind of thing. Wordbuilding, designing characters, coming up with stuff, and just hearing about it. My last girlfriend was jealous of the female characters that I would come up with and spend so much time thinking about. I feel like the springs of imagination in me combined with bad anxiety causes me to come of ass (or in practice be) neglectful to who I date. It wouldn't be my only negative aspect when in a relationship.

Lately, I've been making progress with my story, but the feeling of suffocation in my chest is causing me to seek real human attention over creative stimulation. It's quite the predicament. I long for symbiosis. Right now, I am a NEET. I don't know if I'll be able to become a successful shut-in.

She had a glare and maybe it was nothing but I've programmed myself to assume the worst. She said nothing and I quickly resumed looking at the ground since anything else would be creepy.

For some background info: 

I have been dating my girlfriend for over a year and have never been happier. Even tho my last two relationships ended in me getting cheated on, I truly loved and trusted this girl. She was and is still the only person who truly understands me and who I feel safe with. From the start of the relationship we both knew that at some point I would be travelling to another country to learn the language and maybe even find something I’d like to do in the future. My problem is, that I am still young but haven’t found what to do in my life yet. My girlfriend was the exact opposite to that. She always knew what she wanted to do and prepared for it a long time ago. She would be moving to another city for it though. So me not knowing yet, what I will be doing made her nervous because she didn’t know if we would be able to continue the relationship if I were to go some other place to study/work. So we tried finding something for me together, which helped a bit, but still I didn’t really have anything. She would always tell me, that I should just apply to whatever I feel like to be able to choose at all and not just have nothing. The pressure coming from my family to find something to study/ work didn’t help either. 
So I eventually had to go to the other country and we weren’t able to see each other in person, as she had already started working.

About 2 weeks ago my girlfriend and I started to take a break from the relationship. Even though she knew, that a break for me was normally out of question. I still agreed because she said, it would be the only option to save our relationship. In this time we didn’t speak only if it was necessary (missing the other person)
Today she told me she didn’t have any feelings anymore, but she doesn’t want to lose me. 
It broke me. 
I have never felt anything close to the love for her before. Even now, when I should be forgetting her and cross her out of my life, I still love her. And I hate myself for it. 
I told her that I need time for myself at the moment. In 2 weeks I would be able to see her as I am visiting home for a few days.
I just want to get back with her.

Hell, like 15 minutes prior to ghosting me/blocking me, that person I've been feeling pretty comfortable around gave absolutely no sign of being upset at me, even telling me they were excited that I was finally back to talk to them and reply, only to find out I've been blocked. 

Like, I don't get it. Why do some people have to ghost?

Lying in a woeful bed of sorrow

The sun has been dimmed out for a week and one day

Tinted shades and catchy tunes sadly come to tomorrow

A mirror image for calamity as time will decay.

And in the darkest hour that I have come to know

With distorted eyes, still I see you

I promised a dream long ago

But I am fickle, as my word is in all it’s entirety, disturbingly untrue.

“So toward the infinite, and through the unknown!”

I’ll soar with you forever and always in my mind

And my thoughts may be poisoned, and I may be alone

But remembrance brings euphoria for the deaf and the blind.

And maybe in a new life, like magnets we’ll attract

Though with uncertainty I speak

Hope is diminishing, handing reigns to logic and fact

So my ex dumped me about 2 months ago( its a long ass story that i should have seen coming but i didn't becausei loved her with all of my heart and i still do which is turning out to be fun). And it just isn't getting better. Its getting worse. I cant handle it anymore. I dont know why but ive been getting alot of anxiety attacks, which i have nevver gotten before. I have never in my life felt so lonely. The loneliness is deafening. 

Im sitting outside smoking a cigarette rn, and im starting to think of shit i shouldn't think of. 

I hate what this breakup is turning me into i am not this person. I dont know how to deal with this. I am usually the person people come to to talk about their problems. And i honestly have nobody to talk to because all people say is that it will get better. 

I am a fucking mess. And i honestly cant deal with the shit im dealing with anymore it is draining and it is killing me more and more each passing day.

I fucking miss her, even though she hurt me so much. I miss being inlove. I miss feeling loved the most. I miss not feeling like a soul less, emotionless entity floating around just waiting to die.

Should I join the military to help with my loneliness? I’m almost done with college so maybe I’d try for a commission. Any former-service redditors here to give advice? Did joining help your loneliness, not do anything, or make it worse? Will it make a difference if I end up an officer or enlisted? What about reserves and active service? Will joining the reserves still help combat loneliness?

4606,CowboyBeerbop,1649010411,1,"I was pretty popular in high school and had many friends and people who always seemed to check in on me. Joined the army right after graduating and got married soon after. 

I deployed and went through some shit overseas. On top of dealing with being in a combat zone, my dad died, my wife seemed to talk less, I started having severe depression, insomnia, and panic attacks. My squad leader was giving me alcohol he was somehow getting mailed to him, then he was out and was drinking NyQuil and suggested I should too “it will help you sleep”. Some leader, should have sent my ass to see someone… anyways I ended up wanting alcohol on the anniversary of my dad dying (yes my deployment was longer than a year) and I couldn’t find any. I ended up using a drug that psyched me out and I stumbled into a security office asking for help. They sent me to med hall and I was drug tested. Got in trouble and was put on extra duty, loss of some pay, and was held overseas while my unit went back home. They were trying to kick me out of the military but ended up with being demoted. 

I finally returned home and was definitely grateful it wasn’t worse. Though I had unresolved issues. And my wife didn’t seem to be there for me. She told me we grew apart overseas and she felt we rushed into the marriage. Divorced and I pretty much started drinking heavily and isolated myself. 

Eventually I decided to do something with my life and went to college after I got out the army. I made new friends (I thought) but became consumed with partying and dropped out of college. I was pretty much just working to pay for for that lifestyle. Met a girl but it was pretty much a rebound and ended badly because I didn’t truly want that relationship and I had unresolved problems that were constantly her focus. Like she needed to fix me. 

Eventually a little while later I met my current wife. I didn’t want anything serious with anyone when I met her. We just bonded and I felt connected. We did everything together, and partying definitely continued. She eventually got pregnant and I got a better job and partying came to a dead stop. I did start to get real help with therapy and was able to cope with a lot of my past trauma. But I became so consumed with providing for us and being exhausted after work that I never wanted to do anything with my friends I had left. Some of them even graduated and moved away. I became very isolated again. We had a small house we hated. And my wife wanted to work but jobs she looked at would basically end up with her working just so we could pay daycare. She ultimately joined the Air Force. 

I worked from home due to Covid-19 and had the kids in daycare because we could now afford it. But I ended up taking them out because of a problem with the daycare and decided to just keep them home with me while I worked until wife graduated trainings. COVID-19 delayed her training and she was gone 6 months. The whole time she was gone I hung with friends twice. New Years and supper bowl party. Friends left right after 12am and half time. I felt they just came to hang with me out of obligation. 

We got stationed in Florida. The friends I did have rarely talked to me while I was home because of my lack of interest in partying. So they definitely don’t talk now that I’m out of state. My wife is making friends in the military but I can’t seem to meet anyone because I work in an office by myself with no coworkers. 

I’m literally doing everything I can to meet people and make true friendships but I haven’t been successful and feel even more lonely and isolated. My wife works a crazy schedule so she often isn’t home when I am, and when she’s at work, I’m asleep or she isn’t able to talk. When we can, I tend to over share and overwhelm her with everything I have to say because she’s my only outlet. I don’t want to damage our relationship by wearing on her and I don’t want to be her burden. So I isolate even in my own home when she’s here, keep my thoughts to myself. 

Anyways, that’s my confession. As long winded it is, much was left out. My self-induced loneliness. I’d appreciate any feedback and if there is a better sub to post this let me know.",lonely,Self-induced loneliness,2022-04-04 04:26:51

And I'm here, waiting for that special day (rare dinner with the gym guys, a lunch with relatives, a reunion with an old friend...) that comes once a month. Otherwise I'm always alone. Another thing that worsened my mood is hearing someone who already organized summer holidays. I will not find someone to go on vacation with me. Why is it so hard to have a stable social life?

Friendship is something that I not only don't care for but also especially dislike . It seems like a myth made up in TV shows and movies. Nothing comes out of friendships as they seem temporary and end within 1 month(sometimes not even a week). Friendship is just an excuse for people to get what they want. 

I guess after being alone for so long, I no longer have the desire to be around other people and have noticed most people not being who they present themselves to be.

But why i am saying this? I am 26yo and my whole life, i am pretty much alone. You know all the cliché elements, like; not much of friends, outsider towards your family, no girlfriend at all. I was really depressed few years back, but i got my shit together - of course, few people were somehow helping me, and every person had some kind of influence without any doubt; but most of the time, i was facing my own self, doubts and bad moods, you know all that crap.

That i can always move everywhere and explore. 

But then i realized, that it feels so one sided. That i miss this one element; sharing it. With someone. With anyone. I feel like i reached so far beyond my own horizons, but still - stuck in this lonely space. I have really small circle of friends, but they live so far away and i can see them only through weekends, if they even have time. And 98% of our conversations are their issues, problems and etc. I love helping people. I am always providing great solutions, hints and feedback. BUT! i wish that at least at once, i can have also someone that is like from the opposite direction. Someone, that can push me for once. Someone, that can fill the void. Someone like me, but more wiser, more fresh and someone, that is more experienced, so i can learn. Someone that can at least once, help me. 

I always like action movies; recently, i am watching romantic movies, cause i feel like i am filling the void with these movies. That i am trying to make some kind of compromise with something, i don't even have. I am exercising a lot, jogging often, i don't drink alcohol, etc. I am always trying to be so diplomatic and learn more.

I mean, shit...It stings a bit, doesn't it? When you haven't done anything (noticeably) wrong? When you seemed to have been getting along great with a person, genuinely, and yet they still throw you away like you're nothing? All I thought to myself was, a simple ""I'm sorry, I don't think I wanna be friends"" would have sufficed. But why leave so cowardly? I thought they were a decent person?

Aha..I mean normally I wouldn't care, but it's rough when you (almost) find someone that's completely on your wavelength, a prospective real friend that might actually be there for you in the long term, only for it all to end inexplicably. 

Anyways, needless to say I am back again 🤪, on the (almost) hopeless search for companionship. I already have a few great people but something is missing? I can't even describe what personality I am looking for, but i'd enjoy connecting with an introverted and/or socially anxious individual like me. 

To describe myself, I'm that kind of guy who never really speaks unless he has to (may not be thr best endorsement hehe) but is always thinking, contemplating, daydreaming (ooo, deep  and mysterious! Come on dm me guys)

Why is talking so damn hard, bro? Not online though. Over the internet I can never shut the fuck up, especially if the topic is a subject or person I care about. Thankfully,  I'm getting better at communicating, and for that reason I'd be glad to voice call you (whoever you are), if you're comfortable. Not sure where else to go with this, but I always try to be kind, open-minded, and I value sincerity above all else. Even if we don't have everything in common, as long as you show you care and want to make a friendship work, I'll try my best for you too. More basic info out the way: im black, im an Atheist, don't care about politics, and I'm a 19 year old Business student from Michigan.

Now for my interests! Did I mention I'm a shameless nerd? So, yeah, I think most of the stuff I'm into is typical for discord users loll. I enjoy Fantasy books, comics, cartoons, manga, anime, gaming (I'm a part-time gamer), movies, tv, basketball, etc etc. Oh! And rock/rap music. Who cares though, tell me about yourself!

so today i've come through a lot, felt a lot of different feelings and thoughts. i had a little crush on this girl, and turns out she's already in a relationship and it's going great. i'm really happy for her, but miss her a lot. She was a great friend and we had a great time together. I'm happy for her. But i feel lonely now. Everyone's getting on with their life and I'm here without anything to do.

I really felt that i could keep her happy and we'll be happy together if i had her in my life. She still is with me, but just as a friend.

4639,Practical-Audience13,1648998040,1,"I like being alone and I never really feel lonely like I used to. Years ago I started taking care of myself and taking myself out to do things even if I wasn’t with anyone because I don’t really give a fuck if people think I’m weird for going out alone. Ever since then I’ve actually been the happiest I’ve been in a long time. Sure I have some times where I get a little sad but every year I have less and less of those moments. I stopped smoking weed so frequently and i completely stopped drinking because I don’t feel like I have no one, I have myself. One thing I recently learned through my psychology class in school is that loneliness can cause a slew of health problems. I don’t think this is entirely true. I think loneliness is that cause of other things that cause health problems. Many people who are lonely tend to resort to things like drugs and alcohol and other things to fill the void. They also stop exercising and doing the things they love. I’m pretty sure it’s the substance abuse and lack of physical activity that’s causing these health issues. If your lonely right now start taking care of yourself, see if you can get into therapy, start exercising daily, take yourself out even if no one is with you, enjoy your own company and be proud of yourself. You are all amazing, strive to be happy and comfortable being alone, make goals for yourself and don’t beat yourself up if you can’t meet those goals, just keep striving to be the best you regardless if you have thousands of friends or not.

I truly think I may be touch starved but I really have no idea and feel I'm so far down the hill and disconnected I really have no idea.

Now my roommate has begun bringing girls over and its college all over again with me locking myself in my room, terrified to get water from my fridge in-case a girl I don't know sees me and judges me, yet at the same time hoping to some higher power that she'll burst through my door and we cuddle and finally someone holds me until I die. I only went on that date because that girl asked me out and I've been too chicken shit to even try and talk to anyone or get help or even try and get better, so now I'm here waking up every morning feeling absolute nothing inside, clutching a pillow like its the last thing I own, praying someone somewhere will just fall into my lap and make everything better.

4651,Dtwdom,1648992361,1,"I moved to a new city (Indianapolis) a few years back to start a new chapter in my life. It was hard enough to find a new job when one is “older” (I’m 62 &amp; it took 15 months to land a new gig). But that journey pales in comparison with the burden of making a new (hetereo) connection with a potential partner when one is “older” AND identifies as kinky - makes looking for a needle in a haystack seem trivial. If it was just a matter of making a “mainstream” connection, I’m sure that any of the “traditional” online dating sites would be a place to start. However, I’m not looking for a “traditional” relationship dynamic - and I’m at a complete loss as to how to proceed.  The traditional kink social events (“munches”) have left me feeling more alone than ever, since they appear to be largely populated by much younger folks who already know each other &amp; have played together - problematic to “break through” in such circumstances.   I’m also tired of online-only dynamics - I yearn for one irl. Sigh.  Truly sucks.",lonely,It sucks to look for a compatible partner when one is “older” &amp; kinky,2022-04-03 23:26:01

4685,themightybigj_,1648976337,1,"My last relationship ended in September 2019 and I haven’t fully recovered since. Over the past few years I have learnt many new things about myself. The most important one to me is that I am autistic and an introvert. I don’t like going out, I don’t like socialising, I get anxiety when I’m around a lot of people and I struggle with making new friends. I was in and out of friend groups at high school but I didn’t really have one group that I could call my friends. The only people I can call real friends I have known since primary / elementary school and they know about how I function. My last relationship ended because my girlfriend had a really good friendship with a guy and they would hang out on a regular basis. I made a big deal out of it and she got mad at me and broke up with me. Since she was a reasonable and nice person, whenever I tried to talk to her again after a month or so she would and we would start talking as mates. Something would happen and we would stop talking. Then after a month I would try to talk to her again and the cycle went on until she got a new boyfriend. I was definitely obsessed with her and it probably made her annoyed at me. I haven’t talked to her since about roughly six months ago and she’s probably making fun of me. I tried to help myself by trying to talk to new people over Snapchat and I eventually started to more people and became friends with them over the phone. I wanted to put myself out of my comfort zone and actually try to meet up with them in real life and I did a few times and everything was cool until they all called me weird and awkward, ghosted me and I’ve never heard from them since.

4688,SpicciBobicci,1648975400,1,"Australia. I like some aspects of it, but as i’ve grown up i’ve felt a large disconnect from the dominant culture here. i guess it doesn’t help that i also come from an immigrant background, so i’m disconnected from the majority populace in that regard.

I’m not ‘rowdy’, i don’t go out to drink, i don’t drink at all, i don’t like loud music festivals, i don’t like huge greasy fatty meals, i don’t smoke, i don’t like TV, etc etc etc…

I’ve tried my best to get over my internal dislike for these things, i’ve tried doing things that are popular and basically all people around me do but i just cannot stand it. it goes against my nature.

i like quietness, reading, tea, exercising, writing, small meals, etc etc etc…

i’m very low-key, quiet, introspective, subtle, and that has always rubbed the people in my life the wrong way.

my family see me as weird. every friend that i’ve tried to make has ended up leaving me. i find it hard to meet new people because not many people in my country like the things that i like.

i’ve made my peace with this, i’m not bitter or angry or sad about it. it just is what it is. i just wish it were different.

They take me now and assume I've always been this way. No, years of rejections and insults such as the one a few nights ago have made me this way. Years of isolation have made me this way.

Ever since I was very small I have been bullied. Bullied for my looks and other things about me so I never had good self esteem and had lots of traumatic situations happen to me. I'm extremely lonely and feel I have really no friends. Well I do have friends but they don't speak unless I speak to them first which makes me feel kind of shitty. So to cope with my loneliness I pretend I'm a popular person. Whether its an internet celebrity or a celebrity in general. Just a figure that gets lots of attention from others. Its always been my dream to be famous so that lots of people would love me unconditionally because i never really felt love from someone else unless they wanted something from me of course. So I talk to myself often and get stuck in daydreams where i pretend im famous and i also think of stories and stuff to occupy my mind. Does anyone else do this?

4713,nobodycares239,1648965265,1,"I've always felt a pervasive kind of loneliness. Growing up gay and closeted is hard, everyone has heard that kind of story, so im not going to go into it much. 

I was the type of person who decided not to come out to my family because I knew they would disown me, and I'm struggling with the ways that decision has effected me now. 

I met a man online, we became friends, we started dating, and a few months ago I went to meet him in person for a week long trip. It went wonderfully. He's everything I could ever want in a lifelong partner and I've never felt a connection with anyone like this before. 

Now ever since I've been home, I've just felt a horrible numbness. Its hard to describe what I'm feeling exactly, but I think a lot of it is centering on my age. I'm 28, and this is my first real relationship. Before now, I've never kissed anyone. I've never held hands with anyone before, and no one besides my mother and grandparents have ever told me that they loved me. 

Finally feeling like someone loves me has honestly fucked me up. I've always felt lonely and hidden in some ways, but it was never like this. It feels like one week of a normal relationship has completely tainted all of my memories into being lonely and sad.

I think of all the things I used to enjoy by myself and they all seem pathetic now. Going to movies by myself, talking long walks, trying new foods, shopping... it all just feels so hollow. I try to do the things I know I used to love and I don't get real joy out of them anymore. 

Every night I go to sleep and it feels wrong without him. I've never had trouble sleeping before, but now I lay down for hours without falling asleep. I thought it would get easier over time, but it doesn't. It's like it's involuntary- every time I close my eyes I think about how I held him when we would go to sleep together. 

I've never cried much before, but sometimes I do now when I cant sleep because I'm lonely. And I feel like I can't tell him that because it sounds overbearing or obsessive. 

My mom knows about my relationship now, and she absolutely hates it. She cried every time we talked about it, she says she will never accept it as a relationship and won't ever attend a wedding. No one has told my dad or extended family, but it will be far worse when they find out. 

Sometimes the realization hits me that my only choices are to be cut off from my family, or leave the person I love. Even knowing how happy he makes me, it's still so isolating to lose family, and I know they'll never budge on this. 

I'm so bitter about it all... it would have been easier if I had come out when I was younger. Now it feels like it's too late to be doing this. I almost wonder if I never should have dated and just tried to find contentment in being alone because the loneliness I feel now is like a pit in my chest that won't go away. It's like it's eating into me a little more every night and I don't think it will ever stop now that I know what's missing in my life.",lonely,I feel so much lonelier now that I have someone.,2022-04-03 15:54:25

I first realized I was crushing on her when once during online school a big group of us boarders (there’s 31 in total, 16 girl 15 boys I think) were going downstairs from the boarding house and I dropped my granola bar on the floor in the hall way after the stairs ,(I was holding a laptop, my laptop charger, a book and my phone in a pile in my arms) and this one girl,( Let’s call her C for this post) C picks it up and hands it to me, and when she does I just feel this, Spark, jolt me. After that I start thinking about how I feel about her, because I wasn’t so sure anymore.(I had already acknowledged my sexuality a few years ago) Usually I just think of her and her other three friends as annoying, or loud, or rude. Because they are loud. And I realized that I did like her. And over time I realized I had liked her for a while, just not known it. Now I only have two months left at the school I’m at before summer break and I’m moving schools next year, and I don’t know what to do.
Another thing, my school does cadets and “C” and Mine platoons are right next to each other. And each platoon has to form three lines. And im in the back row two people from the right corner. C is in the right corner of her platoon, so I have a pretty good view of her. Sometimes I think I see her looking at me too, but she might just be looking for one of her friends who is in my platoon. Even just looking at her gives me this intoxicating feeling. I think she might like me back but idk.

4737,Correct-Account-5567,1648956658,1,"Hey guys, 

This is my first time writing here, but I think that I really need it. I'm american, but have been living in europe for most of my life, and just moved back to the USA last July. It has been a very difficult transition for me, and I have already gone through 2 different schools. I had absolutely no friends for the first 6 months here, and that really took a tole on me. At this point I moved from the private school where I was at, to a public one, an since then I have met a couple people I get along with alright. 

Since I moved to the US, I have kept in close contact with most of my friends in europe, calling them on a daily basis and playing videogames with them as much as possible. Though this definitely helped at first, the sense of online disconnection I had with them, as well as the start of the new school year when they started to talk about the new people they had met, made me start feeling kind of lonely. Over this same time period, I got back in contact with this girl I had been talking to and playing games with as well online. We started spending a lot of time together over call and became pretty decent friends. Its been about 9 months of this, and I've already known her for a little over a year. Anyway we decided that we liked each other, and decided to give online dating a shot. So far, it has been incredibly taxing on me. We are both extremely busy people, and since we started ""dating"" we have actually been talking less and less as the school year has progressed. I do my beset to rationalize this but sometimes I get really pissed and wish I would just end the whole thing. Of course I know that isn't what I really want, and she is one of the few people with whom I feel some real connection with. Its just this distance between us that feels like its keeping me from solidifying our relationship ig. 

Honestly idk exactly what I'm feeling, but I definitely feel pretty depressed/generally sad rn. Having an online relationship, as well as slowing starting to drift away from my old friends has definitely had a negative impact on me, and the people I have met in the US just don't feel real to me. I spend time with them, and I genuinely like some of them, but they just don't feel real. I'm not sure exactly how to explain, but I feel like there is kind of like this cloud between me and everybody else, and I feel incredibly lonely here. I have dealt with suicidal thoughts and real depression before, but I have fully overcome them and don't think I could ever fall back into that state. This feels different, just this long extended loneliness and gloom that just doesn't seem to go away. As definitely more of an introvert this all really hurts because in general it is not often/for extended periods of time that I really look for human interactions or big groups of people, but when I do occasionally feel like having some company there just isn't anyone there. 

Anyway that is my little rant, I really appreciate it if you read the whole thing, and any encouragement or advice that you have to offer is more welcome than you could imagine.

I was at a hotel with my mom and her friends. We stayed for 3 days and I tried my best to stay positive even when I knew no one. I was very lonely and depressed, I've been this way for about 2 years now. And I pretty much gave up on talking to females at all because none of them see my existence. But that was all different with this one...

I just wondered around town and the hotel for the first 2 days pretty much until the last night. I went to swim and seen the prettiest girl I've ever seen. I suddenly felt the need to talk to her (shockingly). I sat next to her and was surprised I did. She was on her phone and looked at me and smiled. I really didn't have any plan, so I sat silently until I thought of something to say....

I said you should add me on snap like a basic guy. She said I should with a sarcastic tone. Everything she did matched my energy perfectly. She added me and I was very surprised with my performance. 

About 2 hours later I was sitting by a elevator like a sorry mf. And she came with her friend and said hey there's ""anon""
She talked to me for about 30 minutes and it was the happiest I've been in years. I forgot about everything besides that conversation and didn't feel alone.

I got comfortable and forgot about the waifu sticker on my phone. I sat it down and on the couch and she seen it and jokingly said ""oh hell no""and ran off. My depressed dumbass just walked off and she texted me 5 minutes later asking where I was. I went back down to the elevator and there was no one there. I got left on delivered until I was about to go to bed about 2am. She said we should meet up tomorrow. I knew it would be the last time I would see her considering she lives 1+ hours away from me.

Things have gotten better for everyone, including me, yet I can't shake the feeling of sadness or emptiness. 

Today, first time in a long time, I found myself inside a fast food joint. Normally I'd just order online and get pickup, but my coworker sprang the idea of food out of no where and offered to pay for something. Anyway, we went it and immediately I became anxious. I thought I was doing better with talking to people but I became tongue tied at the counter. It was a pretty girl and I must have looked like a crazy person as I kept sneaking a peak at her face and then darting my eyes as she looked at me. I have a hard time being loud so it was kinda embarrassing to have to repeat myself multiple times, basically yelling by the end. I am sure I blushed the entire time. 

The coworker got and paid for our food, I thanked him and we sat at the nearby park as we ate. I wanted to forget the experience but he never let go of it and brought it up multiple times, as if talking through it would help my nervousness.  By the end of it he states ""well obviously this is why you're alone."" I agreed and we sat in silence while he dropped me back at work. And when I drove myself back home, I didn't even want to listen to music.

4761,SpookyStarfruit,1648944509,1,"So, as the above stated, I was told of R/Lonely and have been coming back to this subreffit for the past few weeks every now and then. I’m quite the rambler and highly compulsive on organizing out my messy thoughts (esp in lists!!!) so the best format to do this would be to list out reasons I’ve been feeling lonely.

For context: I’m a 22F, American learning Dutch, and a generally quiet ambivert. For the past 2 years — **due to not having IRL friends nor a strong support network in my hometown** and a family who struggles to communicate with me (er, we don’t exactly see “eye to eye”) — I’ve been trying to make international friends on an app called “Bottled.” I met some nice people here and there who pandered in + out of my life, but rarely anyone I connected to. I suppose it showed me that outside of my hometown, I would still felt like an alien essentially. An outsider to the world, longing for some form of substantial, meaningful connection.

In the end, I hope there’s someone out there who can somewhat relate. A good friend I’d hope to find through difficult times &amp; heavy thoughts, and who better but one who understands?

But hey — let’s skip to the chase! (I tend to overtype, oh boy)

##No. 1: Unlike many of my peers, I didn’t grow up with a happy, supportive, stable family.

There were many times when my family was unable to support me (not going into too many details). But it had affected me strongly, to the point where for years seeing families with loving mothers, dependable fathers, doting grandparents, and helpful aunts and uncles or people with older siblings who could guide them along really bothered me. Especially a loving mother. I’m the oldest of my 2 siblings and grew up taking the brunt of my mother’s anger.

Although things are long over, there’s a part of me that feels heavily alienated watching loving families from the point of view as an outsider who will never know the feeling.

##No. 2: Cultural crisis, wishing I had a sense of belonging others did.

Let me note that I never quite liked anyone priding themselves in their heritage/genealogy or nationality (ie, where they were born). My bad experiences with my family, who immigrated from a different country with a tough, heavy filial cultural expectations marked me as jaded on this matter for the most part; frankly, I’m skeptical of taking the environment you were given and its norms as a truth.

But being online a lot and seeing how many people from different countries just click so well in their cultures, have a place they feel they belong (reaffirmed by those around them), or no major conflicts to come to terms to because of the circumstances of their birth gives me a tinge of envy. Even those from my parents’ home country, who I began to envy, when I previously wanted nothing with my heritage, as it gave me such bad memories.

The area of the US I grew in is open-minded and accepting but I don’t know... I always still felt conflicted. And with a lot of hatred directed at this particular nationality online, I feel oftentimes distressed and guilty even if it’s not logical to take responsibility for things you can’t help — like your country’s governments’ actions or your country’s history. That people aren’t their countries but rather individuals. But many times, I feel lonely because of a feeling that I wish I was born another way, that I belonged somewhere, that I didn’t have so many jaded personal conflicts.

##No.3: My real life friends either abandoned me or pandered out of my life.

I was never the “fun” friend — someone they messaged first (usually, I initiated), someone they wanted to invite out, be around, spend time with. I even found out very recently that a girl I believed to be my best friend for years actually considered someone else her best friend. And I have a stream of memories of our mutual friends/others from high school who many times let me down last minute, never initiated, mostly led me to pull the weight in the friendship.

Real-life friendships are something so important and common to many people, but I only ended up lonely where I am. Which added to the hurt not having a loving family to come home to added.

##No. 4: I was sheltered most of my life.

I never stepped out of the house with adult supervision before turning 18. My family sheltered me quite a bit, and when hit with adulthood, I was unable to handle the panic of things I was never taught — for instance, paperwork. I didn’t have those normal casual hang outs everyone seemed to have so easily throughout my teen years. And my childhood wasn’t spent playing at friends house or celebrating important days with them.

##No. 5: I didn’t get to take the “conventional path” everyone else did.

Which leads me to this.

Because of being so sheltered, I wasn’t able to pursue university after graduating high school. Two months ago, I turned 22 and realized that the summer of this year is when most of the peers I graduated with will be getting their bachelor’s degree after having the time of their lives getting all their exciting college experiences. Probably going off to do amazing things in interesting fields, and getting to travel with the friends they’ve made or go new places, have adventures I can only dream of.

Meanwhile, I feel like I’m wobbling behind, slowly getting left farther and farther back.

I see their photos, hear of their fun experiences in college, and all I can do is start to feel lonelier and lonelier because I wasn’t able to make it that far and am still struggle to overcome my numerous issues back at home...

##No. 6: I’m terrible at picking up social cues and have massive social anxiety in person.

Which honestly just makes it hard for me to approach or understand people in many cases.

##And lastly, No. 7: I can’t relate to most pf the conversations, mindsets, or viewpoints people have.

Sometimes I feel like people judge themselves, others, and the world at a surface level. Sometimes I feel the things they care for are superficial (looks, achievements, being strong in the face of adversity &amp; valuing strength to the point of Social Darwinism). And it really bothers me and makes it hard for me to understand.

People end up making poor assumptions or conclusions of another’s situation.

Now when trying to talk to people, I just feel lonely because if I mentioned my point of view or situation, it gets dismissed pretty quickly. But I almost can’t stand the lack of empathy, the unwillingness to see some others’ situations aren’t always going to be ideal. Actually, sometimes their dismissiveness starts to get to me because I can start to feel hurt and lonely because I don’t even know who to talk to about the situation anymore without being dismissed like many previous friends and family members have.

##Bonus, No. 8: I can only connect to cats!

Title says it all! even started volunteering with them because their presence gives me comfort people can not. I suppose that’s an odd trait of mine.

**Alright — if you read this far and can relate, please say something.** I want to know I’m not the only one out there struggling in my mind, struggling to find a place in the world, who won’t come back to a happy home, or friends who care.

But sometimes, when I look at pictures from my childhood, I get an overwhelming feeling of loneliness. It's not the feeling of being alone, but it's the feeling that no one in my life today was in my life during my formative childhood years. 

I moved across the country for college when I was 18, and settled down in the same city where I went to college. I lost touch with all of my high school friends within months of starting college, only to reunite with them virtually via Facebook some 15 years later. But we're all different now, and will never actually see each other in person again. We like each other's pictures on social media now. It's not real ""friendship."" 

I have pictures from birthday parties I had as a child, or just times I hung out with high school friends. The people in those pictures and the places they were taken... all completely meaningless to the people in my life now. 

And my relatives from my childhood? All dead or struggling with dementia. I have a family photo from the Christas of 1996. There are 11 people in that picture. I am the only one who is still alive or still able to carry on a coherent conversation. 

Of all of the people in my life today, my wife is the person I've known the longest. I met her when I was 21. All of my memories of the first 20 years of my life are just that... memories just for me. I have no one to sit around and reminisce with.

4775,Normal_Entertainer47,1648939773,1,"I have deep rooted abandonment issues and I need help. 

I grew up under parents that were really controlling. Me and my siblings were their underlings. To this day we never had personal relationships because we're considered underlings. Our opinions and perspectives never mattered to them. Something that destroyed our (fake) relationships as adults. 

My siblings and I kind of took after our parents and aren't particularly close. Our household was strange, it was like strangers living in different sections, who never interacted with each other unless necessary. But I thought it was normal. 

I don't have any external family. I do, but they've never been in my life. When I was younger I moved around a lot and didn't have a real friend or anyone that I grew up with. No real bbq's, parties, family events, they were all kind of forced and a bit strange because I never knew how to interact in them, like I said, we weren't close but because they were family, I know I was supposed to act differently with them. 

I've gone to college and realized that everyone wasn't like us. I met friends at school but they all live in other states now. Every girl I met has pretty much left me. My college gf said that I have no one and it's weird to her but I honestly don't know how to change it. It's the one thing that I've always wished i can change. 

When she left me it was hard to take, she was the first person I've ever let in. And she left me and didn't even look back or have a care in the world. I was back to my emptiness and loneliness. I would've did anything just to have one person for me. I actually got a job in her state and moved but it wasn't the same and I ended up quitting the job because I was still lonely and ofc she didn't care that I was close by. 

I tried to rekindle the relationships w/ my family but they all kind of disrespected me when I did. All things that attributed to me really feeling deep abandonment and emotional pain. I'm honestly in my late 20's and I'm like an old person in an old folks home if i get to talk to someone. Just so grateful and long winded, when I'm probably naturally an introvert lol 

Anyway, recently I was talking to someone who left me in the dust again because she wasn't ready for a relationship. I find that I go for people that are emotionally unavailable(i think she was hiding a drug issue), probably because I'm used to it with my mother/family. Anyway, needless to say I disrespected myself so much trying to get her to change her mind. Anything would honestly be better than me going back to my solitary confinement. But again, she left me in the dust and didn't look back. Probably because she actually has a life w/ people and family that she can go back to, where I don't. 

Can anyone relate to me? What can I do? I know I shouldn't have abandonment issues and that there's probably better ways to go about things but how do I stop myself from wanting companionship when I feel so desperate for it. I feel it in my soul. Just hurts how easily ppl able to not know about me.",lonely,"Abandonment! Help, How do I Get Over this!?",2022-04-03 08:49:33

5. I'm probably not entirely ready to face the reality of socializing yet, let alone companionship.

I’m very introverted. I don’t need a lot of socialization. But after some drama~ in the past year, I’ve lost my main community and friend group, in addition to moving to a new place.

I am not totally alone. I have one long-standing friend, and my husband. I get along great with both of them. But of course, they get busy, they work, they have things to do. I don’t expect them to drop everything every time I want to chit chat with someone.

I used to make most of my friends at work, but remote work and a recent career change has made that much more challenging. There are very few chances to “hang out” like there were in the past. Any time I talk to coworkers, it’s strictly business.

I have a variety of interests. I’m learning to cook, I do programming, I’ve done a lot of travel. We’ve started a vegetable garden and are in the planning stages of getting homesteading animals like rabbits and chickens. I think I’m pretty approachable. Easy to talk to, good listener. I don’t think I come off as awkward or desperate (though maybe I do, because if I’m being honest, I am). I try to do both give and take in conversations - I let other people talk about what they want and steer the conversation, but I contribute too.

My casual relationships are constant disappointments. I’ve already gotten rid of all social media, but I’m considering going nuclear and just eliminating everyone from my life.

4834,Texley_Ad760,1648914973,1,"I’m a 30 year old guy in northeast Nebraska. I’m a small farmer(crops, cattle, hogs) 
I came back to the family farm in 2015 after college and traveling the world, mostly because I wanted to have a family on the farm and make a life in the community I am from. It’s such a great a small town. I started farming with my dad and grandpa, and I’m really fortunate to have great friends that have been there for me. This last November my dad died (57) and 3 weeks ago my grandpa died (87). The farm now rests on my shoulders. I’m very capable and love it. I just feel so alone. I haven’t dated anyone in quite some time. It’s really difficult to date in a small town and due to my responsibilities I can’t really leave that often.  I’ve used dating apps, but I’ve gotten so tired of it. It’s always mostly just hook ups, and when I try to organize an actual date I get ghosted. 
It’s really hard being alone in my house and on the farm with out having someone who wants to build that life with you. All of my friends are married or engaged, and starting to have kids. They’ve been really great with me, but I am self conscious because I don’t want to text them all the time to see if they want to hang out…they have their own lives and need to take care of their own stuff. Im an only child, and I think that has my dad’s death harder because I can’t really talk to anyone who can relate on the same level with me.
It’d be nice to wake up with a good woman, share some coffee, and feel motivated to take on the day. I came here to have make a good simple life for a family, and sometimes it feels like that just isn’t going to happen.

4837,Unlucky_Ad7732,1648914760,1,"It hurts. It fucking hurts. I have never been able to connect to anyone in my life on a deep level. Nobody.

I don't have that childhood friend that I can honestly share my feelings with. I never had a friend like that. I had many friends over the course of grade school, but absolutely none I ever connected to on a deep level like that.

I was a dork growing up and all my friends were dorks. A lot of us had autism or ADHD or depression, things like that. We were all socially awkward to an extent. But that resulted in us only connecting superficially, through gaming, pop culture, and internet culture. We never bonded on a level truly deeper than that, and in hindsight it is very depressing.

I felt distant to my high school friends because of this. Why did I feel so distant? Maybe it was because I wasn't as invested in that stuff as them.

In my Junior year I started consuming a bunch of TV, movies, and games because I felt this would develop my personality, which was laughably pathetic but true. I always saw everyone talking about this stuff in school so I thought doing so would better help me connect to people. This was around the time the Quarantine began so I had a lot of time to do this.

I don't think it really did anything for me. I didn't contact my friends for the rest of high school. I haven't talked to them since graduation.

It's honestly the same thing with my online friends. Everyone just cracks silly jokes or gets all negative about drama. Something about them radiates negativity to me. I feel like I can't be myself around them because they get irritated over the littlest of things in people.

I can't connect to anyone in my life on any meaningful level. I've spent the last few years feeling inferior to everyone around me and trying to be the people around me. I've neglected myself and my own personality, but I don't really know who ""myself"" is at this point.

There are things I want to do. I want more intellectual stimulation. I wanna read more, learn history and politics, learn to cook, develop my taste in music, improve my art skills, but that's not who I am now. The real interests I had, I neglected in an attempt to be others by wasting my time consuming media.

My personality is underdeveloped as a result. I'm not the person I want to be, and I feel like an uninteresting person as a result. I know I would probably find myself uninteresting.

I've quit all the timewasters like games and TV and stuff, but now my life feels so empty. I only connected to people through media, which is sad. I want to connect to others on a deeper level but it feels too late.

Why even attempt to make friends when I'm not the person I want to be? When I am someone who I would not even want to be friends with?

I have always been picked on for being smart and attacked for being different and all of their hate worked! I’m all alone and in a really bad condition and situation. I was doing really good but it’s hard to fight everybody, especially with no money!

I don’t even know what to do with myself. I mean, I can play the Xbox but that gets old. I could drink more liquor and beer but that’s getting old. I could sleep all day, but that’s getting old too!

I’m stuck in a small room in my mothers house. My mother and I haven’t talked for more than 3-5 minutes ever and I’m 36! My father made fun of me and abandoned me at a very young age. 

I have no one to talk to. No one to listen to. No one to share anything with. No one likes me, and they’re happy that I’m not doing so well; they put me in this position to watch me lose! Now all I can do is lose.

I’ve tried everything. I’m tired. I ran away and became a millionaire only to lose everything. I went to college to become a teacher, but ended up having to drop out because my mom stole my money.

I’ve tried everything to be successful and have a life, but my mother and her family keeps on holding me down. I really wish I had a girl to call and money to live with her. I really wish that I could just lay here and rot away soon. The only thing is, my mother picks on me and I can’t even really relax. I know she wants me gone!

I don’t want to be homeless and can’t even eat or die. I’m at peace with myself and God, and I’ve embraced death, so I’m not really worried about dying alone, it’s just a matter of when. I wish I could die of alcohol poisoning soon, or in my sleep. Then I wouldn’t be threatened with homelessness and pain. I’m too weak to struggle anymore.

I don’t know what it’s like to have true friends and love. They all drove me out of my mind. I’m sick, I’m abandoned, I’m neglected, and living a genuine nightmare!

I just wish I could meet a girl from this sub in person so we can keep each other company.

Trigger Warning: Some events described in this story may be very disturbing 

  
  I just turned 61 years of age at the beginning of this month. So, I am dealing with the acceptance of being treated differently because of my age. I have been on Social Security Disability Insurance since 2002. So, I have been dealing with the acceptance of being treated differently because of my disabilities as this treated has progressively gotten more and more negative as I age. I have been on Medicare since 2003. So, I have been dealing with the acceptance that denial of services based on Medicare quotas is my new reality and access to healthcare has been becoming progressively harder and harder to obtain as the years pass. Combine my age, income level, and disabilities and I have recently been faced with the reality of healthcare DE-prioritization based on Quality of Life Years (QALY) and Disability Life Years (DALY) calculations. 

  
  Add to this the recent lab results and diagnoses of Psuedomonas aeruginosa and Fusarium in my lungs--both of which are highly treatment resistant and life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals--Bronchiectasis, crippling side effects of Levoflaxacin, a CT scan finding a 5mm nodule in one of my lungs, and as yet to be confirmed diagnosis of mild or moderate Cystic Fibrosis followed by receiving a formal dismissal from services letter from the Kansas University Physicians Network despite the fact that I have hereditary chronic pancreatitis, my daughter and two of my granddaughters tested positive for the genetic SPINK1 mutation, and my sister and her son tested positive for the genetic CFTR mutation. After the dismissal from medical services, I received dismissive treatment by a Overland Park Regional Hospital Emergency Department doctor, and discharge instructions from Menorah Hospital after the CT scan to follow-up in one year with no bronchoscopy, no biopsy, and the stress heightens. 

  
  In an effort to find healthcare, I reached out to several medical professionals from traditional to holistic only to find that my limited income is inadequate to obtain the care I need and there are no medical practitioners who work on a sliding scale based on income except for those who want to push pharmaceuticals. What I'm looking for is a doctor who will sit with me, sift through the page-long list of diagnoses in my chart, toss out all that are no longer appropriate or never were, see what is left and look at them as symptoms of an underlying cause, and fix it. I want to me healed rather than just have symptoms masked; but, no one will listen to me unless I have money to pay them what they believe they are worth. No one wants to help me just because they see my worth as a human being. A human must either have money to pay for the care they need or be compliant in adding to the wealth of Big Pharma. 

  
  Part of the problem with accessing medical care is the fact that I live in a semi-rural area with no vehicle. I was turned away by 37 medical transportation agencies for either being over income, having no Medicaid coverage because I'm $200 over income and only qualify for Qualified Medicare Benefits (QMB) with $2600 spend-down I am unable to meet, or I am out of the service area. I am unable to afford ride-share transportation. I found that out when I had to pay $80 for a round trip to my Primary Care doctor's office before being dismissed from care. That was for a walk-in visit to the lab. Ride-share is unreliable for appointments; because there is no possibility to book a firm ride in advance and there are few drivers willing to accept anything other than a Metro area pickup. There is no public transportation available to me unless I can find transportation into the service area. Even taxi companies are unreliable with regards to timing for an appointment, aside from being outrageously out of my price range. 

  
  My Medicare Advantage Plan only allows a choice between In Home Health Services when a client is incapacitated through disability including after surgery or medical transportation. I chose the in home services because it was beneficial in the past after I had back surgery and I was always able to access medical transportation through County Mental Health even though they prioritize work and school rides. Unfortunately, that was pre-COVID. Now, staffing is skeletal; so, medical rides are minimal, unpredictable, and the rare times they are available, given with an attitude of inconvenience by schedulers and their supervisors—your medical ride is less important than the needs of 'productive persons' who work and go to school. 

  
  Couple this with housing issues involving willful negligence by apartment management regarding a plumbing leak under the bathroom floor, ceiling storm damage, mold exposure confirmed by a mold inspection expert, and 10-month exposure to slow carbon monoxide poisoning confirmed by a housing inspector's report, and snakes inside the apartment found three times by my cats including snake eggs found with the third snake, all ignored by management until an Adult Protective Services worker became involved to force management to address the snakes, life becomes a struggle. 

  
  When trying to resolve the two issues of healthcare and housing, I am turned away by three law firms, the third one having the decency to send be a formal letter declining services citing “a conflict between law and fact” because QALYs and DALYs legally allow my healthcare to be DE-prioritized and housing codes allow property owners the option to make a “earnest effort” giving them a 90-day clock to fix the problems in which, if earnest effort is again made, the 90-day clock restarts, the detailed documentation of the issues is moot. The only other available option is issuing a 14/30 to the landlord; meaning, they have 14 days to fix everything or consider the document a 30-day notice of termination of lease. Now, this is only effective if I have the money to move and follow through with the ultimatum of a 14/30; which, management knows full well that is impossible for me. 

  
  When it became apparent that I needed help with basic housekeeping because of the debilitating effects of the Levofloxacin, I hired an In Home Supportive Services worker through the County. This person ended up stealing my medication and I had to fire her. Rather than trust another stranger, I hired my former husband and friend of 30 years and got him on the County IHSS payroll and paid all of his living expenses because he was unemployed and his Pandemic Unemployment Assistance had run out. Three months in, he informs me that he feels like a “F-ing slave”. During the argument wherein I reminded him that “slaves don't get paid”, he proceeds to volunteer to me that he had broken his promise of refraining from bringing marijuana across State lines because Kansas has strict laws against cannabis and, because of my seizure activity, I must avoid exposure to cannabis, including secondhand smoke, or suffer exacerbation of my seizure symptoms. 

  
  I informed him that possession of marijuana is a direct violation and grounds for immediate termination of the lease. I asked him, “Why would you put someone you love in a legal bind and put their basic needs for housing in jeopardy like this? If I fail to let management know and they later find out, I would be complicit and be evicted as well.” He responded, “I thought to myself, what she doesn't know won't hurt her.” 

  
  “If you thought that, why would you tell me? You volunteered this information. I never asked you, I never suspect, I never accused you; because, I believed you. I trusted you. You knew I thought you were the last person of could still trust. Do you even understand that you have committed a Federal Felony by transporting a Federally controlled substance across State lines?” 

  
  During the argument wherein he is refusing to leave, he gets up abruptly, grabs his rifle, goes out the door, and drives away. I called the crisis line because I am freaking out. He has threatened suicide before. So, I have no idea if this is just some sort of display to get me to change my mind about kicking him out or if this is serious. The crisis counselor advises me to call the Sheriff's Department to check on his welfare; which, I did. While I wait for the Sheriff, I leave a desperate voicemail on my sister's phone. The Deputies arrive and talk to my former husband informing him that, technically, I am correct and well within my legal rights to have him leave. They get us to agree to be civil for a week so he can get his affairs in order to leave. 

  
  A few minutes after the deputies leave, more deputies are dispatched to my address because my sister called the Sheriff's Department after hearing my voicemail. She is in another State unable to reach me because I was talking with the first group of deputies. She informs them I sound distraught, she has no idea what the situation between me and my former husband is; but, she knows he has weapons. The deputies come back in force—five of them. So, now, my neighbors want nothing to do with me because they think I am a crazy person. 

  
  The reason I felt my former husband was the last person I could trust is because, three years previously, I had moved out of State to help my daughter and grandchildren with a medical crisis. My daughter has six children, two of whom have chronic childhood pancreatitis. She was in and out of the hospital with one or the other child almost every three weeks for between 3 to 30 days each stay and needed help with the care and supervision of the other children. So, I disposed of all of my belongings and moved out there into my sister's home temporarily until I could save enough money to get into my own housing. 

  
  While living at my sister's home, her sister-in-law, a person I had met in my 20s and who became a family member when my sister married the woman's brother, was stabbed to death by her son, who subsequently committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. We were informed that the Police and Coroner's Departments offer no crime scene cleanup services. My sister's mother-in-law refused to hire a cleaning company. So, my sister enlisted family members, including me, to help clean up the bloody crime scene. 

  
  Shortly thereafter, I moved into my own home and tried to get into mental health services to process this trauma. I was turned away by 25 clinics saying they were at their Medicare quotas. I called the State Ombudsman and Governor's Advocacy offices for help and was told they only help with Medicaid. My daughter knew the trauma I was dealing with and the trouble I was having getting into mental health treatment. She and the rest of my family thought that, despite this, I should still be on my best behavior. After a small disagreement that escalated over email and text, my daughter kicked me out of her life and the lives of my grandchildren. I have had no contact with my grandchildren for almost 3 years now. 

  
  During this time, I was providing childcare to my niece. I became physically ill and asked for some time off. She told me, “Maybe we're not a good fit and I should find someone else.” To which I responded, “That's your prerogative.” 

  
  “You know, the kids and I didn't care for you anyway. You were just free.” 

  
  “Best of luck with your childcare.” 

  
  After this, my sister and her family went no contact with me. This was followed by no contact initiated by the rest of my family members, each giving different reasons. I moved to another State to stay with my former husband only to have the same difficulties accessing mental health services. I called NAMI and was told to file a complaint with the Federal Comptroller who told me I would receive no information regarding the disposition of the investigation. When I finally did find a therapist who would work with me, she fired herself two weeks in saying my family issues were too triggering for her. It was then, I asked my former husband to take me back to the State where I had moved from thinking I was going back home and things would be better after I got back into mental health treatment there. 

  
  As described above, that was far from what happened. I began writing a memoir blog. My daughter threatened me with a defamation lawsuit. When that failed, she publicly accused me of pimping her out to her husband before they got married in some sort of sex trafficking scheme. Mind you, they married, had five children together, had a successful business together wherein he worked under her contractor's license; yet, she says I allowed him to groom her for this. I told her, “Your logic makes no sense. If you thought I was a child sex trafficker, you, as a responsible parent, would never have asked me to move out of State to care for and supervised your children in your absence.” 

  
  My friends and my son who lives here abandoned me shortly after all of these problems began, telling me I am just too negative. Yes. I am dealing with a lot of huge, negative things all at the same time and I refuse to put on a happy face and pretend everything is fine. Unfortunately for me, my friends and family have always seen me as the strong one, whom they could rely on to support them through any difficulties they face. It is very disturbing for them to see me fall apart. 

  
  I have been trying to pull myself together and solve all of these problems while I am literally isolated in a semi-rural area without transportation and zero moral support. Even my therapist and I had to part ways because her mother is dying and she is unable to be the support I need. 

  
  Well, this morning, after sharing the exciting news with my son that, I found out last night, one of my articles which was published here on The Mighty was also published on MSN, I received a text from him informing me that, a repressed memory of me attempting to drown him when he was an infant was brought forward into his consciousness after watching a television show regarding the same subject matter. It is important to note here, that my son, according to what my therapist told me several years ago, has some form of untreated schizophrenia. Even though I am aware of this, his revelation to me comes at a moment in which I have been dealing with family mobbing of me as the scapegoat once again. 

  
  In my distress, I decide to call a Mental Health Peer Support Warm-line because I feel it unnecessary to call an emergency crisis line and take a spot someone in true crisis may need, yet I still need to talk with someone. While describing half of the above, I stop to take a breath. There is dead air for a full minute. I ask, “Did you fall asleep?” The peer counselor replied, “I'm still here. I'm listening.” So, I proceed to pour my heart out telling him the rest. He then interrupts me and says, “My shift is over. If you still need to talk, you can call back in a few minutes and talk to the counselor taking the next shift. But, I want to let you know, I've listened to you for a half hour longer than I'm allowed on a call.   
  “Congratulations,” I say. And I hung up the phone. 

  
  Are you kidding me? This person just sat there. No, “Mhm. Really. I'm sorry you're going through this”. Nothing, not a peep. Was he just sitting there checking his watch? I feel very sorry for anyone who calls and ends up hurting themselves over this kind of dismissive invalidation. 

  
  I am literally isolated—no family, no friends, no transportation, no neighborly kindness, no medical care, bare bones mental healthcare just to keep me from suicide or homicidal thoughts. So, I call a warm-line to receive a scrap of compassion or even a bit of sympathy and all I get is dead air and then attitude from the peer counselor about how I should have been grateful to vent into my phone to someone who was hardly present on the other end.

And by people in my life I mean family because I don’t have anyone else. And back when I used to go to school the people I hung out with threw things at me and left me behind. Also told everyone a personal thing about me for no fucking reason. 

Now whenever I think about hanging out with other people it makes me angry. Like there are no true people out there who aren’t pieces of shit. Where are the true people who don’t care about superficial stuff and are actually good? Nowhere it seems. Everyday is so depressing for someone like me who can’t find any hope in humanity. It fucking hurts that there are no good people left. I’m not saying I’m a good person because that’s up for debate. But the more depressed I get I hate everyone more. I just hate everyone right now.

Yesterday someone told me that I never tell anyone anything about me and I almost wanted to reply that I just don't like parties and that's what most others talk about all day long. But I couldn't even finish the first word before he already got distracted again.

There's one girl I am trying to become friends with but she always denies when I want to meet up telling me she's busy or already arranged. And when we plan something she tells me something like her grandma is over and stays longer than expected she doesn't have as much time as planned. So we meet up for like 2 hours a month and it always feels like she's just doing it so she can tell me that we just have met up. Planning something with her is a mess as well... She denies all of my suggestions and barely makes any herself although she meets up with others all of the time probably having way more ideas than I could possibly even think of.

I’m not to big into fizzy water either.

I’ve been snacking less and when I do snack it’s healthier items like Peanuts

If you could connect with another person in some way, someone who got you or shared a similar interest or mindset, what would that relationship look like? Would it be meeting in person doing something every week. Chatting online? Playing a game? Sharing a hobby?

We agreed to have each other on there so if we needed to we could check up on each other and see where the other person is at to make sure they’re safe. Well tonight I checked my phone to see where her location was and to my surprise I can’t see her location anymore. Now I don’t know if she’s done this on purpose or accidentally but I don’t know how to address her about it. Would it be weird if I did? Would it sound like I’m a stalker and need to see her locations at all times? Because I definitely am not one. I just don’t know why she would stop sharing her location with me. So my question to you guys is is she trying to slowly stop being friends with me? Could I have maybe done something for her to stop sharing her location with me?

I tried talking to her on Monday, and it was fine, but then I came to the realization that if we’re not dating anymore, she should be equally responsible for starting conversations as me. On Tuesday, I didn’t talk at all to her, and she was really angry all day long for no reason (I don’t think bc of me, but ig it’s possible). Today, I went into work, and didn’t talk to her, and also didn’t make eye contact the entire time. By the end of the shift, I could tell she was waiting for me to say bye. She looked at me a few times right before I was leaving trying to make eye contact, but I walked right by her and kept my eyes forward. 

It sounds petty, but it feels good to not be giving her what she wants.

I can at least say im kinda glad I can move on and try to stop thinking about her for the first time. Although that’s gonna be though for me.

Besides that, I’m almost 19 and I live by myself, with no job, no friends, and been single my whole life. it’s been really hard for me to find ppl to talk to, I’ve never been more antisocial in my life and it’s hard to have conversations now. The only person I can talk to is now is gone. 

I’m just so lonely everyday and I’m sick of it, it’s completely affected my life negatively in every possible way. I think the only thing that keeps me going are my hobby’s. I think a-lot people presume that I’m living the life since I’m pretty big on tiktok and People always saying they wish they were me but no you don’t. I am in pain everyday and I make these stupid tiktoks mostly just to feel appreciated and not feel completely worthless.

4908,sassykitchen,1648871546,1,"A year ago I ended the only friendship that I have ever had. I stopped talking to anyone because I wanted to think about myself a little bit, I had to figure out what I wanted to do in my life, after high school. I realized that my behaviour was that a little selfish and I wanted to apologize to my friends but they didn’t forgave me. Since I have never had any other friends I just don’t know how to act around people and how to meet new persons.

I moved out at the end of summer to live alone in my own apartment. And I also started uni but I really didn’t know what to expect since I’ve never knew what to do in my life like I have no hobbies, No interest in anything I don’t have any talents or whatever. School never really worked out for me. I spend my entire life doing the minimum of what I am capable of because of my lack of motivation I guess.

During the first semester I only went to school because I had nothing else to do and honestly I really don’t know why I went to school because I study cinema and I don’t know why but every time I study some thing for school it’s just disgust me of the thing. Like I didn’t watched any movies during the first semester. Now I just stopped going to school at all, I don’t do anything. I don’t see anyone and I just hate myself I’m living with myself and I just can’t stand it.

Since September I started to hate my skin, every single part of my body is itchy and it causes me insomnia I really don’t remember the last time I had a complete night. When I tell my family that I spend a lot of sleepless nights they just don’t believe me, or they tell me that it if I don’t feel good I should see a doctor. but the thing is that I feel so ashamed of myself that I don’t want anyone to see me so I just don’t take care of it and everything that I have in my head is : what’s the point of seeing a doctor because I don’t even care about myself.

Actually i think that I’m scared of growing up because I am 19 and I’ve never lived anything, like I’ve always had the same friends (that I don’t have anymore). I’ve never dated anyone because of the shame that I have for myself I refuse to get intimate with anyone I guess, but I really don’t mind it, like it’s not some thing that triggers me. I’ve never worked because I think that I don’t have any capacity to do anything useful for anyone. I don’t want to learn how to drive a car, my dad always talk about when am I going to take care of my driver license but this is really is the last thing that I think about and I can see you then it really annoys him because he wants me to be independent but it just terrifies me.

I really really think that I’m useless, I’m not leaving I’m just existing and don’t do anything in my life, I really am wasting it and I’m the only person that I can blame I hate it. I only have negative thoughts, I don’t know why because I have nothing to complain about and I kind of feel guilty about it, but yeah I have never hated myself and I have never felt so alone as much as now.",lonely,I hate myself,2022-04-02 14:52:26

4911,randoteacher99,1648871033,1,"I’m 25m and I work at a middle school social studies teacher. I live at home with my mom because I can’t afford rent on my salary where I live. 

My mom kinda just sits around at home and watches TV while I work for the 4 hours I have between dinner and when I go to bed. I don’t feel connected to her. When Jen came home from Spring Break, they just binge watched Drag Race and were engrossed in it. I can’t focus on my work while the TV is blaring, but it’s unfair to ask them to be silent while I work. So I have to go into my room, away from them so I can be productive. I feel like fremont plus my masters plus track just consumes my life, and I don’t have time to follow my passions, like run for my own fitness goals. I can’t do the stuff I enjoy, like listen to podcasts or play video games. I feel like I’m fighting and clawing to just make it through the day. I don’t know if it’s sustainable. I KNOW it isn’t sustainable if I want to be happy. But I feel like teaching is my passion and my calling. Maybe it’s just this school? Which I’ve been told is uniquely weird and dysfunctional. I don’t know. What I do know is that I’m lonely, and my family doesn’t seem to notice or care. Like how they didn’t get me Gregg’s after they are dinner, and Jen admonished me for wanting any. She said I’m lucky they even brought me dinner back home. Isn’t that just basic courtesy? Have I gone insane? I don’t know anymore. It feels fucked up for her to say that, or for mom to say “oh well grandma keeps the car hot so the ice cream would’ve melted.” I just feel a bit unloved, and that hard because Dad is a psychopathic narcissist. So I don’t have many family members left who can love me normally, and it feels like some of that has fallen away. I just want to sleep and quit my job and find time to renew myself and do the shit I love. But I can’t. It’s hard.

Perhaps that is not the case, but it feels like it sometimes. And yeah, I imagine it's not all it's made out to be, and I would never want to burden a partner with my issues, but I don't know any other way how. How do you go from a chronically single, depressed weirdo deprived of romantic attention/affection into a normal person with a healthy relationship? Let alone when I already feel disconnected from the masses.

I've heard it all. Work on yourself. Work on your confidence, social skills, etc. - but if I'm being honest, will doing these things really satisfy this intense desire that I feel deep within my heart on a day to day basis? Will they heal the feelings of being a late bloomer in dating and relationships? Will it fill the hole and deep sense of loneliness in my heart? Will it make all the lost time worth it? I don't know. People seem to say it won't, but I guess I don't know what I'm missing anyways.

4925,WhyAreYouScaredHoney,1648864892,1,"I genuinely respect and love my friends. They are all amazing people, and it feels like we've known each other forever, even though it's only been a year. But I don't think things are going to work out for us. We've had crushes on each other in the past, and now, in both of my newly developed two three-way friendships with them (separately), I just feel out of place.

It's been almost a month, and I don't think I can take it much longer. I've known each person in the friendship for much longer than everyone else has, but I'm still not even near as close are they are. I know it sounds jealous, but I really do support their relationships. I just wish I didn't have to be there for all of it. I wish I would have been more open with them with expressing my concerns with the friendship in the first place, and also in general. I love them, but I'll never get their inside jokes or rips at me, no matter how long I'm there. I'm either the joke, ignored or having to laugh along/listen while one talks badly about the other one, but hold my tongue. 

Whenever I try to hang out with someone else, or just by myself, they always come along. If I was included, I wouldn't mind. Honestly, it's okay if I'm not, as long as I'm not insulted. But I've been ditched, poked at and interrupted by them so many times, it's just too much at this point. I have to repeat myself five times to be heard as much as them, and even then, I'm still not *there*. I don't think I ever will be.  It feels like I'll never be as important to them, and my feelings are an afterthought unless I'm very upset at them. I try and play along, but it's hard to when the only thing that's up for conversation are my insecurities. I've always been self-conscious about my body, especially my ears and back, and I've mentioned this to them, but it doesn't really matter. I'm an easy target, but I don't think that makes it any more justified of a thing to do to me, or anyone, really. 

Not to mention some have psychically assaulted me and cursed me out, who seemed like genuinely nice people in the beginning. It shocks me. 

I have a past of abusive relationships, but I didn't expect it from them, you know? We used to be in love, and now they're hitting me, but won't listen to a word I say. They say sorry, but it feels so insincere at this point. 

They've told me I'll never be good enough to achieve my dreams, but can't stop talking about their own. I know it sounds selfish, but I want to be able to have a moment sometimes. People always say I come off as so positive and cheery, so I don't really have an excuse for not being so. 

I hope this doesn't come off as a targeted-message at them, I just needed to get it all off of my chest. It's not in order, though I feel I'm still getting my message across.

In the space of a couple of months I lost my home, my partner, my entire group of friends and cut off all contact with my father. I'm now living alone in a completely different part of the country. I have no friends and I work from home so I don't even see anyone in the workplace. The person I speak to most often is the shopkeeper when I do my shopping.

It shouldn't be like this, I'm young, I should be going out with friends and living my life but instead I spend every single day alone. I try and get out and go for long walks at the weekend because there isn't anything else to do. I don't even own a TV. I feel like I've forgotten how to socialise.

The days and weeks pass by so fast that it scares me. I hate the fact that I have missed my chance to have a close group of friends, as most people meet through school.

I have tried making friends online by joining groups but it hasn't really been that successful. I was wondering if anyone else relates to this, and would maybe like to talk? 

I really like horror films and play games on switch, I'm interested in things like tarot cards, I love cats, I watch a lot of tiktok, and true crime YouTube videos

We’re good friends and over the last few weeks I was getting the vibe that she just saw me as a friend, but I wasn’t sure some days I thought there was a chance she liked me. My mental health has been in hell for 3 years so meeting her was a breath of fresh air.

Well one week ago we stayed up late talking and she opened up and started talking about her crush…and it wasn’t me of course. She even suggested “as a joke” to have me talk to him for her because I sort of know him. I’m happy being friends because she’s really cool, but I wish it could’ve gone farther.

Anyway I was already getting friendzone vibes before hand so a day or 2 before I downloaded Tinder and Bumble because it’s so hard for me to meet people irl. Bad decision. I’ve had 13 total likes and 4 total matches so far but 2 of them never responded to me and one was just trying to promote her Snapchat. Only one match responded we talked for a few days, and I tried to set up a date, he agreed, and when I tried to plan the date further a couple days later he never responded. 

I was so excited for this date, we had stuff in common, he seemed really cute, and I was going to drive out 3 hours to meet him. I feel so depressed. I knew this would all happen. What tf is wrong with me? This was probably my only chance at a date too because I live in a rural area and have already ran out of people to swipe on and I have no other real matches. I know dating apps are brutal but I didn’t realize how much it would impact me.

It doesn’t help that irl nothing’s working out for me either. Why was I born so ugly and socially awkward? I knew I never had a chance with her, I knew dating apps were a bad idea. My whole life is like this. I’m going to die alone I swear to god because there’s something about me that most people don’t like. I try to be as nice as I can and not come across desperate, in fact I might be too avoidant, I try so hard with people just to receive nothing back most of the time.

Had times where I did not know if the next meal was ever going to come. 

I’ve been an active addict and I’ve lived large periods of my life substance free. I find myself years past that last affliction and thought to be free and done of the trauma and abuse of my life. 

Yet here I sit stuck at war again in my own mind with my personality. Both of my parents are special in their own right. My mother is unbreakable in my anger with faith in my life it has always been because of the lashings I’ve seen life give this kind good woman for no reasons. She posses a level of kindness and brightness that even after a life time of shit still shines. 

I would like to think I have all of these same good qualities and more from her. My father is the opposite unkind infact in many was he’s a monster. But that being said he also has some pretty special abilities and qualities in that evil. 

I know that I’ve gotten his drive, wit, intelligence, but I’ve also inherited some of the lack of emotion and ability to handle and process it. 

I sit here torn trying to be a better person than I have been and it has come at the sacrifice of my spine. I need to speak my mind as I have in the past and when I want somethings take it as who is going to stop me. 

That’s the secret line my old man found in life. (WHOS GOING TO STOP ME?) 
While he abuses this and prays on people because most people confronted with that type of aggression physical or not tends to freeze up most and by they time they thaw it done you you’ve won. 

But I’m frightened I’ve seen some of that same evil in me.

Ever since that day, i slowly started to use social media as a substitute for making and interacting with irl friends. It was a simple thing to see, it was easier. Complete anonymity, control over who and how much you wanted to talk to someone and most important of all, limitless choices of people from different walks of life. 



I have been on Discord (and more recently and infrequently Reddit) for over 5 years now. I have met friends, best friends, girlfriends, parents (not mine lol) priests, musicians, doctors, therapists and so on throughout my years on that platform. And out of all those different, unique and wonderful (and sometimes not so wonderful) people I’ve met over a variety of different servers, ranging from writing groups to massive hangouts. It all feels fake. In-organic, something filled with empty promises and a lack of trust. 




Never in my life have i had my heart played with like a chew toy so much over lines of text, or a simple voice call. The sheer lack of honest and genuine people on the internet and social media as a whole is slim, due to the simple fact that it could be anyone, doing anything with anyone in the world while also talking to you. The sheer power of being completely anonymous, mostly unmoderated and without needing any sort of filter to interact with anyone.  Without the need to act like a socially acceptable human being is just…brutal.




Discord has crippled my social-skills for the worse, even worse from being the introverted shy kid in class nobody talked to because i grew up differently than everyone else around me. To turning me into a bitter, social outcast who could only get internally frustrated at myself for the lack of said skills whenever i work up the courage to socialize in public places, events and local conventions and whatnot. 



For the past 3 or so years, I’ve barely left my parents house. Having the occasional job for to then quit over my sheer social anxiety as to how people treat me, their words practically ringing in my ears like tinnitus long after the day has ended due to a slight mishap. I am unmotivated entirely, have no future ambitions, instead to try and quell my mental state with things I enjoy, like video games, watching videos and…well, not much else. At some points in my life, the hobbies i had were vast. I painted miniatures, played golf, worked on cars…it’s all gone. Instead, it’s replaced by Discord. It’s poisoned me, made me crave validation I’ve never had and i keep coming back. Ghosting after breakup after mental breakdown. I  want to start over, I wanted to have never found Discord, or any other social media platform I’ve ever used. My life would’ve turned out better that way.

5065,deebee1055,1648795982,1,"First post here, 

Im (21M) in my last year of college undergrad now and have done pretty well. Ive worked hard doing research and honors. Its paid off well as ive been offered a PhD position at a school out of state. 

Starting college was great as i made tons new friends, was going to parties, living off campus with roomates, and eventually even made a girlfriend. Everything was great and my life was pretty balanced. 

However after a combination of covid, fractioning of my friend group, and my GF breaking up with me (ironicly because of my likelihood of moving out of state for grad school while she was still doing her undergrad) i have very few good friends left. I know in all likelyhood ill lose them too the moment i move out of state for grad school. Ive gone from a time where i was always doing things and hanging out with people to sitting in my room alone every weekend. Im living in campus dorms because i wasnt able to find anyone to rent off campus with. 

Im not sure why im working so hard every week to keep up with school work + research writing when i get to the weekend and feel lonelier then any other point in my life. Ive never been great at making new friends so the idea of having to start over after i move is overwhelming.",lonely,Not sure why im working so hard when I have no one to share it with,2022-04-01 17:53:02
5066,killerbunny048,1648795140,1,"To our strange life / Noam Horev

 And maybe you also feel that you do not belong
 Showers twice and is still dirty
 So wants to open up
 And always remains closed
 Years when your button of tears is broken

 And maybe you, too, always miss it
 To whom or why - you never know
 At night you hear
 Outside your window
 They are celebrating there without you, from joy to joy

 And maybe you'll also sail in ships
 Disconnected from the world, plugged in headphones
 Temporary loves
 You have already been sealed
 And only the same sentence is repeated: ""This, nothing came out of him.""

 And maybe you, too, are watching from the sidelines
 Surrounded by people but somehow alone
 You remain a frightened child
 That the parents then forgot
 Outside the garden, when you all have already come and taken

 And maybe one day
 Come to me suddenly
 I promise to make you a lot of space with me
 And tell you by night,
 Barefoot lips
 That the children are lost
 They are the most beautiful souls
 And then we'll pour some glass for both of us, and candles -
 to smile
 Long live me
 And to the strange life.

as his interest seems to decline my interest for him grows, i want to hold his hand so bad and tell him i miss him. i’m sure he’s preoccupied with others anyway and im just a placeholder until something better comes along

i don’t think he feels as strongly about me as i do him and its agonizing 

im not as desirable as other women though i have a pretty face and personality that’s all i have going for me, i dont have skinny privilege even after losing weight bc of genetics and loose skin and unfortunately as mammals we are attracted to shiny things and i am not shiny maybe i sparkle here and there but there is no shine

i know it’s bad to look at snapchat locations but i do look at his and each time i do i get disappointed to see he’s been on snapchat but will not respond to me neither on snapchat nor text, i sometimes wonder if he doesn’t respond to me because i’m not a priority, because he’s just leading me on, i’m no one he wants to be with or what

i wish he gave me the attention i give him i feel that i am desperately trying to not let him go because i have this idealized version of him in my head 

i want him to be something he’s never going to be for me so bad and i dont want to not see him because that’ll hurt way worse

i think im just scared to be alone romantically and that’s why i latch onto men who i know i should let go

At a certain point, when pretty much everyone you have ever loved has left you, you really start to wonder if the problem is yourself. Except it can’t be entirely my fault, because until recently I actually had someone convinced they wanted to spend the rest of their life with me. For 3 years, they stuck around, and like an idiot I thought this was it. Even their family loved me despite my awkwardness, and I truly loved them back. They were all such wonderful, generous people, and had truly become *my*  family. Except they were so much more loving and considerate than my biological family ever was. It was so fucking nice, for once in my life, to feel wanted. So losing them, it was like losing my family AGAIN, but worse. I mean, goddamn. There’s only so much a person can take in their life before they just give up entirely. 

I don’t really know what the point of this is. I am just so goddamn lonely. Except I have crippling social anxiety and depression so it’s not like I can just… talk to people. My life has actually been so fucking awful it’s like some kind of sick joke. I just want to talk to someone who cares and understands.

The thing with people on Reddit, you're all either extremely horny trying to get one thing or you have such high expectations that if the person you're talking to doesn't meet them in any capacity, you end up ghosting them or lose immediate interesting.

being that I don't entirely possess a type A personal, I still made it my mission to be creative or attempt to have various kinds of conversations with dozens of people on this sub. the main issue? they either don't respond, don't care, I'm too *ugly* for them, they don't possess the comprehension for a good opener, and last but not least, that I'm a fucking catfish. That one gets really old.

I don't know though. I've gone my whole life being really kind to people with no expectations, I never diminished the capacity of others or went with the intentions of being a bad individual even in private. but there's no fucking yields to it. it's like all you *LONELY* people out there have no true concept of being lonely, and the impression you have is by feigning such loneliness and isolation yet when someone who you aren't attracted to or isn't exactly like you, you're like: ""Wahhhh, I'm lonely. BUT NOT YOU"". And then the conversation is done because all of my complaints listed above.

I love genuine people, don't get me wrong. I absolutely adore those that give equal energy to those who initially make the original efforts. If you don't see the message, fine.

5089,mindgoesbrrr,1648785933,1,"So, I'm 27 now, never had a partner and I think I'm at a point where I tried everything and went through all the phases you could go through.

I was depressed, reached out for help, went to therapy for 2 years, got medicated, felt better, had a positive view on life, tried online dating, had a few dates which led to nothing, tried to focus on me and my own life, developed substance abuse problems, successfully fighted my substance abuse problems, had a positive view on life again, depression... You get the point. 

The thing is: I can't fill this void that comes from loneliness / the lack of a SO. I went to therapy every week for 2 years, but it made no sense because I know what my goddamn problem is. And neither therapy nor drugs won't fix it. I don't need ""another perspective"" or whatever. I know exactly what would make me the happiest person on earth and it's a partner who loves me and cares about me. It doesn't even have to be ""the one"", I just need someone to show me that I'm loveable. 

After all the shit I tried and all the ""almosts"", I completely lost hope. There is no coping mechanism left that I could try without knowing I'm lying to myself. I have no energy left to keep fighting, getting my hopes up and get them crushed again, like it was the case for the last 7 years. 

Also I can't really give up, because I know that love is the only thing that would make me happy. This situation I'm in ruins my life, makes me an anxious depressed pathetic fuck, and I can't do nothing about it because you can't force love. I just don't get why I can't have it when all people around me can and it makes me fucking mad. At me, at the universe, at my pathetic life. 

Don't really know where I'm going with this, but I think that the conclusion is that coping maybe works for temporary problems, but it doesn't for problems that went on for a decade and you exactly know the solution for.

Trigger warning rape and sexual assault

I was assalulted by my sisters at the age of 6 till i was eleven years old. I told my mother and she told me i was being manipulated by the devil. My 22year old sister told me i would pay for what i have done and i have demons inside of me and may god have mercy on my soul

Ok so background, my mom earlier 2 weeks ago asked me if i was going to my sisters birthday dinner (today is her birthday). as soon as she asked, i immediately said no i wouldnt, and she asked me ""why not? Why are you still mad with her""

Like i havent told her my sisters have sexually assaulted me. And she has been staying by my sisters new house everyday. Like she doesnt want to be around me. And now it is my sisters birthday, and i feel as if she has chosen my sisters over me.

And i feel like i am on an island by myself, No friends, or even a phone. Trying to learn how to code, and having no one to talk to but myself. Am i wrong to feel this way? That She has chosen them over me?

I feel like my heart is bleeding inside of me. I feel like, it feels like, the pain I feel emotionally feels like poison circulating through my viens, almost as if my blood itself was poison. There are so many negative feelings that I have about myself I can’t get rid of. I hate how hard it is for me socially. I hate how lonely I feel. I hate how awkward I can be. I hate how shy I am, how introverted I am. I want to change it. I have tried to change it. I desperately want to be different. I want people around me. The pain of loneliness cuts sharper than a knife. But it feels like all of these traits I deeply hate about myself are woven into my being and no matter how much i try to be confident or outgoing or gregarious I can’t. I feel like no of my dreams will come true. I feel like I’ll never find the family I want. I’m just too broken.

I’m finishing my undergrad this semester and balancing an internship that will hopefully turn into a full time job. I couldn’t manage my time between that and his needs so I let him go. 

The first week he would text me each night, apologizing and saying how much he loves me. I wanted him so badly. I wanted to get back together but I put myself first. I blocked him this week to think everything over. This morning I got a call from his mother saying he had taken his own life and that he had written a letter for me before carrying out his final act. I’ve never felt so unbelievably empty, guilty, and worthless. I can’t accept that he’s gone. I don’t care about my future anymore I don’t deserve one. I would do anything to take it back and it’s killing me that now there’s nothing I can do. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to beat this feeling and worse I don’t want to even try.",lonely,My boyfriend committed suicide and I blame myself,2022-04-01 02:22:30

Why can't I connect with anyone?

Is there something broken in me?",lonely,I'm surrounded by people that genuinely care but I'm deeply alone.,2022-04-01 02:20:14

It's been more than a year and still can't get over him. When i meet a good person, i think I'm not good enough, I'll weigh them down, they could be better without all my bs. When i meet someone bad, i think they're just not good enough for me. They'll make me even worse, so i go away. I feel lonely all the time but my mind won't let me start any new connections. 

I'm so afraid if I'll mess everything up. Recently a girl's been saying me she wants me and misses me. I'm a bit close to her. When i want to talk about my feelings, i start to think she's just using me for some ""lol""s. I met her online in a game and haven't had any real contact. And I'm so afraid, I've already been played a few times before and hurt me a lot. They just come in, have fun and leave me. I don't want to lose a good girl, i can't think straight. So any help would be greatly appreciated",lonely,there's something wrong with me,2022-04-01 02:06:48
5190,VenisXz,1648738798,1,"23 never had friends and probably never will. (because of social anxiety). needles to say it makes everything hard besides being lonely and all that. if it wasn't for religion I'd end it without any hesitation. I know not everyone is religious but I hope you understand. I keep thinking about it. I don't want to go to hell after all the suffering I've already endured.  even then some times I feel like I eventually won't be able to endure it anymore.  this is why I'm asking if there is someone who is in the same boat, accepted being lonely but isn't depressed. please share how",lonely,can you accept being lonely forever and be ok?,2022-04-01 01:59:58
5191,jesldd,1648738745,1,"I feel like i’m lonelier than most “lonely” people my age. I’m in my early 20s and a week ago I left my job due to depression, stress and i’ve also been having horrible sleep. I’m trying to figure out what i want to do with my life after a pandemic and not meeting any new people around my age in 2 years. I’ve been spiralling lately, spending big chunks of the day in bed crying… thinking i’ll be alone forever but also begging… crying out, wondering “hey… where are my people and when am i going to meet them?”, “where are you… i need you”. It seems like everyone my age who claims “loneliness” is not nearly as lonely as me. I have a life of some sort… friends… family… experiences, but I haven’t felt like i’m actually living in almost 3 years. I feel like i’m being hit by this harsh reality that no one is interested in getting to know me… never romantically anymore and hardly platonically either. I feel like i have no where to turn for a real sense of belonging… for real love, not just the types of friendships and connections we sometimes make just to appear not lonely. I’m not the “lonely” that has a huge twitter following or niche internet fame. I’m not the “lonely” that has discord server invites with dozens of online friends and VCs to hop into. I’m not the “lonely” that has a fulfilling career that tends to isolate me by eating up my free time. I’m not the “lonely” that’s quirky and relatable, posting stuff like “i only have 3 real friends’. I’m tired of people taking loneliness lightly, they have no idea. I’m just alone… it’s quiet and sad, it’s boring and it makes me feel numb and unlovable… or rather it reminds me that I am unloved. The worst part of it is when your alone with your thoughts and you’ve identified this problem, this “loneliness”… this “nothingness” but you realize it’s not something you can “fix” instantly and by yourself. It’s not going away, tomorrow you’ll still be lonely. And probably the day after that too… and the day after that and for some maybe forever, for ME maybe forever… That thought makes me want to die.",lonely,Does anyone else feel lonelier than this “lonely” everyone talks about?,2022-04-01 01:59:05
5192,blubthedropbear,1648738002,1,"So I’ve started having this weird state where if I think about my sadness or loneliness I get to the brink of crying but can’t. 

I can’t seem to focus on trying to make myself happy anymore. Instead I find myself wishing for others to be happy and trying to help them have that happiness.

Unfortunately every time I hear they are happy it makes my sadness resurface even more but I still can’t seem to bring myself to try and pursue my own happiness.

Only way I can explain the loneliness and sadness feeling is that it feels like being heartbroken.

I keep feeling like I’d rather have the feeling of a broken heart than be focusing on my happiness rather than others.

I hate it.

Just needed to get this out.",lonely,Not caring about my happiness anymore,2022-04-01 01:46:42

5195,Flying_Ocelot,1648735192,1,"I'm 21. I have been staying at home with no income for almost two years. I only talk to my immediate family.

I somehow got close to a guy. We called each other daily and met every week to have sex. Turns out guy is a total piece of shit. He was nice to me but he had serious problems. 

I cut him off few days ago and I am in despair. All I do is cry. Every time I wake up I check my phone and there is nothing there. No one wants to know about me. I feel like I have disappeared in this world.

I know this sounds crazy but I badly wanna see him again and keep our relationship. He will surely accept me because he loves having sex with me. However I don't think he would love me or fix his problems.

I cannot care. I fear that this would be the last human contact I'd have for a very very long time. Even if I had a normal job it would be hard for me to obtain friendship not alone any romance.

I know this is just a long rant of justification but I just cannot stand being this lonely. I felt like I had the world when he hugged me or called me. Imagine you were like me, trapped, lonely, disabled, ugly. How could you be able to cut off the only person you know and love?
