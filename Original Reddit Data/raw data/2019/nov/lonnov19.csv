I do know a lot of people. Like a lot. But everyone does speak to me whenever they run into me. All the person I talk or text share everything in detail with me and even ask for solutions. But they only do text when something needs to get off their chest. I'm more like their counselor than a friend.

And since I do know lot of people, everyone does think that I have my own crew and stuff. Everyone just assumes that I might be okay with my other friends.

7,dannygs1998,1575110980,1,"You should try a new hobby, meet new people, get on tinder, talk to your coworkers, work out, go to therapy. Well, honestly now I feel like I've do it all &amp; no matter what I still feel lonely. But like everyone else, there was a time I didn't feel as lonely as I do now. I haven't felt the same feeling since I was in 8th grade. I had friends, I payed sports, had a gf, tried a new hobbie etc. Before making this post I randomly thought about the people I knew back then. And try to look for some of them online in hopes I could caught up with them later. I'm in my very early 20's and so are they. I forget how time flies and how people change that I'm impress &amp; find it hard to believe some of this people already have kids and are engaged. The gf I had in 8th grade, I been trying to forget about her for the past 7 years. Literally tried everything I can to forget about her. Therapy, new hobbies, meet new people, meaningless s3x(while I was doing such act with this pert, my loneliness is been so bad that I was more attracted to feeling this person's body, I was preferring physical touch over something more ""pleasant""). But it seems like nothing works, I recently found out she(ex from 8th grade) has a kid &amp; seems like the father/Current partner of her is a guy I always watched my back from. My therapist recently got a new job(that was 1 month ago), which means my sessions with her are over. I recently visited my mom, she lives 2 hours away from me , so I drive to visit her and honestly I feel lonely visiting her and not bringing her a potential partner I can introduce her to. My mom is not pressuring me into being engaged or anything like that, that's just how I feel. One of my favorite artist recently dropped a new album it's base on relationships, love &amp; being a strong woman. Some of her lyrics hit me hard because a lot of times I feel like that was what 8th grade gf had in mind and even said it to me. ""Others wish they could have me while you are losing me"" she told me -""there's a lot of guys waiting in line until I'm single"". I don't remember why she told me that, all I remember is that I was doing my best to make our relationship work out because she was in her last year of middle and I had just started high school. 
Lyrics: ""there's now someone else taking care of me inside""  she never said that. I just knew the guy I was always watching my back from would make a move. 
I know and understand that I shouldn't compare my life to others. But let's be honest, that's almost impossible to do. My life is okay I would say or maybe better than I realized. Got a pretty good job where I can grow in the future, I'm paying off stupid debt, Hangout with my siblings/""friends"" everyonce in a while and planing on moving to a different city. And here's why I feel like my life sucks, I'm single, Haven't date anyone in the past 4 years, I drop out of school for new job(I don't want to go back to school thoe), I have no savings partly because I'm trying to pay off debt asap and because I don't even bother to save $30 every paycheck. My ""friends"" are not really my friends, they are mostly my older brother friends, I feel like they are people I just know. When I hangout with them, I feel kinda awkward because 2 of those friends are a couple and when we go out they are all over each other which makes me feel lonely but I also feel tired of being an involuntary 3rd wheel &amp; I feel like I'm going crazy with all this loneliness.

15,nagiakicita,1575104226,1,"I dunno.. I just needed to get this out.

I'm an older single guy raising a son as best he can.  Nothing ever mattered to me other than having my own family.  ""Good Father, good husband, good friend"" is all I wanted on my tombstone.  I worked my ass off since I was twelve years old to do it.  I've fought everything one can think of to get here with a pulse.  (I experienced fairly severe abuse when I was a child.  A therapist once said I had about a 4% chance of not ending up dead before the age of 30.)  

I did a good job at not losing it entirely when I came home from work to find my family had disappeared.  The wife for whom I had worked and faced my greatest demons found she would prefer to be with her ex-boyfriend.  I couldn't find my son for months until I called in favors from guys I served with back in the day.  I got him back and gained custody.

I found love again until her personality disorder showed itself.  I'm now in a city I was trying to avoid living in with no friends and no family.  I've only got myself to give my son.  It's damned difficult meeting people never mind a lover.  

I worked my ass off my whole life for what ended up being an illusion, a mirage.  Yes, I've got my son and I'm very thankful for him.  Still, I'm a man and have needed the touch of a woman who has an emotional investment in me, who loves me.  I can look back now and see that I have literally never been loved that way.  I've simply been used and then discarded when I became inconvenient.  It's not even depression talking.  It's mere statement of fact.  No one has ever touched me in love.  It's been deceit and disorder.  Manipulation.  The abuse I suffered as a child continues to this day in that I never knew what it meant to have someone put love into action and direct it towards me.  Disgustingly, my son was conceived in deceit.  

I'm one of the mentally and emotionally strongest people I know.  I've seen shit no one should ever see.  I've beaten the odds every single time.  I'm still standing, still alive, still working to do the right thing by my son.  I'm a decent man.  I try to do the right thing in everything I do.  I'm pretty decent looking.  I've got my priorities straight.  Frankly, I'd be a catch.  

But, I'm tired of holding onto hope that I might be recognized for who I am, the battles I've fought, the road I've traveled to get here. I'm tired of being alone.  I'm even more tired of holding onto hope that I might be recognized for who I am, the battles I've fought, the road I've traveled to get here.  I can be strong in this way no longer.  I cannot continue to believe that love might be just around the corner.  I'll still do what I have to do.  It's just that to do it alone, without all that a woman could bring to my life, is painful.  The only way I know to continue is to accept I will be lonely.  I'm good at it.  I've done it my whole life.  I'm just tried of fighting against it.  I fear the example it sets for my son.  I just can't do it any longer.  I have nothing left.  No more faith in that magic connection, a spiritual connection with the woman I love.  There's no one to love and no one seems interested in the sort of love that flows through me.  I have no more faith and hope in this.  I dedicated my life to love.  It was an illusion.  It'll eventually kill me if I don't just accept it.

Now, all I have left is to work to be remembered as a good father before I'm scattered to the wind.",lonely,Acceptance,2019-11-30 19:57:06

19,StuckRadio,1575099118,1,"Just to start off - I'm a single Male living alone 33 years old in a few weeks.

When I was a kid things were good, we had a good group of friends and we were always about causing trouble, not actual bad trouble, teenage trouble. You know the usual drinking, smoking and hanging around.  
This was from the age of about 13 I started using cannabis heavy, pretty much daily. This has really messed me up quite a bit. I stopped taking care of myself and my social skills and interactions started to fail.
I'm not sure when it started but at sometime during all this I have ended up with some type of infection on my penis. This coupled with the depression and social anxiety that was setting in broke me. I was too ashamed to do anything about.  I still am. I should probably point out that I am still a virgin because of this.  
All my adult life I've had to push any female attention away at the end of the day I cant be intimate with anyone because of the obvious infection I have.  
I still kept many of my friends for long time in to my 20s. Then they start to have families and lives of there own.  
People always say I should find someone and settle down. As if I dont want this, theres nothing I want more than a normal life and my own family. It really hurts.
Over the years of dealing with this alone it drivin me crazy. The only people that know this is who ever may take the time to read this post. I cant to talk to anyone I know about this, they would be disgusted and rightfully so. I'm disgusted with myself at this point.
The stage I'm at now - I dont see anyone outside of work. My work day is over at 10am and that's it theres nothing more that day.  
From when I wake up the voice in my head starts ""you're a piece of shit mate"" ""go fucking kill yourself"". This continues all day, there is no stopping it. For a long time I was self medicating with alcohol to stop the voice, it was working but my mental is spiralling out of control. At this rate I will not live to see my 40th birthday.  
I have 2 people who i talk to in work. They really dont help. I didnt see it before but these 2 people are worse for me. Just to give a couple of examples -  
A few months ago when things were getting bad I thought I need to let someone know. I told the 1 of the 2 people I talk to, his reply was that it's ok that i dont have a 50k a year job. Of course he doesn't know the full extent of what's going on but still that's a really crap thing to say to someone who is depressed.  
Last week I was getting near breaking point and went to the doctor. I messaged him to say I'm not really doing well, im going to see a mental health professional today and im not sure if I'm going to be back in work tomorrow. He replied to the text with information about a meeting I missed that day. That one really hurt, not even as much as an acknowledgement that I'm not doing well, genuinely it looked like this message could have just came out the blue about a meeting I missed. It wasnt though that's the thing.  
The other person I talk to I  work (person, I cant call these people friends), we have been close since we met which was nice but as I'm social isolated i dont get to do much and people get bored of talking to me fairly quickly. This started when message would be unread for days, even just simple things like when they're pet was not well I messaged later that day after they had said they had been to vets etc to see how they got on. No reply for days. Eventually they said to me it's really strange I dont know why your messages dont come through to my phone straight away anymore (we only use messenger to chat so I can only presume they have removed me from they're friends to stop my messages going to my inbox. That's fine I should have cut them off at that point but I hate myself and have no one else so I tried to salvage the relationship by keeping distance and giving them space.  
I start to notice a pattern here. When she has had a bad week with her boyfriend theres some days I cant get her away from me, not that I'm complaining but I know what this is. When things are going well I can barely get past a hello from them. This again is really shitty behaviour which is sending me even further down a spiral of self hate and suicide. What am I only good enough for people to off load there problems on to? After that I'm not even worth a hello hows things? This person has invited me out for a coffee a few times, knowing I'm pretty lonely but it's never came to anything because I'm being used as an emotional support when things are going bad for her. 
I really dont know what to do anymore. I have been to the doctor about my mental health. I kept saying to myself this time you need to get this penis infection sorted out. I thought I had the courage to do and when I get to the doctors office, it's an attractive young blonde doctor. Of course my courage was gone at that point, I tried but I just couldn't. I think they had a fair idea of what was going on as she did say if I would rather see a Male doctor that's fine. I have an appointment for 3rd dec. My anxiety is through the roof thinking about this. I really wish it could have just happened that day.  
After 20 years of living with all this I'm such a broken mess, at this particular point in time until this is fixed there is no future ahead of me.  
Even if I dont get this fixed I'm still fucked. I have 20 years of social skills to learn. I'm been so stonned from the age of 13 I'm not even sure I know who I am. I'm going to have a nervous breakdown soon. I wish there was a rest button, I want another chance.  
I cant possibly go through the rest of life with this gaping hole in my chest. I can actually feel the loneliness. It has a physical sensation rite in the middle of my chest. I guess it my heart aching for some sort of love and attention.  
I'm so fucking lost I just want to cry.",lonely,"Long post, sorry but need things off my chest.",2019-11-30 18:31:58

21,Pathway_45,1575098507,1," I used to be an avid basketball player — A prospect transfer student who always had the best charisma that led the team forward through the toughest matches. Having fun outdoors, partying on a pool party to singing country songs on the bus to our games. 

 This however is my 4th time moving schools — First from country, second to state, third to a different city, the latest one to another different state (That last move was probably the hardest surprisingly). It’s the beginning of high-school, everyone knows who each other are and usually the newer kids are seen as troublemakers transferred from other schools. Everyone here seems either focused on sports or are complete polar opposite and would rather rot away in front of computer screen (Ironic). 

 Anyways, I’m marking my fourth month of me being a complete loner — Out of the 9 periods that I attend, I say I spend about 6/9 of those periods in the back with headphones on just doing my work whether or not we’re allowed to talk. I’ve had a disdained feeling towards my school’s basketball program as a good majority of the players would rather work twice as hard to make sure you get out than work a portion to welcome you into the team. I’ve lost everything about myself that I had 5 months prior, my pride is gone as I’m picked on for my race, my passion for basketball is gone, my friends are all gone — they will forgot about me soon and I will have no one to remember.

That I don't need to worry so much about my future.. I just crave attention. The lack of human contact is depressing. At least I have a family, but will I just live with my mom forever? without ever having my own house, my own money, my own life?

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

I hate myself. I hate my inability to live a normal life.

Guess I'll just listen to sad music, drink alcohol, and cry myself to sleep tonight like every other day. At least I get to feel something

My mind is so broken, I'm just a piece of trash, a sad excuse for a human being.

I'm a talentless loser. Even If I wanted, I couldn't be succesful in any career or job. I'm too slow, too dumb.

This sub is nice to chat with other likeminded people, but it's also just an illusion. It's not like anyone here cares about me either. But I won't act like I can actually kill myself, I don't have the ''courage'' to do such thing. Even though I'm sad and empty I'm still clinging to life. In a way, I hate feeling that way but I don't see death as a better option. I want to stop existing but at the same time I don't. it's a love and hate relationship with life. Guess I'm just stuck here

(2nd attempt) and one night I took a big bottle of wine from her again and I took a knife as well and I drank a shit load (I  wasn't that wasted) and I took it up to my neck and heart and head and I  just couldn't stop crying that night but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Now my third attempt it was very emotional because that day I was talking to a freind of mine about how sad and shit I was and this cunt came behind me and mocked me so I got up and got into a fight with him and pretty much everyone in that room was laughing at me. I know theirs not much context for this one girl which we've never dated or anything like that but shes one of the more popular girls she was actually very concerned for me and it was weird but I'm getting off track.

Nobody who’d ever invite me anywhere. People I’ve tried being friendly with seem to literally avoid me and try to ghost me.

I honestly wanna just give up and stick to trying to date, but that is no easier. I have done so before, both times I did not make it past the first date and they kinda ghosted me afterwards.

But I’ve only arrived today, and I feel isolated and terrified. Maybe I should’ve stayed at home with my family? It would’ve meant not really celebrating and I suppose I would’ve still felt some loneliness, but this is loneliness without my home comforts to distract me. In the end when I go home, I’ll tell everyone I had a great time, I’ll say it over and over till that’s how I remember it. And I guess I should get used to it, if I want to go anywhere I’ll be doing it alone. And I hate it.",lonely,I don’t know if I made a mistake,2019-11-30 09:23:27

76,langnerd17,1575064967,1,"Ok so today I felt like trying an anonymous chat app to find new people and maybe meet them so I don't feel lonely anymore. Not so great idea.

At first, I felt insecure about myself and what I like. For example I listen to kpop, don't judge me, thats the music I like. But I just thought I couldn't put this in my profile though its a part of me. I thought people just wouldnt talk to me because of it so maybe I'm a shitty person for listening to that crap. And i began to think ""should I lie about what i like or should i just give up my interests so more people will like me?"" (which is not necessarily true)

Then there comes the part with gross messages, dickpics, etc. I hate those. There are also corny messages or pick up lines that just don't apply to me (i guess i'm too down to earth and therefore boring, eh?) All i want is a conversation about interesting stuff or stuff we love, you know?

I deleted the app. Maybe I'll change my mind and I'll try it again, who knows. Anyway, i am lonelier now. I feel like I will stay alone because of what I am and because I dont want to change, but if i changed, if i tried to become another person, then I wouldnt be myself anymore, right?

The only 4 friends I've retained in my life are from university but they're unconnected to each other and live in a different city to me anyway so I don't get to see them. Plus, they've already got loads of friends from before uni, unlike me who has no one. So naturally I feel more attached to them than they would ever feel to me.

This applies to people I've met online and offline, and the people I met offline are people I've known for years. I'm always the one reaching out to people to make conversation, or try to arrange something to do or a time to hangout, and 90% of the time I get no response at all.

Recently I decided to see what would happen if I just didn't message people, maybe they would get in contact with me, see if I'm doing alright, make sure that I'm even still alive. And what did this prove to me? That no one gives a damn. Not the people I've met online, not the people that I've known for years in person. The only person I get messages from is my mother and that's because she wants to know how my newly adopted cat is doing.

Like the title suggests, I haven't touched another human in years, sometimes it's not so bad - but times like this where I have no one to speak to, play games with this is when it really dawns on me. Head back a few years, I had a girlfriend, I was happy and I felt wanted. She ended up cheating on me and now has everything she wanted with me, but with another man. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a tad spiteful over it, but not enough to have it effect anything. Like sour milk, just throw it away and move on. But since then I haven't been able to sleep on her side of the bed (It's just covered in stuff like my laptop, clothes and so on) I'm fully aware that I haven't quite recovered from it and I don't think I ever will. But I guess I just want someone to show somekind of interest in me. Someone to check up other than my dentist, even getting some kind of positive attention would be nice. I'm not typically one of those softer people, apathy and basically being indifferent to most activities saw an end to that. But having someone to do that stupid claw thing down my back? Someone say I'm enough - well, anything to make me feel less hollow would be heaven frankly.

Life just keep going. No one cares, nor they should. Everyone has problems and they live their life, but ah I wish I just had people to go out with and just talk, relax, have a good time.

Today I tried to invite everyone I know and strangers on the internet to go out. Not a single yes, not a single one.

This year Xmas will suck. No family, no friends. For now I’m not doing anything.

I’m sorry. I’m just extremely tired, and it’s the first time I take all of this out of my chest.


Ps: besides everything I said, don’t worry, I’m tired of all of this but I still want to find my purpose, live up to make dad proud wherever he is now, so I’m not playing throwing the towel.

112,Sslapper,1575024838,1,"Hey.
Idk what my issue is.
I feel like nothing means anything to me. It feels like everything and everyone is unrelatable.
People tell me it's normal, but i dont feel that way.
Most people seem to fit in perfectly these days. But not me.
I mean, i look normal. I act normal. But i dont feel okay. I have no idea why.
I used to think i needed acceptance. Throughout my childhood i was unaccepted by my peers. Truth be told, i was a weird kid. Within the last couple years or so i gained the acceptance I thought i needed. I learned how to act like everyone else. I learned how blend in.
I have friends now. Nobody bullies or makes fun of me. Yet still i feel the same.
Im still the same kid who used to get clowned on for being different.
It's all an act. It's as if i paused my real life and took up a whole new one in order to convince my peers that im like them. But im still the same isolated little kid.  Depressed. Lonely. Misunderstood. It seems like i sacrificed my personality in order to gain friends. Now I'm growing up and i still don't know who i am. On the inside I'm stuck as a child. On the outside, I'm strong and independent. I guess you could say im good at faking it.
I certainly did not plan it out like this; it just happened. I started stealing to impress friends. Then i started abusing drugs. Everything i did was an attempt to look good in front of others. 
Now my life is in shambles. I have no real friends. No reason to be alive. Everything i say or do feels like a subtle cry for help, but nobody notices it.
Because of my choices, all but one of my family members has disowned me. They don't even talk to me on the holidays. I live with my sister, who also has been rejected by my family. all we have is each other.
It still doesn't feel like enough. Who do i turn to? Where do i go? I have no friends. It seems like people only pretend to care. Who knows what their motives are.
Now it's too late. I can't reverse my life, although i wish i could. What can i do now? Pretend to be happy? Stay off drugs and hope that i can manage my life without being totally numb? How? Im useless by myself. Substances are the only way i can feel happy. Maybe a real relationship could do the trick, but where can i find that?
I tell you, if you were to meet me in person, you would never have guessed i have all these problems. Yet they overwhelm me daily.
Maybe this is only another cry for help. Frankly, i dont care. All i know is, i need all the help i can get.
I guess i just need to get my story out  maybe some day things will change.
I hope i live to see it. I only want to be happy",lonely,"All alone, yet surrounded by others. T",2019-11-29 21:53:58

120,the-throwaway-godlad,1575017338,1,"I don’t know why it seems to be this way, but I’ve never really had any constants in life. When my parents got divorced I lost connections to a large fraction of my family alongside it. My mom became a delusional drug addicted alcoholic beyond repair. In middle school friends either talked about me behind my back or seemed not to care. All my friends from high school got pushed away due to various drama and bad blood. Somewhere along the lines I’m made aware that I have a half-sister I’d never known. She shows up at our door and ends up moving in for two months before taking everything that was given to her and leaving as fast as she arrived. One person I became really close to. For the first time in my life I felt so genuinely close to a person. I fell in love and we were together for about two and a half years. I was promised the world and was so happy to finally be able to place safety and comfort in somebody. It was always insisted to me that everything was going to be okay and that I didn’t have to be afraid. Their dreams became my dreams and the only thing I wanted was to spend the rest of my life with them. I feel pathetic that after ten months of it being over I still want nothing else. As much as I’ve tried to stay positive and have a mindset towards self-improvement, I feel crippled in desires as nothing else interests me. The only thing that makes me light up is the thought of what no longer is and will not be. Sometimes I’m afraid I’ll never have that sort of connection again and as it is right now I can’t imagine it with anyone else. I feel horribly alone, but I don’t know what to do about it. I desperately hope that things will improve in time, but it’s really hard to say that at the moment.

123,Shonuff40,1575014554,1,"It's 2:30 AM and here I sit with that usual feeling of my heart pumping wishing I had some one to talk to. My life is kind of fucked up right now. Let me explain. If you were to look at my life from the outside in without context, this is what you see. A middle aged married man with 3 young kids who cheated on his wife for the past 3 years with the same woman. Majority of people who read that would say that I deserve all the misery I have coming to me but let me explain.

I had a revelation 2 months ago that had been life changing but so hard to follow. My marriage is 8 years in and has been pretty bad for me. My wife has been physically abusive and mentally abusive for almost the entire time. We had our first kid 6 months into the marriage so I always stuck it out with the mindset of we have to stay together for the kids. I was miserable. In this misery, I started to get attention from a woman I work with. I found myself latching onto the happiness that she brought me. So I juggled being miserable at home but there for the kids to then being happy with my co worker. My coworker wanted to be with me and always pushed for me to leave my wife for her but I always stayed in the marriage for the children. Finally after 3 years of fighting a losing battle my coworker gave up. She distanced herself from me and I panicked. I realized I was losing my source of happiness for my source of misery so I told my wife that we needed to split. We are currently still together but in individual and couples counseling just to see if we can work it out. My coworker, she is officially gone. I can't blame her. I put that woman through mental hell. This past year was just a whirlwind of me having mood swings and paranoia about her distancing herself. Even though she did love me, I just pushed and pushed without giving and really ended up pushing her away. 

Here's the revelation. I put too much of my happiness into other people. I am not a source of my own happiness or confidence so i outsource that to those around me in almost an expectation for them to serve that to my life. Then when the bottom falls out I panic. I get defensive when challenged or called out and then swing aggressive if things don't go in my favor. I tell myself I push because I care but in reality it's just me going crazy because things are falling out of my control.

In reality, I only ended up with my wife because there was no work into getting her. I caught her on the rebound and just ran with it. She was broken when I pursued her and I knew it because I knew that it would be easy for me. My coworker? She was in a miserable marriage and I read that and exploited it. I was a total piece of shit for that.  I lived a life of finding and taking the easy routes. I found comfort zones and stayed in them out of fear and low self esteem. I put up super ego opinions about things that would challenge my flaws and avoided challenging myself to make improvements. Today is the end of that person.

Why I posted this here is because I do constantly feel lonely but I do believe my loneliness is maybe just the insecure side of me not wanting to wrestle my inner demons. I am lonely constantly wanting for someone else to entertain my mind and keep me distracted. The loneliness is something I am going to have to get through. I have to got to find excitement in myself. I so badly wish I had someone to talk to though. I look at my phone constantly hoping to see an unread text sitting in my inbox. Normally disappointed though. 

I have found a lot of relief from the loneliness through exercise. If I can keep myself moving then I find myself too exhausted in the evening to let my mind wander. On those night I don't feel lonely at all. I hope to have found the key to getting over this feeling. This want of someone to be there to listen to my problems or to entertain my mind so I don't have to reflect the pathetic life I have been living. I know great things await me now that I am seeing what it is that troubles me the most, but some nights like tonight. It's just hard to get over.",lonely,Self reflection,2019-11-29 19:02:34

I finished high school in 2013 and was dating this guy. He didn’t really get along with the very few friends I had then, and I lost contact with them. The only friends I had were his. Fast forward to 2 years later, he cheats on me and ends up marrying that chick. None of his friends chose me and I was left all alone. 

I’m a female electrician and I was through a labour hire company for the length of my apprenticeship (4 years) so I wasn’t at any place long enough to actually make some decent work friends. 

I went on an overseas holiday over Christmas/New Years last year solo. And made a couple “friends” then but they all live in different states. Since I got back from my trip (Jan 8th 2019) I have seen 4 people outside of work and I’ve only seen them once or twice. 

I go and do things by myself all the time to try and make friends that have the same interests as me. But no one ever seems to want to actually hold a conversation with me.

But I won't act like I can actually kill myself, I don't have the ''courage'' to do such thing. Even though I'm sad and empty I'm still clinging to life. In a way, I hate feeling that way but I don't see death as a better option. I want to stop existing but at the same time I don't. it's a love and hate relationship with life. Guess I'm just stuck here

150,Medievalwolf,1574997964,1,"All in all, I wanted to break up with my bf. I wanted things to finally be over. Its been a long, rough year emotionally, and most of it was due to being with him. So, a few months ago I got the courage to end it, but he wouldn't let it go. I made a choice, that in order for me to continue, we would have to open the relationship and he accepted that. 

Tinder isn't hard for me. Finding people to sleep with is easy. It's just not satisfying at all, rather it makes the void I have in me open wider after each encounter. It's like a drug though, swiping and agreeing to meet up. 

I noticed my bf downloaded several hook ups apps and it stung a lot, but I just bit my lip and told myself ""this is what you accepted, so you have no right to feel a type of way when he's doing exactly what you said to do."" Still, it stings. Mainly because I'm not sure how our relationship is progressing through this. Moreover, I feel like I'm just his for the sake of it. The love is there, but not much else it seems. Still residual pain.

Supposed to be working on trust, but I'm nor sure how to go about that at all. 

I work monday through Friday, 10 hours a shift. Sometimes more. My friends are the few coworkers I talk with. My best friends are people far away from me, either by hours or states. I spend time that I can with my bf and with the strangers I meet me.

All the while, I just want to be alone, away from everyone. I want to be alone, but I also don't want this void to continue to grow.

I have a bunch of aquanrtnces, or people I talk to at school and even text outside of it sometimes. But no actual friends. Nobody who’s going to last once the semester is over. Nobody who’d ever invite me anywhere. People I’ve tried being friendly with seem to literally avoid me and try to ghost me.

I’m very doing well in school, I’m pretty social and not very shy, I exercise a healthy amount, I have hobbies and interests, but for the last 5 years, no friends. I try to get advice but all I get is, “join a club!” I have been in clubs and once again have made aquanrtnces but no friends. I have also tried going to things like DnD, but It never really worked out.“work out, join a gym, improve your self image!” I’m not so basement dwelling loser, like I said I exercise a healthy amount and I am doing well in school. I have also tried seeing a councillor but to no avail since she pretty much told me the same stuff. Maybe I’m just an arsehole, but I really don’t think I am, and even Hitler had friends.

I honestly wanna just give up and stick to trying to date, but that is no easier. I have done so before, both times I did not make it past the first date and they kinda ghosted me afterwards. This semester is over so it’s too late to try again till next semester, and I’m not very outgoing, so I’m not sure how to meet people outside of school. I’m also too young to try online dating, not that I’d want to anyway.

I’m not looking for sympathy. I want advice and help.

169,foosn2s,1574982812,1,"It's a terrible feeling that I hope nobody else has to endure. Mainly because it's so puzzling, confusing, and void of answers.

I'll start by saying that I think I have a pretty decent life, which in my mind, just makes things worse. I have a loving family, great friends, I'm pretty well off financially, and for the most part I have my health. I've never been tested for anxiety or depression, and while until lately I wouldn't say I have either - I'm just going to chalk it up to a rough go. I hope.

So for the reason we're all here: loneliness. I hadn't been in a real relationship since May 2017, and not being in one didn't bother me until this spring. It's not that I didn't want it, but I just never thought of it. I then accidentally started talking to this one girl at my school for a few days, and it reminded me of what it all felt like. And all of a sudden, I wanted it so badly again. 

So like every hopeless introvert I started playing on dating apps and getting repeatedly disappointed over and over again. It was a game I had so engrained in myself that I felt like I was a victim to it. I've had two incredibly strong connections, both of which I screwed up by wanting too much and ruining everything.

I found who I thought was the love of my life, but keep getting my heart broken and essentially ""friendzoned"" by her. And to be blunt about things - I'm jealous. My LITTLE brother is engaged, my best friend is really happy in a relationship. And I'm over here, alone. The holidays make it such an even harder time of year to cope with things.

I make things worse for myself. The mind is such a dangerous place. I would absolutely love to have someone to go through life with and be more than a friend. But at this point I don't deserve it.

200,PleasantRevenue0,1574960817,1,"So a few weeks ago i went on a tinder date and it went really well, we went for drinks and got super drunk shared a kiss which i took note that he was a really gentlealmost innocent kisser. He walked me back to a taxi where i mentally prepared myself for him to try go home with me and to my pleasant surprise he didnt, he just kissed me and said he wanted to see me again and even text me that night to see if i got home ok.

After that he text me literally all the time and we met a week later again, then he asked to meet me a few days after that date and at this point we literally got on so well, had the best laugh so much in common and he was a gentleman. After the third date, i invited him back and we smoked a few joints. Things got heated, now we were both pretty fucked and did bits but i ended up falling asleep. The next morning was very cute and i felt happy with the situation.

We met again a few days later and he came back to mine again, this time we were sober and had a nice time but things got heated and we were making out for AGES as in to the point where i was like, is he gona take it further or what haha. So i took the lead and did all the work which he seemed happy to let me do, then graphic, i asked him to switch and he literally went for a few mins and seemed to be getting tired and apologised that hed no stamina etc. At this point i presumed he was lazy and the time of guy who let the girls do all the work and it also crossed my mind that he was inexperienced because he didnt take any control and going back to the first kiss how gentle he was etc.

After this nothing changed we still text all the time had a great time together, i didnt have doubts even though we were just casual i was happy with how things were going and i had no doubt he felt the same. He came over again a few days later and said he missed me, that the last few days were so boring how he couldnt wait to see me cause we get on so well and he doesnt have as much fun with anyone else. That night the sex thing happened again, just kissing for ages and grinding and i had to initiate and do all the work again and i was getting pretty frustrated so i asked him when we were going to sleep if he was comfortable having sex with me and he seemed so confused by the question and said of course he was etc, so i said id leave it go and hope for the best. That night he also made a comment about his ex, who he said had started going out with a friend of his and it felt a lil strange but i didnt care too much we were casual and everyone has a similar situation

Again we were still good after that, we even planned a weekend away but he asked to come see me before it which i was more then happy with. So he came over everything was perfect, being very cuddly with eachother, i felt very happy and think he did too. Things got heated again and i was determined this time to make it work but the same thing happened again and i ended up stopping half way and confronting him. Now the details of the order of the conversation are all a bit muddled, but he said he didnt know what was going on.

Then he said it could be his ex that hes a bit bothered about it, and that also he didnt know when it was okay to initiate things with me and wanted to be a gentleman cause before he initiated things with a girl and it didnt go well so now hes extra careful, but i called bullshit on that because i literally couldnt of given him more signs and it still didnt dismiss the fact that he didnt take control etc

He kept saying he didnt know why he was like that and i asked was he a virgin and he said no, and he seemed very confused and a little nervous he kept saying he didnt know what to say and he didnt know why, so i asked the most embarrassing question a girl could ask, was he sexually attracted to me

He said of course he was etc that he was just shy but i wasnt satisfied and kept pushing him and saying its okay if he wasnt and to just be honest and then he said 'maybe i am maybe i amnt sexually attracted to you i dont know im confused i mean how can i not be, look at you, youre so sexy"" and that this stage i was super annoyed and just asked him to be honest and he said that he wasnt attracted he wasnt sure after last time if he liked me and wanted to see how tonight went and that he had considered cancelling the weekend away

So i was devastated and annoyed with all the lies and shocked because until i confronted him about the sex he didnt show any signs that he wasnt attracted to me or that he didnt like me. He couldnt go home because he had a few beers in his system so he had to stay which was awkward. We talked a bit and he said he was so sorry and he was still confused looking and worried, and when we layed down to sleep...he cuddled into me and sighed and said he still liked me?!

At this stage i was just brain fried and upset he clearly didnt know what he wanted and i said that to him and he said he did that he wanted me that hes so happy around me always thinks about me that he was just looking for something to say when i confronted him about the sex stuff that he didnt know why he said it, that it was all lies and bullshit and that he cant explain why he said it but that hed never hurt me again he was just nervous and then he said that he didnt have experience with girls that hes only been with 2/3 girls and that he was afraid he wouldnt perform and disappoint me and that thats why he had thought about cancelling the weekend because he thought i wouldnt be happy etc.

He said hes over the moon were together that hes just shy and doesnt know why he said it etc and i am just so confused and insecure about the situation. I want to give him another chance and believe he didnt mean it because i am shocked by him saying it, as he never gave any signs that he wasnt attracted or didnt like me and as i said earlier i had just presumed he was inexperienced.

But then at the end of the day he did say those things there must be some truth to it? Hes begging me for another chance and i just really dont know what to do im really hurt and upset and need opinions",lonely,helppp,2019-11-29 04:06:57

But anytime I link with them, it makes me feel so much worse mentally. My close friends are all getting on with their lives, they're all doing well on the relationship front, either married, or engaged, or in a serious relationship.

Then there's me, alone, single, forever. I'm not miserable, I'm a positive, upbeat person at the best of times so I don't let my loneliness show, but it gets to me every time.

We sit around and talk about all sorts in life but when they start talking about their love lives, I just become silent. I have nothing to add. I've been single for so long I can't add anything. I want nothing more in my life to find someone but it's seemingly impossible for me.

Time is running out for me to find someone. It's getting harder the older I get. I want a wife, I want a family, I want kids, I want someone by my side through this journey of life. I'm apparently not allowed it. It's so fucking hard to deal with anymore

For example, I can’t tell if my friends are joking. Then I will say that they don’t love me and I’ll play all sorts of games trying to “regain” their love but the love was never lost in the first place. 

Another example, this girl I liked I talked to all day. I would always give complements and she would respond nicely. I had a crush on her, and I thought she had a crush on me over a few complements.

216,KSCWI68,1574951079,1,"I wasn't THE popular girl of the school but let's say I was in a group of friends that was very appreciated in my class and it did make me have  a lot of acquaintances, I would hang out with different people in the weekend, go to a few parties... I had absolutely 0 love life already tho, this hasn't changed :') 

After highschool my social life fell apart.
- My best friend who had a lot to do with me going to parties left my town, she went to live at the other side of the country. I was meeting new people frequently with her. She's very extroverted, can't stand staying home doing nothing etc, so she would take me with her everywhere. Well, this stopped.

One of my friends from middle school and I slowly became strangers, we took different paths. It ended badly, with an argument about it. It sucked but we really weren't friends anymore already. 

Then, another childhoods friend, and this time it hurt reaaally bad. She was like a sister to me. She shared the same issues, we would open up to each other etc. She was my neighbor all my life, we were very close. Then I introduced a guy to her, and from one day to another she just forgot about me. The last time we hung out, we hadn't seen each other in maybe 4 months (despite her living 20 seconds away from me), and she spent half of the time being on the phone with her boyfriend she was seeing every day. She was leaving me on read, I had to double text for her to bless me with a reply, and it was always to tell me she couldn't hang out with me. She cancelled a trip we had planned for weeks etc. Our friendship was at its peak, but suddenly : nothing.

And finally, this year, a very good friend from college. Amazing girl but she's the type of person who's always late (I'm talking like, 40 minutes late despite her living in the area), she cancels plans at the very last minute, very selfish in a way and ungrateful. BUT extraordinary funny. So I was always forgiving her, until a few months ago when she cancelled something we had planned for weeks for my 25th birthday with a very questionable excuse. I know she often lie to cancel plans because she would often ask me to give her ideas of reasons not to go somewhere :) And it seems like she did the same with me. So yes, I moved on.

I'm left with my very first friend from kindergarten, which I'm very grateful for. I'm lucky to have her in my life. She doesn't really have other friends besides me either. She's the only person I hang out with. 

My group of friends from highschool and I are still friends, but we see each other maybe twice a year, at best.

It's crazy how much more exciting my life was when I was a teen than now, in my 20s, when I'm free to do pretty much anything I want. My life could hardly be more boring now.",lonely,"I went from being kinda popular in highschool, to having one friend left.",2019-11-29 01:24:39

218,gilette_bayonete,1574949809,1,"I'm a male and knew going back into this that women pretty much own the dating app market. It's awful. I don't think there's one real profile on there. Not a single fucking one. I find a mutual swipe, have momentary excitement, and wham get hit with that stupid, corny, automated message. It's ALL porn bots. Even after you stop replying it messages you back asking if you're still there. The level of disappointment I feel after that automated message is like the knee jerk reaction after the doctor tests your reflexes. I just want to jam a knife into my throat because it happens so often.

Then there's the ones that do reply that you have to basically extract information out of with those one worded, flat, tastelessly boring answers. 

And finally there's the ones you can only get so far with. The flirts. It's a beautiful day, they'll be standing by the pool, they splash you with a little bit of water but don't get in with you. They're right about to jump in but never do.

I'm not sure which is worse. I just feel like I'm missing out. It would be great to meet someone who could be a potential significant other. Someone to spend time with and laugh and snuggle with. I'm not even talking about sex either. Just affection. In this day and age that feels like it's so much to ask. There are more single people now than ever. An entire generation of loneliness. I can't even blame myself because the odds are just so badly tilted. I personally don't find myself ugly or unattractive just extremely unlucky. But the disappointment does weigh heavily on one's self esteem I must admit. It's so easy to play that tape over in your head: ""Maybe it's me. Something I said? Something I could have done better? Maybe I am ugly. Maybe they just don't like me..."" and I have to STOP before I drive myself crazy. 

It's like running in place on the treadmill. I can't even look back and say I had SOME good dates because I haven't been able to get ANY. That disappointed feeling is like being hit with a foreign agent. I can feel it enter my blood stream and slowly begin to poison me. I can feel it in the chest and it gets heavier and heavier the more I think about it. I just wish more than anything I could make it stop.

221,ComeWhite,1574946896,1,"Picky might not be the right word for it, but basically I always made friends (and by made friends I mean like 2 friends total in my lifetime, one of whom is not in my life anymore) by just... feeling right about it. I haven't been able to quite put my finger on why I liked those two people, but there is something about them that just made me want to talk to them. Be with them, hang out, share. It's just a subconscious feeling of desire to be friends. Just this emotion of friendship that I don't know where it comes from, but it's not due to anything specific I can point to. I don't believe in destiny, or people being meant/destined for each other, but it actually feels kinda like that. We didn't even have that much in common to bond over anyways, but somehow the conversation always pulls me in and however mundane it is, I enjoy it with my whole heart.

But anyone else on this planet I've talked to so far? I'm just not feeling it. We could probably have the exact same conversation I have with my actual friend, but it just won't make me feel good inside. There is no reward in my brain. We could do the same things, talk about the same things, but after it's done, I feel empty. Recently I got so horribly lonely that I signed up for an app to make friends, and I met someone that I have one big thing in common with, and we hung out a couple times, and they've invited me to their friendsgiving. The two times we grabbed food was alright and I accepted the invitation for friendsgiving, but deep in my heart, I am dreading having to talk to them because I don't feel anything about them. I am also quite awkward and don't know how to voice my honest opinions sometimes, so I am scared that if that person likes me as a friend and wants to keep hanging out, I won't have the words to tell them how I really feel about them, and I will be stuck having to hang out with them. My go-to solution usually is to just ghost and feel horrible guilt for months.

So, like, what's wrong with me? I'm trying to tell myself that I don't have to be friends with everybody and that it's fine to be picky, but for the sake of my mental health, I do have to be friends with *somebody* and I just can't seem to like anyone*.* And you know what, lots of people have tiers of friends — work friends, good friends, distant friends, friends of friends, best friends. Also, friends for different things, like one to grab food, one to play games, shit like that. But me? My brain wants this mythical amazing friend that I will want to be friends with at first sight, and who will check all my boxes and do all kinds of stuff with me and be able to hang out often. And like, the friend I have now is like this in many ways, so my brain got tricked into feeling like what I want is possible and it rejects all the other scenarios of making friends, but I feel like maybe I am being unrealistic. Or maybe my personality is just like that, and I have to accept that and keep looking until I find people I vibe with on my own terms. Really don't know why life has to be so damn sad and lonely all the time.",lonely,"I'm can't make friends because I feel like I am ""picky"" with people and like I don't like anyone",2019-11-29 00:14:56

225,theblackestballon,1574938399,1,"I have no close friends. I (M20) am a third year in college. When I was in elementary school my family moved a lot. Never to a different state but different cities. In kindergarten I wasn’t friends with anyone ( at least from what I can remember) and after third grade my family moved to a different city. At this new school (4th grader now) I had two solid friends. And it was good from what I remember. We were close and always cracked jokes. Then my family moved again. But not to a different city but to a different district. At this new school I was bullied more often and didn’t really click with anyone. But I went to an after school daycare located on the schools grounds and made some friends. I made two solid friendships during my time there (one boy and one girl).  But we were all friends only during this after school thing, when it was during the regular school session they both went off with there friends and I was left alone. I would table hop here and there but I was never truly accepted. Then I went to middle school. During this time my family still moved but never out of the district, only in different areas of the region. In middle school I can’t name one person who I was really close with, who I felt I could open up to and be friends for life (ik it sounds cliche but still it’s how I feel). I was just a background character in this group of guys and the only reason I could be a background character was bc the kid I was close with in after school daycare!  Me and that kid were close at one point but he started getting into league of legends and everytime I would ask him to go outside and play basketball he would say no. At a certain point I realized that I couldn’t be friends with anymore bc I felt so mistreated.  Always a no always feeling rejected and an afterthought. And from middle school to high school I’ve always been that background character. An afterthought. I hate this feeling. It’s anger and sadness and hopelessness just constantly building within me. Only being released in small spurts when I go and talk to my therapist. In high school I played football and quit after 2 and a half  years bc I got bullied so much. It caused a lot of problems in my family, it was pretty much the spark that lit the fire. I was angry after practice bc I never was able to tell those fucking bullied to go fuck themselves. And the coaches weren’t any fucking help they were just fat fucks who only cared about the super stars on the team. My anger at them became misdirected towards my family. Cops got called on me twice for domestic disturbances both times they were called my own family. After I quit I isolated myself from everyone. But nobody ever cared anyways so. After that I ate lunch in the bathroom stall of my schools bathroom. And would search every bldg for an empty open room to sit at so that no one would see me alone. I felt so embarrassed. My senior year I had to find a group so that my family would see what it was truly like. I needed to fake it so that I didn’t feel like I disappointed them so that I wouldn’t look like a loser loner. But they probably already knew. I’ve been going to therapy for four years now. Sometimes though since I’m in college I’ll go long periods of time (4-5 months) without talking to my therapist. I’m lonely and sad and angry at myself for being this way and angry at the world for being so shitty and cruel. I’m so close to losing hope guys. And that’s all I’ve had to keep me going. I’m crying writing this bc it hurts so bad. The only person I met in college (one of my two roommates) that I felt was a good friend and a person who I could see myself being close with for years to come is dead. He passed away from a drug overdose. And I miss him and I hate making it about me when I say this but now I truly have nobody. Things with my family have gotten loads better but it’ll never be fully healed imo. I can’t see a future where I am not alone it just gets darker and darker. I’ve become more cynical. I’m reaching out for help and advice. If some of you have been in a situation like mine and came out of it with lifelong friendships please share with me your stories and advice on how you did it. I’m sorry if what I wrote seems choppy I am writing this while in my feeling. I overthink a lot and all the time and when I write it’s the worst so when I am in my feelings or trying to write what I am thinking I just keep writing and I rarely stop bc I just want to get the raw emotion out and articulate it as true to the actual feeling without overthinking.

I guess a backstory is in order. To really clam it down into something simple, I was with this girl for 4 years and everything was perfect. Suddenly on a random day, right before she headed off to work she stopped by my house to tell me that she wanted to see other people. After the breakup, I still tried to be friends with her but for some reason after the breakup she completely changed into someone else. She was incredibly rude, to the point of name calling and even physical abuse. This person that was once the sweetest girl I knew, just snapped. Even her mother said I was too good for her at one point, hearing all the stuff she said/done to me. Since then I've been through some of the worse mental stability, even to the point I was checked into a mental health unit at a hospital. But now, after all of that, I'm in such a better state.

But why do I feel so alone? I have so many friends, and just random people daily that interact with me and compliment me. My friends always ask me how I can handle so much, talk to everyone with ease, just things of that nature. Some of them look up to me. I'm showered with love by many constantly, but the loneliness still kicks in.

They’re generally very nice people. I’m happy to be a part of their family. They used to treat me like a part of the family too. But then somewhere along the line, they decided they wanted to know about my history. So they looked, and they were of course very disappointed by what they found. 

(Trigger warning: description of abuse) I come from an extremely abusive home. My mother physically, mentally, verbally and emotionally abused all of her children from the time we were born to the time we all moved out. To give a few key examples of what my life was like: My dad got my brother addicted to crack when he was only 13, I was sexually abused by multiple stepfathers over the course of my childhood, and my mother used to regularly beat my siblings and I with wire coat hangers and metal spatulas until our back and asscheeks bled all over the floor. 

But that is not where my story ends, only where it begins. I’ve dedicated 5  years of my life to working with a trauma psychologist, sifting through the extensive damage and healing myself. And I’m very proud of that. 

But when my husbands family went snooping around in my past, they weren’t prepared for what they found. They’ve all lived very happy, very sheltered lives. They have no frame of reference for things like inescapable abuse and neglect. It shocked and confused them. 

Ever since they found out about my past, they’ve completely changed how they treat me. They no longer view me as the quiet, reserved adult individual that I am. They see me as a victim. They go out of their way to avoid talking about sensitive topics around me because they don’t want to trigger me. They constantly check in with me throughout the course of family gatherings, like I’m a child in need of constant supervision or else I’ll just have a meltdown right in the middle of dinner. They look at me like I’m an injured kitten that they’re forced to care for.

I have never recognized it in myself before but I just realized I probably haven’t just hung out with anyone in a year. I have like a couple of close friends but they live far away and sometimes I don’t even feel like talking to them.  

My ex husband cheated on meand a nasty custody fight ensued which ended with me backing down and having my son every weekend and over week in the summer  and him having him on the weekdays. This is do to my hectic and unpredictable work schedule. There are not a lot of option with jobs where I live and I have a decent paying one. My ex then married the women he cheated on me with and I have to deal with her being around my son all the fucking time, but I always play nice and keep my mouth shut for the benefit of my son. It’s easier for him to have home more cause he has her help and I am single. 

After the divorce I had two terrible relationships with two extremely manipulative people. I am kind of push over and hate making people mad so I stayed in these relationships longer than I should have. After the second relationship for the first year I was single it was a sense of overwhelming relief and isolated myself and worked, spent time with my son, played video games and watched tv. I don’t leave the house unless I absolutely have to or to take my son out cause I don’t want my isolation to effect him negatively. Additionally I am originally from a different state and had moved here for my ex and now can’t leave unless I leave my son which is obviously out of the question. I am surrounded by his crazy family. His l mother who is literally a sociopath and compulsive liar who is always plotting against me or judging my parenting. The rest of his family is no picnic either. I have no family here and like a couple of friends that i used to work with but don’t really see anymore after we were all laid off from our company. We all have different hectic jobs now so it’s hard to hang out. 

I think I have isolated myself to the point now that I don’t know how to act in social situations past small talk. Sometimes I feel like I am over sharing or talking to much or something idk.

But then I see how many friends they have and how easy it is for them to talk to people, which makes me get so discouraged and begin to feel that I am so boring and shitty and uninteresting and unworthy of anyone’s time and abnormal since I don’t act like any of the other guys in my grade who are so confident and sure of themselves. I feel like it’s pointless to go to any social events such as homecoming. I can barely even talk to a teacher. I can’t even muster up the courage to interact with someone even if it’s online behind a screen. When I get home I feel so lost and depressed and just want to vanish.

I’ve seen a councillor about it, and it did kinda help with making me understand that like dating, I should have a clear goal, and make a conscious effort to achieve that goal, but I’m still confused how to apply that.

Me and my friendship group all go to the gym together. We’re all in a group chat but I’m starting to notice no one really says anything if I don’t reply to the group, or don’t show up at the gym, whereas if anyone else in the group does the same it’s “where’s x, is he coming?” They’ll call or text to see where they are and here I am wondering why my phone is even on loud, as I never get calls or texts from anyone, yet alone my friends.

I recently split with my girlfriend of two years and even though I broke it off, I still can’t shake the feeling I was better off in that relationship, even if I was miserable. At least then I had regular contact with someone. 

I guess what I’ve realised is I’m nobody’s favourite.. and that hurts. I’ve known all these guys since my primary school but can’t shake the feeling that I’m always the last resort, the guy people ask to do stuff when they’ve exhausted all other options. No one reaches out to me at all. I ghosted the group for like 3 months before for mental health reasons and all that happened was me getting roasted, my nickname changed and even then after all that time it was me hitting them up when I finally felt well enough to come back. I’ve confided these feelings into one of my friends before but nothing has changed. 

I’m sat in bed right now feeling like a fucking waste. I want to go to the gym so bad, to take my mind off of this feeling of just being invisible, but if I show up I just feel like I’ve self-invited myself and I’m just a plus one. Is it really so bad to want to actually be invited somewhere individually? To be invited somewhere personally? The guys always say “oh we messaged the group and you didn’t respond”, well maybe I just want to know that I exist for once and people actually want me around?

I mean, I fucking hate myself enough so I totally get why no one would wanna hang with me, I wouldn’t wanna hang with me for fucks sake. Anyone else get like this? I feel like I can’t say anything as I’m just being whiny and everyone else has much worse going on. I fucking hate this.

Whilst at 16 I can't say I was in love or anything, I knew for a fact that was the closest I'd been so far. We'd make each other laugh and flirted all the time without realising. We got along really well and always enjoyed being around each other, even when I was a little quiet or nervous.

We spoke in a group chat outside of school daily but never really directly. We became good friends over that year going to movies and other things together in that group. My life didn't revolve around her but she was important to me. I loved being with her and whenever I wasn't I looked forward to the next time I could be. 

I was always afraid to ask her out. I was friends with one of her close friends who whenever I asked sent screenshots of messages saying she wasn't interested. Whilst she showed all the signs she liked me, I decided to not tell her how I felt and still have someone to look forward to seeing rather than someone who rejected me.

 I remember the last day of high school, watching her drive away in her parents van. I knew I'd probably never see her again and I still remember that feeling of failure. 

During the summer holidays we had to go to college for an hour or two to confirm our places. For the most part she was nearby (I would have spoke to her but I was with my mum which wide make it awkward). I overheard her say how she was eager to talk to some guy who I hadn't heard of and that she liked him. I knew then that even if she did like me at one point, she's moved on. I wanted to burst out in tears but I couldn't.

Now we're at college and I've only seen her once, on the second day there. We only spoke briefly. I still think about her often and how I messed up my chances. I just can't move on. I know just how much I want to. I know talking to another girl might help but there aren't any, not one. My classes are all filled with guys.

Last year I came here overseas to work.I met a lot of people and it was easy for me to befriend and socialize with people.I was comfortable being around with anyobody even with strangers.Until one time at work where I started to suspect my officemates of hating me.One of them is staying in the same flat as mine so we go to work together.And since I was just new,my boss would often shout at me and say negative things due to my mistake.This had a great effect on me : Getting shouted at and my coworkers talking to each other without joining me in their conversation.I even heard one of them asking the other guy if I can hear them chatting so he stood up and looked at me and I pretended that i didn't notice him.(I wear earphones at work and listen to music during times that i just had a scolding from my boss in order to calm myself down.It was a coincidence that the track that i was listening to ended and there was a slight silence for the the next track).Everyday it gets worse and worse.Every day at work is like torture.Everything is just so negative.My boss wanted to terminate me.My colleagues don't talk to me.It feels like I dont have someone to back me up. The only place where I feel I have friends is at home.and then during the daytime at work, I have to bear and endure this mental torture of constantly getting paranoid and sensing the atmosphere that my coworkers are conspiring against me.Even during the times that nobody is talking,I feel like I am being threatened.I cant even sit straight because my head will be exposed above the monitor and I dont want them to catch a gaze of my face because I am afraid that one of them might look at me and sees my facial expression and he will assume that I am angry or upset.And the more I think of having a normal or neutral facial expression,the more the tension on my face gets worse.And the more I look upset or angry.Fast forward 6 months,I moved out of my previous place.I dont feel comfortable anymore even with my old flatmates.Just sitting beside them makes me feel tensed and so self conscious that I cant act normally make these weird body movements and gestures .It all reflects on my face no matter how hard I try to suppress it.If only i could transfer the tension somewhere else. Now every social interaction is a daunting task for me. If I can avoid it, I will avoid it.But sometimes I dont have a choice. I try to smile and greet them but afterwards I will bow down my head and walk awkwardly.I am so afraid on making a bad impression.After every interaction, I am constantly worrying and thinking hard about what I have done or if I acted in an unfriendly manner.I try to strike up a conversation but eventually I will run out of things to say back and this causes me to feel dizzy and panic,which the person I am talking to will notice because of my sudden change of facial expression.so they will also change their facial expression.It is also hard for me to open my mouth and pronounce words since my lips stiffen up and wants to prevent me from talking.So I dont have friends or rather it is hard for me to make friends.How i wish I can just be around anyone and just mind my own business and not feel tensed.But I cannot concentrate minding my own business.I pretend to look at my phone but my focus is on what the other person might be thinking of me.that he might take a glance at me and sees my face.my body movements.and assumes that i hate him of her.it is like a negative feedback loop.i cant act normal.if i see someone eating food in front of me,i really dont care or feel jealous.but in my mind i am thinking that he might see my facial expression that i am mad or angry or jealous so i try to tell myself that i should act normally.but the more i think about acting normally,the more i stiffen up.specially my face.so that's basically it.i cant talk to people.i cant be around people alone.i have forgotten how to socialize,how to make friends,how to live and enjoy life.every day during the afternoon i feel sad and i want to cry for no reason.i keep thinking that my coworkers hate me.even if i dont hear anything bad coming from them.what is this?please help.im writing this now in my room alone.and no.i dont have any thoughts of suicide or whatever but it is hurting my life.an hour ago when i left from work, I had a sore face and a tension headache.I was about to cry.My coworkers were talking to each other again the whole day and I almost lost it and flipped out.I even tried confronting one of them and in my thoughts I imagined smashing his face as hard as I can.But then I thought what if they are not talking about me.what if it's just all in my head.but that is impossible.I wouldnt feel this way if that is the case.somehow, even slightly,I know they are hostile against me.I just took a hot shower and feel normal again.no paranoid thoughts,no painful and stiff lips.no sensation of super glue smeared on my face that dried out.i feel happy.i feel functional.but again i am facing a problem.I want to eat and go to the bathroom.but i hear people talking in the hallway.oh well i dont care anymore.tomorrow i will have to endure this pain again because I cant have a normal straight face while working in front of the computer like normal people would.i feel pain in my lips.my cheeks feel stiff then finally my eyes become teary.I always do a face check using the front camera of my phone.it really looks terrifying.like a person about to explode.Like a person about to kill someone.and they can see my face.and when i hear them talk i feel like they are mocking me.challenging me to fight back or to make a move.my question is why is this sensation of stiff face,painful lips and teary eyes occurring during the time that i am at work or when I am around people but when i am inside my room they disappear?How can i make them disappear forever?is it all just in my thoughts?is it all just inside my head?am i crazy?am i paranoid?am i depressed?do i have a mental disorder?do i need treatment?PLEASE HELP.I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.",lonely,I Don't Know What Is Happening To Me,2019-11-28 03:12:10

Anyway, the week just gone was my daughters third birthday and i got to spend the week there, i love my daughter so much and we were just so happy to see each other and hang out  she constantly told me she loved me and when she went to bed, me and the boys would watch films until they went up and then my ex and I would chat about old times for a bit before we went to sleep, i was on a sofa bed so it was clear to the boys we weren't  getting back together.

The week sped past and soon i was heading home looking forward to christmas when i got to see them again.

Yesterday, my ex messaged me telling me I can't come back over christmas and she isnt willing to have me stay over again because one of the boys has started being naughty at school and calling her selfish for not making enough effort to get back together even though he knows it isnt going to happen. He is slightly autistic and has always had behavioral problems, lashing out at people is just one thing he does..

My daughter has also been playing up at night since I left which im getting the blame for, my opinion is she just misses me AND she is also just getting over an ear infection and no child goes back to being 100% after being ill.

Ive never been able to cope very well without the family we created and im happiest when I'm around them. The thought of  being alone on Christmas upsets me so much and I don't know how im going to cope.",lonely,Alone at Christmas,2019-11-27 23:39:33

I just feel like I wasn’t good enough. I wasn’t convincing, I wasn’t tempting enough at baseline. When things required more effort in his part he just said he was tired.

300,PeruvianRealtor,1574855326,1,"Hello anyone who reads this! I dont know who to talk to about this, I feel like I'm a burden to my friends and I know that's not the case but I cant get that thought out of my head. I guess I just want someone to talk to.
Before I can explain my thoughts I'll have to give some context, so bare with me.
I broke up with my ex a year ago and some months now, we were together for 3 years. She was my first real love, and my first serious relationship. She was actually my first everything. Well, I've had relationships before but not like this. I know it takes time to get over someone, I've heard before that its double the amount you've been with the person but I'm sure it depends on the person. 
During the relationship I felt like I was always being taken for granted and I wasn't being understood. I was so certain that my girlfriend was such a mean person, I've since come to realize that she wasn't bad at all, we just didnt know how to speak to each other in our different love languages. We went through our rollercoaster, bickering a lot over nothing because we took it personally but it was worth it when we could make it work. When it was good it was great, we were a team. I was so immature and naive about everything, I didnt even try to understand or appreciate anything, not just my ex girlfriend. I was so closed minded, I didnt even bother with making change. At that time I was sticking with my old ways that I learned rocking onto.
When we broke up I felt horrible like I let go too soon, and that I made a mistake. I continued to live my life trying to make myself believe it was for the best for me.

 Snce then I've went on a journey to find out who I am.
I told myself that I wouldn't turn to any substances before I knew I was ready because I didnt want to grow dependent and I wanted to face my emotions head on. 
When I felt felt ready I got high with my roommate at the time. I had a bad trip and ended up having this existential dream or vision or something and it completely changed my views on everything including myself. I realized that I was the one that was mostly messed up. Though, she want perfect, if I even tried it could have worked. 

After about half way through the break up, a girl from work was interested in me and made it clearly obvious. I didn't want to get into something so soon because I was still hurting but I knew I would regret it if I didnt at least try. So after a month of dating she ends up ending things with me because she didnt feel anything towards me anymore. It's fine, it didnt really hurt because I knew it wasn't going to be anything serious. I think she was using me for support 

I never stopped thinking about my ex though and even now it affects me. I want to reach out but nothing's changed in my life other than my thought process. I have a new job as an MLO but I haven't been making any money yet. I want to show her and more importantly myself that I'm dedicated now and I'll be successful. 
I want to be better for me but also for her, in the Hope's that one day we can be together again.

I just dont know if I feel this way because I'm lonely, or if it's because I really do miss her and I want to be with her. I know she was my first with a lot of things and I dont have a lot of experience with dating and that can make it seem like shes more worth it than she is but I really dont know. I know that the way I am now, and the way I'm going I can make it work with her and we can be happy together but maybe that's just the daydreams of a delusion person, but I know shes probably not the same person she was before either. I just feel the need to not give up hope

Title says it all, I really can’t mentally transition having him as my ex-boyfriend. 

We were in a long distance relationship for almost a year and a half, talking every day through the internet and visiting practically bimonthly. 

I met him on the tail end of my first ever relationship which was incredibly toxic and abusive. I think I only got the strength to break up with my first ex because of him. 

Because I was coming from a place of so much pain, he took advantage of that and love bombed the hell out of me. 

He told me I was the prettiest girl he’d ever met (most guys say I’m a 7/10), really treated me like it to. I blocked him on everything and he wrote me a letter. He spent hundreds of dollars on me that I knew he didn’t have. He complimented me every day, talked to me every day, always took care of me... 

He made me feel beyond special- he was the only person I felt like understood me, loved me, wanted me around. And his family made me feel this way too. 

I always felt like we were connected- even when we were fighting- we were working under the same tendencies and patterns. Something I felt like nobody had like me, nobody was that decent. 

He was my other half. 

I had got to know his whole family and all his siblings (a family of 6) and I was basically like a daughter to his parents. I took care of his younger siblings too and was very involved with his life and the whole family’s lives. 

When we broke up, it didn’t even feel real. He never told me why, but he kept me around for about a month. He said he loved me, he still wanted me around, but he didn’t want me as a girlfriend anymore. I couldn’t take it, I felt so far away from him, it just built into rage. He finally gave up on me. 

I was so enraged that I cursed him out, I said the meanest things I’ve ever said to anyone- “are you crying? I hope you are. I hope you hurt as much as you fucking hurt me. You’re a piece of shit. You’re a monster.” I ended the relationship, and he has my phone number but hasn’t done anything to show that he wants me back, understandably. 

There’s a certain way a guy talks to you when he hurts. It’s just a voice that’s given up, a voice that tells the truth it doesn’t want to, a voice that cares about you but can’t stand you any longer. And I hate to hear it. I want to be with someone who wants me, but I want him. 

He wants nothing to do with me, but to me he’s still my baby. It’s been months and I still think about him with happiness, missing him, loving him. I knew even if I got to talk to him, it wouldn’t be the same, and I’d just be crushed because he doesn’t want me anymore. I accidentally described him as my boyfriend at work the other night, and I immediately felt so disgusting and sad. 

Sometimes it’s easier to just lie and say he is my boyfriend to tell a story. Sometimes it’s easier to think of him as my boyfriend because I don’t have to deal with the mental conflict of reality and my memories. It’s just so hard to feel different when I rarely even saw him or talked to him towards the end, maybe once a week. I used to have to wake up every morning and remember that he isn’t my boyfriend. 
I still have to remind myself but these memories and these feelings won’t go away. I hate it. 

*nsfw trigger warning* 
I can’t even touch myself without thinking about him or wanting him. It’s been several months. I don’t want to be with other people, I don’t want to date, I don’t have crushes, my body doesn’t want other people. It wants him. I’ve been in nonconsensual situations with other people, and my body tenses in a certain way. I can’t enjoy anything sexual because my body won’t let me, and my mind half way doesn’t even want to. My body and mind go off with warning that I am my ex-boyfriend’s still, that I need to save myself for him. He was the only person I’ve ever trusted or enjoyed sexually. I can’t imagine sex with anyone else, not even previous crushes or celebrity crushes or anything. All I want is him. I hate it. 

*nsfw over* 

The relationship is over and will never be the same. I can’t stop loving him, wanting him, thinking about him as my boyfriend. Not even as an ex that I want back, full blown delusional “he is my boyfriend”. What do I do about this? I feel so disgusting.

320,deseraeb236,1574832436,1,"Ok so to start off I'm from a small town in Ontario (Canada) and my high school experience was horrendously shit (like most peoples) with nearly daily bullying. So I did what most do, worked super hard to get good grades to make sure I'd never have to see those assholes again, and now I attend university in a big city (the capital to be specific). During high school, I hung around a shit group of people (the majority of whom I was very close with in elementary school) who overall treated me like shit, talked about and made fun of me behind my back, excluded me from literally everything and anything they could, and were just flat out mean. 

Just to give you an idea of the kinds of individuals they were, I had one ""best friend"" who in the 10th grade, asked to meet up with me in a park adjacent from our school, where she then set me up, brought along one of her friends who absolutely hated me, physically held me down and beat the living shit out of me while I was left defenceless. Another ""best friend"" messaged my sexual assaulter (boyfriend of the one girl who was brought along in the previous sentence) on Facebook and for whatever reason told him I lied about the entire assault (unfortunately I still remained her friend even after I found out about that). There's so many more stories like that, but some of them are just too traumatizing to even bring up. 

So you can understand now why in the last 2 months of high school, I decided enough was enough, and sent an online message to some of those friends, explaining why and how they hurt me and how I no longer wanted anything to do with them, proceeding to block them completely just so I could have the last word (god knows anything they would've written after that would've just been lies upon lies). It's been about 6 months now since I've done that, and honestly the loneliness/hatred for them and myself is slowly eating away at me. The thoughts never go away, the memories of how fucking stupid I was to put up with such horrible treatment/abuse are constantly in my mind and I wish I could just be at peace. After all, that's why I left my hometown, to get away from those constant reminders of what I went through for 4, almost 5 years. The thoughts just seem to follow me wherever I go. 

I've thought about killing myself so many times just so I won't have to think about it anymore, but what good will that do? That means that they win and I lose. I can't let that happen. I can't do that to my family. Everyone I know from my counsellor back home to my parents/brother has told me to just ""forget about it and move on"", but I fucking can't and I don't know why. I think what bothers me the most about it all is that they don't even feel bad about it. I know for a fact they think they are in the right and that I'm just a whiney cunt who expected too much. I guess that's what happens when you use that many drugs at such a young age. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that too? Cocaine, xanax, molly, you name it, they're doing it (something I unfortunately got into for a few months as well but thankfully got the hell out of. Them, not so much). Anyway, where was I? Oh ya, any helpful tips/similar experiences you guys have to share would be much appreciated, as I'm kinda struggling a lot right now with this if you couldn't tell. Thank you so much!!

321,throwaway29495739247,1574831324,1,"Made a throwaway due to the fact that I’m basically about to pour out of my personal life out to which I hardly share with anybody. So here goes

I’ve had this constant feeling of loneliness since around the beginning of freshmen year of high school.  While it does waver sometimes, it feels like I can’t escape this feeling of dread and disappointment. I’ve always had a way of fucking up relationships, with friends or partners, parents, etc. I seem to always set myself up to these absurdly high goals where failure is certain, yet I never seem to learn from my mistakes. I was infatuated with this girl, for whatever reason. I was going steady with this girl at the time, really solid gal, just to try and maybe see where this new oppurtunity would take me. She ignored me, gave really bland responses to texts yadayadayada.  Not sure why but I kept trying and trying to make this shit work, using excuses like “maybe she’s busy” when she wouldn’t responded when it was obvious I was being ignored. It’s the worst feeling, when you like somebody so much and if you disappeared they wouldn’t even give a shit. So I just broke a perfect girls heart, for no other reason than me wanting to switch things up. Around this time my step dad dislocated his shoulder when I was around 16, and he was prescribed oxycodone. With my depression growing deeper, and I’ve heard pain meds can get you high, I took some. Took 2, nothing. Took 2 more, nothing. The next day I took 6 and I was just wrapped in this warm feeling, like a blanket that just erased every single worry and doubt from your head, and let you finally have peace. This cycle continued for a couple weeks, and when his script ran dry, I’d switch to looking for anything I could take to just escape this feeling of loneliness swelling inside my body. At the end of sophomore year, I met a girl at a friends place one day, and it was pretty much instant attraction on both ends. She pursued me, which was absolutely perfect for a shy lad like myself. We ended up dating at the beginning of summer and things were going great. You’d think after I made such a stupid mistake beforehand, I would have learned my lesson, right? Nope; not in the slightest. Same exact thing happened again, another woman crossed my path and I threw everything else to the side, pursuing a woman who doesn’t give a shit about me. I’d go into detail, but it’s the same thing as what I previously described above. After that it’s been silent for me, I haven’t really tried to get out there, and maybe find someone who cares about me as much as I’d care about them. Maybe it’s like that one song, once bitten twice shy. Anyways here we are in present times. I’m nearly 18, have some pretty decent friends, I’m good with my parents, I have a car and a really solid job. But why do I not like looking at myself in the mirror? Why do I go to sleep with this feeling that I’m alone? Why won’t this constant agony subside? I’ve never felt worse when one would think I’d be feeling pretty good. I jsut want to be able to call someone mine, someone to think about, someone to feel. If you’ve made it this far I really appreciate you reading this, it means a lot.

342,Sampson_39,1574813525,1,"I love my best friend. We share so many good times. My world doesn't spin so fast when I'm with her. Everything with her makes sense. We go on adventures and I love that we do everything together and spend as much time as we do. There's so much more. She brings me genuine peace. She sees me as her ultimate protector. She knows she can count on me for anything she ever needs, and knows I would drop what ever I'm doing in a moments notice to be there for anything she needs, big or small, but never takes advantage of that fact. She's told me on more than several occasions she knows I'd be the perfect guy for her and trusts me as much as I do her, indefinitely. It all makes sense with her. I know she would blow off any plans she's made, no matter how far in advance if I told her I needed her, and has proven that she will go to great lengths to take care of me emotionally, though I may be hard pressed to to admit it or ask for help. And knows I would never take advantage of that. 

But all she wants from me is everything you find in a non plutonic relationship, minus romantic intimacy. She's like a puzzle I have every piece for, except that. She doesn't want anything more than my friendship. She wants to be free, to do as she pleases with who she pleases. After a failed attempt at a relationship with someone she was very close with before, and watching that fail and what they had together, including one of the most important friendships she's ever had, go up in flames- she will not risk hurting herself, or more importantly to her, me. She's comfortable in the idea that she can find a guy, and give them that piece of the puzzle that I wake up every day wishing I had more than anything, but if she for no rhyme or reason wakes up and decides she's no longer interested, she can hurt them and drop them just like that and feel no remorse and move on with her day. A safety mechanism for her, as she's suffered from huge emotional relationship trauma. As many of us have.  

I respect her for her honesty and truth and her desire to protect me from her warped sense of love. Shes accepted the love she thinks she deserves, and that love is not the true, genuine, compassionate love that no one ever realizes they deserve without learning the way life works. 

So we will continue to tell each other we love another. We'll continue to spend hours on the couch watching YouTube videos. We'll never stop bending over backwards for one another. We'll plan a ton more adventures and keep making some of the best memories with each other full of laughter, tears, and everything in between. 

I'll continue to wish we were more, she'll continue to get what she wants out of many more guys she doesn't need to emotionally invest herself in. I'll continue to watch it happen and stuff down my jealousy and sorrow every time she finds a new flavor of the week to fill the void in her heart she protects me from. 

I'll remind myself every day I wake up that I have something more valuable then that last missing puzzle piece. That the fact she honors me with the greatest gift anyone could ever have, the privilege of being the most important person in her life, and that wanting anything more than what I have is selfish on my part. And it'll get easier, tonight is just one of the tougher nights. 

After all, when you truly love someone, you want to see them happy no matter the cost. No matter how much it hurts. No matter how much I might want more, what really matters is I give her exactly what she wants from me emotionally, and that makes her smile. That's what's important to her. That degree of happiness and her smile is more important than anything else ever could be.

But I guess we were not that close because we went to different college and never talked to each other after.
Now it's just me. I'm extremely anxious and shy and I can't talk to people, it's realy hard for me to start a conversation. People in college already know each other for a long time or had met each other during the integration parties . And I never went to one of them.

Can you see the kind of people that always looks upset ?

Well that's me ..For some reason my neutral face looks like someone just told me that they broke my phone. 
And I get that people probably don't want to talk to someone who seems like they hate everyone here and that they don't want to speak to anyone.
And I could be thinking about love and cute baby pandas people would still think I'm upset.
That's not something that usualy bothers me but to think that it's the only reason why people wont talk to me kinda hurts.
Because I always had a nice time with the people I used to talk with and we had a lot of fun.

In my family my brothers and my parents are all playing Handball except me. And obvioulsy that's the only thing they talk about all days.

So event when I am with them I end up on my phone or alone because they are talking about sport and they don't even try to change the subjet ONCE in a week.

So, basically, I had given up on communities in the past and only recently had a friend basically forcefully force me into her server. I knew her from a group ages ago which ended up being one of the first ones that I left. We still were chatting on the odd occasion. And well after some convincing I joined. Well I met a few really nice people that way but I also discovered that the person I knew back then had changed so much, which I didn't notice during the little chats. So what do I do? I pick a fight after 3w and get myself kicked. I kinda expected this outcome and I genuinely feel terrible every time it happens, as it makes the other friendly people feel shit as well.

That in turn makes me feel like the source of the suffering I carry around and seem to spread everywhere I go, I mean, I'm pretty stubborn when it comes to my opinions and I will poke the bear with a pointy stick and not prevent myself from it. Sure I'm trying to improve in a manner where this doesn't happen but my response is that I push those people who seem to care away. I isolate myself.
Is this justified? Should I give up hopes to re-socialise? I mean the only reason I looked for online communities in the first place was because I don't click with people irl like at all. Aside from maybe two, but those people don't go to my school and rarely have time either.

For the record, I am also visiting a therapist to deal with my other issues that resulted from domestic issues during my upbringing which I won't elaborate here right now. It's kinda helping but I feel it has plateaued.
Yet still when shit like this happens, it depresses me so much that it makes me often contemplate ending myself entirely. I haven't yet attempted it, somehow I'm strong enough to not give in, or maybe too gutless to do anything I contemplate, but w/e.

Do you ever feel women dislike you for no reason? (Again, not to sound like a narcissus - But other women often presume  I'm cold or bitchy or mean just because of how I look. In school, the girls named me 'the boyfriend stealer' (LOL) even though I never spoke to their previous lovers and by and large had no interest in them) I've been told I'm intimidating, I'm 5'2!

&amp;#x200B;

How do you make friends? I'd love more female friends. (Also, I'm not mean or pernicious with people, I just seem to lack friends to do things with - Current example: I got a PS1 emulator on my WII and have no one to play Gran Turismo with :( 

I just feel endlessly lonely - I can't seem to connect with women, men seem to want one thing. As for boyfriends, I just can't find one I like I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice and any hate (will welcome all responses, I'm not alone!!) appreciated.

I haven’t wrote anything on any social media platforms or said anything in real life about how I feel and I want to try that on reddit to see if I can actually get some help/advices or just get some of my emotions out instead to trying to keep it all to myself. I want to start with an introduction, I won’t really say my name but I’m a 15 year old girl, in 9th grade and I would say that I’m decent in school. I’m shy and don’t talk that much in school to anyone, even to my friends. Maybe because of my awkwardness, I don’t really talk to my friends and that they don’t really talk to me. I don’t feel any connections to my friends and I feel like I’m becoming more distant as time goes on. A thing about me is that I have trouble expressing how I feel and opening up to anyone and everyone. I have never talked to anyone about how I’m feeling or the tangled up thoughts and emotions in my head. I always feel like I’m going to be judged by my friends and that they’ll look at me like I’m trying to get attentions by saying I need help and stuff. I’ve noticed that every time I go to school and is around with my friends, I always have a smile on my face, but I still Walsh’s feel empty even surrounded by friends that I’ve had for a very long time. All I want is to at least have some courage to talk and share to someone about how I feel and express my thoughts. Or at least have some confidence with my actions because every time I zone out thinking about how I’ll tell my friends about the things going on inside my head, I always imagine them thinking that I’m so bothersome and annoying. I think I feel and think this way because I have seen other people at my school, from table mates and glances around in class, judge and talk behind the backs of someone they have some relation to. I don’t want an outcome like this, but then again, I can’t control their actions and choices. I feel like I should already be grateful that I at least have friends and I don’t even know what problems I have, it’s just really me being a problem to myself my overthinking everything and can’t decide on anything.I don’t really know where this is going, all I feel like is that I’m ranting and going on about things I want and not even thinking about how people around me might feel.

(Sorry for writing so much on my first post, but if anyone can help me or give me some advice, please say anything.

396,ItsInSpanish,1574749054,1,"Where do I begin...

Currently, my parents are going through a divorce, and it's nasty. Years ago, I moved 1000 miles away to start my career in my dream city. But another reason I moved away was to get away from the toxicity of one parent (call that parent A).

Growing up was not easy. Parent A always made the house tense; anything that would upset them, the smallest thing, would cause outrage. Parent B and my siblings would be walking on eggshells. There was a lot of emotional abuse. Because of that, I would tend to keep to myself because I can't get hurt if I don't open up to anybody.

I was loving my life, and thought I had overcome all that adversity. I gained confidence, and made good friendships for once. Then came the divorce. I tried to stay neutral to both sides, constantly reminding both parents that this fight is between parent A and parent B. Parent B has tried to maintain some form of civility, and has mentioned to me that they do not want to get in between the relationship between Parent A and their children (2 of 3 children are adults).

Well, parent B has decided to go with a scorched earth policy and has been tearing everything apart. Even though I am 1000 miles away, I have begun reliving the emotional abuse from my childhood. I've reverted to my old defense tactic: isolation. Because of what I am reliving, I am becoming increasingly skeptical even of my closest friends because I am afraid of additional hurt, which I know is irrational. But, I go to work, come home, and lay low and would much rather be left alone, because being alone and not opening up further makes me feel safe.

Further, friendships change because, well, life. Everyone I know is coupled up, getting married, starting families, buying homes, making career moves, moving to different cities. Then there's me. I recognize things change, and no matter how close of friends we are now, I know and understand that one day life will happen. This isolation also helps me in getting ahead of life, that way when friends start a new phase of their lives it will be much easier for me to let go. I hope I won't go missed when that happens.

I do not have anywhere to go for the holidays. I am spending Thanksgiving with my roommate, his family who are staying with us, and friends. If it weren't for us hosting Thanksgiving dinner, I would just stay home. As for Christmas and New Years, I literally have no where to go. I refuse to go to wherever the parents are at, it's too much for me to handle. And I do not want to go to any Christmas celebrations with friends because I will be the awkward 2n+1 wheel. And, that way I avoid pivoting away from the inevitable ""what are you doing for Christmas?"" questions.

Moving away and starting a new life, never had I imagined I would feel ever more alone. Maybe it's the holidays, but it seems like everyone has somewhere to go, and then I am here by choice because it's safe. The place I grew up with is gone, destroyed. I don't belong anywhere, and have no where to be, or to go. I'm just here...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Parents' divorce has me reliving childhood emotional abuse. Pushing everyone and everything away. My defensive strategy is isolation because that way no one can hurt me. I'd rather be left alone. I don't belong anywhere anymore. I'm just here.",lonely,"Torn Family, Life Happening, I'd Rather Go through the Motions Alone",2019-11-26 17:17:34

First off the dating scene is terrible. I hate how much of a chore it feels just to meet someone you're attracted to. Even with simple interactions it just takes a lot of energy. Idk if it's because girls don't put effort in communication anymore or I'm just not interested in dating at the moment or I'm scared that I'm not good enough. There are a lot of reasons. I want a relationship and meet someone that I can make spend time and make memories with, but it's so difficult. Ahh well nothing if you also have this problem feel free to share. 

I realised that my friends suck as well. They never call or text to see how I'm doing. I only hear from them when they're not feeling well. Honestly I'm tired of dealing with others people stress. It's gotten to the point where I started becoming more honest with them. Bad enough I don't really work well with crying and stuff, but having to hear other people cry puts me in a uncomfortable spot. Not trying to be cole hearted, but the truth has to be told.

Next aside from looking for a partner I've been increasing my skill set. I've taken a hobby in cosplaying and photography. Sadly it's an expensive hobby 😭 I just wish I won 2mil so I wouldn't stress so much, but life isn't always gonna work your so oh well 😁.

Been a customer of the chain for years but it was that december (26/12/18) when i was back from christmas holidays with my friends when i saw her sitting behind the service bar with her smile and her gorgeous ginger hair.. I instantly fell for her. I started going more regulary (just for her) alone and doing my thing (drinking my morning coffee and then getting into the PC). We started talking little by little like ""hey how are you?"" to political views, hobbies etc etc. Everytime i see her i melt from love and sadness. You know why? Because i knew from the very first moment that i had no chance with her. I mean she is 4 years older than me (me: 19 she: 24), she has a boyfriend and im not even average looking guy with a lot of problems \*ok i will accept at least average\*. Even if i know all those i still want to go to drink my coffee and have a conversation with her until i have to go to work. She fuels me for the day, like a drug. I need little bit of her sight to make my day and after it to keep thinking about her. Its a bittersweet feeling.. I like the state of falling in love for someone but it hurts knowing i will never have a chance with her.Am i the weird dude here? Maybe.

It just makes me afraid for the future you know? Like, why should I expect anything to change if I'm in the most social environment there is?

I got really scared last Friday or so though. I had a really bad day and I started noticing that I sort of resent everyone else.

Little background..


&amp;nbsp;


I grew up with my grandparents, they have been the biggest support in my life. My parent divorced when I was 6yo and since then I live with my granparents.

&amp;nbsp;


This year was tough for me. My bf broke up with me twise then we got back together and all of my good friends moved away in another city or state.
I have this relationship of almost 8y, it's been hard, we met very young and over the years we've changed a lot but I love him more than anything, he is also my support and I feel like I can really be myself with him.

&amp;nbsp;


Sometimes I woke up at morning with no desire to get out of the bed, I have constant feeling I am not good enough for anyone including myself. I am feeling like I am stuck and I can't go forward. 
I have terrible relationship with both of my parents, they never cared for me and that stop hurting me years ago, now it's just anoying. 
I can't believe that they are not even ashamed to call me and telling me how hard their life is or how they don't have enough money and they never ask me how I am.

&amp;nbsp;


I also have social anxiety and it makes everything even harder as I get older. Sometimes I cry whole day and then I am so annoyed by everything someone say to me and later I feel terrible because of how I have treated people who love me and care for me. But I just don't know how to control that.

446,JazzK9,1574696849,1,"So a little context first...

I'm a 19 year old student in the UK. I was taken outta my family home at the age of 16 due to abuse and put in foster care. Then kicked outta foster care at 17 (they didn't want to keep me anymore as they wouldn't be paid for it when i turned 18). Because I moved around so much as a kid I never had a chance to make any friends who would stick around, nor did I ever get on with any of the families I lived with. 

I also got out of a 2 and a half year relationship around 5 months ago, and just moved somewhere else for uni.

The problem here is; I have never been this alone. I'm so very scared as to what my mental state is going to be like and how I am going to deal with the loneliness. I won't have any friends or family or SO to spend Xmas with and that's petrifying. I'm not sure what I am going to do.....I've thought about doing charity/voluntary work but (as bad as it sounds) I don't think doing others good will help me in any way to not feel shit about going home and being alone that evening. 

Any ideas guys...?",lonely,Anxious for Xmas,2019-11-26 02:47:29
447,RuhdiculousRyuk,1574695269,1,"24(m)  I don’t know what happened, where I went wrong.  Fell in love with my best friend, moved in together and had a couple months of good times with those bad moments in between. Good and bad memories altogether that’ll always be with me. We grew part rapidly and I’ve just felt used. Watching as we got further and further away. She made a friend that needed a new roommate so I asked how serious she was about it since it all happened rather quickly. She was dead set on this offer so I did what I could to help her move everything she had to her new place. 
This move was for the best especially for her and I’m glad she’s doing better and making her way. 
I told her from the beginning since before she moved in with me that I’d sooner tear myself apart rather than put her out on the street. At the very least I’d just try and be there for support. 
Well I did and will always be there for her if she needs. 
I did offer so I can’t blame anyone for how I feel and I really don’t intend on it. I just need to get this out, to try and free myself from this awful place I’ve found myself in. 
Days before she moved out my depression hit hard, and it just didn’t let up. I kept a smile on my face just to make it. My family keeps asking if I’m okay and I just tell em not to worry because It’s not really important and I don’t worry about how I feel anymore. Well I just don’t know how I feel anymore, I spent a week crying and drinking. Helpful right... I still care a lot about my friend, but I just don’t feel like it’s the same way for her. When we hang out it’s almost like before we crossed that line into a relationship. But It feels like she’s lightyears away out of my reach and life. It fucking hurts and it just won’t stop. 
I try and keep myself occupied with work and my trade school. But it’s just an obligation at this point. When I’m working I loose time In my day because I’m just somewhere else mentally. Most times it’s just quite in my head. Usually I’m thinking about some shit to say to my coworker or focus on doing a good job, but my mind is just blank. When I come home there’s an emptiness that takes over. I tell myself I’ve been through this before many many times before and seems like I just haven’t gotten a break from this cycle. Everything seems less than it is, but every day it crosses my mind to just end it all. I definitely have to means to, and know time schedules so as to not be found for sometime after it’s done. 
But why do that to people? I know I try and be helpful and that (good guy) but really everybody knows if you see yourself that way your just a piece of shit. And yeah there some truth to that. I want people to hurt as much as I do, that one thing that’s never left my heart since I was little. I fight that feeling as best I can ever since the first time I’ve had that thought. When I thought about it and was being dead serious about it, I felt this black shadow/weight rise behind me that made my hairs stand up. Never looked back and stopped thinking about being hurtful.. 
now that feeling is back and comes in my dreams. 
I’ve had a reoccurring dream where I’m in a prison and it’s always dark with the only light coming In from cracks In the walls. All I hear is dripping water and the sound of chins. When the guards come to drag me out I can’t see anyone’s face until they bring me into the light of this room. Dropping me in the middle of a circle of people all standing over me. When I look up I see them. These people surrounding me are all parts of me from my past from childhood to present. I’m forced to look at myself though a mirror. As I do so, my reflection stares into my eyes and starts changing its expression. Before I know it I’m paralyzed. As my reflection crawls out of the mirror and is standing over me. He starts choking me and as I’m gasping for air calling for help, the lights start to fade into total darkness. Chains wrap around me and drag me further into the void while my reflection just laughs in echoes. 
Then I wake up in a sweat. 
Walk to my coffee table and pour myself a drink and just stare into my glass wandering back and forth from my glass to my gun. I keep one round right next to it just incase. I can feel something coming, I can see it. I just want to blow my heart out. It’s corrupt and hurting and I don’t know when that day will come when that hammer clips forward and the lights go out forever and I can finally rest. Maybe one more Christmas, one more new year, one more birthday... and then I can disappear.
I just want this nightmare to end. But there’s still that FUCKING one little bit of resilience, a defiance to prove to myself that I can live with it that I have something to prove to myself if at nothing else there’s no one else left in my life I can let in or hold close. 
I don’t wanna harbor this hate anymore, it’s twisting me and will make me sicker than it most likely already has. I’ll hold myself together, because if there’s anything I can say it’s that I’ll always make it. Guaranteed",lonely,I feel like I’m slipping through my own fingers.,2019-11-26 02:21:09

Wrong.

Since last year, I've been struggling with my grades, as well as friendship problems. I thought they were the best friends I could ever ask for. I really thought they were. Until a nasty rumour about me came around and they turned their backs against me. I tried explaining myself to them but they still cut me off. They were the only group of friends I had in this school, the rest of the school probably thinks I'm weird. I had been roaming around school alone for two years, I am so glad I graduated.

Teachers took notice about me and my grades and were really concerned about me. I told them I was alright and I believed that all boils down to that important exam this year. However, I still feel that I did not put in much effort and afraid that I might have to retain or get sent into a trashy school. I will only know what happens when I receive my results next year.

These past few days, all I can think about are that exam and how sad I am feeling. Looking at other people's IG and Snapchat Stories, especially the ones with my former friends, make me feel even more empty. I have never felt this lonely before.

455,usernameistakenxxx,1574681517,1,"For the first time in over a year I actually feel lonely. Every since I took a “break” from college last year I’ve been at home trying to “reform” myself. I was performing poorly and eventually the stress got to me and I crashed. I just couldn’t do it anymore. I took this break to runaway from all that. Ever since then I’ve been afraid to go back. Never told my parents why I needed the break, just said I needed one cuz I wasn’t feeling it. I think my mom saw through me.

I rarely leave the house so I’m basically a shut-in. As a result I have little to no social interactions. I do live with my extended family for reasons but even then I’m starting to feel lonely recently. There’s this uncomfortable feeling in my heart. Like it’s craving something. And it really bothers me. 

For the past year I’ve been gaming to past the time until I need to return to college but that has become uninteresting. So I begun rewatching anime after 2 years of not watching. So far it’s been keeping me occupied. I don’t have any friends. Haven’t had any for almost 2 years. At the beginning of college I made 3. But when that semester ended we never really caught up. 

I have some bad habits. Sleeping really late for example. It’s 6:30 am as I’m typing this and I woke up at 4:30 pm yesterday. Haven’t slept since and I won’t be falling asleep for another 2 hours. Been eating very poorly too. Sometimes 1 meal a day most often 2. My dad’s been giving me earfuls for my sleep and my mom for my eating but I’m just not feeling it. 

I don’t know if this is the right place for this, but I felt like this is what I needed to get off my chest. Maybe this is what my heart has been craving recently.

I’m not depressed, I’m sure I would know if I was.

I’m pathetic. Here I am worrying about minor issues that can be fixed but I’m too lazy to fix anything. But it feels kinda nice to type all this. I’ve never had anyone to tell me problems to. Never been in a relationship nor would I get into one. I have nothing to offer to someone in a relationship.

It’s really hard to find someone who is actually interested in talking to me, or actually remember anything about me afterwards. I start to wonder if something is actually wrong with me or something, if I’m so strange that I repel others, but that’s just what my anxiety tells me in my darkest hours. As I get older I’ve learned that not everyone is going to get along and that there’s no such thing as being too strange or weird, everyone is their own person. I guess that my problem stemmed from social media, before I had that I was blissful and content with my life. I became envious of others watching them show their best selves. I’m starting to learn that people are just people who probably feel the same way as I, they just don’t show it, and my envy comes from me imagining that they live a life without problems as well.

None of these feelings are near as bad as they used to be. The progress I made gives me strength to keep moving forward. But sometimes, I'm still sad and that's okay so long as I remember that these feelings, though insightful, are not truth or fact.

493,hamartiated,1574648399,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

502,The_Lighter_Side,1574639816,1,"So just wanted somewhere to just say how I feel since I don't really feel like I have the right to complain sometimes. 

To kick things off I want to start by saying I'm not alone. I live with my dad and his GF, (about to move into a flat with my brothers) and have friends who I see once a week or so aswell as people I talk to at work and all the other usual spatterings of people you see on a day to day basis. 

And until a few months I was happy with all that. I was so optimistic and even met a girl and even moved into her parents place until we saved up enough to move into our own place. We were both 20 and I was so happy with my life but I started having these days where I woke up and didn't want to get out of bed. I started getting more and more sad for no reason and even started having panic attacks about the world ending and exterstential crisies about how meaningless everything is. 

Even though I was happy I wasn't.  

But my girlfriend made it better. When one day I didn't go to work because I didn't want to get out of bed the next day she set her alarm half hour before mine and woke me up with a cup of tea and we watched Dr who for a little while while cuddling in bed so that I was awake by the time I actually had to get up. When I'd have a panic attack she noticed I stroked my fingers through my hair when I'm stressed and when she did it and hugged me close I genuinly felt like everything would be alright. And when I started to think about how meaningless life was she gave it meaning.

But I started to become abit too relient on her. It got to the point where she was there for me so often she would want brakes and that pissed me off. Not that she wanted a brake but the times she would do it, I know I was being a dick and I'm not excusing my controlling behaviour but she started doing things that made me feel like I was losing her. She went on holiday without telling me for a weekend when my birthday was on the Saturday, she got a tattoo without even discussing it with me and she would start going to the pub until 11-12 at night every night and ask me to wait up when she knew I had work at 4/5am the next day. 

Eventually we clashed too much and we broke up. I was devastated but I knew I'd get over it. I hadn't had panic attacks in a few months and she still wanted to be friends and made a point that if I had them again to call her. But it didn't get better and I eventually had to go see a doctor who diagnosed me with depression. I had two weeks off work and half way through the first week my ex calls me crying. Turns out she's pregnant and it's mine.

I knew I was a bad person when the first feeling I had was anger and frustration. Not because we were gonna have a kid, but if she had taken a pregnancy test a few days before we broke up we probably would still be together. I told her the truth, that I still loved her and she told me she didn't love me back. It had only been a month since we broke up but she was seeing someone else but hadn't slept with them yet and so the kid was definetly mine. 

That's when the panic attacks started again. I messaged her and called her but she got annoyed and told me she'd only want to hear from me or talk to me about the kid from now on since when I was trying to call her she was in bed with her new guy.

Fast forward to now and I still have all the things I had before, I have work aquatintences I have friends I have a dad who loves me but I still go to bed every night upset. I still message my ex once every few days seeing how she is and she just repkls with a thumbs up emoji. I still get panic attacks and when my dad hears me at night (sometimes get night terrors) he tries to comfort me but it's not the same. I walk around every day and I'm so lonely that I genuinly don't know what to do with myself most of the time. It feels like all I do is work, lie on bed eat shower sleep  repeat and going to bed every night and not having anyone beside me literally kills me. It's like that passenger song 'all the little light' and every time I got to work, every time I realise I've been laid staring at the ceiling for half an hour or every time I go to bed alone a little piece of me does and there's really not that much left at this point.",lonely,I'm Lonely But I'm not alone.,2019-11-25 10:56:56

508,NotesForYou,1574635783,1,"Scrolling through this sub I realised once more how many people on here are hurting. And I get it, I really do. Feeling lonely is so horrible because not only does it make us feel worthless in the face of a society that constantly reminds us what a great, socially amazing life everyone’s leading (as seen on Instagram etc) but it also makes us feel like something is fundamentally wrong with US as individuals. Believe me, I feel this 100%.

But today I learned this important lesson about perspective. We are hurting (mostly) because we are missing someone by our side in a particular moment. We feel lonely when we don’t have plans on a Friday night, or when we wake up to no one laying next to us in the morning. But for some reason we believe that, because we are hurting in this moment, because we are alone in this moment, it means that no one can love us enough to care, no one in our life cares about us at all. But I believe that this is just our insecure, anxious brain speaking. 

I strongly believe that if we walk through life with open eyes and an open heart we will inevitably find the connection we long for. I mean, there are literally 7,6 billion people out there. And, as we can see in this sub unfortunately, a lot of people feel lonely, left behind or are hurting. A wise man once said “what unites us as humans, is that we all suffer the same. We all experience loss, loneliness and pain. Suffering is the most universal experience we got, paradoxically, since to so many of us suffering feels like such a personal struggle.” and if we take this as a “starting point” it might help us realise that our feelings are not unusual, and we shouldn’t be ashamed or beating ourselves up over them. We’re all just human, we’re all looking for connection. 

Life holds so many surprises for everyone, we just need to be brave enough to see them and act accordingly. Everyone of us is worthy of love and attention, and I just don’t believe that loneliness is forever. So many people I’ve gotten to know in my life felt lonely but never reached out, never tried making plans because they were afraid they would come of as “needy” or “uncool”. So let’s be that hand that reaches out to people, let’s be more open minded and more thoughtful of the people surrounding us. Everyone of us is capable of finding the connections that can make us happy - this is just temporarily- I promise.",lonely,You’re not going to be alone forever- I promise,2019-11-25 09:49:43

512,wildcardbtchz,1574634131,1,"22, male, I have been aware of loneliness for years now and I've been following this sub for quite some time. I just created an account to post here.

So I fucked up, big time. I should've seen it coming — I *have* seen it coming but I did nothing for some reason. She and I had known each other for almost 2 years now, and we've practically messaged daily. In the past 3 months, we've barely missed a few days without talking. But all of a sudden she's been ignoring me for the past 2 or so weeks. I haven't double-texted (not ever actually) or sent messages like ""Hey what's going on? Is everything okay?"" and I definitely haven't said anything about her ignoring me. Usually, if something has come up, she just says it. This time, however, if she asks me ""what's up"" and then I ask it back (or ask a question about something she mentioned), she gives me vague and sort of dismissive answers. She could still be busy but I see her online (on WhatsApp) literally for hours, several times a day. Last night I couldn't sleep and she texted me back at 1:30 am (I had sent a text at 9 pm), I replied, she then replied surprisingly fast but then started taking 15, 20, even 40 minutes to reply while she was online the whole time. I excused myself around 3:30 am and I never felt more ashamed of myself the next morning. We still exchanged a couple of texts then and I went to university at 11 am. I'm being ignored to this time (it's past 11 pm as I'm posting this).

It's clear that she has been talking to someone and as a result, she has no room for me anymore. Or is this just in my head? ... That doesn't matter, it isn't relevant anyway, I just want to get over this obsession. (Overthinking is ruining my life.)

I can distract myself by writing, reading, watching my favorite show, studying and so on, but I can't possibly be busy 24/7 and not think about what's happening. I can feel good for a couple of hours despite it, but eventually, it comes up again. It's a mixture of irritation, self-loathing, and wanting to know ""why?"" but also knowing that I'm not entitled to that and I just have to somehow accept this abrupt change of events and move the fuck on. Being self-aware in these circumstances is agonizing.

I have tried to find love. I had two online dating profiles for over a year. I met several women and talked with them for a week or two. We'd always make plans to meet for lunch or coffee. But then most of them (not all) would cancel for some reason; not feeling well, kid not well, an ex boyfriend back in the picture, blah blah blah. That last reason was the only one I ever believed, the others I figured were just bullshit. I realized this past summer that it was all a waste of time and called it quits. Meanwhile, my coworkers who use it talk about how they met someone on the same dating apps and I can't but say, quite enviously, ""Must be nice."" 

I feel like this is the way it's always gonna be. I can't bring myself to talk to any woman or ask them out because I don't wanna get cancelled on again.

I play football, so I did a summer camp and met someone who I considered my friend because I thought he was really chill and he had around 6 girlfriends throughout the camp, so I thought I could get a girlfriend with his help. I was wrong he didn’t help at all. My other friend I met him in kindergarten and I was really close with his family and he was really close with my family. The reason I kinda lost those two friends was because my parents found out that the summer camp friend vaped and was not a good person over all. He tried to date my sister and talked shit behind my back. My other friend that is really close to me, made a racist Craigslist post about a slave and he got suspended and got all over the news.

532,JustCantExplainThat,1574608365,1,"TLDR:heart broken 3 times since I was 17, been made fun of and cheated on by women I love since. Beginning to become convinced that women are generally just selfish creatures waiting for Benjamin Franklin to break down their door and solve all their problems. 


So I have an issue romantically in my life, I don’t know what it is. Everyone seems to have a common input that I pick the wrong people to have in my life. 

I’m 23, I’ve had few women in my life and the relationships all ended terribly and I feel as if karma will haunt me forever. 

Back when I was 17, I really feel like I met the love of my life looking back on things, comparing the feelings I had then to the ones I have now, much more rash and extreme and passionate. I unfortunately being young and finally gaining my confidence had a lot of girls attention in highschool and I couldn’t help myself but to talk to them, and one thing led to another and we broke up because she couldn’t trust me and her best friend of the time (m) was in her ear for his own personal interests with my girlfriend at the time. Mr.try to steal your girl type. 

Then later on after that I separated myself from relationships for a long time, still a Virgin at 19, I say f*** it and I try to have something just casual with someone. I lost my virginity and got an STD and I’ve had Erectile disfunction since. This experience really turned off those sexual hormones in my body that makes a younger man crave a sexual lifestyle. And from that point it just makes me dirty and no one seems to understand that. 

A year later (now 20 years old) I find myself dating someone 8 years my senior with a child. Thinking someone who wants to really kindle a nice homelife and strong foundation of a relationship. But as soon as sex was implemented, she told me I wasn’t a man if I couldn’t please her 100% of the time. At this point it hurt even more to hear about my issue being real for someone else rather than just something inconvenient for myself. 

Finally come time for my most recent relationship that went a year (22-23) She hadn’t had a boyfriend and was a Virgin. I thought I did right in finding someone decent but a year down the line after talking wedding, kids names, dogs names, where we’d live, etc. she cheated on me with some sleezebag and had no remorse for it. At the time I had a well paying job working 60+ hours a week to get a jump start early in my life for the life we both wanted together. She said I became boring, too into work. Even though all my effort at work was for what we had agreed we wanted together. She also took my erectile disfunction and told me that she never knew if she were doing things right, wanted to experience something different and didn’t really care about what we had anymore, and wasn’t willing to look back. 

I don’t know what to do and I feel like I will pay back my dues for a 17 year old mistake the rest of my life. Women take advantage of my kindness and understanding and willing to be there for them every moment, my mom being a single mom without anything just me and my twin brother at 19. So I have a soft spot for women. But I’ve only been hurt severely. Now with years of experience, I’m tired of the beating, I’m tired of being treated the way I am. I can’t find anyone decent because I don’t believe there are any left.",lonely,"Lonely. Made fun of, cheated on. Just wanted some advice on how to deal with it all.",2019-11-25 02:12:45

Now I'm turning 30 and my life is in a very bad place - I'm unemployed and living with my parents, basically spend 24/7 alone in my bedroom. 

I have 2 friends and they are nice, but they both threw big parties full of people for their 30th and I feel insecure about not having more people to celebrate with. I feel like my 2 friends pity me for having such a lame bday compared to them, which just makes me feel like a charity case. 

I've decided this is the last year I will celebrate my birthday (tbh the best gift I'm giving myself). But I don't know what to do for the big 3-0.

Some ideas: I would love to book a flight to somewhere cheap and just escape for a 2 night get-away. (I have decent savings, but I don't know if I can justify this expense since I'm unemployed). 

I want to go see a theater performance or go to the spa, but those things are expensive so my friends would probably not join me and that means celebrating alone. I want to say I can handle that, but tbh I would feel very sad going to the theatre alone on my 30th bday. 

Basically, I can go get blackout drunk with these 2 friends at some shitty bar to bury my feelings. Or I can dip into my savings and do something I will enjoy, but I will feel plagued by guilt for spending money when I don't have a job.

But today something happened, something so trivial I almost feel ridiculous mentioning it : my washing machine broke down. I'm not the manual type, so whenever I have something to repair, I usually call a friend. Today he was busy, so I sat down on my sofa and broke down and started sobbing.

I never cried when my last (latest?) relationship ended, and it was as if all the repressed feelings suddenly came to the surface.

I’ve never been able to find that kind of happiness with someone else, and it honestly feels like they’re rubbing it in my face without trying. That and I just don’t come there to socialize. I go there to exercise. When I have friends get married, I am genuinely happy for them, but deep down it takes me back to the same place of frustration. It always brings up the question I ask myself all the time: Why is it so easy for them but not for me?

One thing I really hate is meeting girls who are excessively flirty or friendly to me, but they have a boyfriend. This happens all the time. I do not like playing games. I’m not interested in someone who is not available, so why waste my time? Don’t put your hand on my shoulder or try to hold my hand or stare at me with puppy dog eyes if you already have a boyfriend. I actually would like to find somebody, but I have a hard time taking anyone seriously because all they seem to want to do is play games and use me for attention. 

When I’m in public walking, women try so hard to get me to notice them. I will be going one direction, they’ll be coming the other way, but I don’t even look straight at them. They’ll do the hair flip, they’ll stare at me, they’ll start talking even louder to their friend, but I just keep walking. They want so badly for me to acknowledge them, but I’m just not going to give them that. I know it’s rude, but I’m so used to being burned that I just take it out on these strangers.

On and off, I’ve been this way for about 6 years. Only been here 2 months, but I’m already pretty convinced I’m not going to find someone in my current city.

This might seem like a small thing but she’s gotten more and more distant over the past months. We used to hang out all the time, but now that she moved in with another friend she’s completely stopped contacting me. I’ve tried to reach out several times but it never goes anywhere.
It’s like she doesn’t need me, she has replaced me. 

Every time she gets drunk she sends me at least  a snap of her being her drunk self.
But this time she didn’t. She spammed her new friends.
I know this because I’m in a group chat with her and a couple other friends, where she talked about going out and asking if she spammed anyone last night. 

It seems like such an insignificant thing, but with everything else that’s been happening, I’m scared that she’s replacing me and out-right forgetting me.

She used to text me every day, I used to text her and get actual responses, now she never contacts me and I barely get a reply.

 Loneliness comes in many shapes or forms. Mine takes the face of Frankenstein in my head. I feel like I'm a stitched up pieces of different people. I could be this person. Or this person. But I want to be this person. But I keep going back on being this person that's also a part of me... I hate these pieces of myself. I try so hard to love them...but I find myself only wanting to scream at them all. These pieces of me is what makes me feel lonely. It's all these things that happened to me and all the things I do...it's like every fiber of my body is screaming for help but no one understands what it is I am, or what I'm saying.


The worst part of it is I want them to understand so badly. I want people to know me, I really do. But no one is actually feeling what I say. They just see words and put it together and there it is again. Frankenstein reborn. But I swear I am someone. I swear I am more then words...I have feelings.

Example 1, we liked to smoke. I bought a lot of stuff for us to use. I didn’t have to, but I felt like they wouldn’t like me anymore if I didn’t do it. Example 2, I gave them a key to my apartment to watch it while I went back to my hometown to take care of my dad because he broke his leg. They never gave it back, and they started coming over regardless of whether I was there or not. I couldn’t come home and just rest without them being there. I couldn’t go to sleep. They told me to kick them out if I wanted to but it felt like an empty offer. I don’t know. Example 3, they did everything they could to spend every free moment with each other. They go to stores, go eat, and I would go with them sometimes, but it always seemed clear that the gold standard for them was going without me. They would talk about parties and plans I wasn’t invited to right in front of my face. I would find myself so unhappy after they left. 

Yesterday night was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I have a potassium deficiency that gets to me when I’m very tired or dehydrated and it caused me to pass out, and all they did was watch me get up, say “you want some water?”, tell me to go to bed, and leave in the course of 20 minutes.

So today, I packed up all the things that were theirs in a box, handed it to them, and asked for my key. I was so angry I couldn’t say a word except asking for my key. They promptly left. I texted them everything I had been feeling over the past few months, and they proceeded to take to Twitter and subtweet that I permanently lost “my only true friends”. We got into a screaming match over FaceTime. I told them once I quit smoking, I assumed the friendship was over. Why? That’s all we ever did. The friendship revolved around it. I didn’t get invited to the other things they did. The majority of my time with them was spent in my own apartment, just smoking and smoking. If I chose not to smoke they would take their stuff and smoke somewhere else, and I’d never see them again. And they called me ignorant and irrational for saying these things. I hung up on them. 

This is one of many friendships I’ve had that have ended badly, but it’s by far the nastiest demise I’ve ever experienced. I feel like I never make the right choices. I don’t know who I am anymore.

589,ftl4438,1574549881,1,"At a young age I developed social fears and isolated myself. Then I turned to the internet and I've been secluded for years. Now that I left high school and college I'm just full on isolated and have no idea what skills I need. I know what my goal is but there are around three major pieces to the puzzle missing to get there.

My isolation fuels my social phobia, social phobia fuels isolation. Isolation leads to lost social cues, lost social cues leads to social phobia and feeling like my conversations get nowhere. My ability to ever feel part of an ""in group"" is virtually gone, so a majority of my interactions with people make me feel like I'm some sort of alien.

Then there's the societal aspect. So many people like me? What if I become popular and my life just ""gets back together"", what about the others? Because I'm in this state right now, I know how it feels. If I ever escape, I will still remember how it felt. Is this a societal issue or just a personal one? Before the last of my friend group dissolved, all of them had a similar issue.

I don't know how widespread isolation is but I am willing to bet it is not only massive but higher than any other time in history. We'd need some kind of massive cultural reset to fix not just this but many other issues. In short however, the only thing I can do now is find out how to restore the cues that have been worn away from this isolation for so long.",lonely,It's an endless cycle,2019-11-24 09:58:01

I wish there was another woman that could fill that void and make me forget my past. I have such a strong desire for that attention that even when I’m in a relationship and love someone I still crave more. I don’t actively seek it, but when I happen to stumble upon it I just shut down everything and my brain kicks into “receive this attention” mode. 

I have lost gfs and even a wife over this idiotic flaw of mine. Idk why I can’t refuse attention from the opposite sex. I’m not talking friendly women and what time. People that are genuinely interested in me and want to get to know me and be in a relationship. I crave that feeling constantly. Even when in a relationship I crave it from more people.

She said she wants to be friends for now, which is fine because she promised me, “I promise on my life I won’t move on, it’s only still us, I just need time.” But ever since then, she barely texts me, sometimes will leave me on read, I’ll swallow my pride and triple text sometimes even more because I’m scared, sometimes we’ll have a small conversation but she’ll cross the line of a “friend” and I’ll tell her about it and she says “I’m sorry. I’m just so used to doing these things with you.” I always remind her that I still love her so much, but she never really says it back. My thoughts are the what’s hurting me most, I always think she’s found someone else and just doesn’t have the courage to tell me, or she just doesn’t want me anymore, or she’s giving me obvious hints by not texting me or calling me anymore that she doesn’t want to talk to me but I ignore them because I’m so emotionally attached to her.

604,OriginalGnomeHunter,1574540856,1,"  

I was supposed to go on a date tonight. The firs one in a long time. And the first one in an even longer time that I was actually looking forward to. Not just some random encounter with whoever would agree to meet up with me, that I had to drag myself out the door for, just to get some adult interaction to keep myself from going completely insane. Some apathetic right swipe on tinder just because no one else was biting. No, this was, for once, with a woman that seemed genuinely interesting to me. I was actually excited about this one. But alas, it fell through.

So here I am. Again. Sitting in the glow of the screen, next to my dog, feeling the loneliness fall upon me like a heavy blanket of self-despair that just leaves me incapacitated and unable to muster up the energy to do anything meaningful.

So, I guess this night will end up like all the others. Alone. Siting in the couch watching some crap on Netflix I've seen a hundred times before. Constantly checking my phone just in case I've missed a message from someone... I never have... I can't even remember the last time I received a message from anyone who just wanted to know how I'm doing, or whether I'd be up for doing something. I could try taking the initiative and call up someone in my ever-shrinking group of friends, if I can even call them that anymore, to see if they want to do anything... No... Wait... I already did that... They are, as usual, to busy.

I just realized, I have absolutely no single friends. I guess it makes sense then. They're spending time with their families. Besides, why would they want some sad divorcee around, reminding them that their happiness can go down the shitter at any moment. 

My least favorite holiday of the year is coming up. New-years-eve. A night I dread. A night where everyone is out celebrating and having a good time. And, once again, I have absolutely nothing to do. Last year I celebrated the night with my kids, so at least I could tell myself that even if I had been invited to something, I probably wouldn't have been able to go anyway. This year they'll be with their mother. I wonder what my excuse will be then. I'll probably end up sitting at home, curtains closed, so no one can see the sadness inside, getting drunk, watching TV, wallowing in my self-pity. The clock will reach midnight. The spam-texting of well-wishings and 'Happy New Years' will commence. But all I'll receive is silence.

I don't think anybody really knows me. Why would they? I've become a master of putting on the brave face when I'm out. I don't know how much longer I can keep up this charade. But then again, what's the alternative? 

I just noticed the posting-rules in the sidebar. *2. Behave like you would in real life...* Right... In that case I'd might as well delete this whole thing and tell you all about how great things are going.

What's the alternative? Actually telling people how I'm feeling? I don't think so... People generally don't want to invest their time in someone unless they're being entertained. I mean, you might be able to get away with letting out small glimpses of yourself from time to time. But unless you're able to snap right back out of it, and keep on partying, you're not worth the investment. Fake it till you make it, right? Well... I'm getting tired of faking it.

I'm a very introverted person. Not shy. Just introverted. For those of you who think that those two are the same thing, I have to say, they are not. To give an example: I was recently in a group situation. Conversations were flowing. I was, as usual, the fly on the wall, who no one were really paying any attention to. At some point the conversation turned to a very sexual topic. Allot of people in the group were left red-faced and embarrassed to say anything. But, for once, I had something to say. I spoke my mind, and I were celebrated for it. You see the difference? For once, just for a few seconds, I was the center of attention, the life of the party. And I loved it... I asked myself: How can I be this person all the time? A person who is entertaining, who people pay attention to, who people want to be around? Would I even be able to endure being that kind of person?... I had no answer. I still don't.

Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm just not worth peoples time. Maybe I'm just not interesting. I try to connect with people, but I always just end up drawing a blank. I recently went on a week-long study trip with my university. We would be close to each other for a whole week. There would be a bit of drinking involved. I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to make some connections. People would be a bit freer. I would be a bit freer. Free to get out of my own damn head. But yet, nothing. My mind was numb. I've heard people describing how they, in social situations, panic, and can't think of anything to say. But it wasn't that. My mind was just blank... Nothing... I didn't even try to think of anything to say. A few even came up to me and tried to make some sort of connection. But still, nothing... What the fuck is wrong with me? Why don't I grab the opportunities that's presented right in front of me? I hate myself for this.

Do I think to highly of myself? Should I just take whatever I can get? As a friend? As a companion? As a lover? Are whoever I can get to interact with me a reflection of my worth? Or is this just it? Is this my life now? Is this as good as it's going to get? Should I just embrace the loneliness and accept that this is my life now?

616,alan13446,1574536166,1,"Let me tell you the story of a boomer, 61, and the clusterfuck life that today made me a lonely old man.

My dad was in jail for embezzlement the day I was born in 1958 in Turkey. My mom may have been his whore. They divorced when I was 6. Those first 6 years, we moved a lot, skipping out on rent. After their divorce, I attended 4 schools in Grade 1. Then I was sent to Germany to be with my dad who had immigrated there. The next 3 years, I spent in several more schools plus a horrible year at a boarding school/orphanage. Then back to mom in Turkey for 5 months. Born a tall blue eyed blonde kid in a land of shorted dark haired dark eyed people, I was always an outcast.

Summer of 1968, sent to NYC to be with dad who had immigrated there now. Skinny pasty white blonde kid, we lived in the Stapleton district of Staten Island, where pretty much everyone was black. Got my ass kicked too many times to recall. Then 3 years later, sent to Canada to be with mom and step dad who had immigrated there.

All in all, 15 schools in 4 countries in 9 years. I never fit in. Also, above average IQ and hyper-vigilance where I would spot any anomaly. In high school, everyone knew everyone. I was once again the outsider who spoke a terrible NYC black ghetto dialect. Worst acne you could imagine, plus alcoholic narcissistic mom and angry at the world and everything and everyone in it stepdad, no friends were allowed in THEIR house, so I kept to myself.

Finished high school, then college, met someone, got married at 25. Small town Canadian family, because I didn't talk the talk of beer, hockey, sports, trucks and other mundane lowbrow rural chatter, I was shunned. 25 years later the marriage finally ended in 2007.

Several failed relationships after that for which I will take the blame, take the fall. It wasn't that I said or did anything bad. There was no violence or abuse, no drugs and theft or cheating, no, it was because when in a social gathering with my partner and her family/friends, the smalltalk that took place, I never fit in. They all have this peculiar way of talking. a strange dialect of simpletons. Plus the general topics they talk about are beyond boring, simple and idiotic, always about how much they drunk, smoked up, got broke, sports and who hit who and got arrested. The ex girlfriends got embarrassed because I couldn't make the trivial smalltalk of her peers, and eventually found excuses to end the relationships/ Each is now with a man who talks about drinking, sports, pot, fishing and trucks, and they all fit in. The herd is complete once again.

The people who are capable of better conversation, more intellectual, I don't fit into their world either because I am not of their class. So, stuck in limbo, not part of the country of my birth or residence, I never fit in.

Today, I have my 2 sons, 26 and 32, who rarely call me because they were turned against me from a lifetime of deception and lies by their mother who never matured past the age of 12. My dad is half a world away, and that's it for all the family I have in this world.

When the marriage ended, my friends all scattered, as no one wants to invite a single man to any events or social gatherings.

Bottom line, if you didn't fit in at 10, 20, 30, it doesn't get easier. If we were capable of climbing out of this hole, don't you think we would have by now?

Not fitting in, the loneliness is the worst. People shun you because after they hear you say 3 sentences that isn't like what the herd says, they won't have anything to do with you.

All I wanted was to be loved, to be held, to be cared for, the same way I loved, held and cared for you. All I wanted was to be taken seriously, to matter to you, to belong to and have a family. I tried my best, I did the only thing I knew how.

Shunning and rejecting someone for being different takes no effort.

To understand and respect and allow someone who doesn't fit into your life takes hard work and commitment.

Today, whenever I encounter someone ""weird"" that others walk away from, I talk to them, laugh with them, help them best I can. because they are me, they are us.",lonely,Sometimes the loneliness is set from birth.,2019-11-24 06:09:26

618,KRokossovsky,1574532479,1,"I'm awkward, ugly, shy loser with basically 0 friends. The person who has been my best friend for years isn't replying to my messages anymore and over the past few years we've drifted apart. Recently I've been opening up to him about a lot of my concerns and I think he's been overwhelmed and has rightly cut me out. All of his friends are better than me and aren't fucked.

2 months ago I started university and while the first week was good (I went to lots of events, went clubbing for the first time, tried talking to people on my course) I'm left with less than I started with. Firstly I don't have any friends from before uni anymore. Secondly, I talk much less to my flatmates and I think some of them hate me. Thirdly I stopped going to the societies/groups I joined because I was too stressed about not having enough time to work. Fourthly, I haven't managed to make any friends here. Whenever people talk to me it's either because they are the kind of person to talk to people (and they subsequently stop talking after they discover what I'm like), or I start talking to them and they keep listening to me because they're too polite to tell me to go away. They both try to avoid me, never initiate conversations, never come up to me to say hi etc. I've given up, I don't feel like going out to bars/clubs and getting drunk and nobody ever shows any interest in me. When I try to talk to people I fail horribly, nobody cares about the stuff I find interesting, I can't hold a conversation for the life of me.",lonely,No chance of making friends or finding love,2019-11-24 05:07:59

I’ve been watching videos of left wing vs right wing, trump this antifa that I don’t really care about the specifics but I’ve been feeding off their hate for each other. I know it doesn’t fill the void completely but I don’t know what to do anymore. When I think of love I can only think of how far I am from everybody else. When I think of happiness I only seem to get jealous because I used to be happy too. When I notice all the hate in the world though, I think of how I now have hate too. 

I don’t like feeling like this. It feels like I’m feeding a monster inside of me that wants nothing but hatred and pain for the world. It feels like the anti me because for my whole life up until recently, I’ve wanted nothing short of world peace. I’ve spent the past 24 years doing my best to help other and be kind and considerate.

The problem being, she’s still hung up on another guy from prior to her meeting me and I understand, I can’t change how she feels nor do I want her to do anything but follow her heart. She’s made it clear before that if not for him we could have something. But last night after a party and it was just us, I almost just broke out in tears because regardless of us clearly having something special, and her knowing that, she’ll talk about going on dates with others guys from Tinder and shit. 

I’m not obsessed with her by any means, I understand space is space and the only way to get a girl to continue to like you is to fuck off at appropriate moments but I do really need her, she’s so special to me and I just know that heartbreak is coming. She’ll move on from him, but for some fucking reason it won’t be me. Maybe I’m overthinking it, maybe I’m wrong but I cannot for the life of me get that thought out of my head and it’s going to ruin my chances with her piece by piece. 

I know I should enjoy it while she’s here, but the thought of her finding someone else right now kills me. I’ve learned so much about her and done my best to be super caring, and now I’m afraid I’ve done too much and I should just cut myself off a little bit to avoid too much of a heartbreak.

Recently that habit has hit me the hardest it has in a while. A year ago I was just recovering from a breakup that rattled me hard, and that still kinda sticks to now, it wasn't aggressive, it was more just, she needed away from being in a relationship, which i get, although it doesnt help sooth the hurt nonetheless. I hoped we would continue talking bcs, regardless of relationship, she was an amazing person to be around, and that connection is sorely missed, I hoped that by now we would have reconnected


Today, I'm several days past having graduated high school, theres been no conversation between us since, and now that school is done a lot of my friends are taking long needed holidays to other countries. I'm not worse than I was last year, I think ive bettered myself, but theres still this just, hollow feeling of a lack of connection


I'm now facing my first year free from school, and one that could take two paths in a social context. I either simply stick to the small circle I have, who will be harder to contact due to branching paths, because of my fear to expose myself to new people, or I could pull myself out once more and just, speak to new people


I guess this is a rant with two purposes: 
1. Just simply to dump my feelings anywhere, and get it somewhere out of my head
2. If anyone here is down just with chatting, chilling, ect, shoot me a message, I'd love to talk and meet new people, and itll be a first small step towards making sure that the future im looking to next year takes a more positive path,

I never really got lonely in my life. My emotions used to be pretty dull and never really felt any kind of sadness.

Ok, I'm lying. I always start sentences like this whenever I do a post about me feeling bad.. I think I've been actually pretty fucked my whole life and hate to admit it because  I feel weak for doing so.. My relationship has been pretty much falling apart lately and decided to do a move, which turned out to be the right one, but my girlfriend has admitted to me that she liked another guy that she never even spoke to and doesn't even know name of. She said it may be due to her feelings forcing her to like someone because she was just feeling miserable in the relationship. 

She said she doesn't like the guy anymore. (Can I trust you? Yes you can. Ok, I'm glad)

Ah, I'm just lonely. She is pretty much the only person I have besides my two other friends that I never hang out with, but deeply care for.

My girlfriend has recently enrolled into a new school and I already saw her posting photos on instagram again and making stories of her replying to other people. People keep telling her how cute and pretty she is and she doesn't mind. I have already told her that I don't like this, but she decided not to care. This whole post is a bit messy. 

I couldn't sleep this night, although she has told me after a long time that she loves me again and that she likes me more and that she is happy again. I still couldn't sleep the whole night. I have no one to be around currently, I'm just alone in my room. I wish I could be near her. I tried to hack all of her social media accounts, which is pretty distrusting of me, ended up only hacking one that she doesn't even use... (Yeah yeah, I know I'm pretty useless and hopeless as well..) I don't know, I don't know if I want to trust her. I really want to trust her, I just hate the fact that so many people are now texting her on fucking instagram bullshit cunt crap social media.. It's not the fault of the social media tho. Maybe nothing even is wrong and I'm just out of my mind consumed by anger. My whole life, I had about 5 friends. Now I have 2.  I call a lot during the day and tell jokes with friend number one and with friend number two I share my deepest secrets.. It's more than a blessing to have people like this, but I need physical contact. I've been just so fucking lonely my whole life, constantly abandoned by the people that I loved, making me close off from people and stay in my own head and use the excuse of something being ""illogical"" whenever people trying to connect with me. I don't know, I'm not some  mastermind motherfucker but I do have the ability to foresee future actions just by thinking about the worst scenario that could occur. It just saddens me that it's the true. I don't want things being like that, I don't want to see the painful truth.

This post isn't even supposed to be about my relationship or anything. but I need to speak my mind out somewhere. I don't even know if this is the right place, I just typed ""lonely"" in reddit.

I am a loner, don't have much going on in my social life. I prefer it that way, but once I have some people that I love,  It's not just easy for me to let them go. 

I have started crying again lately. After years of emotional apathy I started to constantly sit down in the corner of my room and cry. 

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. It just pains me so much. Being in this fucking room alone. I don't need many friends, I just want someone in my life that would ask me how my fucking day was, how am i feeling, someone that is interested in me, my interests, opinions... Fuck my life.

Recently I have enrolled into a new school, I'm there for about 3 months and only spoke to about 3 people. 

One person has asked me if I want to hang out and smoke weed with his friend group. ( I pretended to be dumb not knowing the slang word for weed in my language and declined.) I just hate this stuff, I hate alcohol and cigarettes, drugs.. I don't want to be involved in that.

The second person has also asked me about drugs .

And the third person I spoke to because I was scared of getting a bad grade so I just came up to the kid with best grades in class and asked how I should solve a certain physics problem.

Besides that, nothing. I'm not even sure if I want to talk to them, I don't need school friends. I can see some people just telling me to come up to them and say Hi!, but I don't wanna. The whole 3 months everyone came up to each other, even people that sat alone and quiet had people come up to them, but no one came up to me. 

I don't know, I was told that I appear cold and distant tho I'm just like everybody else.

I couldn't sleep this night. I was just constantly locked in the future, trying to predict what will happen today, tomorrow and how everything is eventually going to break up again.

I don't want everything in my life to just fall apart and I know I should take action, but how am I supposed to take action on something that is inevitable. I can't just control other people, I'm bothered. I don't even want to think like this, I just want to be happy. I want someone that I can hug, kiss, I want to feel the warmth of being happy, safe, cared, treasured, valued... I can switch to my "" cold jerk mode "" where I'm just a cynical motherfucker to everyone and have 0 people around me, but I don't want that. I don't want to be alone, listening to depressing music, playing videogames for 14 hours a day, ruining my health and future..

I just need someone and I know no one is coming to help me.  I want to be rescued. I wish everything in my life, the past 5 years was just a dream. A bad dream.. Sadly the way I'm typing on my keyboard, the way I learn, consume knowledge.. Just seems too real to be a dream.  I want to close off and be stuck in  my own daydream but I think I would go insane eventually. I just want a single person that would care, besides my two friends. I just want to be loved.. 

Love is pretty much like an apple that is rotten inside. It's not really an usual symptom of apple appearing so pretty on the outside and being completely rotten on the inside, so this could also be compared to an apple being parasyted on by a worm. 

You really like that apple, it's so nice and appears so juicy , you take a bite, but then you actually see what it's like.

I feel heartbroken, lonely, crushed, pointless and confused in what I should do.

652,throwawayrlonely,1574493430,1,"I have anxiety and depression my whole life, and undiagnosed Autism until about 6 months ago. The only thing that I feel like made it possible for me to ever make friends is mimicking people, being productive/helpful and good at drawing... ten years ago. I meet/met a lot of people in my life, but don't connect with them. Now I am reclusive.

I am married with the perfect husband, and he has all these friends and a family he's close with and I'm just like... existing next to him. He is great, but he can't be all my friendship needs and we run out of things to do and to talk about.

It just feels like I'm surrounded by other people's friends and other people's family, and they're really funny and nice to me (some genuinely, some out of obligation) but I don't connect with them. I try not to be around them, I stay in my room. Seeing them have fun with my husband makes me feel sad that I ""don't have friends"" even though there's all these nice people around me.

I'm starting to wonder if it's actually a neurological problem: it's like I can't have feelings for people, or like I can't care, sometimes I'm disgusted by people just being normal people: but I'm still SO LONELY. There are about three or four people my whole life who made me feel anything besides indifference (my husband is one) but everyone else is like an alien.

I try to find a therapist, but they hear ""Adult with Autism"" and they YEET me to 'other therapists:' i.e. disconnected lines, practices that no longer exist, therapists who no longer practice, or aren't taking patients, or who only deal with children with Autism.

663,NuclearSteeze,1574487925,1,"Maybe the best way to start this is a backstory about me (sorry for the long read):

I am a 23 year old guy. I moved to the USA from India when I was 2 years old (so I am a u.s citizen and westernized in every way other than the fact that I can speak Hindi and eat Indian food more often than the average American).

I have always been a loner. I tried to be cool and make friends in elementary school but I would always get teased and bullied. It was worse in middle school. So, in high school, I became quieter. I was still teased, but not nearly as much, because I would just keep to myself, assuming nobody would want to be my friend and that I would just have to deal with it. Well, as a result, this led to me being totally socially awkward and underconfident into college as well. I should also add that this whole time I have been having a porn addiction. I went to a good Engineering college, but I had no social life (like 0 friends) the whole time and an awful GPA (literally just enough to graduate but I failed so many of my major courses. I literally barely made it). Of course, you gotta have a good GPA to get internships and to get a full time position, companies look at your experience (I had no internships other than this research thing I kinda did at the university).

So, when I graduated last May 2019 with a bachelor's, at 23, I had the following:

1) no friends
2) never been on a date or any form of intimacy with anyone 
3) I was broke and lived with my parents because I was unemployed



Obviously, I was thinking about ending it all (my professor said I should speak with the college therapists because he thought I might have depression. Maybe he was right but I never have been one to care about my mental health. I just tell myself to stop being so pitiful and deal with it). I had 0 confidence in myself for a whole 6 months as I made futile attempts searching for a job. I ate so much that I became medically obese.

Anyways, something really good happened for me recently. I got a job. A job that is damn near my dream job. Like it works in the exact industry that I have dreamed of working in since a young boy (but gave up on thinking it was just a fantasy) and it pays well (not 6 figures or anything but still pretty solid). I have been working for about a week now. It's a ton of work (more than 40 hours a week for sure) but I really enjoy it even when i get mentally exhausted. 

But here is the thing, despite having this great job, I still have this void in me. I think it is because I still don't come out of my shell. I still hate myself on some level. My team's director invited me to go out with some of the employees for happy hour and walking around downtown. I told him maybe, but I dont think I am going. I think I am just going to lay in my room being a loner as always. I just assume the worst. I have tried going out with people, but I always just end up being kind of left out because I am afraid of involving myself in anything because I never feel like I am truly welcome. 

And of course, I do want intimacy. I just think I will be one of those few people that will have to die without it (some people just go on without some things) but it makes me sad thinking about it. I do want a girlfriend, but I have never asked a girl out because I am too damn self-conscience (my body, my lack of a exciting personality). But I am a 23 year old virgin who has never kissed or dated so I feel like my ship has sailed since obviously women my age would want a a guy with experience (sure, there is that 0.001% that would be cool with it, but how on earth would I find them and, since there are so few, chances are high we might not even be compatible).

One thing I am working on is getting some hobbies. I will have to work some more to get the funds to do them, but that shouldn't be long. But here is the thing. No man is an island. I really was hoping that this lovely job would completely fill my void, but it hasn't. Because it's the weekend now, and I am back to my self-pity shit. Also the place I live in and work is a crowded downtown area, so I am just a loner in a crowd. I don't know how to build relationships, platonic or romantic, with anyone. I'm just ""cool"" to be around occasionally I guess.

Anyways, I feel like I am rambling now. So basically I want to know how to get out of my shell and stop feeling pathetic.",lonely,There Is A Void In Me I Don't Know How To Fill,2019-11-23 16:45:25

670,Ugh-Kid,1574479897,1,"Yo, so the last couple of weeks would've put me in the darkest mindset of my life (nothing major, like a death of a loved one) but for some reason I've been feeling the worst I've ever felt. I understand most of it's from substance abuse and me doing it to myself but it's genuinely the only thing I have to comfort me at this time and it's just been negative thoughts hitting me waves and waves. 

The waves of negativity that hit me are from; exams (fin 11 Nov), taking acid for the first time during a concert (14 Nov), my best mate moved across country after only knowing him for a short time (16), my favourite co worker is leaving soon and all my flatmates have left but 1. All this mixed with my lifestyle of never socialising (therefore having barely any friends, social skills or confidence) led me to have some sort of identity crisis during my acid trip and now I just hate myself more than ever.

I'm thinking of opening up to someone but I've only been able to shortlist 2 different people (all chicks as they're more comfortable to open up to for me). I've already asked my favourite co worker (Sunday) if I can open up to her which she said I could talk about anything to her at anytime. It's just that she seems so busy all the time and so cool that I don't want to annoy her as my problems are pretty basic/pathetic. I've seen her at work maybe 3 times since and the vibe just seems completely off since me asking her but maybe it's just me.

The 2nd is actually my previous flatmate that recently left. Now I barely talk(ed) to any of my flatmates (or anyone for that matter) which will make this one rather weird. She's a very in your face, very vocal person that's never had any filter and so trusting her with this would be my biggest fear. However she always seemed down to talk about dark mindsets so I'd say she'd take it very serious. But what's sketching me about this is that she might tell everyone I know (flatemate/s and the crew that I hang with) which I will be open to the idea of mentioning that when I'm ready I'm just not wanting to announce it to the world from the get go.

So fuxking sorry for the length of this shit but I was just wanting someones opinion/help on what I should do/how I should go about it. There's actually so much more layers I want to go over but I feel it'd be best communicating that face to face.

We were talking about hanging out this weekend, but she hasn't texted me back in three days now.

The shitty thing is, before I started talking to her I was in a decent place mentally, not really feeling too lonely, actually being pretty content and entertaining myself. Then I got on the app randomly one day, and started talking to her, and getting excited about meeting her and fantasizing about what could potentially happen. Now I feel worse than I have in a while.

The problem is, I know how to make friends. I can make friends. I can meet people. But there is something about me that throws people off and I never understood why. I have no childhood friends. Hell I have no friends at all lol. Any friends I have made in the past over time just lose interest. Stop taking to me as much, start avoiding hanging out with me, etc. The only friends I can make and 'keep' are online friends in gaming communities. This never felt *real* to me though.

I don't do anything to cause this reaction either, trust me. I've never been in fights in school, I can probably count on my fingers the amount of times I've argued with people, I'm very much a listener type of person, and gentle. I don't like conflict.

721,viinerid,1574447323,1,"So I haven’t had the easiest life, but I won’t go into all the details. 

Ever since I was very young we moved around a lot. I never got that stability in my life, or lasting friends. When I was 8 my family and I moved to Norway. It was a huge change for me, and I lost the, so to speak, only friend I had. Because of the language barrier I couldn’t get to know people, and I felt, just... I don’t know, different. 

I have always been a rather philosophical kid. Always enjoyed talking about deeper stuff and learning more about life. But because I realised how much shit there was in the world at an such young age, and because I also had a very very unstable family life, I started contemplating suicide at an age of 5 or 6. That’s just sick to think about. 

I eventually felt really depressed, which caused me to clam up. Because of the constant moving, language barrier and my “depression” I didn’t really develop any friendships that lasted.

At an age of 14 I started therapy for social anxiety. Later on at 16 I was diagnosed with clinical depression. The depression and anxiety made me stay in bed for days at a time, which again made my already weak friendships weaker. 

At one point though, I actually felt like I had a real friend. He was just so nice to me, and we clicked. Eventually we developed feelings for each other, but because of my anxiety making me scared, I fell into an hole of depression for a couple of weeks where I didn’t reply to any messages or calls. Eventually he realised there was no point, and gave up, and I understand why very well. I tried to apologise later when I was better, because I felt shit for just disappearing, but it was a lost cause. 

Now, I’m 19. Not shy nor introverted, but with very few friends/acquaintances. Whenever I talk to my therapist I lie about my friendships, because I feel so embarrassed by having none. In classes I sit alone, and I feel afraid for some reason. I feel so damn lonely, and even though I am so happy that my siblings don’t have to go through all the shit I do, it breaks my heart when I see them with their friends for some reason, because I know I don’t have that.

Even though I am not depressed anymore, I can’t feel completely happy, because I have no one to share it with.

I don’t know. Maybe I’m boring, or too weird, macabre even, or just annoying, and that’s the reason why I don’t have any friends, but... I just wish my life would have been different.",lonely,"I am so afraid, and embaressed",2019-11-23 05:28:43

As for myself, I'm 20 and my girlfriend of 3 years and 8-ish months broke it off with me a little bit ago. I'm still madly in love, but she is with someone else now.

I never realized how cold the bed is when they're not there. Even if they weren't sleeping beside me, I have the comfort of knowing they were out there.

She was my best friend. She was my first love, and now I lay awake at night, knowing I messed up, hoping I can fix it.

I don't think I can, but I will try. Everyone tells me to get over it. She's with someone else, so ""man the f*** up and move on"". But she was my life for all that I can remember. Maybe if I improve myself, I can be what I need to be to get her back.

I have a long road ahead of me, and I really want it to take me where I need to go. It would be so much easier if I could just fall asleep, and not wake up in the middle of the night, not knowing what to do.

737,HypedForever,1574435065,1,"I've been attempting to get the feeling of loneliness for a while now (to be exact, it's been 45 days). Within that time frame, I've attempted isolating myself from as much people contact as possible, including using us my 2 week paid vacation (for science!) and being in a hotel for those 2 weeks getting room service. Over the 2 weeks, I've calculated \~4 total minutes of total interactions (to get food). Every other minute was spent with just me and solo entertainment, like TV and whatnot. 

Although the entire experience was satisfying and I really enjoyed being alone the whole time, I hated it because I didn't get the results I was after at all. There could be a number of factors as to why I wasn't feeling lonely. It could be because I was expecting it, therefore, it didn't happen. 

Since this method of trying to self induce that feeling in me failed, I want to know if there's something else I'm missing. You can PM/DM me as well if you have any input that you wouldn't share in the comments, I'll appreciate it!",lonely,On my way to feeling lonely,2019-11-23 02:04:25

742,losergorlstacks,1574428647,1,"**HI**     (i'm probably going to post this everywhere :P) but i'm a bit of an introvert so naturally i don't get out much, therefore i get a bit lonely? and bored sometimes so  i'm trying to expand my \*non existing\* friend group (and i feel like it would be fun to have a group of friends to share memes with, talk about important stuff or just joke around, even to just talk to ig lol)  so i decided to start one! it doesn't really matter who you are as long as we've all got something in common. (I'm just starting this newly so no one would know each other and we can all be awkward together :P)   


**REQUIREMENTS**  
 I *don't really require anything lmao but it would be much easier if we all had a few things in common, I'll try to keep everything somewhat broad.*   


1. ***interest;*** if you like any of these: art, video games, reading/writing, dank memes, sleeping, eating, anime/manga, yt, animations, movie/series buff, true crime, comics(dc or marvel lol even bloody tintin)  mystery/fantasy, weird shit etc or {basically nerdy shit}   

2. ***age;*** we should all be somewhat around the same age (so its easier to relate) so maybe 18-25? its expandable, not to boomer level though :P  

3. ***please*** don't be overly sensitive or extremely judgmental, that's not big brain.  

4. you should be okay with **leaving reddit** to other platforms.   


**How this would work.**  
My plan would be to start off here before moving to discord and potentially other platforms (if i can flipping figure out how to make a good server) we would obviously have movie nights and voice calls and stuff if we all get close to each other and vibe. We would be a nice support system who can still roast each other.  I want everyone to get to know everyone so maybe only 7-15? people   


**POTENTIAL FRIENDS**  
If you're somewhat interested ***send me a message telling me about yourself*** ( make it JUICY because it will go into the discord server so people can get an idea of who everyone is) If you don't know what to write ( name, age, interests and a fun fact about yourself) should do it. I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU.  


**P.S; If this flops, i'll be mega sad. If i get good feedback we'll  start today :)**",lonely,18f F4R let's make an online friend group? :),2019-11-23 00:17:27
743,bluwjay,1574424202,1,"I'm 18 and i'm crying so hard right now. I haven't had a single friend or even an acquaintance in a year and a half, and in the entire 18 years of my life, i've never had anyone i could talk about my feelings with. Nobody has ever truly understood me.

The only people i have around me is my little brother who's autistic, which means we don't really have any common interests. My dad, who is just loud and annoying all of the time. He's not necessarily a bad parent, but i don't really like him most of the time, and i always try to avoid him. My mum is the only person i kind of get along with, but anytime i've told her something personal she just gets mad or doesn't understand me. Those are the only 3 people that i talk to.

I dropped out of high school a year and a half ago because i couldn't handle it. I had started cutting myself and i also started having suicidal thoughts and i started fantasising about killing my teachers. My mum got mad at me when i told her i needed to leave school (i didn't tell her why though because i didn't want her to think i was crazy). After i left, i stopped cutting and i stopped having violent thoughts, but recently those thoughts have started to come back and i'm so scared because i don't want to hurt myself or anyone else.

I spend all my time by myself in my bedroom because i have no reason to leave the house. I have really bad acne scars which makes me hate the way i look. I also have bad anxiety, so much that i'm really afraid to even post this to reddit because i'm afraid people will say mean things to me. Some people have online friends, but not only am i afraid to talk to people face to face, i'm also really nervous when messaging people.

I tried getting a job but i just couldn't do it. It was so hard and i hated it for the same reasons that i hated school. I have astronomical aspirations though. My life goals are so huge that i feel like i can't tell anyone otherwise they'll think i'm crazy. I love making music and art so much but it's really hard to do anything creative when you're depressed.

The thing i hate most about this world is the fact that everyone feels like they have to hide their true feelings. Why do i have to go into the bathroom to cry? How messed up is it that i don't want to have a mental breakdown in public because i'm afraid that i'll ruin someone else's day? It's not fair. If someone says how are you, why do i have to tell them i'm good instead of telling them the truth? If i tell people things are going bad, they're just going to judge me for it.

The thing that triggered this big post, was me seeing that schoolies was happening. It's a big thing in Australia where high school kids go out partying, and doing drugs, and having sex, and having fun and it made me realise just how pathetic my life was. I never even went anywhere during my high school years, let alone went to a party. I've always wanted to try party drugs and i've never even had my first kiss yet. 
But the part that makes me so jealous, is that they get to go out and have fun with their friends while i have no idea how to even make friends in the first place. Everyone i see who's around my age i instantly don't get along with. I've never met a teenager with my type of personality before. Maybe it's because every teenager who's like me also never leaves the house.

Usually when i feel a big emotional meltdown coming, i'll go to my bedroom, close the door, and listen to music until i calm down, but i'm staying in a motel with my parents and my brother right now, so i don't have that luxury.

Anyways, if you read this far, thank you very much. I know some people will probably call me a pathetic crybaby, but writing all of this made me feel a little better.
Basically the one thing i need in this world to be happy is just ONE person who loves and understands me, and who won't judge me for my feelings. A hug would be nice too :)

749,littlebabyfatgirl,1574409078,1,"I have selective mutism and haven’t had a friend irl since like 5th grade. I’ve tried making online friends but i’m way too shy. I’ve been active on the internet for as long as I remember. I have 3 reddit accounts, each one being more anonymous than the other. But I spend most of my time on twitter.

Reddit kinda sucks for making friends, at least in my experience. I get daily messages from pedophiles asking for my snapchat and discord. Maybe i’ll get the occasional “hey i saw your post you wanna talk” or “what’s up” but i suck at responding and never know what to say. It’s much easier to talk to people on twitter. 

I’m 16 and when I finally have someone who talks to me they’re like 19+. That doesn’t bother me personally but it would probably bother them. I never give away my age on twitter. I don’t want people to go away when they find out how old I am.

A lot of times when I get a message from someone on twitter I won’t know how to respond or i’m too scared to. There’s some people where in my head i’m like “damn i really wanna be your friend i’ll respond to anything you send me” but those people have mostly left. I’m never the first person to send a message cause it’s too scary.

We click though, with everything. Inseparable. If only time lines would....LINE UP! lol they say you should date your best friend. And I 100% agree, but what do you do when your best friend has found someone? She is happy with him, and I wont get in the way of that. 

Hence the saying, nice guys finish last. Well, I hope you are sleeping well in the room down the hall from me. Time for this guy to stop holding on. And move on. She will always be my friend. I have that.

756,throwaway755403,1574401671,1,"I was taking a shower and was just remembering my old friendships. Early last year i was a part of this little movement thing started by 2 friends. The goal was to basically encourage people to write letters of appreciation to eachother. The person receiving the letter should only open it when they are having a bad time and it would remind them that they are cared for. The movement didnt last long considering that everyone involved was in highschool and busy.

I really supported the message and was the graphic designer for all the social media stuff. Even after everyone stopped pitting effort into spreading the message, i still thought it was an amazing idea. Eventually i put my own anxieties aside and wrote 2 letters, 1 for each of my 2 closest friends. I poured my heart in soul into them and hoped that when they do end up opening it, it would make them feel a little better. I got a response from one friend thanking me and never heard from the other. 
 
During my shower i realized that i never received a letter. I know its wrong to do things and expect something in return but i would have loved to get my own letter. There have been so many instances where i needed one, and yet i dont have one to read. Now i only have one friend, all my other friends stopped talking to me after we graduated. My closest friend of 6 years seemed to just forget about me. Ill never get a letter back from her... 

But if im being honest, im still waiting for my own letter. It seems like everyone involved in the movement got at least one letter. Idk why i didnt.

771,vladysnepo,1574393841,1,"I had a online relationship with a girl I met online on a Discord server. We chatted a lot and often through video calls, and my relationship with her felt amazing, having somebody I could talk to and be completely open with. I was a shut-in at the same time, a third time university drop-out because I often got bored and incredibly lonely at my university. I haven't had meaningful friends for ages, but spending time with her was always more than enough to make me feel whole.

I wanted to make something real out of this bond I had with her, so I worked a part-time job to save up money to finally meet her this last summer. I live in Canada, and she lives in Australia, so budgeting for the trip was a nightmare, but I was determined to meet her in person. Things in the last few months got worse with her, as she held everything wrong I did against me, even though I was forgiving to her whenever she slighted me.

It finally came time to the trip, and she was telling me things about some new friends she met in person. I had a bad feeling about these conversations, but decided to trust her that she wouldn't do anything to hurt me. Turns out during my flight to Australia, she had fallen for some guy, and was dishonest about being in a relationship with me. I met her the first day in Australia, and we met. For just 5 minutes, but she looked uncomfortable around me, and I felt my heart sink. She left soon after and broke up with me over text. I was devastated. I didn't bother to stay anymore, and took the first flight back home.

She messages me about how life's so much better now, that she no longer felt unstable and miserable around me, how she was in love with her new boyfriend, how her family approves of him, and how she feels motivated again with her studies. I was really hurt, hearing that from her, how quickly she turned against me. I'm still hurting sometimes now.

I lost a relationship that genuinely made me happy, my first girlfriend and relationship ever. I have very little experience with women, but I haven't even gone as far as to hug one. But she was my everything to me, and those few months afterwards left me in total darkness. Who does that? It seems for cruel and inhumane, to create and bond and then quickly destroy it for somebody more convenient and better than I.

Things have changed now. I go to the gym, workout and I feel a bit better. Dieting to reduce my weight. Going to college now in a program I really accel in. But I still feel like a huge part of me is missing. I would often just spend my free time gaming, but now I joined this Meetup app to meet new people. Yet I can't seem to find meaningful friends. I don't really know how. I don't want to give up yet, but each time I feel lonely and left questioning my own worth and if I can ever find that burning passion in me again like I had for this relationship.

What I know is that I want to move on, and learn to be okay being single, happy and content with my life. But it's really hard, because I'm a very envious person, even come off as cold or hostile to others. I'm really bad with finding the right people and making meaningful friendships. I'm not asking for many friends, just ones that are good for me. I also want to learn how to create social connections and bonds, especially starting from scratch, having been isolated for 3 years. I keep going to different group. How can I remain patient and not get discouraged? I really want to change things for the better and find meaningful friends and hopefully one day a special somebody that can make me feel alive. My ""strong alone"" philosophy is breaking down, and I am having a hard time maintaining it.

I just need advice on how I can remain optimistic and continue to progress with positive changes. Maybe even advice on what I can do to further improve myself or social skills. Thank you for reading.",lonely,"Needing Advice, on Staying Motivated to Change Where I am Now",2019-11-22 14:37:21

775,TheFlyingFry,1574392501,1,"I apologize if the heading is confusing. Long story short, my old group of friends excommunicated me after I refused to give 7 dollars to one of them as part of an agreement we arranged for a bonfire that I didn’t go to bc I was incredibly ashamed of my acne that day. The 7 dollars was for these skewers that my friend asked if i could split with and i said yes, but after not going my parents said i shouldn’t have to give them anything since i didn’t go. I tried explaining to them that my acne was really destroying my self confidence but all they seemed to care about was me paying back my “friend”. 

That happened two years ago, and nothing’s been the same since. 

I’ve done my best to talk to each one of them and see if I can remain being friends with the ones who were closest to me, but no one ever really invites me out. When i first apologized, i could tell they hated my presence. Even my “best friend” invited everyone out somewhere without me. So i completely cut them off. 

A year later, i saw one of them at a mall and i texted him and we were talking about how much we’ve missed each other. Apologizing to everyone a second time worked out better. Unfortunately, i still don’t get invited out much. They don’t seem to care about how lonely i am. They talk about their hangout plans right in front of me all the time and rn they’re in Las Vegas which is killing me. I’ve always wanted to go to Las Vegas with a group of people. One of my friends is in the middle of all this bc he’s their friend and I consider him one of mine as well. He’s never really bothered to get them to come to terms with me, and he claims that this is just how it is now. Really? Over 7 dollars and my insecurity? It’s been 2 years of depression and horrible thoughts.

777,hamartiated,1574391217,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-11-22 13:53:37

he knows things about me that i haven’t told my best friend of nine years. he knows about my suicidal tendencies, my depression, a little bit about my self harm, my philosophical nonsense, my favorite shows, how many blankets i sleep with, big or small, he knows it. idk whatever he remembers it though

anyway, he’s had a girlfriend since the beginning of the year, and we’ve been friends for less time than he’s been dating her. she’s a great girl, one of my best friends in fact. i love her very very much and she deserves a great life. 

but now, they spend every waking moment together. in school they’re talking whenever they share a class or have any free time, and out of school they’re always playing games together or calling. 

i guess my problem is that i don’t feel like i have a friend anymore. 

we don’t talk during school because we don’t have any classes together, so he used to always text me and call me after school and on weekends. it kinda was the highlight of my day, now that i don’t have many friends to talk to when im at home. he was my support system for awhile too, always helping me whenever i needed it even though i always told him he didn’t need to. he’s so selfless and kind, and he treats everyone equally no matter what. and because of that, he has trouble with his girlfriend.

he loves her, even if he doesn’t say it i know he does, and it always comes down to one question; her, or me? which person does he go to when they both need him? i always tell him to go to her since she should be held higher than me, but every time i say it i feel so shitty, because i haven’t talked to him in so long and i want to. i want to rant to him even if i always say that i’m okay or that he doesn’t need to always be there for me. i want to be a little selfish, but i’m already being A LOT selfish by admitting all this on some sub reddit.

but yeah, i just feel like i can’t talk to him anymore because he’s busy with her. she deserves it, they both deserve each other’s love and attention in fact. but i’m so lonely and i have no one else to call or text. no one who likes me back.

Helping you guys (if I have haha!) is helping me realise the reasons I love trying to help you all. I thought I'd just let you know why...:

1. Not to be melodramatic, but my experiences (particularly as a child) have made me know what it's like to feel alone, small and helpless in this world. I _never_ want anyone to feel that way nor suffer like that either. 

2. Growing up, I never felt I had the support I needed (I have particular difficulties but have overcompensated for them for years) to progress in particular facets of my life. I am only beginning to mend myself now. Equally, I _never_ want anyone to lack the support they need.

3. I genuinely love that you're all strangers. I think it's so cool. Isn't that what life's about? Being kind to one another and helping eachother to be the best we can be, irrespective of race/gender/sexuality/beliefs etc? I think it should (maybe that's just my overly quixotic view of life haha!). 

Sorry to sound like John Lennon, but I truly believe we are all one family on earth 💙

4. I feel that the world needs more love. People need more love (John's now morphed into Michael Jackson haha!). You guys offer me the opportunity to spread my kindness to you. I hope you guys can spread yours to others. The world deserves to be a better place. I believe this is one way of achieving that goal. 

I do hope I didn't bore you guys with this mini-rant of mine. I just wanted to thank you all and say that whatever you're going through, there's always someone who cares and this community is proof of that. I 💙 you all.

795,Own-Consideration,1574374845,1,"The main thing to realize is that your negative thoughts are just thoughts that you've stored in your subconscious (like most people do anyway) and because of this you're brain has convinced you that you should feel bad for certain reasons. If you look at what I just wrote completely unbiased then you'll realize that there's literally nothing to worry about in life and there's literally nothing that should make you feel bad. Also, when your happier good things will naturally happen to you. 

If you do just a few of these things you'll be fine:

Be 100% honest with yourself and don't have an ego

Rely and focus ONLY on yourself to make yourself feel happy. You may think that you need people to make you happy, but if you focus solely on yourself with no distractions and do what you need to do on your own to make yourself happy then you will be happy

Realize that all of your negative thoughts are just thoughts you've convinced yourself are true, usually based on negative past experiences you've had. Don't identify with negative thoughts, just ignore them. Now is the only thing that matters and the past is completely irrelevant

Love yourself

Don't go on social media for at least 2 weeks

Take care of your physical health, because physical and mental health aid one another

Stop doing things, watching things or hanging around people that make you feel bad

It’s just a small reminder to myself that even if you feel lonely and helpless, there’s always hope and there’s always opportunities to turn things around.

This particular entry was from October 13, 2017. At this time I was very alone and everyone I knew had no idea because I hid it so much. I hid it to the point where I created a journal in my google docs because I knew that there nobody would find it.

//Starry Tears// 
I wait here in the numbing cold. I have a jacket, but am not wearing it because it’s nice to feel the chill. I'm alone, and the silence is tranquil, yet loud at the same time to the point that it's deafening. The gentle sound of the grainery, and wind blowing is calming to me, but there is always a ringing in my head when I'm alone. It never really leaves, just stays and does nothing but wipe away my thoughts into oblivion. Where there is complete silence, there is sound, and where there is sound, there is silence. My world is black and white, but yet I dream in color. How can I learn to love who I have become? How can I just simply push aside everything I'm thinking and focus on what matters, when I don't even know what matters to other people? Maybe to them, it's sports, clothes, or everyone on their list of 100 friends that they'll forget about when they graduate. No. To me, I care only about people, but not in the ways I'd assume others do. For instance, when a person looks at a group of people, that's all they see; a group of people. When I look at a crowd of people, however, I see people who wake up every morning, have families, jobs, hobbies, and friends. I see more than what lies on the surface, or I'd like to think I do. I know there are some other people that think like me too, though. I'm nothing too special, but when will I ever meet one of these like-minded people? Once I know someone, I never forget them. Names of people I've once known are in the back of my thoughts, the things they've said to me ringing in my head like a recording on repeat.",lonely,A journal entry of mine from one of the loneliest times in my life.,2019-11-22 02:21:17

i’m finishing up my first semester at college. i love my school. i love the campus. i love the classes and what i’m studying. but i can truly say i’ve never felt so alone in my life. i have one true friend here, but i guess by true friend i mean we talk about mental things and eat dinner together every once and a while. they’re amazing, really, but i don’t think that singular occasional friendship is enough. i had another friend who i was hanging out with all the time, but now...i don’t know. i guess they’ve found their group, and i don’t think i’m a part of it.

i’m not sure if this would be that bad of a situation if it wasn’t the complete opposite of what i’m used to. don’t get me wrong, i’ve never been popular. but i’m a very outgoing person, i love talking to people. i know i’m funny, i know i’m at least smart enough to hold a decent conversation, and i’m extremely empathetic. i don’t say any of this to say “why me?”, i say it so that you understand that i truly am trying. i am putting myself out there. or, at least, i was until about a week ago.

i’m very passionate about activism. it’s what i want to do for the rest of my life. especially the queer community. don’t get me wrong, i’m not one of those twitter/tumblr types with the furry icon who just constantly nags people for being offensive. i just really care about the community and the actual issues it faces. so when i got to college, getting involved in the lgbt organization on campus was my top priority. i went to the first few meetings and was on my way to making friends. 

then, the depression hit. my therapist is looking at a possible bipolar diagnosis, but just to be clear, i’ve known about my depression and anxiety since 8th grade. and it’s been pretty severe before. i’ve been hospitalized, dealt with an eating disorder. among my old friend group it was kind of a joke that i was the “crazy” one (a joke which i went along with, because these friends genuinely did care about me and were there when i needed it). however, over the past two years, i started to feel a lot better. i our active effort into recovering and improving my mental health. when i went to college, yeah, i was a bit nervous, but i was also happier than i’d been in a while. but then, about 6 weeks in, it all just shifted. i was miserable. i missed so many classes that my grades dropped from straight As to straight Cs. i didn’t go to any club meetings. i didn’t see anyone outside of my classmates. i couldn’t function anymore. that lasted about two weeks.

then, after a super low point, i just bounced back. i started going back to my classes, i talked to my professors about what happened, i went out with the two friends i had at the time.everything looked back on track. until the LGBT student org meeting. i came in with a happy attitude, brought some snacks to replenish the supply that had been neglected since i hadn’t been there. and no one said anything to me. i was sitting in a circle, playing a game with everyone else, and my presence was hardly even noticed. 

i tried to stay the whole time, but i got so upset that i knew i was about to break down (which takes a LOT for me to do in public) and i made some excuse to leave after about an hour. no one acknowledged me as i left. i attended again the next week, in hopes of something changing, but, even after trying to strike up conversation the second time, nothing did.

after that meeting, everything started spiraling. i ended up more depressed than i had been in a long time. usually these depression dips last a week or two, but this ones been going on for five weeks. five weeks of me just being miserable. of considering killing myself every night. the only reason i haven’t is because i get to see my friends back hone in a few days. we’ve all expressed how much we miss each other, and i know they genuinely mean it, but i know none of them feel like this. they’ve all found their places, if not, at least a few friends.

i don’t know what to do. i’ve put myself out there, i’ve tried to build relationships with classmates, i’ve joined multiple clubs, i’ve sought out social activities. i don’t know what to do anymore. i’ve never been so alone in my life.",lonely,i don’t know what to do. it’s never been like this before.,2019-11-22 02:13:02

You ever get that feeling of a sharp pain through the middle of you chest while being alone. At the moment I'm in a house full of other people but have never felt so alone. 
There is an overwhelming want that I have to just have some one to hold and lye next to. Some one that is my best friend and that would care about me the same amount that I care about them. 
 Wish there was some one that would send me pointless messages just to talk with me and would come round to watch movies and enjoy each others company.
While a girlfriend would be nice, so I could take her to watch the sunset and see waterfalls, and go on adventures together. Someone just to be next to would be so much better than the spiral I'm on now. 
I feel like I should shut myself away from everyone because they are not here for me, but I also know this will just cause more hurt.

I no longer have severe anxiety nor depression, so I'm definitely better than I was few months ago and it's a big relief. But I'm still lonely, I have no one to open to, no one to share interests with.


Thing is, I'm self inflicting all of this, each time a friendship/relationship forms, I ruin it because I don't know how to cope with it. Like, I'm not shy, my social anxiety got better but as soon as people get close, I push them away or ghost them. 


Since september few ones tried to sympathize with me (I could tell some of them were even interested in me) and even if I appreciate them, I cut all ties. It's always the same way, I pull the fire alarm, not knowing how to manage others trying to know me.


On the other hand I'm craving for attention, affection and emotional support. I used to be ok with loneliness, but not receiving any text for months, having no one checking on you is too hard now. I still go out, I do things by myself, but I always wish I had someone to share those things.


Right now the only person I regularly talk to is my psychiatrist. As much as I appreciate her work, I don't want it to be like that :(


So that's my situation, ignoring potential friendship/relationships while crying because I can't stand keeping everything for myself.


Now I know I do not have it the worst, I do enjoy things and I'm relatively comfortable with myself. All of this is part of the recovery of a massive breakdown (fuelled by years of uncured anxiety disorder, depression, abusive relationship, bad choices,...) I had last year, and I'm now way better.

I haven't been in a social gathering or hung out with anyone for 2 years now. I'm average academically and far below average in life and looks. I have anxiety, fear of public speaking, childhood trauma, abandonment issues, self-sabotaging and self-destructive tendencies and I'm too broke to do something about them. I'm an absolute asocialite and the worst part is that my mind has convinced me that all these things are what who I am, without all this I'd be an empty shell. My mind has romanticized loneliness for me and I've accepted this as my fate. My father left us when I was 5. When my mom retires from her job, we'd be homeless. I have never been emotionally intimate and all of my approaches to grab a chance at this has been rejected creating a colossal fear of rejection, self loathing and low self esteem and led me now to actively be rude so people stay at an arm's length from me now.

I've been at a running club for a year. Barely anyone has made effort to talk to me. Tonight it was relatively quiet and after the run I had to wait around awkwardly until my dad collected me. I'm sick of things being like this. No one approaches me and says hi. Nothing is reciprocated. Also, I smashed my parkrun time recently and one of the few people whom I talk to a lot didn't even mention it tonight. I used to always congratulate her on her times even when she just shaved a few seconds off her time. Frankly it pissed me off and I won't bother congratulatng her in future. In fact, I might just sprint ahead and avoid her.

I tried meetup last year and that was pointless too. Everyone were already in cliques and were closed off.

I know that I put peoples noses out of joint sometimes because I am quiet and an introvert, but I am finding social situations to be more and more unpleasant these days. I'm always the loner; the outsider and I don't see it changing any time soon.

A part of me wants to quit the running club, but it helps with my training and gives me a good workout. In the past I noticed one or two others who attended a few times and then never came back. People are just unwelcoming and in their cliques.

I told my dad about it and I can tell he is at his wits end with my loner tendancies. I think, unless I get a wife and children, I will be alone for the rest of my life.

I work 13 days a month which means I have a lot of spare time and money to make up for it when I'm free. But to be frank. I never spend any time with anyone besides myself. All my friends are either broke, busy with girlfriends or just plain boring and too comfortable to move outside of their home.  


And no one ever stays in touch, no messages, no calls. Everyday is the same. Wake up either going to work or make some breakfast and staying at home doing nothing because I'm off work. Scroll through Facebook, tag friends in memes - one friend in particular. And repeat. Everyday, the same.   


But the worst thing of all. If I ever wanted to do something, whether it be playing some games on the computer or just have an occasional beer. I'm the one that starts the conversation. Not the other, no one else, just me. Always me. If I would leave my phone at home for a couple of weeks not interacting socially with the world, no one would notice.   
And I've been getting slightly depressed when I start realizing that if I stop texting people, they wouldn't notice.

  
The natural answer would be that I should stop caring because obviously they don't care - and I agree. But if I did, I would be truly alone because I wouldn't have any friends left at all.

I know some people can relate to this, and it's painful when you start realizing that you're the only one trying to keep the friendship and conversation afloat.

Ironically, the types of people that made me feel like shit for not socializing right are the ones that are scratching their heads wondering why I don't give it a chance.

Today I just saw a councilor at my university. It was pretty awkward but I guess that's there job. I talked about struggling to make close friends, and told her that I think it largely has to do with being autistic. 

For the most part she told me obvious stuff, but she did reveal me to something I had not really realized. I talked about how I found dating a lot easier than making friends, and I realized this was because when I date, I make a conscious effort to achieve a goal, of a relationship. With friends, I just kinda talk, and hope for something to come out of it. But friendships, for aspies anyway, are a lot like relationships where you have to ask questions, tell them about your self, and invite them to hang out. You must actively do these things with a goal in mind.

I guess I never really thought of it that way, and it seems pretty obvious now.",lonely,Update: Saw a councilor to talk about struggles with making friends. Learned something important to making friends.,2019-11-21 05:14:42

897,ItsTheNovahkiin,1574254104,1,"A Year ago today, i got out of a toxic relationship, one that was draining every ounce of my energy and trying to drag me down into a bad situation. Whilst in that relationship I burnt bridges with friends, family and anyone else I cared about, just to ""prove"" to the person I was with that i loved them. 

When i finally got out of that position i felt refreshed, free for the first time in a while. and it was good. i rebuild friendships, reconnected with family, got a better job, improved my life as a whole. for the first three months i felt invincible and more confident that i have ever been. 

Despite this, despite having more friends, better relations with family, and a broader social circle. in the last 9 months my confidence has slowly spiraled down and down further, lower than it was when I was in that relationship. I feel more isolated and more alone, lacking real connection and love. 

Its not like the people around me don't care, they absolutely do, my housemates are supportive, my parents will always listen and be there to take my shit, but i just feel hollow. like something is missing. and I Can't figure out what it is. and my mind keeps wondering back to that relationship, not the person, but the feeling of being more than just myself. being part of someone else and them being a part of me. and i miss that feeling. True that spark died out with that person before, primarily because it got to a point where no matter what I did for them it wasn't as good as they wanted. I Wasn't enough. and i think that creeping feeling is what keeps me where I am right now. 

I spend 4-5 months after that relationship sleeping around with people, even had a FWB for a short time. but it felt null, like it was nothing. Sex doesn't feel the same as it did before, there's been no fire, no passion in my life for well over a year. to the point that the most exciting things to happen in my life these days are Game releases. 

Ive tried Tinder, Bumble, PoF, Even a short spat on Grindr. Whisper hasn't helped. I've lost so much confidence in myself to the point at which I don't know if i can even speak to a woman face to face anymore.",lonely,Inside is like a void,2019-11-20 23:48:24

921,JarlGurahamu,1574219302,1,"I'm sure that you're all pretty busy so I'll try to keep this brief.

I'm suicidal. I hate that I am but I came to the realization that the constant thoughts I were having were neither healthy nor normal. It's been diagnosed so there's no doubt now.

Around the time that I came to this realization, I was a pretty heavy drinker, and had more or less fallen in love. I hung out with this girl a lot and tried only to show my best qualities. I made jokes and gave her compliments and attention. I did whatever I could to make her smile because I wanted her to be happy. 

Things weren't easy for a while but we pulled through, and we've been happily dating for almost two years. My depression never went away and neither did the suicidal thoughts, but I haven't given in because I have a reason other than my religion not to off myself.

She's known about all of my emotional problems. I never hid them from her because I wanted an open and honest relationship.

About a month ago, she stopped talking to me as much. She wouldnt hold my hand, kiss me, or hold me like we have been doing for so long. I tried not to let my anxiety get the better of me but eventually it won and I got her to admit that she feels like we've lost our spark. This devastated me but I don't know how to show it so she thought that I was just brushing it off.
The cause of her loosing hope was my intense depressive episodes where I locked myself away for days at a time.

I've been talking to her and it seems like things are getting better, but my anxiety has given me panic attacks daily. My heart beats so fast I fear that its stopped and I can't stop imagining scenarios as if she had cheated on me or had completely given up on us.
On a particularly bad day recently, I put my gun to my head and felt pretty disappointed at the lack of fear I felt.

Ive been going to therapy, taking my meds, and getting medical treatment for my sleeping problems. I just want it to work faster.

I don't want to lose her. I want to die but I wish I didn't. I just want to be healthy.

923,hamartiated,1574218179,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-11-20 13:49:39

But instead, my feeling of loneliness got stronger while bowling with them.

929,jashtonn,1574212018,1,"So this is mostly just going to be a rant post because I’m feeling particularly down and I just need to write it out. 

So a year ago, my boyfriend of 2 and 1/2 years broke up with me. It was really hard and I wanted to just give up on life. Slowly I started getting better and started talking to new people, went on a few dates, and was getting over him. Flash forward to about 9 months after we broke up and he started talking to be again. He really missed gaming with me and I missed that too so we started playing games together just as friends. 
This really helped me get over him and I liked just being friends. I was dating a guy and things were nice. 

Next thing I know, my ex decides that we shouldn’t be friends so I lose him again. Sucks but I did have a relationship with a guy shortly after that and I was feeling fine. (Not with the same guy I was dating, he stopped talking to me randomly) Anywho, not really feeling it with my new bf, I think we moved too fast, so we part ways. 

I started feeling great though. I had a new job, I was getting out more, being more independent, had a guy on the side who was like a friend with benefits and I was okay with this. 

Then I quit my new job because my manager sucked and made me feel so stupid every time she talked to me. Everyone just stopped talking to me other than my immediate family and my cousin. 

So now I’m just sitting here on my couch. I’m 23 years old, I get social security benefits because of my depression and anxiety, I live with my parents, and I’m feeling so lonely right now. I don’t have a car at the moment so I don’t leave the house too much. Any time I start talking to a new guy and start to feel good about them, they ghost me. I have no friends and I just want to fall into a coma so I don’t have to deal with life anymore. I’m sure I’m not the only one who has felt this way. It just sucks. I want to fall in love again.

Occasionally someone gives me a chance like, wanting to hang out with me or talk with me out of the blue, and it’s like the second I get some confirmation, I get so excited and gushy and happy and emotional with them, I guess too much, I never realize it happening I guess the conversation starts opening up and I get too cheesy, then they don’t give me anymore chances. And I’m lonely again, and I can’t stop thinking about what went wrong, what could I have done differently, so I sulk like a baby until people pick me back up because they feel bad for me, then next thing I know I’m naive and doing it again, the worst part is that I feel like I’m at the whim of the nature of my interactions with people.

936,zach9735,1574199417,1,"just going to go on about my life

I think it all started in middle school I’ll keep this part short because there is a lot I want to talk about in middle school basically I was picked on constantly and singled out because I was white in a mostly colored school that absolutely destroyed me I went fro this real fun kid to I hated everyone

Throughout high school I was always the guy that everyone knew, but only a few talked to I’m not sure why, I think I’m decent looking And nice but idk. Well throughout high school I would get friend zoned like crazy I had more female friends than male ones, I’m not sure if it was because I was to nice or what but it just kinda sucked. I eventually dropped out of school and started online school to go live with my grandfather who was in very bad shape he needed someone there 24/7 and from there for the next 3 years or so I didn’t really do anything but take care of him which was amazing I loved my grandfather as much as my own father. But eventually one night he fell and broke his hip from there he went to the hospital had surgery then came back home for his last week alive.after that is when I started to get really lonely. I realized he was the only thing in my life that kept me going all my friends from my last school had stoped talking to me and I never realized because I was so busy.(there were only like 6 or 8 people that even knew what had happened) then about a year after I meant this friend and he is probably my only true friend his name is Kurt. For example one day he messaged me to see how I was doing and I asked him why he asked. I’ve never been asked that simple question by anyone other than family. 

This whole part is about my ex who made everything worse than it was.

But let’s continue so Kurt lives in a different state than me I live in Florida he lives north of me but he introduced me to his roommate over a video call who thought I was cute and me and her talked a lot for 2 weeks I finally felt like someone actually liked me and it was great we got together(long distance relationship)for about  a week then out of no where Kurt called me to tell me what hat she didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore so about a week went on with me being super depressed me an her would send like a message or two every so often but not much then one night she told me to call her and I did and we talked then she asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship with her and I said yes. From there it was as great for 2 weeks then it happened except this time she just stopped trying to engage in conversation I would ask how she was doing and all I got was a thumbs up back. Well one day she went to the flea market she said she was going with friends I asked how she was doing and I got a message back saying I’m busy and didn’t get a message back the whole entire day we’ll what happen was she went with her friend and her ex (her friend brother is her ex) but I didn’t say anything because that who I am I’m a very nice person some say to nice. But when I asked her about the next day she said it was great that she got to hang out with her friend and said nothing about her ex(she had also been telling me about how much she hates this dude) then a couple days after that I was talking to Kurt and apparently she didn’t want to say she loved me anymore apparently she didn’t like the love word. From there I was like ok I don’t know why but ok I can deal with this. Then the next morning I told her how I felt, how I felt like she was not being there I quest I don’t know how to say it but from there all she said is I’m gonna go then from there I started to freak out I said sorry if I over stepped nothing she read it but didn’t say anything I then asked if we could talk she asked (why!) she the went on to say that she thinks she doesn’t belong with anyone. From there I say sorry for whatever I did then she said why would you say that I then said again that she hasn’t been acting the same. From there we go back and forth and she tries to play the victim card saying this is just how she is and it’s all her fault. So while this is going on I was talking to one of her friends that were friends with me and he sent me screen shots of their conversation were said I was a control freak(just for your information I’m the type of person that will just say I don’t care to everything I am like the least controlling person there is) that friend also sent me screenshots of her saying how much fun she had at the flea market with her ex. So I asked her how I was as controlling and she immediately asked who told me I wasn’t going to say because I didn’t want to ruin there friendship but she just said wow your not gonna tell me then I asked after that because I was starting to get aggravated when where you gonna tell me about the flea market and your ex and from there she plays dumb telling me she doesn’t know what I’m talking about then she asks me if she that friend had told me about her ex and that person was a liar I still say no. (Also it is a little hard to lie when your sending screenshots). Then from there Kurt and his wife get back from work and talked to her I don’t know what was said and don’t care anymore. But we both apologized to each other which was restarted I wasn’t the one talking behind there back she was the one telling people I was a control freak. After the the relationship was even worst and eventually Kurt had to call me again to tell me she didn’t want to be with me which I figured was coming but the he told that she said she had no feelings for me.and that sucked after that nothing really happened I asked how she was doin like a week later and she said good then that was it for us talking to each other. But Wait there’s more (just some background info she was living with them rent free for about two months she also didn’t have a job) after that she blocked me on tik Tok which I didn’t care I only made that because she wanted me to. Then one night I noticed she blocked me on everything. Everything apparently her and Kurt got into a argument because she was talking shot about Kurt and his wife behind there back and was trying to say that they forced her to date me so

1. The nights when we would talk we would both stay on the phone until we would fall asleep I would ask her if she wanted to and she said she wanted me to stay

2. How about the day she was sick I stayed home to stay on the phone with her for 5 hours I asked if she had wanted me to go so she could sleep and she said no she licked me being there.

3. The second time me and her got together Kurt and his wife didn’t even know so could they have forever that.

4. How can you be forced to date someone who is several states away from you 

Then after that I felt like complete shit I wasn’t sure if she had liked me or pretended to I mean she was the first to say I love you but I’m not sure. After that happened a week later she had lied again she had told Kurt and his wife that she was doing a babysitting job for a friend for a week then it turned into a month apparently she was living there until she wasn’t welcome anymore the was going to go back to Kurt’s house she was kicked out of there house that day Kurt’s wife packed her shit and brought it to her. 

So after all of that if kinda fallen into this place that I will never have a significant other or friends who actually live near me. Like every so often I will get this real depressing feeling and it just sucks. I’ve even went to tinder to try and find something but I’m so shy I don’t usually talk to a match unless they message first and even then they will talk for that day but after that nothing. So I don’t really know how to end this but thank you if you read all of this.

When I’m with the people I usually hang around with I feel like I’m constantly bringing them down and that I’m a burden, the people that helped me before are amazing and I love them to bits but I can’t bring myself to tell anyone about how I feel because I already feel like such a bother. Other people i talk to seem to like me less and less and are pretty quick to take the piss out of how I’m acting. 

I just want to get to a point where I’m completely detached, like I’m completely by myself and isolated and at the point where it doesn’t matter to anyone whether I’m here or not, I don’t want to feel like anyone’s responsibility because it fucking hurts to think that - it’s the only thought at the moment that doesn’t make me feel numb

I’ve never talked to anyone about the extent of how I feel before, honestly even me doing this pretty much anonymously is fucking scary to me but I felt like I needed to let it out in some way. thank you if you read this far, I know it’s been a long post but I appreciate it a lot",lonely,I don’t really like talking about stuff like this but,2019-11-20 08:03:01

I suddenly remembered all the days we spent together talking about our life problems and laughing at them, we used to talk about our failure relationships, cry together, and comfort each other. 
A few years later, we stopped talking as well, he lives very close to my house, but I don't enjoy going out anymore.
I think I feel better being alone now.

So today I sent him a message to say that I was happy for him, we haven't talked for almost a year and he didn't even ask about how I was, it's no big deal I think, but once again I have this feeling.
""He's also going away, definitely this time.""

964,Depressiononmymind,1574163093,1,"Long post warning. Sorry about that.

For my beginning, I just want to say, I try to have the biggest heart. Whenever I see someone hurting, or thinking about suicide, I immediately try to help them and talk to them for whatever amount f time to hopefully give them some hope and make sure they are okay. Even though I have a big heart, this has messed me up in some relationships, by putting partners needs first, and the same with friends. I try my hardest to help people out, and give them everything I got just to help someone with anything. I’d give my food to someone else if that means I’d have to starve. It’s how I was raised, and I love everyone. Anyway, why is this world such shit? You try so much for everyone. To give everything you got, and sometimes people expect more and more until you literally take your own life because you just can’t give them anything anymore. I think about suicide often. I’ve been battling with depression for the last 9 years of my life, and Anxiety for the past 3. I sit here everyday and think, “Why? Why is this the type of world I want to live in”. I have the type of anxiety where I think somethings going to happen when I’m in a public place (ex: Whenever I’m eating at a restaurant I’ll think someone’s going to burst in and kill everyone). This also affect me being able to drive, both of which cause me severe anxiety and panic attacks.(which is ironic because I want to die, but by my own hand. And I like to know that I would die from my own hand than someone’s else killing me and possibly others)

I was kinda in a relationship a couple months back. I’ve known this girl for a couple years, and we’ve always been good to each other. When she started flirting and everything, I’d do it back too. We were never in a real relationship, but everytime my cousin would have parties, she’d come over, we’d both get drunk and once we lay down for the night, we’d always kiss and go to sleep in each other’s arms. It was blissful, to say the least. A couple months ago, we went on a vacation to a certain state with a beach. Not going to say much because she’s subbed to this sub reddit. Two weeks before this trip, she says she didn’t want to do anything, and just be friends. And I agreed. But while on the trip, we were on the very top floor of the condo, right on the beach. I have severe anxiety and panic attacks because I’m afraid of heights. So over the course of a couple days, they’d always go out at night to clubs, and I’d stay at the condo drinking a gallon of jack (yes I drunk a gallon in 3 days. Don’t judge me. A gallon of jack was 25$ there and where it is normally where I’m at it’s 60$) and sit on the balcony in the night and feel the wind blowing and watching the sea in the distance move. It was peaceful, and blissful. When I drink, I don’t think about anxiety that much. Also, we shared a bed in the condo because it was very tight in space because of everyone. So every time she’d come back with her friends, I was drunk and she was drunk, but I respected her wish to just stay friends. Although, one of her friends that stayed in the condo with us was really attractive, and I really liked her personality. But enough about her friend. Over the couple nights at the condo, while they were out partying, I’d always be shitfaced drunk when they come back. When she comes back from parting, if I was asleep, she’d always come in there and jump on the bed at 4 am I’m the morning just to wake me up. This didn’t bother me, though. But when she’s drunk, she likes to flirt. So on the third night, everyone comes in, she wakes me up, and she sits in my lap waiting for me to kiss her like we’re a couple. I mentioned what she said a few weeks earlier, and I just looked at her with a grin, and said. “Go ahead. Your move”. If she would’ve kissed me, I would’ve did it back and went through with whatever happened. I was extremely drunk though, and she just looked at me, got up from my lap from sitting on the bed, and walked away. Later that night, she came to bed, (I wasn’t expecting her too, because I thought she was mad at me). She woke me up coming to bed, like how you do when your partner is asleep, and I put my arm over her, she went on her side and scooted in to me, and we fell asleep. Also, she’d always let me put my leg invetween her two legs when we are both sleeping on out sides, if that makes sense. Just something I love to do when I’m with a girl like that. Anyway, the next day, normal stuff happened. We slept until like 4, and everyone else was down at the beach. I woke her up and told her that breakfast was ready, and headed down to the beach with everyone else and she went back asleep.  That night, again, we got drunk, but she was acting weird when she came back from partying. As we were about to goto bed, I started to have a panic attack, so I pulled out some pills that I take to help with them. I already knew she was made at me, and just that pure frustration she felt towards me really upset me. I try to do everything for her, and I try to never be mad at her. But I took the pills, (two 50Mg pills for anxiety and I’ve never took anything in front of her before), looked at her, and said “fuck it”. And I lay down to sleep, but she was going out with her friends to party again. I woke up a while later when they returned, to find out that she was messaging a guy at the club to fuck, and was going to go down to the beach and then to fuck. Me, literally drunk as fuck, and possible high on pills (similar to Xanax) said fuck this shit, so while she went down to the beach, I grabbed my jack from the freezer and went to the balcony. I didn’t watch her go down to the beach, nor talk to anyone. (It was dark anyway) I was just focused in my  own bubble, drinking more, and watching the cool waves roll around in the beautiful sea. I was so close. So close to jumping. I looked down, and I wanted to leap off so bad. I was so relaxed, that I wanted to die right there. And I almost did. I was so close. Literally milliliters away, and feeling the coldness of that metal protective rail from achieving happiness. I chugged the bottle of jack for about 10 seconds, set it down, and I was about to. But then, my mothers face went through my mind. I had just FaceTimed her the previous day, and it just destroyed me. The feeling of pure hopelessness is something that I never talk about because I have to much pride. The only person I’ve ever cried too was the girl I’m talking about in this post. No one else has ever seen me cry, or get so angry that I cry. I just looked down and since I was drunk, I wasn’t afraid of the height. I just slowly turned around with my bottle, and went back inside. I put the alcohol back up, and got back into bed. I was still awake when she came back to the condo, and I overheard her saying to her friends that “she couldn’t go through with sleeping with the random guy”.  Then, I tried to get her attention multiple times to come out to the balcony so we could talk, and even asked her to walk to the beach with me, and for us to talk. She said she just came from down there, and she said she was good. So, we go to bed that night, and we were both mostly sober. Sometimes in my sleep, I jolt up because of my anxiety and panic attacks. And it happened in that night, and my heart was beating fast, and she said “Please stop. I’m trying to sleep”. Like I can control it. So, I stayed awake so I wouldn’t bother her. So finally, she woke up in the middle of the night to fix something to eat, and I asked her to meet me on the balcony, and we talked. I brought up everything. About her wanting to be friends before the trip, and then her flirting first, and about her and the dude she was suppose to see. I said “Don’t ever play with my feelings like that again. You should’ve kept your word about us staying friends, and not of tried anything when you were drunk”. We both argued, and we went back inside. She slept on the couch, and I slept in the bed. It was around 6 in the morning by this time, so I stayed up until 10. We had to leave that morning and the vacation was over, so we did. We didn’t say anything to each other on the drive back, and I dropped her off at her mothers and I haven’t heard from her in 4 months. 

Sorry again for this being so long. But ever since then, I’ve been thinking about suicide a lot. I just want that connection again. Someone to hold, and someone to protect. My constant experience with anxiety and depression really has fucked me up. My mom and I always argue, but Id give my own life for her to live hers. My dad is really religious, and even though I’d give my life for him too, we just don’t see the same views in this world. He’s always saying stuff about religion every word he talks. But just want someone to love as much as I did that girl. know it’s pathetic to say, but I just sit here and wish how I had someone to give my all too again. Someone to love. I just want to feel wanted. Everyday that goes by, I just feel like more of a wasted space that shouldn’t of ever existed. I just wish I was the perfect person that someone was wishing for. I would give anything to be with someone who wants me. 

I’m sorry about any grammatical mistakes I mad writing this, as I’m writing on a iPhone. 

I love you all,

Highschool was a experience to say the least. I was at my peak 240 pounds heavy. I used to get bully all the time and made fun of for the way I looked and way I spoke. 

After highschool i didn't go to college cuz i had other plans but they really didn't pan out. I got my shit together lost 80 pounds and never felt any better. Whenever I go in public I feel like everyone is looking at me and judging me. 

Living here in the US without my parents really fucked me up and I never realized this when I was young but I have been depressed for quite some time now but ai was never suicidal until one of me best friend stopped caring for me and he just wasn't the same.

Long story short I'm currently studying for my A+ cert and whenever I try to study I just feel like ""what's the point?""

986,hamartiated,1574131413,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

991,Kakaditz,1574128452,1,"It’s true. When you never experience warmth, affection, romance, love, you’re more than likely going to be aching for it. Unfortunately, this desperate need for those things will often lead to behaviors that turn people off from giving them to you.

Some people use words like ‘clingy,’ ‘needy,’ ‘desperate,’ ‘pathetic,’ to describe people who feel this way. People who text/call more than most, who want to be around someone more often, who seem ‘too’ friendly, who ‘throw off the wrong signals’. And in turn, they get pushed away or ignored, when all they wanted was to be accepted, or loved.

It’s tough to break these patterns of behavior when you never learn the ‘right way’ to attract people, or to at least maintain adequate contact/kinship with people. On the other hand, the people who push these ‘clingers’ away seem to not want to understand them or help them understand why their behavior is repelling them from others. 

I get it, people have their own shit to deal with, and a lot of the time they don’t have the time to help someone else with their social failings or give them a chance to be connected with them so they can see the value of them as a friend or romantic partner. Hell, I’M guilty of this. I’ve pushed a girl away from me when they seemed paranoid. My rationale was always, “They’ll find someone else.” And now here I am, thinking I had finally found someone who I could relate to and who could understand me. And now they’ve blocked me... ironic isn’t it?

I don’t know, I just had to rant about another failing in my life, and the lives of others in this sub I’m sure. It hurts getting rejected. It makes you want to give up, especially when it seemed like you were so close to connecting with someone, only to screw it up with your insecurities. Maybe one day I can change... or not.

I honestly just want a close friend, or a girlfriend, or some kind of intimacy. I have not had a close friend since primary school. Its a long story involving my parents divorce that moved me across the world 4 times, and taught me to not get too attached. Being autistic also does not help.  

I honestly just don’t know how! This is why I’ve been trying to date, because I’m looking for intimacy, and dating is honestly easier for me. There are step to step guides on how to date everywhere, but in terms of close friendships, it’s kinda just, “yeah talk to them and it will evolve naturally”. It does not evolve naturally.

I'm a 16 years old, male, and gay. I live in a very homophobic country and currently I'm living with my family. Everyday I feel bad because I don't tell my parents the truth but, if honest, I'm afraid that they will disown me... *or even worse*. I know that they won't accept me because I recently told them I'm atheist and they took this in a very offensive way. 

They are sometimes suspecting that and when they do they ask in a very wary and intimidating way and I must lie. It hurts. I must listen to their homophobic propaganda and accept it... That hurts more. One day I'm scared of what they will do if they figure it out. What if someone tells them (some of my classmates know that).

I plan to tell them this once I move out, so they won't be able to *hurt* me.

Given the username, you may be able to tell that music is a massive part of my life. I play guitar, bass, a bit of piano, drums, and a few others. I've been teaching myself these instruments (starting with guitar) for over a year now. But even then, I'm not good enough to make anything of it. You can only teach yourself so much. I know chords and suck, and I know all of the keys on the piano and whatnot, but I know very little theory. A few other passions of mine are literature and video creating, and whereas I haven't really given either of those a try, given the odds I don't feel confident in pursuing them at all. Call it cliche, but I've always wanted an audience of sorts. People who enjoy the content I make, whatever it may be. Music, videos, literature, anything. But I just don't feel good enough. And I never have the time to try and improve upon my passions, nor do I even have the goddamn motivation anymore. I work part-time and go to highschool full-time. I don't know. I just feel so trapped, so alone. I've been thinking about suicide so much lately, and it's honestly scaring me. I don't want to die at a young age, but I fear it'll all just become too overwhelming and my emotions will get the better of me. When? I don't know. But I fear it'll happen. Even if I don't kill myself, I feel as though I'll only end up a lonesome loser with nothing to be proud or happy for. Life just doesn't seem worth it anymore, and I really wish it would change. I want to better myself so badly. I want to start exercising and losing weight, to try and get into the dating scene, to try and solidify myself in the music industry or the YouTube community, and to just generally better myself and my life, but I haven't the time or motivation to do any of that right now.

I'm a guy, 18 years old. Living alone with my cat and working. Been in relationships before. My most recent one besides the one I'm in ended with my boyfriend killing himself. I'm wondering if maybe I'm to depressing to be around, or I'm just that weird guy looking for attention constantly and it annoys people? I feel like I push away people for no reason. My cat is the only thing keeping me sane right now. 

My boyfriend now, is obviously lying to me about his issues that need immediate attention. I asked him about it and he got really angry and hit me really hard. Then he just left. I think I shouldn't have asked him or talked to him about it but I'm just worried. That's how I am; worried all the time, scared FOR you. 

Most recently, I've tried committing suicide. It was rough. Cut myself all over, felt like everything that's happened is my fault. And my family is blaming me. Recently I've been raped and I told my dad, he was driving when I called. My brother was in the car with him. After my dad hung up, my brother told me he was yelling and really upset. Next thing I know, I'm getting a call from my brothers wife telling me that they had gotten into an accident. The next day, my dad died. My brother had a broken leg and he hurt his hand. Him, my mother, and the whole family (on both sides) is blaming me for it. And yes, I feel it is my fault.

1034,Radiation16_,1574091027,1," 

Hello! I'm Rads (Arisu is cool too), I'll use my username for reasons i'll explain below.

So yeah, I'm 19 years old, spanish. I'm studying programming but i've loved computers since i was 3 (my dad used to have a computer store before i was even born, I grew up with a computer and lots of hardware at home). I do also like to read manga, way more than anime since I feel anime is really slow paced when compared to a comic, my favourite one being One Piece. Also I like electronic and techno music (plus subgenres) altho I'm not just locked to those genres.

I do like gaming too, but i tend to enjoy infinitely more a singleplayer experience than playing with friends, I just like to be on my own at my pace.

**That's the basics covered, let's get to the advanced half of this.**

Since began school, I've always been bullied, making a huge sink in my self-steem and confidence, it got worse when i entered high school, because I got more bullied and depression started. Spent my highschool years normally, even tho I was mildly depressed, and then, the last two years happened. My last two hs years were hell, i wasn't bullied, and i got relatively good at social, my classmates were really cool, and I have to thank them for opening me. That said, the exams along with my parents expectations and my fear of them, really made my depression worse, and it made me a huge dick. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a dick for the sake of being a dick, I just was too clingy, too desperate and played with people's feelings, all of this happened whenever I had crysis. So I was literally pushing them away, my depression made me do that, and I lost a lot of wonderful people because of it, not blaming depression per se, it was my fault after all, I was the one doing those actions. 

That said, there was another key piece in that depression, **my gender**.

In 2017 I started feeling like a girl (I was born male) and those feelings started to grow on me, after a few months of pain I told my parents and they weren't that supportive at first. Which made things EVEN worse. In late 2017 I told my parents I was depressed, they were really worried and I started going to a psychologist

Stuff started to change next year, during my last year of hs, during the second trimester, I missed some classes, by the third one, I missed every single period I had. My marks weren't good by any means. I was also too negative and things looked really dark in my eyes. On the last week, I decided to finally quit school. For a bit of context, you should know I live in a really small village, based on agriculture, like all my zone. When I prompted my parents with the fact I wanted to quit high school because I wasn't feeling good there, they hooked me up as a farmer pawn, which was... okay. Obviously not my desired job but a job nontheless. I worked at my aunt's store as a restocker too. 

I spent some time working, and the work at the farm was really aggravating me, in June 26 2018 exactly, I attempted suicide and failed (Thanks god I failed). I got to a psychiatrist after that, a really good one, I might say. I started to get medication, and spend the rest of the summer okay, with some irl friends, but they actually made fun of my because attempting suicide, that wasn't making me feeling better. As a normal person should do, I got rid of that kind people with time. This summer was also when I pushed away REALLY hard all my online friends, and really hurt them. They were the only people I had real trust with, people I had a fulfilling relationship with, unlike my irl friends. So I ended up, alone, while I used to spend hours on discord talking with friends daily, after the point I blocked them all and deleted during a lot of my crises , I spent aprox almost a year without using it. By September 2018, I was feeling a little bit better, and got a new job, I'd be learning as an electrician, specialiced in solar power. During this year of contract, I started feeling progresively better, and I was really enjoying my job. 

At some point during early 2019 I noticed that I was feeling okay again. Future wasn't so dark anymore, bad things could happen, but they happen to everyone, I could get out of anything, I was feeling powered again. All of this boosted my self-respect and confidence. I was a really happy for the first time in ages.

About my gender, I learnt to accept myself as I am, as my body is. I still felt female on my soul, but my body was the one of a boy. In summer 2018, I could just see HRT far far away, but now, I don't believe I need it at all now. I don't know what my gender is, or how to classify my feelings of ""I'm a girl, my body is male, but I just get along with it and live happy with this body anyways"", so what I did was literally to not think about it. Why wasting energy in trying to assign myself a label where I can fit when after all I am who I am, I cannot do anything about it and I'm happy with it? I don't need hormones to feel better, because this is my body, and I like it.

This also creates a complex problem where I don't know how people should refer to me, but I don't really care either, I don't mind called he or she to be actually honest. IRL, everyone calls me he, because that's what is easier for everyone (including me), but yeah, I wouldn't mind she either.

\[(Accurate representation of me)\]([https://pics.me.me/thumb\_and-what-does-he-find-some-gender-confused-wolf-yeah-screw-62425805.png](https://pics.me.me/thumb_and-what-does-he-find-some-gender-confused-wolf-yeah-screw-62425805.png))

The point is, I literally had no more depression nor huge problems by April 2019, I was happy. My psychiatrist removed my meds a couple of months later, I was set. I was ready for anything, I got the english proficency level B2, I obtained my certificate of electrician, I enrolled in driving school and more importantly, I started studying again. Thankfully, here in spain, there is an alternative to ""bachillerato"" aka the last two years of hs, which is ""formación profesional"" (vocational training), and there is one exclusively about computer IT. My subjects vary from server management and computer building and maintenance to web design and programming (Which is what I want to do for a living). 

The reason I'm telling you my story today, is because, even tho I'm happy now, I have nobody. I do have irl friends, and a couple of online friends. But none of my relationships are meaningful. My school friends are just in school, we don't talk outside of it, same happened at work, same happens now that I'm studying again. I can't open myself to people, let that be because I don't trust them enough, or I'm just scared of hurting anyone that is close to me. Either way, I'm just looking for someone to kill my continious feeling of loneliness. Is not something that happens from one day to another, of course not, I just want to meet new people, and do my best to be a good friend and build a nice relationship with time.

1043,harsherthanmemory,1574076291,1,"I've been in different places in my head recently. I feel like I'm pulling myself up and falling down again. Or like I'm leaving but homesickness keeps bringing me back. 

There's a part of me that thinks, the only way for me to survive is by getting on with my life and trying to stay busy doing things that give me some joy. Loneliness is only a problem if I make it into one. It's probable that I will meet people through something or other within the next 5 or 10 years of my life. If I'm happy to be alone in the mean time then there's nothing for me to be worried about. I have a small amount of human contact through work at least, I get along with people there easily even though I wouldn't yet call any of them friends. With that and family/friends of the family, it's kind of enough to keep me - a very private and introverted person - sane. 

But there's also another part of me. A restless part of me, that feels like none of this means anything if I don't have anybody to share it with; that life inside a bubble is not really living. I know that however content I manage to become with being alone, it wouldn't compare to the genuine happiness I'd feel being in love again. I believe if I found the right person I could make them that happy too. I have so much love to give. It's tragic to have that potential love there and to just keep it boxed up. 

I thought about this post all day. It's hard to describe how I feel. I know I can't force anything to happen before its time. If I spend all my time thinking about this empty space in my life it could drive me to despair. But in a way it makes me happier to daydream. It gives me a little bit of hope to imagine that there's a woman out there who has my back, and we just haven't met yet.

I’m pretty awkward and dorky. I joke around a lot cuz I’m insecure, and it often leads to me making inappropriate jokes that turn people off to me, or make them think I’m horrible, when I just want to make them like me. And when I’m not acting like a clown, I’m pretty reserved, which leads people to believe I’m creepy or crazy.
I’ve been lucky enough to go on a few dates in my life, but they were all first dates. I could never get to a second date, if one at all, with a person I’m interested in. This is likely due to my lack of understanding how to properly court someone, as well as my other flaws that I listed. 
I often fall into depression thinking about my failed connections, which lately has effected my performance at work, which has now led to me being fired. 
I’m currently seeking therapy, but I doubt it will help in any meaningful way. I’ve seem psychologists since I was a kid due to my parents thinking there was something wrong with me because I was doing poorly in school, when in reality, I couldn’t focus on my studies because I was being bullied and getting my ass kicked at school AND home (by my parents, go figure). I also in turn bullied my younger siblings, which I greatly regret to this day, because now they want nothing to do with me. I resent my parents for the way they treated me and continue to treat me, but I don’t want to put the blame on them. I made my own choices that led to where I am now.
I WANT to change, I WANT to be better. But I can’t help but feel indifferent about everything these days. My hobbies no longer give me joy, I have no desire to ‘put myself out there’ and try to meet new people, I’ve lost my drive to work out, and work is just a paycheck.

In the past two years I tried to kill myself, found out my partner was sleeping with one of my closest friends, left the country I moved to to be with them to go back to my home country, Had a second mental breakdown, attempted to kill myself, lay in hospital for two weeks with my family insulting and attacking me to the extent i told them to get out of the hospital, they washed their hands of me, On discharge I was given a letter by the ward doctor to present as homeless to the council where I ended up living for six months or so next door to a crack addict/dealer who threatened to stab me in the eyes and let a full gang deal from our shared stairwell and kick the locks in on our front door weekly, I was told my temporary accommodation there expired and had nowhere else to go so squatted for a couple months, eventually a homelessness charity I was referred to got back to me and I was given a room. Things were going better, I re-enrolled for my degree, I started therapy, I had a keyworker, I booked my driving test, I was finally healing, throughout all of this I had very few friends, anyone to relate to, and became extremely socially isolated. I ended up in A&amp;E three times for self harm, and another attempt. All my progress went kaput when one of the other tenants of the homeless hostel threatened to kill me, smashed on my door and threatened to murder me repeatedly, stupidly I opened the door and he attempted to force himself into my room hand in pocket, it was only the staff member on shift doing an evening walk on the floor as he did so that stopped him barging in my room to do god knows what. The rooms are the only place with no cameras in the building. He continued to threaten me all night 12-7am. I called the police around 2 as he threatened to kill me, threatened to stalk me and stalk me to the building of flats I was next on the list to be moved to to continue recovery.   


The police arrived at 9am, he was asleep and treated me like a hysterical idiot, I was told by staff that management was not in until the following mid week, this was a Saturday and I lived two doors on a landing away from this person threatening to stab and kill me if i report them, and to kill me if I don't report them!?  


Anyway, I fled. I left and remained in contact with the charity and left all my belongings there, and I stayed with people I barely knew, I stayed with someone I knew far away, I stayed in cheap hotels and hostels, and I stayed on the street. This all happened in august and only now in the last few days have I finally organised a place to live, with my deposit and month of rent in advance covered by a charity. Because of the timescale, I have had to defer my studies for another year, cancel my driving test, been discharged from my psychiatrist and mental health team for 'missing an appointment' which my keyworker had made contact prior to - I only found this out last week after collecting my post in spite of the fact that it was half a month ago, no contact no follow up at all, just a discharge.   


Words fail. I don't know how to carry on. I have so much love to give, platonic love, kindness whatever. I feel hollowed out, I feel cheated by life.

Ive been feeling lonely for pretty much my entire life, im 21, never had a relationship (also a virgin of thats not obvious) and well, seeing my few friends all get into relationships and spending more time with them instead of me just hurts me more and more every single day. Ive tried to talk to my best friend but even she doesnt know what to say anymore.

One of the big and obvious reasons is that i have seriously severe social anxiety, like even just leaving my home to idk buy food is extremely exhausting for me, just imagine how I feel if i have to talk to someone...its hard...very very hard.

Ive tried to change but everytime i did, it ended in me feeling even worse than before, and now that even my best friend doesnt know what to say anymore, I have no one who I can talk to directly about how worthless I feel.

What also hurts is that I recently was out with a friend (which was hard enough for me) and a good 20% of the girls that were around our age were interested in him and showed exactly 0 interest in even looking at me, just as if I wasnt there. I understand that he may look better and is more confident and stuff, but not even wanting to say a simple ""Hi"" or whatever just completely ruins me.

I just honestly dont know what to do anymore...I just want someone who who cares at least 0.1% about me and who listens to me when I feel bad again. Is that really too much to ask for ?

And finally, the icing on the cake, im usually feeling well but over the last weeks I kept thinking about things like: ""What if I just werent here anymore?"" ""Would it even make a difference?"" And honestly, the fact that Im starting to get these thoughts, scares me a lot.

1114,throwawaylavender523,1574014796,1,"Ive been out of school for over a year, and in that time I’ve pushed away the few friendly acquaintances I had while there. I don’t have a job, and dont think Ill be able to get one any time soon due to my anxiety and depression. The only thing that was keeping me out of the house was doing basic things for myself with my mom, such as grocery shopping and going to doctors appointments. Its the only time i ever leave the house, and the only interaction i get thats even slightly meaningful. I got my drivers license about two weeks ago, and now that source of interaction is completely gone. I have to do all my shopping for myself, get myself to appointments, if i want to go to a cool place to get food or just to walk around with my dog i have to do it alone. Ive stopped leaving the house completely because of this, the driving force behind all of those activities was an escape from loneliness, and now they seem useless. Ive tried asking to do these things now, but the response is always that i can do it myself. I know its selfish, but i really wish i never got my license in the first place so i could still spend time with her.

They moved back home to an extremely rural area and small town, and have expressed how much they miss me and having things to do.

Old friends are drifting away and unmotivated to hang out - I have new friends who I get along with but there's no real history there yet. I miss my righthand buddy you know. We had such a special connection and every time I try and look to fill my evening up with that similar vibe or energy, it's just not there. It even feels like the universe is purposely keeping people away from me. I will text 7-8 people to hang out in a night and no one responds until the next day. It feels like a cruel joke. I get so restless and sad.. I love my friend so much and I miss them. We loved each other so much we moved in together and lived together for a year. We joke about getting married.

I have tonnes of friends and acquaintances. In college I'm one of the popular kids where almost everyone knows me. In fact most of the people highly value my opinions and confess their innermost thoughts and secrets t me...but I've never had anyone for any of that. 

Even when in a group of people I'm really familiar with, I've always felt like someone who didn't belong there, it just never did resonate with me.

From someone else's point of view I would probably be the least lonely person but in reality I have no one. 

Earlier the loneliness used to bother me a lot and I used to try and fill the void by finding someone new to ask out, they probably saw the mess I was and the answer was almost always no.

I’ve never been in a relationship and I’ve been putting more effort into trying to change that lately. Not for lack of trying earlier in life, but it’s funny how just a few years - let alone, a decade or more - can change your perspective. 

My twenties are almost over, thirty is on the horizon. It would be nice to find someone while I’m still this young. It’s definitely something I want, not a need. I’ve been alone this long and I’m still here, so ending up forever alone isn’t an idea that particularly bothers me. I’m on sturdy ground with myself, for the most part. Took a long time to get there, but I’m mostly satisfied with where I’m at.

It would just be nice to find someone to love, you know? Being alone is something of a double-edged sword for me. On the one hand, it can be peaceful at times... but, it can also be downright unbearable occasionally.

It’s a real roundabout way of getting to it, but what I’m getting at is, I’m dipping my toes into online dating for the first time and I don’t quite know how to feel about it. I haven’t found anyone yet, but that’s okay. Gives me time to ponder. Essentially, I’m out of my element because I prefer interacting in person and I’m not especially proficient with modern technology. Social media is something I avoid like the plague outside of Reddit, so I realize I’m limiting myself right out of the gate.

So, I guess I’m more or less looking for some kind of advice/support? Maybe some tips on how to navigate the landscape of online dating?

My family makes me feel even more alone when I remember that one day they will discover my truth and I will be disowned. I am not like them and I won’t make them proud. They are the only people on Earth who care that I exist but will soon wish I didn’t. I just want to be with someone for once. I know this sounds pathetic but being 20 and being alone all of your life hurts. Anytime my parents(especially dad) brings it up I just avoid the question or say I’m focusing on other stuff. The worst thing is that I know they might know I’m gay so I feel like an idiot. They’re just waiting for the day they find out. That they know their son is a faggot and will burn in Hell. I know that already so I can’t wait to just run away and break out. I don’t care for what they preach and have abandoned their religion a long time ago. It’s just that today we saw a street preacher going off about sodomites and my parents agreeing with every word. I felt so alone in that moment. That the sick people they were talking about were me. This life is meaningless and vile. I just want to feel anything. Even if things were different, my appearance and self-esteem are still there to make me basically invisible to not only the opposite sex but the same sex. Even would of taken a fake relationship with a girl in high school to have that as a memory. I’m repulsive. I’m just really lonely and want to just fade out. I’m so used to being unwanted and looked at with pity I can’t think of a life without misery.

1161,IssaMuffin,1573964227,1,"These past 4 months I’ve fucked up more than I could ever imagine. I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember myself but this year was going perfect, found a good paying job, reconnected with a friend I really loved, ended up in a relationship with her. Finally, I was feeling good. The thing is, she has multiple sclerosis and also she had some problems with her ex, he treated her badly, made her feel insignificant, he was telling her that nobody was ever going to love her cause of her condition and shit like that to the point she wasn’t ready to commit with me. It’s acceptable though I don’t find that preposterous. Well she asked me to break up but to be honest, I’ve been in love with her for a really long time. 4 years to be exact so I wasn’t ready to let it end. I skipped going to work just to try to salvage this relationship. I was successful at that point, but I got fired. It was ok, if I could pull finding a job like that once I could do it again, or so I thought. After that my father attempted suicide and I didn’t know what to do, we never had a good relationship so tbh I didn’t really care. I took my sister in since she is a minor and our mother died 12 years ago, and I found another job, this time at a bar, temporarily so I could pay some bills and provide what I could for my sister. Some days passed and my girlfriend didn’t feel ok, I was treating her with utmost respect, giving her as much space as she needed, meeting her whenever she was available. I tried my best to not push her to do anything. We had plans one day to go to a concert together but she went and booked a ticket for another one at the same day, well I got mad but I think it’s understandable. We had a fight that day and we broke up, this time for good. After a couple of days we decided to keep a friendly relationship but we all know how hard it is to stay friends with someone you love. In the end we stopped talking, I made a bunch of mistakes back to back and ended up losing this job as well, I’m not gonna say that it was stress and/or depression that pushed me to failure cause I don’t like making excuses, it’s cause I’m bad at managing my life. The thing is, I’m not the most likeable person since I’ve been fighting a constant back to back war against depression, I ended up pushing most of my friends away. Nobody really wants to talk to me anymore. As my father got better my sister moved back with him cause I couldn’t support her financially. I was feeling so alone and attempted suicide, but before I did that I made sure to tell it to my ex, part of me thought that she would try to talk me out of it, she didn’t see the message in time. For good or worst the attempt failed, and I’m still here. It’s my third attempt to date, first was when my mother died and second was like 2 years ago. I don’t feel like I want to die right now but I’m feeling so alone. I’ve tried to make up with my friends but nobody is willing to forgive me, I tried talking to my ex again and she wants nothing to do with me. It’s understandable though, the last thing she needs in her life is someone to worry about. Now I’m unemployed, alone with no energy whatsoever to do anything.

1167,BeeFucker3,1573962579,1,"I'm a bit lonely. I don't know how lonely cause I've never really not been lonely. I live in a pretty isolated place, with no kids my own age (or just kids at all) for at least 10 kilometers and I don't have a car. I've only ever meet people at school, summers, weekends and holidays I spend alone, and in school I was bullied from before I remember pre 4th grade till 8th grade, in 8th grade I made my first real friends (friends who would actually want to visit once in a while), one of these friends actually moved close by! Only problem was that I got even lonlier in this period, everything was harder and less fun, and also this friend that lived close by used to be a bully. I didn't care that he used to be a bully, he wasn't now, but he wasn't that good at realising how I feelt at times, and I could probably be pretty irritating. There is this one inncident I remember where his parents were driving the two of us and his little sister. The sister was bothering him and I kind of lead her on cause I found it funny (as I said I could be a bit irritating), I didn't mean any harm. Anywasys he then proceeds to violently grip my face, his hand covering my mouth, and telling me to stop (I think he sweared or something, but not sure). To my memory this was one of/the only time he got violent, I was very hurt by this inncident, he didn't notice. Three years later he moved and changed schools, we haven't talked since. Now half year later, I doubt he was ever my friend to begin with I think he just feelt pity for me, I think the rest did too. There are two people I believe were geniune (at least a bit), one I haven't talked to in a while, the other is in my class, but I still feel like they don't really care about me the way I do them (If they ever killed somone I'd help cover it up).   


There is also my family. As I said we live in a isolated place, but I still got them right? Eh... I have two little sisters, a dad and a mom. When we were six or so the oldest of my sisters and me started fighting quite a bit. She then told my youngest sister not to play with me, this was sad as they were the only ones to play with, and so I was all alone. My sisters and me have periods where we like and don't like each other, but there has been driven a wedge between us, I could never trut them with my personal feelings, and we only ocasionally play games together. My mom and dad? Well remember those fights I talked about? Well my mom kinda has this idea in her head of a good family and what a good family do. A good family talks together, goes on trips together, play games together. So she took us on trips, but they were usually by car, hours sometimes over a day in a car packed liuke sardines (with tons of useless crap she always brought) disn't excatly make us friendly, we usually started of fine, us kids playing in the backseet, but she would scream and boss us not to constantly, we couldn't move we almost couldn't talk cause it got to loud (that may be normal and me just complaining, but I feelt more like she was treating us like diobedient dogs than kids), but three kids just can't sitt still for fifteen hours straight without doing anything. Then she would yell, she would get furious, screaming and yelling spitt flying everywhere (her mouth would literally start to foam a little). I would talk back, she would get hysterical telling me I was a disapointment and such, and how ""her"" kids shouldn't be like this (she kept saying ""her"" kids like she owned us), and how she acted better when she was young, this happened time and time again, eventually when I started feeling imense emotional distress, from for example her screaming at telling me how disapointing I was my emotions would simply turn off. Then everything would become humorous and I couldn't help enjoy the situation, saying things I knew would really hurt her and pressing just the right buttons to keep her going. Afterwards my emotions came back and I feelt bad, then she would be crying at my door telling me how sorry she was for all the things she had said. My mom always seemed so sad. I think that was partly my fault (or a lot my fault). This happened every trip, without exception, and afterwards she would cry and cry, I started locking my doors cause I didn't want to see her crying, but she would stand outside my door and beg me to open, I remember how her crying would just hurt and hunt me (I never let that show). This and how my mom couldn't keep her mouth shut about any secred at all, lead me not to trust her and ressent her. I now believe I have a deep hatred for bossy blond women (especially if they are thin), probably roted in my mother. I always liked my Dad bette, but he could  be violent when he got frustrated. I used to hear him and my mom fighting, her complaining and complaining, if he tried to escape into another room she'd be outside knocking and knocking while still complaining, she did the same to me or anyone she was angry with, she couldn't just leave people alone, yet she herself would get hysterical if not immideiatly left alone when she wanted to. This would eventually lead to him becoming so feed up he pushed her out of the way or something, her beeing so thin sometimes she would fall, she would then scream of how he punched her or something, sometimes shoes would be flying across the kitchen. Over the years my dad's fuse grew shorter and shorter, and he began snapping at my temper tantrums. I remember one christmas eve when I was draged down stairs and locked in my room, where I would be crying and cursing for him to lket me out. Now it's all a blur, but I think I was draged down those stairs a lot more than once, and the lock on my door now has kife/scisor marks. Because I learned to open the lock with a sharp knife or scisor (not an advanced lock), this did not cause the marks thought, no the marks were from when he got a special lock he once got that he could place inside the keyhole to keep me from opening it. I started panicking, but I still had the sicsors (or knife don't remember, think it was scisors though) so I started hacking away at the lock. Eventually I had started to chip away parts of this lock, but it was still stuck, so I started hacking at the keyhole making it wider to get the lock out. My dad has thrown the ocasional shoe or had his hand over my mouth to make me stop screaming (sometimes accidentally making it hard to breathe and me panic, making him tighten his grip), but he was almost never outright violent. It was always to controll or make me calmer. He used to intimidate me a lot thought coming running when I did sad something that really pissed him of or such. Eventually I got scared of him and any sudden movements would make me flicnh. He noticed this and it made him very sad, cause in the end he always loved me. But I did say ""almost"" never, he has hit or kicked me on two ocasions (or at least that I remember, but I have a good memory), one time he I can't remember, what I do remember though is that I'm pretty sure it was a kick and was simopy because I REALLY pissed him off. This also happened before the next ocasion. The next ocasion was my fault, I hit him first (then again I was 12, 13 or 14), well he hit me back. This was a good thing though as it didn't really hurt (I was still scared though), but I started becoming confident that in a few years I would be stronger than him. Since then things have gradually gotten better, I've gotten older and don't have temper tantrums so he doesn't get as angry anymore, and it's been quite a while since the last fight between him and my mom. Yet even though things get better I feel worse.  


I don't know when, but I've now lost the ability to cry more than a few tears at a time (unless about a trivial matter) or to simpl trully feel my burried emotions. Actually I think it may have been when my dog died a while ago. She was mys best friend in the whole worldk, she helped me through a lot. I tried to save her I carried her shaking bosy to the car, my mom drove, and I was petting my dog who had her head in my lap, but she stopped moving. I keept petting her, then I suspected she was dead, I calmly looked at her and opened her eyes. There was no reaction, I lightly tuched her eyes, and she didn't even blink. I then told my mom with a calm voice that it was no use. She was dead. My mom started crying sayiung sorry to me, I said I wanted to go home. I remember thinking that this wasn't hurting my dog, she had a happy life, and I hadn't wasted any time, I had been with her as much as  I could. This wasn't really a problem the dog was fine, she wasn't hurting, so why should I be sad. Then we went home and then I sleept. The night the next day I was able to cry a little, but I know there were some feelings buried that I wasn't able to feel. I never did feel those feelings. Recently my life has gotten better and better, right now it's pretty great, my family is happier, my new class is kinder, and we got a new dog who absolutely loves me (and I love her), but I don't feel that much better, and day by day I've been becoming a worse person. There have been ocasions where I've hit my mom, and my oldest sister when they have driven me over the edge. I'm getting pretty tired of my dad thought, telling me things like that I look like a drug adict, a day when I scratched a itch a lot, he keept saying it thought even when I made it apparent I didn't like it. Then again no one on this planet should feel sorry for me I deserve everything because I am a horrible person, I just got the puishment before I did the crime. Recently when I have gotten horny I couldn't controll myself and raped a horse and several chickens. The chickens died. I am a murderer and  rapist. They were innocent living creatures. I am not an innocent living creature and I deserve to die. Even though life was getting better, a while ago my family had a fight, but this time something had changed. This time I was actually a bad person. So I went outside in the middle of the night and jumped into the ocean with my clothes on. I'm too much of a coward though so I got out. I've done this a few times , and I've started cutting. Cutting seems to draw my attention to the cuts and and blood, adn away from my own mind.

Ever since I was in high school I always just belonged to groups, but I never truly felt like I had close friends with whom I could share my experiences the save way I saw other people do. After this, now that I am in college, these groups have grown apart, only the closest friends sticking together (of which I'm not a part of).

In college things are acting in much the same way as people connect but I fail to be someone more than just a guy, which doesn't seem to have ever been enough.

I do have a girlfriend though, of 3 years, but in this last few months we have had so much of a falling out and we just keep fighting which is breaking my heart.

But what breaks my heart the most is that every time that we have this falling out I find myself alone in my room, crying with no one to talk to, and I just feel so much worse since I feel that in much the same way that I am the cause of the falling out through my mistakes, I too am the cause for me being alone, and it just hurts.",lonely,I feel like I have no one - venting,2019-11-17 14:06:31

I’m struggling with my mental health, I’ve had problems for years and have been seeing a therapist for three. I’ve tried quite a few times to end therapy, especially when I’ve been feeling more stable. But I’ve not been successful yet. I was talking to my therapist about this, and I think it’s because I don’t have anyone outside of therapy I feel I can talk to.

It’s weird because I outwardly seem extraverted and have a wide social circle, but I feel very lonely. I have a hand full of people I think of as proper friends, and one to two I can sometimes talk to, if I include my mum lol. 
I moved cities half a year ago, so most of my friends don’t live near me anymore.

I find it hard to go from vague acquaintance to friend, and then to talk to people when I’m having a hard time is a whole other ordeal. I feel like I’m bothering them and they don’t really want to know. I see other people around me talking to each other when things go wrong, but I don’t know how they feel comfortable doing this.

Meanwhile, I know these other people have long-lasting friendships, the kind who would go for miles for each other sort of friendships. Where they can just be their true self and not have to cover up their true intentions or just to appease me - which, when i notice it occurring, would only serve to make me think “oh so you don’t feel close enough to be genuine with me”.

I hate this bullshit social environment where you’re expected to cover up your genuine wants and self to “get along” or accommodate to others.

1208,au_gold3872,1573930076,1,"I remembered when I was in 8th grade, we were going on an end of year trip to Canada. And everyone was finding their roommates and stuff, and I thought I was going to find a roommate but I unfortunately I didn't. Earlier, I made an agreement to be roommates with someone but they ended going with someone else. I also asked a friend if they wanted to be my roommate, because we were roommates in a different trip back in 6th grade. She already had someone to be with. I was sad that people didn't think of me, and that I was just being left out, which I now kind of realize that its kind of selfish to think of now because the world doesn't revolve around me. Something that I didn't realize in the past.

A week before the trip, we had a meeting to go over the rules and procedures, and what we were going to do. Our teacher told us to stand next to our roommate and I remember being the only person sitting down. It felt really embarrassing. People were looking at me, someone told me to stand up and just stand next to someone, but I didn't want to do that, it would feel awkward. It really hurt cause I felt like I didn't exist to people. I had friends in school but I thought I existed to them. But I didn't know I was going to be left out like this. When everyone left the room, I told the teacher that I didn't have a roommate and he told me that he would set me up with someone on the attendance sheet. It really hurt that I couldn't find my own roommate. When I got home, I called my mom and cried to her and I told her that I didn't want to go on this trip anymore. I told her that I didn't have anyone, and that I was all by myself. My mom convinced me to go and I ended up going. I was really scared, and I didn't want to go at all. I just wanted to stay home. I cried cause I'm a sensitive, I get upset easily.

We were going to this college in Canada to stay in for 3 nights I think. The first day we got there, our teacher was calling out the names on the attendance sheet for the roommates. He called this girl's name and it was followed by my name being called next to her's. Turns out she didn't have a roommate either. She didn't show up to the last trip meeting. To be honest, I felt huge weight lift off my shoulders. I knew the girl, and she's very nice to me. I was not that close with her, but it felt good to finally have a roommate. 

Although this story ended on a good note, I sometimes still struggle with the same problem of feeling like I don't exist to people. The same thing still happens where people will go to other's first, and I'm like the ""leftover person.""

How do you deal with your loneliness? I mean, I'm starving for some kind of human interaction, of any kind,and I'm not usually the angry bird in a group of people, quite the opposite, gentle af, sometimes you get when I'm pissed of cause I could become pretty straightforward, but it ends there.
Anyways, I have a bizzillion things to do, and all I can do instead is peek on insta or here for some kind of talkative mate. Should I forcibly out myself into doing things? does it work this way? how do you deal with it?

1219,greasyhandle7,1573921873,1,"  

I’m a guy living in India, currently training for competitive exams (and some other stuff). I consider myself decent looking; neither exactly handsome nor ugly, just average. I have never been in a relationship before, and I don’t mind being in a relationship but I’m not actively looking for a girlfriend. I was never a good conversation starter but I can make people laugh frequently, and I never tried to hit on anyone because I didn’t want relationships to hinder my grades in university. Girls usually drop subtle hints at me but I ignore them because I am dumb and realize hints later.

I have a pretty small group of friends, but only 1 close friend (male buddy) and among my friends, there’s a girl who is also single and never had a relationship before. A brief introduction of her; she’s pretty, but not too much, smart, maybe extrovert, great conversationalist, bonds with people very well, caring and all that. Many of my colleagues and classmates often talk to her, and she talks back pretty normally, some frequently hit on her but she rarely flirts back. Although I know many guys who actively have a crush on her and I think she’s unaware of them. As of now according to my knowledge, she’s isn’t seeing anyone either. Let’s call her Natasha.

So we’ve been studying together through our Bachelors and Masters, but she’s in my friend circle since the Masters (last 2 years). My close buddy is a very good friend of her because he’s in relationship with her friend. I used to make everyone laugh when we were hanging out or having lunch, etc. Everyone talked freely to me but my close friend (let’s call him Karan) was the more preferred one; meaning, if someone in my group has to start a conversation or ask a question, they would look and speak to Karan first. On the attractive scale Karan and I would rank pretty much the same except, he’s more charismatic. And btw, most of the friends in my group are female (except me and Karan).

So Natasha, rarely starts a conversation with me, and the conversations are usually short and brief and sometimes we would laugh over a joke. Even if I started a conversation, she would terminate it after a short time. When we would part ways after a hangout she would wave bye to everyone except me, or unless I waved first at her. She doesn’t like me romantically except for that one time when she dropped every possible hint at me in one day. I replied well to those hints and we connected well, but the next day she didn’t look at me when we met, instead she talked to and joked around my friend Karan, and unless I spoke to her, she didn’t look at me. Even if we talked in a group, she would always turn towards Karan after looking at me for a brief second. This, didn’t happened once, but numerous times, everyone treated me the same except her. She will always speak or ask Karan first about anything, even though Karan and I spend most of our time together throughout the day because we go to classes together.

I’ve never tried to hit on her, I like her as a friend but it only occurred to me once that maybe I could be in a relationship with her. So once I tried to talk to her frequently but she didn’t seem interested so I backed off; only I would start the conversation. I did not hit on her since then. 

Skipping to today, it’s her birthday, and I was invited too but I didn’t wanna go because I did not want to be ignored again. But I had to go since she treats me as her friend and I had no legit excuse. I tried to play it cool and treat her the same as everyone and talk to her but, damn, nothing changed, and I was being ignored and overshadowed by Karan. Now, the thing is, if she hates me, why would she invite me. Or if she just treats me as a friend, why doesn’t she talk to me normally. Also, if there is something off and/or weird about me, why don’t my other female friends treat me the same as Natasha. It throws me off every time. Does she have a crush on Karan? Or does she dislikes me in particular. Or, she’s afraid that I might sway her into having a relationship with me. I don’t like the way she treats me and its bothering me to my core.",lonely,I (24 M) am constantly being ignored by a particular female friend (24 F) among my friend circle.,2019-11-17 03:31:13

I rarely ask for much in life. But feeling accepted and even loved by someone would make my day a few times better.

Sure im young and have time, But whats the point in having time if you are just gonna spend it alone yearning for things that you dont know will come? I dont get along with people my age, So I find myself talking to older people in random discord servers and find myself out of place.

Published November 16th, 2019 
To Who It May Concern and To Whom Will Help. 

My name is Paul Anthony Bergen-Wayman. I am a gay boy who needs a mate. For the past 8 years I have cried reclusively, and have become more than broken, I have become fractured as my 20's burn away crying &amp; surviving. Without sharing my life with him, I am living a life or romantic deprivation. This chapter of my life needs to end. 
 
Using a combination of dating sites, forums, events, and both online and offline communication, I haven't fallen in love no matter how friendly and affectionate I was. 

I have been deprived of so much due to not having a SO. I have dropped out of college, I have disassociated from organizations, I have been terminated from jobs. I have been deprived of countless simple pleasures because I am all alone. I have been deprived of normal human activities and a career path. Due to a series of circumstances and bad directions my true self is now buried under a overburden of despair and despondency. 

I am done with platonic relationships, and have given up on the insanity that love will just happen when I least expect it, or that one of my plattonic gay friend will blossom into a boyfriend. Crying for romance has become a daily affirmation. My friends know full well that I cry for love and I need love. 

There is nothing to live for if I'm not monogamously coupled. You will not change my mind on this. I am dead set on being a SO to another male. Denying this is existential fraud, and a violation of my true essence. 

I have cried enough. Each Christmas, I yearn to make out with him under the mistletoe, and each Christmas I have been deprived of this and countless other simple pleasures. 

Last Call. If I don't consider myself monogamously coupled by December 24th, 2019, I am going to truncate my life.  I will disappear into the night to end this deprived, miserable experience. Eight years of searching for a boyfriend and false starts, flings &amp; dates will culminate in a dead body, an idea, and the worst Xmas present imaginable - if I am not monogamously coupled by Christmas Day 2019. 

Where is the minority who know what they have before it's gone? Where are the gay males also crying for love?

1248,amistupidhelpme,1573883762,1,"I don't know how to even start this, so I will give some tl:dr then go into detail.

I have no real friends, I hate my family as no one respects, and I don't understand how emotionless I become at times.

I am currently a college freshman, and throughout the years, I have honestly not found a single person I can trust with my secrets, not even my family. Although I do have some ""friends"", I view all these friendships as fake and just for benefits. I am also social awkward af, but I do believe that I treat anyone I meet with respect. I feel like people think I am unapproachable and I can't change it. So my social life is a complete 0.

My family... well, that's a whole other story on a entirely different level. I really wouldn't care much about my social issues if it wasn't for this, which elevates it 20 times more. Basically, I am the youngest of 3 boys, and ever since i could remember, I have always been bullied, disrespected, looked down up, ignored, etc... by my family. It's just insane. When my brothers bully me, my parents would always excuse is as ""playing"" with me and having fun, no matter what I told them they would just trust in my brothers and believe I am overthinking it(more to this later on). At times, I'd ask my parents for permission to do something, for instance, play video games(with my brothers, ironically),(on the weekend), and I would be refused, my brother would go then to ask, literally 60seconds after me, and my parents allow them. This may seem like a really stupid example, but it kept happening over and over again.
Also, my opinion for anything is always ignored. If I decide to do something, but my parents tell me otherwise, and I dont listen, and I fail, they blame me. BUT, EVEN IF I FREAKEN LISTEN TO THEM, and fail, THEY STILL FREAKEN BLAME ME. My brothers always get treated better and I am constantly treated like trash and has to listen to ever single order.
Another thing, my parents ALWAYS compare me to my brothers, which is expected, the worst part is, when I do something good, and compare myself to them, I would be blasted about how I shouldnt compare myself to them and I dont know what they have gone through.
Another thing, I am commuting to college, by my parents decision, and even with that my mom puts in the absolute most minimum freaken effort she can to cook, so 99% of the time I cook for myself. I wouldn't be irritated if she didn't cook fresh meals every weekend when my brothers are around. (Both my brothers now dorm at college). It irritates me even more that when I think about how when my brother used to commute similarly, my mom cooked for him EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. And it pisses me off every day. It doesn't end there, even when she cooks for me, I have never gotten home and ever found the food to be hot. I had to heat it every single time. this seems stupid, but coming back after 12 hours out of home I would love if my parents did something to make me feel at home, but they never do. I always spend my time in my room doing whatever, I avoid sitting down with my family because THEY MAKE FUN OF ME EVERY DAMN TIME, REGARDLESS. I also have to mention that my parents create these weird f,'ed up problems from the smallest things, and then pin it in me, making me feel even more alienated. They do whatever they can just to make fun of me and they always just brush it off when they are wrong.

To further add to that, I personally believe I am mentally stable as I am always calm and never show my anger/emotions, ever. I believe I have anxiety as my heart rate sky rockets whenever someone calls for me without tell me why before hand, I always think I'm going to get into trouble knowing full well I did nothing wrong, but my heart still races. 

TL:DR : no social life, hate my family
No one, not even my family, understand what I am going through or my emotions

...It's hard to put into words (especially after a bottle of wine) the odd position I find myself in although I feel this might be the one place people can relate.

I am one of those people who relied heavily on drink and drugs in my youth to 'open me up' and all my friendships were built on being under the influence. The most harrowing part was the hangover. I would often be stuck at a random persons house and have to make small talk with the crippling sense of anxiety only heightened by the hangover. The words ""you're more fun when you're drunk"" were uttered more than once leading to a sense of feeling uncomfortable when sober. This drove me down a dark path that left me feeling more and more alone the heavier my habits became. The penultimate moment was being in a Tescos at 11am in a onesie and sunglasses, so high I couldn't understand the concept of paying for the items I had dragged to the till. I decided then that I would no longer drink or get high just to feel comfortable in social situations.

I am now 31, my career has never been better. I found my calling in my late 20's (engineering) and have never looked back. My problem lies in socialising, I never feel close to people apart from my partner (over 10 years as of Feb 2019). I avoid parties, I rarely hang out with other blokes and I am quite happy to stay in every night by myself and watch tv, read or study. 

Fast forward to the last two weeks and me and my partner are on the rocks. I've been asked by her to move out without her and feel completely lost. The same weekend she announced I should leave I started my dream job as a design engineer. I've been thrown into a state of emotional turmoil and suddenly realised that my lack of friends has never been more apparent. To the point I am coming onto reddit to put my life story into a post in a failed hope that my emotions have relevance to anyone but myself...I am worried that by being this loner, recluse I have now doomed myself to a life of solitude through my own making. Should I have tried to be more 'one of the lads' and kept a life outside my relationship? 
This is only made worse by the fact we were due to be married in Feb next year. With me planning to move us out to our own place with our rescue cat that is lying next to me now. After a few calculations I worked out that we could not afford to move out on just my salary (my fiance is a PhD student) and I asked that she dropped to part time and got a job to help support us. This drove the divide and her decision to ask me to leave. Now I am losing a future wife and my cat all in the same week as my new job. 

I am feeling a little overwhelmed by it all and just wanted to put out there. I'm not looking for pity or support. I just want to start a conversation with people again. Maybe reconnect with the concept of friendship with other people, outside a relationship...",lonely,I'll miss my cat...,2019-11-16 08:41:53

I wish I could talk to people normally and have a conversation but I can’t. People tell me that I need to push myself towards doing this and break out of my comfort zone. I don’t value small talk at all because it feels meaningless but that’s the only way I think you get friends in a setting where you barely know each other. 

It’s getting worse because I’m a year 3 college student and I feel this is the only time I can actually try and build relationships. After that there’s nothing for me. This is what leads to my suicidal thoughts, I have nobody now and I won’t have anyone in the future. I always focus on the idea that someone will come and break me out of my isolation so that I may become a normal person. It just hasn’t happened yet and I’m losing hope in that ever happening.

It’s the worst thing in life to be honest. People act like they care or understand you but they don’t because I really don’t believe they’ve had to feel this way before.

I am an 18 year old college drop out who, while in college for 2 months, had made very little friends. All of my friends from high school broke up and went our separate ways before some of us hooked up again which isn’t really what I wanted since these people and I don’t really click too well but what can ya do. Anyway I’m just now realizing with help from some rather rude people that the reason I’m so pathetically rejected by everyone is my awful and condescending personality. I grew up with so little to show for that I get very cocky and very into correcting people. I really don’t wanna do this and when I get really close to people it changes to what I consider a hidden compassion but rarely do people see that and from face value I look like the local dickhead who thinks he’s smarter then people when in truth I’m actually kind of dumb. 

My cynic but secretly very libertarian views cause such a problem for me and have always made me push away from people to the point of my anti social tendencies showing to everyone, ignoring party invitations, playing video games in my room all the time and requiring no social interaction for days on end. My father and step mother truly don’t understand the problems I’ve got and assume I’m just some lazy kid who doesn’t care about real life at all when I really do and wanna get back into life having fun with people and honestly all I can do now is look back on the little relationships I’ve had in nostalgia and wonder what I could’ve done to make them better instead of getting out there to be better and make new ones. 

I decided today that I’m going to make amends and begin showing my compassion to everyone at any stakes. I’ll begin fixing my personality to be the more laid back guy who anyone can go to instead of the cynic asshole who honestly isn’t fun to hang with.

I'm not here to sell anything, i don't even know how to do it. But the thing i know is that i need you, the whole world needs you as never before.  
How they say? A stitch in time saves nine?  


So I'm working on an app project coined as **EUPHORIA**.   
**The mission is to rewire human connections** as they should be. Today even if we're connected we're lonely like never before. It will be a new form of social network, a virtual social network. The promise is that no one will feel lonely again. No one will feel left out. There will be space and voice for everyone. Direct connections, made with a simple but ingenious filtering and matching system. I've decided to take act and for once do a good thing by letting this application, when it's ready, to be of the public domain. It will be very interesting to see what it will become, shaped by humanity, shaped by heart. I wish i could give in details, but for now trust me please. It can't change the world without your help.  


**What could you do?**  
Anything of what you come up, it's already a help. By being the voice of it, by helping spreading the word and letting others know that this idea really exists and will happen. Or maybe if you think you have some sort of skills that might contribute somehow. That would be amazing! All of it is already amazing.  


 **We are the voice, we are the power of the change!** Not a mere product of history. No! We are the history!  


I've made a server on Discord [Euphoria](https://discord.gg/b6WWWX4) . Jump in and let me know what you think about it, i will be really to hear it!

I was a novelty for about a week and then all of those kids just ignored me for most of the year. What’s more is that all my other friends (and I had a lot of friends) completely forgot I exist. So basically I would go to Japanese school, humiliate myself for the umpteenth time, and then have no one to fall back on. Me and my American friends were hanging out less and less, and it was always up to me to initiate any hang outs. Eventually it got too much for me, especially when I would say “hey! Let’s go to the next train station over, it’ll be fun!” “Nah, I’m too lazy 😝” and then finding out they went somewhere even further with another friend was soul-crushing. It was exhausting to have to carry these friendships on my shoulders alone so I just let them all fall away. I enrolled in an online school when Japanese school was over, and ever since then I haven’t had any friends with one exception.
I reconnected with three of my old school friends, one of the guys fell “in love” with me, I broke his heart and moved back to the states, and now I’m lower than ever. I have no friends. Every time I see someone around my age, I seize  up. I don’t remember how to talk to people.

That day in particular my mom told me she didn’t order my pills for that month, this wasn’t life or death or psych meds, and she then started ripping apart the house to find the bottle of pills she had said an hour prior she never ordered and demanded I stay with her and look, however I didn’t want to hear about how I’m worthless scum while looking for pills that don’t exist so I left and then she threatened to kill herself and when I came back she had started smoking cigarettes again. So yea, I should’ve just let her berate me for another hour or so? Longer than that? There’s also the time she drained my bank account without telling me to buy clothes, cigarettes and casino time. My family had been nice to me since, mostly, but I will honestly never forgive them for perpetrating and enabling that abuse. Deep down I hate them and always will. I also feel like they’ll never see me as a woman, even though most strangers see me that way I know my family will always view me as a deluded man they tolerate and a burden",lonely,I have people in my life but no one I really want in my life,2019-11-15 14:14:50

1370,AndreaToosti,1573777666,1,"ok,that's actually my first post on reddit and the first time i actually try to recount myself.

I'm  from Italy, i remember primary school as a idyllic period of my life, i got two soulfriends , however i still got in mind when i used to seek refuge alone during free time, loneliness was is in my dna.

Then after primary school, we didn't hang out no more,because of my lazyness and paranoid.

Since 4 years old, i goes to a camping during summer, it made me make lots of  close friends that i see and i hang out with every  July and August, i use to meet some of them during winter as well.

Middle school was a such an hell,due to the fact i was timid and very sensitive, people started to bully me .

this has been happened for the first year and half of the second till i decited to change personality, repressing emotions: this made me make friens,  i  have hung out with some of them during some liceal years.

As i said, i have hung out with these with a couple of years, i broke up with them 'cause i was getting bored.

During  4th liceal school,  i used to go to birthdays ' parties and i used to get drunk, these were the only occasions for me to have a social life.

My parent used to scold me because of my loneliness and the lack of my social life since 12 years old.

Even though i don't go out that much, i have had a girlfriend for 2 mouth (we're still friends) and i have few great friends.

Thanks to internet, i have known some great friends as well,  with who i use to write with.

i spent the most of my time on internet,laying in my bed.

i'm 18 years old, today is my birthday lmao, and i'm doing the last liceal school year.

1382,thisismyopinionbitch,1573767457,1," At age 19, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m better off by myself. I’ve grown to enjoy my own company. In fact, I prefer it. I’m learning to love myself and I’ve found peace in what I’ve always wanted to change. I’m stuck with me and I’m honestly okay with it. People don’t understand why I like to be this way. They think I’m just depressed or stuck up. I do struggle with depression and isolation is how I cope, but I’ve always genuinely valued my own space. I can be myself by myself. I can be silent, loquacious, elated, melancholic, or angry without it effecting anyone else because its just me.

I like being social as well. I love parties, standing out in my own unique style, and meeting new people. I enjoy being the life of the party. I have a very sweet and welcoming personality. It’s magnetic and pure, but seems to attract those who really don’t give a fuck about me. I’ve always felt like an emotional landfill where others unloaded all their shit. They don’t selflessly care about me or how I feeI. They just want my validation. If I were compensated for the time I’ve regretfully invested into being people’s personal therapist, I’d be smoking a fatass J on a multi-million yacht to the Maldives. By myself of course. Whose fault is that? Mine, I’m aware. I’m too nice and understanding. But I’m practicing assertiveness although it takes time. I know how fickle people can be so I no longer have expectations to avoid disappointment. I understand that nobody owes me anything. I don’t have friends either- only people I occasionally hang out with to meet my quota of human interaction. I even find texting and talking on the phone draining. I hate partaking and I rarely do. People are truly exhausting. I can only take them in doses, preferably when I’m stoned. 

 At this point, I just feel numb when I’m around others. I can’t connect with them at all. Not even my dysfunctional family makes me feel whole. I don’t even like hugs or to be touched. I’ve never had a romantic relationship because I truly cannot see myself spending the rest of my life with someone else. I’ve had countless opportunities and still do, but I just know they won’t suit me. I lose interest too quickly and they always value my appearance over who I am. Nothing more, always less. I want to know how it feels to fall in love at least once. I enjoy and want to have sex too. But in order to do all of that, you have to comb through so much bullshit. So many users, abusers, and entitled losers who I refuse to willingly give my time. Not anymore. I’m done censoring myself for the sake of not being able to muster enough energy to defend my thoughts and values. I’m done forcing myself around others just to feel human. I just don’t care anymore. I don’t want pity or sympathy. I don’t hold any grudges or resentment at all. This is my choice and I’m sure others make it as well. If something real is destined to come along, then I’ll encounter it then. But for now, I’m all I could possibly need.",lonely,"Me, myself, and I",2019-11-15 08:37:37

For the vast majority of my life, I've been single. I would look with a jealous eye at others who had beautiful, loving relationships. I would watch movies and TV that had these beautiful love stories that I so badly want in my life. I would see beautiful women everywhere, and want to talk to them but figured they've been through enough shit, so I don't want to add to it, especially from someone like me who isn't conventionally attractive. Despite that shit, over the years, I'm learning to love myself more and more with each day. I'm still learning in general and trying to be the best person I can be. I'm not perfect, nor obviously, will I ever be. But I still want someone to love, and a loving, team effort, supportive relationship. I still *need* that love...

Come this week where I have a really awesome first date. We had an awkward cute kiss at the end. I was nervous as fuck the entire time. I knew I wanted to see her again as soon as possible. I felt a connection, both of us are refreshingly honest with each other, and it just felt *good*. We talked for hours on the phone the next night and the night after that.

But that's kind of where the problem began.

Having been so fucking lonely for so many fucking years hurts so fucking bad. I do my best to live life with this pain, via medication, via therapy, but man, it rears its ugly fucking head from time to time. It manifests itself by being pushy and needy. I can't even help it. At times it feels like I'm not even in control and I'm watching this horror show from far away. This fear of losing that connection becomes life and death-like. Panic ensues, anxiety takes over, can't think straight, can't sleep well, simply can't function properly, and so I do really stupid shit. And of course, it pushes that person away. Understandably so. Rightfully so.

And so I sit alone again, just wondering why the fuck I can't control that pushy and needy urge, why after so many years of therapy and books and meditation or whatever the fuck I've been doing to try and better myself, why can't I control it? It feels like I'm just stuck with it forever. It feels like a permanent flaw that permanently pushes potential relationships away.

1392,battlestations_1,1573757530,1,"Firstly, if anyone ever wants a chat, I'm here.

I am so fucking lonely and so jealous of pretty much everyone I know as they are all so popular. It's pathetic really, but it's the truth.

I've had stages in my life where I was quite popular. At the end of secondary school and at university were just the time of my life. I had so much social stuff going on I could pick and choose and turn stuff down. I never stopped getting calls and messages. 

After university was a tough time as I went from living with and next to loads of good friends, to being isolated back at the family home. Still, I knew enough people locally, and my uni relationships were still strong, that I always had things to do, albeit not so regularly.

And then at the age of 27 two things happened. 1) I entered the corporate world and 2) I got married. Both things changed me completely, mainly that I lost a heck of a lot of confidence. Both things were very tough, and I suffered a lot of anxiety and depression. Because of that, I let go of all my previous relationships and isolated myself.

My career and marriage are now both pretty good. But I am just not the same person. How do I know this? I cannot make a new friend to save my life. I try hard, I really do. Probably too hard and I've scaled that back, but still nothing. I am universally known as a ""nice guy"" but not nice enough that people want to spend time with me.

I have tried reconnecting with a couple of old friends, guys I was super close to (one I lived with for 2 years), and both times it was just super awkward. I've heard nothing from them since. 

I would say I've only got 1 real friend left, and he lives a long way from me. Other than him, I honestly don't remember the last time someone asked to see me. 

It hurts, it really hurts. 

I work in a team with a bunch of guys my age. We all get on well and have a laugh, but I am still the odd one out as they all share big common interests like football, and boxing, and mainstream music etc.. I have my own individual tastes, I always have, and that will never change. But I am not arrogant or judgemental,  and never push my views. I sometimes think maybe I should force myself, or pretend to like, the same things as them all, so they'd like me more? Every time I ask one if they want to grab a beer, its always a no. I've stopped asking. I dread the Friday ""what's everyone doing this weekend"". Each one of them will have some awesome social event going on. Me, its always going out with my wife, or staying in alone if she's going out with her friends. If that's what's happening I tell them a made up story of something cool I've got going on.

I've even started doing the things I never thought I'd do - go to the cinema, to the pub etc.. on my own. Just to get out the house when I'm so lonely. 

I've started to really despise myself. I am just so socially awkward and have such low self confidence these days. I need to do something, but I don't know what. I need to learn how to make people gravitate towards me again, and to not push them away. I am kind, trustworthy and loyal, and go out of my way for anyone who needs it. I'm not even asking for all that, just a couple of people I can meet for a chat and a drink if needed, and a couple of people who would ask me to do the same.

Whenever i “make a new friend” or anything it dies out really really quickly. it’s so painful to see this happen to my and i really wish i could blame it on someone else but i can’t because that’s not fair and it only can be my fault. i just want to go back to the times when i was happy and not alone. i guess that’s not going to happen any time soon though.",lonely,I’ve slowly lost everyone i have in my life.,2019-11-15 02:54:15
1400,Geoz_Vidra,1573746806,1,"At the moment I'm writing this I'm in pain so I'll vent. I've felt pain for many things; feeling stuck, seeing friends going away from my path, being lovesick, having horrible intrusive thoughts, self-inflicted injuries and just plain old anxiety attacks, but this time I just feel desperate enough that I, a person that is shy even online, that gets nervous when chatting and can't normally do it, wants to scream into the void of the internet, with some hope.

The pain that's been consuming my flesh is caused because of a breakup I had three months ago with my first girlfriend. Two years nine month long relationship btw.

I am seeing the person I love the most, who has loved my heart and my first friend very much in many years, moving away as far and as fast as she can. And I get that it won't be the same as before, I'm ok with just being a friend like she asked me to be because I just want to see her grow and be happy, I want to see her smile and make her proud. 

A day ago at night I saw one picture of her through a third party that published the photo, she looked stunning, she made the changes to her hair that she always told me she wanted and that I always supported her to get, she was dressed with a beautiful black leather jacket and red lipstick, smiling genuinely because she wanted and not because her mother was pushing her to. I felt happy for her, she looked great, not all her problems where solved but she was pushing through and she would make it, there I realized how much I still love her. 

At the same time I felt my throat combusting, it wasn't even my heart (that was beating like crazy but it didn't pain me as much, idk maybe it just went numb) but what I had used all those times to calm her down from her severe anxiety attacks and ptsd, my voice and words. It hasn't stopped burning since yesterday, like a candle getting kindled, burning everything near and above, my vocal cords and my head.

She is happier without me and the farther she goes she seems to be better, I feel that she hates me, I fear that she hates me, anyone could take my place and be better at what I had put my heart and soul on for almost three years and help her better than I never could. I have no value as a friend, because even if she told me that you wanted me to stay as a close friend  she still pushed me away further and further like it was no problem. I'm replaceable, meaningless and disposable as I had always thought.

I just want to cry but my tears can't come out, to scream and shout I want to know that I'm still here, I want someone to acknowledge that I exist even if I have to shred my throat and vocal cords, but I can't, no sound comes but I'm still screaming. The candle on my throat doesn't stop burning, but maybe my hands could extinguish such a candle if they press hard enough.

I'm tired and also scared, I don't feel more pain, but my heart has been unable to feel anything since some days ago. I don't want to stop feeling, I don't want to disappear from my own mind.

If I stop feeling anything entirely I just prefer dying while I'm still myself; the lovesick and love-struck, always memeing bastard that loved acting and talking like Ralsei, that always tried and hammered his head to use the correct words to make anyone that he could make feel a bit better, feel a bit better, that coward that always practiced in his head what he was gonna say a thousand times and then sometimes got to scared to say a word, that 18 year-old child that laughed at any joke as hard as he could while banging any near table. I can't go back to being a husk again, I don't want to.

I don't even know if I really want to die, I just want to be a friend, her friend. I'm so sorry.",lonely,The burning of a candle,2019-11-15 02:53:26

I went to school and forced a smile for my peers and friends, of which very few acknowledged my birthday (not that I feel entitled to it), and then after school, I went to work and forced a smile for my co-workers and the customers I served. Don't get me wrong; there were a few things that happened today that made me smile. My co-workers told me happy birthday, a few even sang to me, my ma brought me a birthday card and a balloon during my shift, and a few customers told me happy birthday. But that was really it. After that, I sort of just came home in a depressive and tired trance like I usually do. No party or anything, I haven't the friends for that, no special conditions of any kind. I don't know. I hate to seemed entitled, but I guess I just wish I felt wanted and appreciated on my birthday for once. My friends wouldn't even play a game with me, something we usually always do together anyway. They were just busy, or at least they said they were. At the end of the day, yes some people did acknowledge that I existed and that it was my birthday, but I still ended up coming home alone and depressed with nothing else about my day really changing. I'm still the same old depressed and lonely loser I always am, and nobody seemed to care all that much as usual. I could tell everybody said nice things out of the obligation that it was my birthday. I could tell they didn't really care. But again, I guess I shouldn't have expected anything. I always expect something to go my way for once, and then I still get disappointed when it always ends out of my favor. Maybe I'm just being selfish, though. I don't know. I just wish I had somebody that loved me to join me at my house where I get surprised by all my friends and family being there with balloons and streamers and cake and stuff, just there for me to let me know they care and are proud of me for making it this far. But I guess commodities like that just weren't in my soul contract.

A little bit of my background: I currently live in USA and I'm originally from a country that doesnt speak english very well. I moved to US at 12.

I came to America and when I started middle school, I hang out with kids that speak my language and it was generally fun. Some girls had a crush on me and I liked a girl too but we never really got together haha. In middle school, I just focused more on my family than friends so i had fun with my family

My first 2 years of HS was great to be honest. I made a lot of friends who were from asia like me and we used to hang out a lot. It was so fun... I would sometimes even randomly visit my friends house haha. We would hang out after school, and also after summer school. For relationships, still none. However, there was another girl who was interested in me and i was also interested in her but we barely talked haha. 

However, after my 2nd year of HS, i moved to a different part of the state (so still in the US) and my last 2 years of HS was shit. I did have friends I eat lunch with but i never really hang out after school, and right now i work &amp; go to college. Currently, I have... basically no one. I do sorta have friends at work and school (mostly work) but I am not close enough to hang with them. I dont even talk to my old friends I used to have back in first 2 yrs of HS...

And yes, I still never had a gf or been to parties (ik parties are stupid but it feels like ive missed out).

1446,TootyXD,1573689423,1,"So here's the story about my life so far. Gonna be pretty eventful and I'm struggling through it all. 


My parents were highschool lovers (as I've been told) and when my mom was 17 she decided it was a good fucking idea to get pregnant. So stuff led to other stuff and BAM I was born.


Years later and my dad wasn't in my life AT ALL until something tragic happened. My grandmother on my mother's side passed away with me in the bed with her, only me. My mom sent me to live with my grandma on my dad's side that day(I hate that a tragedy like that happened for me to be set free, I escaped a life of depression)


So days later and it's the funeral, my mom put my other 2 younger brothers in the car with her but 5 year old me? I had to ride with someone else. (Note: I was supposed to have 3 younger brothers but one died from asphyxia at birth and he was supposed to be my twin, at least that's what I've been told)


So years later and I'm going through many hardships in my life. Grandpa on my mom's side also passed away, I get retained in the fifth grade, I get bullied ALOT in middle school.


Then my mom thought it would be a great decision to take me from my other grandparents when I'm 12( I'm just starting puberty so holy hell am I confused about EVERYTHING). I ran away for the first time and went missing for 2 weeks. Until I'm found and my mom just takes me to her apartment.


She had a new boyfriend and he was TERRIBLE. he made us do everything for him(like taking out the trash in the rain at 3am and sweeping up trash in the snow without a jacket and long pants) and my mom didn't have her own opinions, he made every decision for her. Until one day I started rebelling, I failed all my classes and tests from 7th grade to 9th and miraculously made it to 10th. I showed literally no emotions and had a grin on my face 24/7 They stuck me in a room with no blanket, mattress or even a pillow, and I couldn't come out no matter what, not even to eat.


This goes on for 4 years, I'm 16 now and ever since President's day of this year I've been back living with my grandparents on my dad's side. It's fun and all but I don't have my own room, nor do I have a bed, and a loving father. He's still as distant as always.


I dont know if I can take the pain anymore, I'm not suicidal but feel as if i will snap and hurt someone else or myself. And therapy isn't an option.",lonely,In need of a dear friend,2019-11-14 10:57:03

Lately , my boyfriend broke up with me as well because my parents don’t allow us to see each other since I’m 17 and they believe it’s not something I should be occupied with at this age.

1460,chocok0,1573678319,1,"Since I was a kid I didn't have many friends, I'm on the spectrum and socializing isn't always easy.

However, things got downhill 2 years ago. I used to live with my mother, and after she died I started living with my grandparents. I was 14 at the time, still in middle school. 

Bullies were kinda harsh, but I kinda deserved it. In the first year of high school, I was tired of my grandmother's complaints, so I tried to make friends. Ngl she is the worst. I remember when she yelled at me for wanting to party for my birthday, how she was ashamed of me, how she used a bell to call me and got upset every time I came late.

But, yeah I really tried hard to make friends without any success. Then it was the time of my cat. And later on, of my grandfather. 

Then I had no other choice but to move with my dad. Well, I changed everything. I changed myself. At first, it wasn't easy, but I have friends now and I met my gf, the cutest person in this whole world. But every time i look at my reflection, I hate it.

I think about how much I hurt myself, only to fulfill those expectations. Now I watch my dad when he comes home late. I greet him and have dinner. He's so...distant. I know he loves me, but sometimes I'm so frustrated. I get good grades, I smile and I'm positive, but he's never impressed. When I mess up, he gets anxious. 

Lately, I've been feeling very angry without reason. I yell at teachers or go to the bathroom to punch the wall.  Last time i yelled out of the window and started crying and at last, i threw up. 

So even if I have people who ask me how I feel and care about me, i feel like I don't belong. I don't know how i would make it without my gf, and if it was just like last year, i would have probably stopped going to school.",lonely,i'm so tired,2019-11-14 07:51:59

I was again having the need to tray and chat up some woman on reddit that can be found all over the different dating subreddits. No results but 1, so good enough i guess compared to the usual quota you have in writing to woman whilst not having the six sixes that one needs to be worth the time of day. Our chat went pleasant and we quickly ended up over on Discord shortly before i arrived back home. Once i send here a nice and fresh picture, all nice and skillfully showing of my lack of skill of photo shooting and not best looking of faces. Then i get some silence, she did mention she had some issues of her own so i suspected that her mentioned anxiety had flashed up. Nope i got a short ""Sorry you are not my type"". Well that ended nice and quick, at least she hold true afterwards on sending that return picture she had promised in her post, not like oh so many trash woman who only take and never treat others with respect as they are oh so much of a princess.   


That acquaintance i had to let go was simply unable to talk with my mentally sick and socially hindered friend. That friend has severe depression and is really lonely for years now so his social skills aren´t the best. They were chating for several days now with my friend really trying hard and trying with all might to have a good friendly conversation, staying clean of politics or other conflict themes. No success, the acquaintance was condescending, rude and in the end so far left and almost social justest warrior that he called my friend a nazi for having minor disagreements (and the disagreements my friend without more than 3 messages got scolded / corrected on, without any issue.) and when i tryed to ask the acquaintance about his side of the story, he ripped the issues out of context and ended up calling me a nazi as well and to never have kids.

I have recently been noticing this that has been happening but then again there hasn’t been many times where I haven’t been invited to social events so I suppose this might’ve been happening longer than I realize.

TLDR; I tend to cry after social events and I have no idea why. Whether I’m social myself or not, I’ll feel a wave of sadness and loneliness during or after the event. 

Longer story: 

I think the first time I felt like this was when I entered college. I made friends with someone and invited them to hang out with me after class to an arcade/restaurant that’s right next door to the campus. The whole time while I hung out with her, I felt sadness. I felt alone even when I was hanging out with her. I kept up my excitement as I internally just wanted to leave. I tried hanging out with her again and the outcome was the same. I brushed it off as me just not being able to connect with her. 

Another time I remember is last year when I went to my first work holiday party. It was at a buffet restaurant and I sat at a table with coworkers I rarely talked to. But, I managed to talk with them, play bingo and even won the first round. and even though I had a pretty good time, the moment I got home made me feel like I was wearing a mask the whole time. 

The second time I hung out with my coworkers was for a farewell party for coworkers as they were moving back to Japan after helping out with the transition that my work had from one company to the other. It was a lot worse compared to the holiday party. I rarely talked, only spoke when spoken to and ate food as I watched K-Pop videos that were on auto play in the Korean BBQ we celebrated at. I really wanted to cry. Female Coworkers around the same age as me didn’t invite me to the bathroom as they used it to take pictures together. Luckily, it was a 3 minute walk from my house so after it was over, I must’ve spent time in my bathroom crying and trying to calm down and understand why I’m like this. 

It feels like this has gotten to the point where I can’t even go to certain areas of my new college campus without wanting to break down and cry. I have no idea why as it’s not like I have a negative memory associated with them. I can’t go to the library or cafeteria for long without feeling sadness and loneliness creep up on me. 

I’m just tired, I suppose, of feeling like this. I read somewhere it might be being over stimulated/overwhelmed and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if it was the case. I just don’t understand why it’s happening recently when I used to be fine before.

She will never want me again and i know that no one else ever will.. I guess that I’m just unlovable.

1478,DisposableAliasName,1573666628,1,"Right off the bat, I'm a huge introvert and I've had pretty much the same friend group since High School and I'm now in my early thirties. I never really felt too close to them but I always appreciated being part of the crowd - like the player 4 in your Smash Bros. match or the designated driver at a social event. Even though I yearned for more, I was content with what I had. I knew where I fit in and being the socially awkward person that I am - I didn't feel comfortable asking for more.

However, as time went on my large group of friends started drifting away. It was only natural that from the transition from High School to College that I'd lose half of my friends as they went out of town for work or school. That's fine, I understand. 

It's also fine that in my 20's that my group of 5 friends would slowly but surely get girlfriends or boyfriends or move away for work. I get it. I can't expect things to stay the same.

This year though, there were only three of us left and one of my friends just told me that he's taking a teaching gig over in another state after he's done with his PHD this year. I'm happy for him. He's doing what he loves and I'm sure he's going to have a great time chasing his dreams.

This month, my last remaining friend got engaged to his girlfriend of five years. I was the second person he called and I can still remember how excited he was. I want to be happy for him but he's been distant these last couple of years as he keeps cancelling plans to hang out. I don't blame him though, I want him to be happy and have him spend more time with someone he really cares about.

This last month has been particularly rough for me. I went out and took myself out for a ""date"" of sorts a couple times to go and see a couple of movies, a restaurant I always wanted to visit and a comedy show to see Bill Burr. I think I was fine at the time but I just can't help but feel like I'm hollowing inside out. It's a tough feeling to describe and I'm not sure if it's the right word but *hollowing* is the first term that comes to mind.

I've never had much luck with dating apps and while I'll get a date once a blue moon, getting second dates with the same person is practically unheard of - less so when it comes to a third or fourth date.

I've tried Meetup.com from a recommendation I read here but I always feel like I'm intruding on a clique or like I'm eavesdropping. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough and haven't been to ""the right group"" - that's entirely fair and I'll work myself up to keep trying but I can't help but feel worried about my future. I know that it's somewhat cliched to say that my life didn't turn out how I had wanted it to but I never expected to feel this socially isolated and to dread what the future might hold.

I can empathize that I'm probably asking the wrong crowd but how can I learn to make new friends in real life? I love and appreciate the friends that I have made online but it could just be that I'm wired the wrong way and that I crave human contact even at the most basic level.

I really don't know where I'm going with this post and if you took the time to read this, I appreciate it. I feel like I just needed to tell someone - anyone that will give me the time of day how I'm feeling.",lonely,My friend group is shrinking and I feel incapable of making new friends,2019-11-14 04:37:08

We brokeup because I was really mad that she was constantly going out with friends and getting close to this guy, where she would spend more time with the guy, skype him, and also tell him stuff she never told me. She also started taking pictures with him as if he was her boyfriend. She was always saying ""he is just a friend"" but constantly kept making me sad as I told her not to hang around him. She couldnt leave him as he was in her friend circle.

1. Was I right to leave her? 

This really pissed me off but what was more hurtful was that she called me a ""loner"" after our breakup. 

I do have friends who are doing their own thing and really busy but I just hate hanging out with them now because the only thing they love to do is smoke weed. Unlike her friends, me and my friends dont go out to events or plan birthday party's or dinners or stuff like that.

1501,Kazorking,1573633232,1,"I’m 23 years old, I am clinically diagnosed with depression, and anxiety, and I have been almost alone my entire life. I have a sister with special needs, and as a very young child, maybe 3, I have always remembered having to fight with my sister for my mother’s attention, often times losing because of my sister’s condition. My father isn’t a very affectionate person, so I didn’t seek his attention. 

When I was in elementary school, I would get bullied for being overweight, my mother would work from 3-11:30, so my sister would see my mother, but I wouldn’t, not even on weekends. My father was an abusive alcoholic, he would drink a bottle and a half of wine, and then he would beat me, for various reasons he felt was necessary, and my sister being special needs with a mental disability, would be home, but because we always fought over my mothers attention she saw me as a rival, so she would beat me up, punch me, hit me, and I was not to hit her, because she’s special needs. So I would wake up, and go to school alone, where I’d get bullied and beat up, come home to an abusive sister, and an abusive father, and cry myself to sleep for 10 years. 
 
Until I hit 14, and I went to high school, met people and thought my luck was turning around, finally people who cared about me, until I got to Sophomore year, where all the friends I had accumulated suddenly gave me the cold shoulder, almost speed walking to get out of range of me, and talking about me behind my back. Soon I went from having a group of friends I could count on, to feeling betrayed, and back to where I’ve always been, alone for another 4 years. While at home, my father cut down on drink, but still a void had been missing in me for years, and I found temporary content in what most people would find it in as-well, video games. I would probably play for hours and hours, and eventually met some pretty cool people, but the long years of being made fun of and getting beat up took its toll, and my depression probably manifested before highschool, but I can’t prove or remember it anymore.

Upon going to University, I had a couple of online friends, and opted to go to a far university, hoping to find friends, and maybe any rumours or anything made up to prevent me from making friends wouldn’t follow me here...but soon people who I felt I had a strong connection to, would begin avoiding me. It wasn’t as noticeable, until I was talking to 2 of them, when a third pulls them, and begins to run, and looking behind them to see if I would chase. I would power walk a little, and they would keep running, and try to lose me. It wasn’t my first time experiencing that in my life, so I know what it was, and I thought that i ran away from my problems, but everywhere I go, it seems I am the problem, incapable of making and maintaining friends.

Recently, I’ve felt that my depression makes me an unpleasant person to be around, so I deleted my Facebook, and removed every online friend I had, and gave away anything of value I could give them, as a compensation to the years they wasted with a subhuman parasite like myself. Now I sit in my home office, clicking away on my keyboard, once again alone. I go days, if not weeks really talking to anyone. Loneliness is a dark life, I’ve somewhat lived my whole life, people were around me, but it’s always just been in passing. I feel like it’s no longer worth trying to make connections with anyone, because I know every friend I make, I lose them one way or another, by removing myself to benefit their lives.

Lost in a dark place

Trapped in the crawl space

In my mind I get lost in

I wake up in a coffin

They tell me they care

But do they really care

Like read my poems i’m hurtin

But I don’t have anything else to share

So they'll never know

About the pain I go through

It's like a chain of reactions

All these demon attacks

From all the drugs that I'm taking

To the women distracting me

From being myself

It's like I'm losing my traction

Kiss death on the lips

I have a fatal attraction

This is my heart

Watch as my problems inspire me

Tear me apart

Won't let the demons take over me

They took it too far

Now I need some surgery

I'm falling apart

It's like I'm lost in the motions

Use this poem as a rope

To wrap around the commotion

Tie the knot at my throat

I look at death as a notion

I don't want it no more

Well, I have PTSD (I’m a vet), BPD, Anxiety, and Depression. We live across the country from both of our families (his mom hates me anyway, so that’s not a bad thing). I had a group chat with my sisters and my mom to keep in touch but my middle sister ruined it I believe... she also suffers from mental illness and has recently started taking medication. I’ve gone to therapy for 10+ years and have decent control over my moods and symptoms thanks to tools from my therapists, besides my harmless Hypomania (my worst habit is buying my husband and daughter things they don’t need) that has worsened a little. She was being pushy with me needing to be on medication and used private posts from a group I was in, which she also is in, on Facebook asking for advice on different coping methods to try against me and started making exaggerations and claims that are simply not true. Needless to say, I am originally from the Bible Belt where things like that are taboo. I responded respectfully and asked her to please stop and that if there was any confusion that I was sorry, I just don’t want to risk bad side effects. Since then, no one has talked to me. It’s been 2 days. I’m fine being alone most of the time, because my 4 yr old is fun anyways, but it hurts. A lot. And it makes being alone even more lonely.

I know very well what it usually means in old people a broken hip and all the statistics and data as I was looking into it a while ago to know about the worst case possible. I know this very well could shorten her lifespan to short term and I had always thought that a moment like this could happen anytime, just this week I had the recurring thought that I could never know when it would strike. As a kid my parents were not around so much due to work so I was basically raised by this woman all the way until I was 10 and she was one of the few people in my family who I really loved no matter what (I had some issues regarding depression and suicide during middle school and she was always a reason why I could never do it and one of the few motives I really liked still being around in my home and not going away for good). Gosh I still remember her sometimes praying to God for more time, just enough so that she could be able to see her grandson out of elementary school back in the day.

1527,DGP9999,1573610007,1,"I have always been an introvert. Was bullied in school and had trouble making friends. Loneliness and sadness was with me always. I see so many posts on this forum that really make me sad.

So, I want to share some of the things I did to break this cycle. I call it becoming an adapted introvert. Some of this applies even if you aren't a total introvert so please stay with me.

Here is what I have observed and I hope, really hope it helps someone else. There are other things but I want to keep this post from being too long.

***First observation***: No matter how weird you think you are or are a misfit you can find friends and make relationships. I know, I am quite different and this is why I was tormented so much in school. I am quite the misfit. However, being different can make you interesting to others if you use it to your advantage.

***Second observation:*** If you want to have interesting conversation try making your life more diverse. What I am saying is find things you like to do and learn new things. Take a community  class on painting, music or something that interests you and try to learn. If your doing something interesting in life it makes it easier to talk to people. Take up a hobby or activity that you are interested in. In doing and learning the activity you'll likely meet people with things in common with you. Practice talking to people and also prepare yourself for conversation when your alone. Think about the things you are interested in and want to talk about.

***Third observation:*** If you have pain in your life work on it. Self reflection and actually feeling the pain will help with healing. If you can find a friend in this process or go to helping groups in your town it will help speed the process.

***Fourth observation:*** We are all connected and part of this universe we live in. Take a new attitude, say to yourself: This is my world and I will write my own story. What I am saying is take action to make your story read the way you like and want it to. I know this is challenging but give it a try.

I recommend looking up Jim Cary's Commencement speech (uncut) or Ekhart Tolle's videos on Youtube. BTW, I don't necessarily buy into everything any ""expert"" says but I see value in much of what they say, it's up to each one of us to sort through things like this. There are lots of inspirational things out there to evaluate for yourself.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV-tA8njqq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV-tA8njqq8) 

Anyway, chime in if you have ideas or want to ask me (not an expert just another person here) more about how I made it through the loneliness.

is it true?

When we met up we talked for hours and just hung out, telling each other things about us and getting pretty personal. We ended up just watching netflix and falling asleep in her dorm together.

The next night we threw a party at this air bnb, before everyone came over me and this girl we’re hanging out and ended up telling each other a bunch of secrets. She told me “I’ve never hooked up with someone and not caught feelings for them.” Which kinda shocked me because I already knew I had caught feelings for this girl. 

Later that night we were drunk and ended up hooking up finally but it didn’t go well. She completely ignored me for the rest of the night and my friend said she even called her ex who she recently broke up with. My friend ended up driving her back to her dorm that night. 

The next morning she sent me a text apologizing, blaming it on the fact that we were both too drunk. I was pissed so I didn’t accept it, and we ended up getting in a fight and stopped talking for a while. Eventually I texted her apologizing for being immature just because I missed talking to her. 

So as of right now we’re on good terms, but have stopped talking. And I cannot stop thinking about her. I was so close to moving on until she sent me a snapchat and I instantly lost all the progress I was making. What should I do? Did I mess up by not accepting her apology right away?

I'm close with my family but you dont have the same connection with family that you do with someone you're romantically involved with. I also lack any physical contact. I just need to hug someone  and be hugged back. I want to kiss someone on the lips and be kissed back. I want to have sex again. I feel like a whiny asshole just for saying that. But humans need that physical connection. I've gone so long without it (almost 3 year now) . Dating apps are so shallow and useless. I've tried them and had zero success in any way. I have extreme social anxiety that makes it hard to flirt with women irl. I know that sounds pathetic, but it's not just shyness. It's legit anxiety. I get this fear that acts like an anchor and holds me down. I dont know how to meet women. I dont go to bars, all the girls at college are quite younger than me at this point, and also quite immature. All the women at work are quite older than me, or in relationships. I feel like I dont really belong anywhere, and that I'll end up a single loser for the rest of my life. I was doing pretty good the past few weeks but today is just really beating me up. I miss my ex so much, but it's only because she's the only person I've been with. I need to meet new people, but new people dont want to meet me.",lonely,I'm severely depressed today,2019-11-13 05:10:10

And yes, I have tried to get out of this situation numerous times before, but things haven’t worked out. I think things are somewhat looking up now because one of my old friends might be moving back to my city and they told me they wanted to reunite with me and they’re also in a similar situation. I know this doesn’t mean that I should stop trying to get out of this, but it does make me feel better knowing that I’m gonna have another person to hang out with other than the only friend I’ve had all these years. But yeah, it fucking sucks being isolated in your house for long periods of time.

1583,Othersidethrowaway12,1573534621,1,"Sorry for the throwaway account, but I'd rather not have people see that I'm lonely on my real one. Better to keep up the  facade than to show you're sad inside. 

If you're interested in my little story here goes: 

It wasn't always like this. I probably was not as good of a person compared to what I am today. In fact, I despised people who were social cast-outs, who were depressed, or just sad in general. 

I thought that it was just a phase, or due to the lack of effort that created the situations that they suffered in. But this was in high school, where friends were plentiful, relationships built out of necessity than out of value in each other. Life was better back then, I had people that I thought I could count on and vice versa. 

I even remember saying how depressed people who committed suicide were weak people who weren't brave enough to face life's challenges and that they were cowards. 

But life has a way of flipping that on it's head doesn't it? Good things don't last forever, and the relentlessness of time grinds even the toughest of wills into pebbles. 

After graduation from high school and conscription into a foreign country, I found myself in a weird position, where all my relationships were deteriorating by the day and there was no way I could circumvent it. A lot of my 'friends' moved on into university while I crawled in literal trenches in a forest. 

At first I was just spiteful, that people were just shallow, hollow entities that couldn't care less about your existence once you're not an integral part of their lives. 'Fine', I thought, ' I'll just live my own life just like how they would live theirs - without a care.'

It has been 2 years since I've returned and by God did I try to reconnect. One of the things I noticed was that no matter how much effort you put in, no one really extends the same amount towards you. 

It almost feels as though your value to them had vanished, that you offer nothing towards a relationship and it was beneficial for them to keep you out, than in. 

And just like that, unknowingly at first, I realized I drifted over a line that I thought I would never live to see the day in. It's an awkward existence at best, I live in a room in which I have built a castle in, it has the comfort that many seek for, I don't have to worry about money, or sustenance. Music keeps me company nowadays, it's the sole refuge that I reside in to hide away from the gnawing feeling of being the only singular entity that exists in my own world. 

It is a lonely existence. 

Not only is it lonely, it's tiring too. Occasionally people who drift by and say 'keep trying and you'll find someone' or 'you can't give up' or 'I know I can't be a good friend to you, but I hope you find someone right'. If I offer no innate value to you, why don't you just say that? Instead of being the faux positive individual you're pretending to be, standing on a high pedestal and telling me how to fix myself but not willing to step down and be my friend. 

I feel like my loneliness phase is going to be over soon though, I feel as though there has been a slow but sure transition towards hatred.

Hatred is a better friend than all they could ever be, it fuels me to keep going forward, to be a better person. To eventually surpass them and prove that I could be worth more than they could ever fathom, that I could be great enough to make them eventually feel the hopelessness I struggled with. 

It's an unhealthy way to live life, but is there another way out? 'Just keep trying' will never be enough.

1584,anr909,1573533843,1,"Entering university has been one of the most life changing moments in my life, because for the first time in my life, I was truly alone. It took a big toll on my mental health as I saw people around me flourishing in their new lives while I felt like a loser of society, so I took to the Internet for advice. “Join a club, talk to people more, find new hobbies”, I did it all. Nothing changed. This impacted my mental health even more because then I began to think something was fundamentally wrong with me. 

But something I’ve come to realize is that really it’s a matter of running into those people that you can form a friendship with. Yes, joining a club where you have similar interests can be helpful, but people are complicated. You’re going to need more than simply a couple things in common to form a friendship with someone. Sometimes you just don’t get along with certain kinds of people, and that’s okay. You could run into someone with no similar interests as you but you two get along really well just because. 

The most important thing that needs to change is lack of self confidence. There is nothing wrong with you. You just haven’t found the right people. You may run into them tomorrow, next year, who knows, maybe never. But not having met the right people is still better than being with people who don’t even know the real you and you’re just pretending to be someone else so you can fit in.",lonely,Finding people who you connect with is based on luck rather than “putting yourself out there”,2019-11-12 15:44:03

You’ve been with me since I was young.  Have always been there on my side through the good and the bad but mostly the bad.  While I understand you wish to be with me whether I like it or not, I say it’s time for us to part ways.  

Is this a break up?  Yes pretty much.  Will you still come and try ruin life?  Of course!  Will depression and her darling sister suicide come in to check on me?  Well, fucking unfortunately.  

What am i say to you dear old loneliness?  To simply fuck off.  I don’t need you in my life.  I don’t need to feel you or torture me.  It’s fine to come once in a while but not daily.  

It’s time for me to welcome peace, solitude, and happiness into my life.  No more shitting around.  No more.  Of course, easier said than done.  I’ll confess there will be times where you will come uninvited and I have no choice but to accept you.  

When you come, please know you aren’t my main focus or will be getting any of my attention.  I have a choice at the end... and that’s either to chose happiness or loneliness.  You know which is the obvious choice.  No questions asked. 

So dear Loneliness, let this be a deceleration of freedom from you.  Not may.  THIS IS IT.  As of today, I’m turning a new page.  Forging a new path.  Doing what’s right for me and healthy.  

I’m willing to battle you along with depression as long as I live.  I dare you to come.  No more fear.  No more holding back.   This is it.

My dad was always working and my parents are divorced so I rarely got to see my mom until recently. My step mom was the person who did most of the parenting and I let was just being told what to do when to do it and I never had a say in anything.

I’m not a social butterfly and the most social interactions I have at the moment are whenever I’m at school and must interact with classmates and my professor . After school I end up going home and realizing once more that I literally don’t have any friends at all . Sure I have my classmates phone numbers but we mainly discuss school .

I do not have anyone at the moment who I would even remotely consider a friend at all . Whenever I am home I just read manga , watch anime , do homework and play with my phone . Sure I have done many many things by myself but it’s starting to take a toll on me . It sucks that I don’t have a date and haven’t dated in forever but more so that I literally feel very lonesome . 

Last week I went to a concert by myself and wish I had gone with someone. It kind of sucked that I went to see the One Piece Stampede movie by myself a bit even though the movie was pretty good . Tomorrow I plan on seeing the movie Konosuba by myself as well . 

I should probably try to be more social and try to make friends while I am in school as the moment . Except that I have somewhat of social anxiety and wouldn’t know where to begin talking to people. I did attend an anime club meeting at my school but have not regularly gone . I am thinking of getting a hobby or two in order to cope with the loneliness that I feel in my heart .

At school nobody knows me, I can go a full day without talking to anybody and nobody will notice. It's not that I get bullied or anything but I just know that I don't matter.

Im not even the silent girl or anything, I can be social and I have friends outside of school but I dont even try.

Honestly without wanting to sound like a bitch, I just don't like anybody there. All the things that theyre talking, I just dont find interesting and I dont want to force myself to pretend. Believe me I did. But I only got sadder by pretending to be someone Im not.

Ive been to a psychologist for a year but it didnt help, i only felt worse by having to tell how sad and pathetic my life is.

“Excuse me, do you sell Redline?” 

They just kind of looked at me and grimaced, except one.

“Sure, follow me.”

And so I did. Turns out the Redline was hiding in plain sight. I grabbed one out of the freezer thing and closed it. Then she asked a question.

“Are these effective?”

I just answered they way I would to anyone.

“Yeah they work pretty well.”

“But for someone who doesn’t drink energy drinks that often, is it effective?” 

“Yeah, but you’ll feel like you’re gonna die at first.”

“Yeah, thanks for pointing me in the right direction.” Then I walked back to the register. She followed behind and ended up getting one herself. After that I left and drove home.

1661,hiineedlove,1573457558,1,"I haven't met anyone like me. I am unique to say the least, and you will learn how unique i really am if you choose to keep reading. I think unlike anyone i have ever known. I mean that my head is silent. I hear nothing unless i manually force a thought in there. all activities are just distractions from the silence. Maybe I'm autistic or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its easy for me to socialize, i can make people like me pretty easily. I cant seem to make people stay. I can make them stay until i get sick of pretending. A lot of people say the answer is clearly to simply be myself, but that's not a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I am depressed, very negative, and show sociopathic tendencies. I like how to feels to cause mental anguish to others, I like to manipulate people and make them feel horrible emotions they have never felt before. I think about robbing my friends, I think about how it would feel to kill them. I lose respect for any given human being once they admit to trusting me or loving me. I think, ""Hah, what a moron, cant you see who i really am?"" Then i think about how i can use that trust/love to destroy them or gain something. Here's the kicker, I am attracted to children. I was attracted to girls my age until around age 12-14. And got stuck. Over the years i hoped it would go away, not me i said, please not that. I thought once i wasn't a virgin anymore i wouldn't be attracted to kids anymore, years later it is still there. I am a pedophile. It wont fucking go away. I haven't acted on it and do not plan to. In fact every woman I've ever been with has been over 19 years of age and older than me. But no age group turns me on more than 12-15. When i am around attractive girls of that age i leave the room because just being around them spawns horrible thoughts.  This is a secret i have told nobody. I feel vulnerable typing this dark secret out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Girls come into my life and i let them know some or most of this. that i do not have a relationship with my family. that i have never felt loved or included. that i have no friends and that i am a horrible horrible person. They do not believe me. They say they can see the good in me. Give it at max 6 months and they see how deep my SHIT really runs. TO MY SHIT FUCKING CORE. and even to the point that they give up trying to fix me give up trying to help me, they don't even KNOW THE HALF OF IT. They don't know how many times I've fantasized about killing them, they don't know that id rather fuck their little sister than them, they don't know how disconnected I am from this society. 

&amp;#x200B;

People tell me to trust them. People tell me i can tell them anything. the strongest and realest people i have ever met cant make it half way. they run as soon as the bucket starts to really pour. This is why i keep all of this to myself. this is why i cant make real friends. only causal acquaintances for a while until i get SICK AND WANT TO VOMIT ACTING LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT MAKING JOKES MAKING THEM LAUGH AND MAKING THEM LIKE ME BECAUSE ITS SO FUCKING TIRING I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE THE SIMPLICITY OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND CASUAL SOCIALIZATION STANDARDS I HATE IT. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to change. Ive seen many a therapist. Ive broken through on dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the strongest psychedelic known to fucking man trying to find a decent core inside me. I spent 7 months too depressed to shower or go outside when i lived with my parents, in silence, thinking about how i could change, and habits i needed to break and things i could do to become a healthier happier person. I meditate, i quit watching porn i am on r/nofap i quit smoking weed as a crutch i exercise a lot, I go outside everyday, i have a job, i do my hair and i wear clothes that match my style and i pierced my ears, i work hard on my image, i am abstaining from dating and sex until i can better myself. I do not sit at home all day eating junk food wondering why my life sucks. I am attractive, i am fit, i have good sense of style and i charm basically everyone who meets me. People assume i am a very happy and successful person, I mean, i have my own apartment, my own money, i bike everyday, lift every day, i go to movies and i go out to eat regularly, i have a good schedule that i stick to. If anyone in my life knew i wrote this they would be shocked. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's something wrong with me. I just know it. Whether its a mental defect, or maybe I'm just so deep in the closet i don't even know it, or maybe there's a medication i need to be taking, or I'm lacking some vitamin that is causing me to behave this way, I KNOW ITS SOMETHING BUT I CANT FUCKING FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS. Its always been like this. it only feels better when i ignore it, but it doesn't change anything when i do. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have tried. so fucking hard. for so long. I am crying as i write this. it only seems to get harder as these thoughts get cemented as i get older. i cant believe i am 19 and i am still like this. I cant kill myself i cant bring myself to do it... but the idea becomes more and more realistic and plausible as i go on. i think i am going to look up and i am 22, and still like this. i think i am going to look up and i am 40, and still like this. i think i am going to regret not ending this life before i really REALLY irreparably harm lives. All the anguish I've caused, the hate I've spawned, the anxiety I've grown in others, the bruises I've inflicted, is childs play to what i know i am capable of. how long before i am unable to stop myself? I am a danger to others and to myself. i am not fit for the public, and a total meltdown is on its way.

I have friends however I always feel like I’m on the outside of things. Always being told about fun things after they happened, not invited to hang out, ignored when trying to make plans, etc. I have almost completely stopped talking to my best friend who was one of those friends that you just “knew” the friendship was gonna last forever. I went to a party a couple of days ago and talked to maybe 2-3 people. Throughout the entire thing I still felt like I was on the outside, just watching things and almost feeling non-existent to others.

I really don’t want to go down that path again but I really do feel like I’m losing everything I had. The suicidal thoughts I’ve had before are starting to come back as well as the feeling of hopelessness that I can’t shake. I just don’t know how I can go from feeling content and happy to this in a matter of months. Sometimes I’ll get these little feelings of happiness when I’m driving or a couple of good things happen in a day. But after that feeling is gone I’m left with the cold and dull feeling of life. More often than those little moments of happiness, I’ll just get of burst of pent up emotion that hits me all at once. This usually leads to me either just breaking down or trying to do something to help or numb such as drink or smoke. I just feel like my life is starting to blur together with how uneventful and lonely it is. Most days aren’t bad but they’re just so mind numbingly boring that it’s enough to drive anyone crazy. Most days I come home and wish I had the choice to just erase myself from reality. I don’t have extreme suicidal thoughts and haven’t ever acted on them (if I did I don’t think I would have the balls to go through with it) but I just wish I wouldn’t have been born.

There are only three people I’m close to in this world. My mom, my grandpa, my grandma, and my sister. Back in 2016 my mom suddenly died. I was devastated. I was only 18, then about two years later my sister dies, now almost four years after my mom, a year after my sister, my grandpa died. They raised me, my grandpa was my father. 

Thank goodness my grandma is healthy but she lives far away, my absolute best-friends do too.
However I have been having this unusual thought. And I say odd because I don’t even think I want to be married in my future. 

When I was little I always thought that when I grow up and I get married my grandpa would walk me down the aisle, threaten my future husband, tell them not hurt his only granddaughter. My mom, sister and grandma would do the same. My family would give me away. We’d dance at my wedding and then I’d cry and call them every single day because  moving away (even if its down the street) would be hard. I’d have my first child and I’d call them to give me advice.

But now the only one left is my grandma. Which I’m absolutely thankful for but she lives in another state which I can go there as often and she feels so guilty leaving me alone. I don’t have the heart to tell her just how lonely I am. 

I have the TV volume up to 60, I also have my computer on while the TV is loud. I even have something playing on my phone. Filling up the other side of the bed just to feel like someone is there.

I'm usually pretty accepting of my number of acquaintances and distinct lack of friends but tonight it really hit me. 

Most of the people I talk to are sleeping/doing work, but they aren't really people I would talk to about personal things anyway. The guy I like is definitely still up but I'm afraid to talk to him because I don't want to give away my feelings. We are on a coed team and the team is pretty against relationships amongst ourselves because it makes it awkward. And because of that I feel like I can't talk to people I'm close with on the team, especially him.

Liking him has made it so much harder for me to express the dumbest things and now everything has built up to this and I hate it. He jokes about how lonely he is but I'm too afraid to react and now my stress over him has become uncontrollable because it now includes stress over school work/other personal problems as well.

I'm not so close to my high school friends anymore (after years, I got tired of always being the only one to reach out and try to make plans) and I didn't make new friends in uni (except for one who left the country after the 1st year). I have never admitted it or talked about it seriously to anyone. Who can I talk to when I've got no friends? 

Anyway, I just needed to rant about the fact that tons of little things remind me of that fact, e.g. social media contests, where you have to tag 1+ friend(s) to enter. I know it's silly, but every time I see one of those posts, my heart sinks a little more. It just makes me realize that I've got no one to tag. And I find it ridiculous myself that I feel attacked by such a small thing, but it's my reality now. 

Also, I've seen a couple posts from people feeling lonely, looking to make friends, on my uni's ""Spotted"" FB Page. And almost every time, someone mocks the OP in the comments. I just can't begin to explain how angry this makes me, as if someone's loneliness was laughing matter, and especially someone's attempt to break said loneliness.

I look back at my life and remember the ""good times"" which was probably 12-17 or so, when I was physically fit, had loads of friends, was super smart and wish I could go back to then and just make my move

That was pretty much the only time in my life I can remember girls actually wanting me (some anyway) but I was too dumb, naive and inexperience to let anything happen. 

I wish I did let it happen. There was one girl who was perfect for me, used to flirt with me all the time, talk to my own friends about me, got my number off them and would call me randomly and I was too dumb to realise it was a romantic thing. My life could have been so much different if I got with her, who knows I may still be with her because we were that perfect for each other

Since then my confidence, physique, life in general has plummeted, I can't even ask anyone out cos I feel like I'd offer nothing that women want. Being 33 and inexperienced in a relationship is not something any woman would want I bet, and I know it.

I wish I could find someone, I yearn for a relationship, some companionship, someone to hold and cherish. There's nothing I'd love more in my life than just to find someone I love to cuddle and do nothing with all day. How hard is that to find?

Started getting seen as a weird kid, never hang out with anyone, and i was probably in an extreme depressive state. Not that i would be diagnosed with it, because therapy is for weak people, as my dad said.

My teenage years were the same, i started workingg at my dad's store when i was 12, and all of my free time was spent playing videogames. I started gerting fat and never gave a shit about my appearence back then. I never saw a reason to like myself, since no one else ever did anyways.


Graduated highschool, never made friends, and was extremely suicidal all of those years. I got used to being alone and having to do everything by myself.

I haven't received a single text message since 2012 and even then it was because i tried reaching out to someone. But it has been all my fault, so i understand.

Or going out and wasting time, money, and mental energy on women who are fooling with others, and wouldn’t do the same for me.

1680,broken_crown17,1573442400,1,"   I have an amazing guy friend that has just started to ghost me. He was a good friend of my husband's in high-school and he and I hit it off. He's been more of a brother to me than anything. He was in our wedding and even came to visit us in the hospital after my husband and I had our son. Shortly after that we had to move away for work, but we kept good communication with the friend.                                                                         

Less than two years ago this friend met a girl and I was happy for him! I knew how lonely he was. We visited our home town and took the two of them to dinner to meet the girl that he insisted was ""the one"". They seemed great for each other and we all seemed to click. I think this is when the trouble started though. 

Despite two more visits back, we have not seen this girl again and we have hardly seen our friend AT ALL. During both visits he was nearly impossible to get a hold of. Both times he barely squeezed us in the night before we left and she wasn't there either time. He deleted his Facebook profile shortly after they started dating so we can't keep up with one another's lives that way either. We hardly talk to him at all anymore. 

The other night we got him to call us (he won't answer if we call him) to tell him some news. He seemed detached and couldn't wait to get off of the phone. It seemed that someone was pressuring him to hang up. 

I just don't know what to make of this. I have never had any sort of romantic attraction to this friend and I don't THINK he's had any for me. He has other female friends, even one woman who he asked out once that he still sees.

-Sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes I may have made.

My whole life I have been forced to move place to place. My father is in the military and thus comes the different job opportunities, and with it the different moves. My extended family lives nowhere near us, so it is only my immediate family and I. From the start of my life I couldn’t be happier, we lived in the same place for several years and I got to grow up with people who I considered friends. When Second grade ended I was told we would be moving to where my extended family lived, I was so happy that I didn’t fully realize that I would be leaving behind so many people I loved. 

The move came and for first time in my life I realized the drawbacks of the life I was living, and I pretty quickly lost contact with everyone I knew. I met some wonderful people where we were, and I was once again happy, but the second move came and I knew I would once again lose contact, so I tried to establish a connection with specific people, and even got their home phone numbers. After we moved i tried to contact my friends but quickly realized that the numbers didn’t work for some reason (we were nine so maybe they accidentally put in the wrong number), I was heartbroken. 

I went to a new school, this time on a military base. I hated it, I was bullied, could not find any friends and was even accused of cheating by a teacher when I hadn’t. My parents realized that nothing would change and put me into a private school. For the first time in almost a year I felt as if I was a part of something, I had the greatest friends ever and I belonged for a change. Everyone there made me feel welcome, so when that dreaded time came again I was unhappy. 

The third move in the start was the worst.  I wasn’t bullied, but I wasn’t treated kindly either. The first 4 months of school were the worst, I had no one, I ate lunch alone, and was laughed at for not being good at basketball. I kept into contact with my friends from the prior move using XBOX, but it wasn’t the same only communicating by voice, and I could tell the distance was growing. I gained a small group of friends who I was happy with, but the time spent there was short lived. 

We moved back to where this all started at, almost 10 years later,and are still there now.

My best friend was still here, people I remembered were still here, but they had changed. My best friend was so happy to see me but he was in a group of people already and when I joined it they all treated me as if I didn’t belong. Over the school year I was allowed into the group, but wasn’t treated as a member. Which lead into this year where I am still only just a member of the group and am not considered a friend. I have never been invited to “hang out” after school, I’ve never been invited to play games or see a movie or anything. 

I’ve come such a long way on mostly my own, I’ve tried so hard to make friends but when I always get close I have to leave them. I haven’t spoken to anyone from the first move in over 6 years. My friends from move two have slowly begun to drive me out of the group, and say racist things about me before saying they don’t “mean it”, they also have begun to generally be unkind to everyone who is not associated with the group. And the two friends I had from move three barely speak to one another or to me. I’m back where I started but I feel left out and alone, with no end in sight. 

I curse the life style I live. While I have the upmost respect for the military members and the military as a whole, I hate the fact that we have to sacrifice so much of our normal lives.  My family has also not always been the biggest support, we fight all the time, and I’m sick of it. 

I’m trying to distance myself from my friends of prior moves because they are all becoming toxic to be around, at the same time though they are the only ones who I can talk with, and the only ones who acknowledge I exist at all. I’ve contemplated suicide several times but I’m to scared to do it. I love all of my family and my friends but i feel it is not mutual. I hate my life. I do not know where to go from here, so I’m pouring out my soul to strangers on the internet. I apologize if this all seems minor or insignificant, but for once in my life I want to feel like someone appreciates me in their life. I don’t want to be alone.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, any advice would be much appreciated. I will elaborate on further details if needed.

 Does hiding myself from communicating hurts people around me?

I’m an international student, I just moved to a new country that speaks English only(I speak Cantonese), at the first month I tried to communicate with people even tho I’m known for being a lone wolf in my home country at school. But as soon as I found out this doesn’t work for me, I cannot get into groups of people. I been being a lone wolf again.

Then she starts saying stuff like, “yeah u prefer being alone anyway” bc of my English ability, I been sitting in the corner every English lesson got no task( I’m typing this in lesson).
I’ve been alone at school for 5-6 months now. I don’t feel sad at all but i care about what I did and did my act hurt others feelings.

From the start of my life I couldn’t be happier, we lived in the same place for several years and I got to grow up with people who I considered friends. When Second grade ended I was told we would be moving to where my extended family lived, I was so happy that I didn’t fully realize that I would be leaving behind so many people I loved. 

The move came and for first time in my life I realized the drawbacks of the life I was living, and I pretty quickly lost contact with everyone I knew. I met some wonderful people where we were, and I was once again happy, but the second move came and I knew I would once again lose contact, so I tried to establish a connection with specific people, and even got their home phone numbers. After we moved i tried to contact my friends but quickly realized that the numbers didn’t work for some reason (we were nine so maybe they accidentally put in the wrong number), I was heartbroken. 

I went to a new school, this time on a military base. I hated it, I was bullied, could not find any friends and was even accused of cheating by a teacher when I hadn’t. My parents realized that nothing would change and put me into a private school. For the first time in almost a year I felt as if I was a part of something, I had the greatest friends ever and I belonged for a change. Everyone there made me feel welcome, so when that dreaded time came again I was unhappy. 

The fourth move in the start was the worst.  I wasn’t bullied, but I wasn’t treated kindly either. The first 4 months of school were the worst, I had no one, I ate lunch alone, and was laughed at for not being good at basketball. I kept into contact with my friends from the prior move using XBOX",lonely,"I’m Sick Of My Life, And Have No Friends, Where Do I Go From Here?",2019-11-11 10:40:27
1700,AlFuckinStabYa,1573428599,1,"So I’m lonely, natch. 

Left my partner (long term ~15 years) about 18 months ago for a complex array of reasons I’m not going to get into.

I let her ‘have our friends’ as part of the separation - she needed the support network more than I did, I didn’t want to put them in any awkward positions and she’s still the mother of my children so I want her to do ok. 

Now things have calmed down. I’m cool with the ex and want her to be happy, and I think she’s thinking the same, but I’m down to my ‘work’ friends and my family. 

Family are great for occasions but not people I’d choose to spend time with outside of that. 

My workmates are cool and all, but a certain level of professional distance needs to be maintained there (don’t shit where you eat etc). 

I’m 35. 

Last time I was out making friends I was in my teens getting shit faced in dingy clubs. I don’t know how to do this now. I’ve tried meeting people on Tinder and the like, but Jesus, that’s a shit show. 

How do I move forward from here? The local ‘meet-up’ ecosystem is non-existent and as I’ve mentioned, the usual dating sites are the same. 

The worst part is rolling over at night and not having anyone to hold, and wondering if that’s just the way things will always be now.",lonely,Where do I go from here?,2019-11-11 10:29:59

Hello, I figured the best way of meeting new people is showing my interests and things about me right off the bat and anyone that has similar interests to me can just hit me up. This is a improved post  from r/makenewsfriendshere as I got no invites. 

\- Interests -

\- Hiking - But due to my age I can rarely go out and when I can it's with my parents  
\- Level/Map Design - Aspiring map creator for CSGO   
\- Video Games - Pretty big in my life, I spend around 4 hours everyday wasting my time on them, some of my favorites -   
\- CSGO  
\- Rocket League  
\- The Forest  
\- Hollow Knight  
\- Dark Souls 3  
\- Terraria  
I know many other games but if I listed them all this list would be too long.

\- Music -

\- EDM - Anything made by Porter Robinson is great and some Monstercat songs  
\- Electro Swing - Just in general a lot of great songs  
\- Nightcore - I've used to like this way more like a few years back but still anything made by NightcoreReality is good.

\- Things About Me -

\- Born in Poland, can speak decently in Polish but I don't know any grammar.  
\- Dad's Russian, learning Russian right now.  
\- Moved to England and lived for 6 years now living in Ireland.  
\- Had a girlfriend for 7 months but now single.  
\- Favorite color is neon green

\- Mental Illness -  
\- Depression - Lack of motivation, always bored, no distant goal in life   
\- Social Anxiety - Feel like i'm always bothering people   
\- Emotionally Dry - Not really a mental illness but I find it hard to show my emotions to people

\- Humor -   
\- Dark, the darker the better i'm not offended by anything you say.  
\- Deadpan  
\- Bad and good puns   


Would write more but then what's the point of having a friendship?  
Hit me up if you want to talk i'm open to any age but preferably 14-16 and preferable in Europe because of time zones.  
Oh and my Myers-Briggs personality type is ISTP if anyone is interested.  
Thank you for sticking to the end.",lonely,15 - M - All About Me -,2019-11-10 23:00:07
1741,2Honest4MainAccount,1573384540,1,"Birthday yesterday, 24. Spent with family in Bournemouth  which coinsided well with my grandparents 60th anniversary party, but still can't help but feel alone. It isn't that my family isn't great, but rather I live in London and I'm so sick of life up there. Spending time with family reminds me of how alone and lonely I really am with literally zero friends in London. People I know and colleagues I work with, sure, but nobody I properly and regularly speak to or meet up with. Nobody. I've tried but over the years I've just became more isolated and as much as I try to give up caring and accept it, it ends up hurting me more because I never can accept it. Making friends is incredibly difficult in London and even with others on this sub and others saying the same thing, for some reason there's still a huge disconnect. People are of course busier but people also seem to be more judgemental and less accepting within London. I won't be moving outside of London any time soon due to my job but will probably move around to somewhere with a garden or something so I can have a dog and at least have something that I can feed some of my unwanted love in to. Meh.

I'm apparently not allowed to find love. I've been single my whole life and it hurts me to my core every single day. As a 33M I feel like it's never going to happen for me anymore. My chances of it happening are getting further and further away, I'm destined to live and die alone

They play a major role in my life but I feel like I’m not that much of a role in theirs because they all have significant others and family and other friends.

1751,browns5101,1573373995,1,"Recently, I've been in the perpetual depressed mood of just utter lonliness.

I dont have a bad life, and generally I'm pretty happy.  I have a good job, classes are going well, I have supportive friends and a loving family.  Something still feels lacking though.

I just got to talking with my sister about love and my views on it.  I told her that I'd be more than happy to meet and marry my significant other fairly young (goven the right circumstances of course) and she was fairly caught off guard by that, until I got to explaining why.

See its all about experiences.  I want to share my experiences with my significant other.  I want to do them together and as time moves on you will never be able to re-experience certain things.

See, once I leave college there is no going back.  There is no re-experiencing being young and the freedom of (relative) irresponsibility.  I will never be able to share those experiences with her.  Yeah, I can share them in story but she'll never be able to live them with me.  This is the same for every point in life.

Seeing all my friends in relationships and them being able to share this time with them saddens me and gives me the disgusting feeling of jealousy.  Its something I long for though.  So much so that I continue to see my ex in my dreams.  We didnt have a good end to our relationship so it sadly sticks with me and its not something I like to relive but I'm forced to nonetheless.

My best of luck to everyone in this sub and I genuinely wish for each of you to find the resolution to your own loneliness.",lonely,Sharing Experiences,2019-11-10 19:19:55

Treat this as a disclaimer, I’m not trying to protect me from those ”Fix your grammar or fix your broken English” comments ( to be honest i would be surprised if I even get any at the point)

I just don’t want be a bother to you while you read through my thoughts or whatever I’m trying to say here, but I truly appreciate you reading this, maybe I just wanted to be heard? I don’t really know. 

Don’t get me wrong I’m very grateful for my life, I’m honored to live the life that I’m living, I’m not mad at anyone, I just wish sometimes that I matter (?)
Also my goal is not to brag or anything, I do not mean to appeal like an asshole. 

I’m just pretty done at this point and I do not want to sugar coat anything anymore. 

So, where do I start ? 
I’m 18y male, you can pretty much guess where I’m from after looking at my username I guess.

I was born in a rich household, my mom and my dad were pretty hard workers ( my mom is a lawyer and my dad was a surgeon) and don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful for everything, but that’s where the problems start to rise.

All I really know is “Here have this amount of money, get yourself some nice toys!” Or “I can’t talk to you right now, I’m busy” all I knew was the money aspect. 

money this and money that, I never really got to spend time with my dad before he passed, pretty much inherited money and that’s it, my math teacher was more like a dad to me at this point.

Growing up, having money is cool and fun, but I learned pretty early on that people can and will use you for anything (pretty much in every aspect in life, I know, but money is like a weak spot to me so that’s what I mean by that) after 
I learned that the hard way, I obviously developed trust issues, never knew what people really want from me, am I just an atm ? Does any one care what’s going on with me ? Do I as a person even matter? Questions I have in the back on my mind since I’m 12.

As I got older, the first girlfriend arrived, best time of my life, I thought I found someone who truly cared for me, who listened to my problems, just being with her was  like a victory, I was able to enjoy life again.


Fast forward 3 months, all I know at this point is 
“Please buy me this”    “ i thought u loved me ? Why don’t u buy me this then ?” 
And guess what yours truly did, I bought everything she wanted, I was 14 at this point.

I just wanted someone to be there for me,  i thought if I don’t do it, she will leave me, after a couple months, she left me, for one my friends, fuck you Daniel btw.

Soo I was completely done, all these questions started to come up again, just a billion times worse, my mental state wasn’t the best and I developed depression over the time, I basically just lost all interest, my sleep schedule was extremely weird, some days  all I wanted to do is sleep, on other days I was awake for 3 dats straight.

So In my time of being done with everything and everyone, my friends and I were starting to take drugs, idk why, it sorta just happened, to the point where I was high on several drugs pretty much 24/7 (obviously not 24/7 but you get my point)  

Again no one noticed, not a single person, it killed me to see that I truly do not matter in this world.



Alright bois and girls, I think that’s enough, I just wanted to let atleast some steam off, also I’m pretty sure 99% of you guys stopped reading my pathetic and poorly written post a long time ago but to the 1%, thank you, I appreciate you reading this, I really can’t talk about my problems, with anyone so The fact that you read through this means a lot to me.",lonely,How much are you truly worth ?,2019-11-10 17:51:30

I’m so tired. I’m not ungrateful for the life I have but I’m really tired of the routine of it. And it’s always the same. Wake up at 5, check dad’s blood sugar, give him insulin, give him breakfast, get ready for school, kiss dad goodbye, go to school, fuck around with the guys, sleep in Spanish class, do work, eat lunch, finish school, go home, say hi to dad, mom, and brother, rest for 30 minutes, get yelled at for using the restroom for more than 3 minutes ,start to clean, give dad to eat, do homework, eat at 9, get yelled at for eating at 9, give dad his final insulin and pill, set up brothers bed, make brother late night snack, use phone until 11:30, try to sleep for 30 minutes, finally fall asleep around 12:30-1 am, do it all over again. My body hurts and my heart is always feels heavy. I’ve started taking painkillers for my joint and back pains and crying when they wear off. I feel like I’m going to cry any second of any day all the time. I want to scream at the top of my lungs and sleep for as long as I can. I’m so far gone that whe I find my pet turtle upside down in its tank and it’s funny to me. I wait for the light to turn and watch the cars go by thinking “ if I jump in front of that car I could probably die” or “ if I jump off my counties bridge would I still be in pain?” I listen to everyone’s problems and keep mine hidden in fear that I’ll disappoint someone, idk who but someone WILL be disappointed if I say how I feel. My mom says that she won’t judge if I tell her how I feel, and when I tell her something that’s hurting me she says” why are you being such a crybaby? Other kids have suffered 20x worse than you and you say you’re sad?” Some support. I want to go to sleep and just stay like that. I find my mind going to such dark places that I never thought possible. I see other girls my age and wonder” why aren’t I like that?” I try to fit in and be “perfect”. But I can’t. I want to be the perfect daughter but I can’t. I want to be the funny happy go lucky kid in the group, but I’m dying in the inside. Everyday is harder and harder to get out of bed to the point where I am actually counting the estimated amount of time it’ll take me to finally graduate high school and sleep for a little bit more. I want to tell my mom how I really feel when we argue, but I only end up agreeing with her. No fighting back, no hesitation. I want to sleep. I’m so fucking tired. I just wanna sleep. Is that to much to ask for? For one day that I can relax and not worry about if dad is fed, or if the dishes are clean? Apparently it is. But I don’t care anymore, I’m just numb now. But I tell myself that tomorrow will be better. I’m waiting for that tomorrow. Im just really tired. I just hope that the good day comes before I lose all of my will power to keep going. I’m really tired right now, god I hope that I can make it.

I don't know what it is I did wrong to everyone I know. I'm a nice person. I've been told by the few close friends I have that I'm a blast to be around, but it seems like when its a group of people, there I am, sitting alone in the corner getting insults hurled at me the whole damn night. It just makes me feel like I have no friends.

And I can't do jack shit about it because I don't know how to use my words like literally anyone else. Everything that comes out of my mouth is so incoherent it makes me laugh at myself. And having ADHD makes it so much harder not to make an idiot of myself. So instead I just sit there and take it. So come many years later in senior year, I cut all ties with everyone because everyone treats me like shit. But I still have a couple of friends so it could be worse... I guess.

I just regret not ever doing something about it. Even now in college, I have a nickname in my hall that's funny, yes, but I don't like it when I'm in a bad mood, which is like every other day. I have so many regrets, and I know I'll never be able to change because that's just been who I've been my whole life.

Just genuinely miss having someone who wants to get to know me. I haven't had a conversation, a real conversation, in such a long time. I feel like I'm too guarded. I don't let people in. I know everyone at a surface level but fail to care beyond that. Maybe it's me? Maybe I'm too self involved? I don't get involved in their groups or make attempts to get to know anyone; maybe that's why they don't get involved with me.   


Without sounding vain, I think I'm an okay looking guy. Pretty funny. But I can't move beyond that. I can't feel connection. No matter how much clowning around I do, no matter how many jokes I make people laugh at, no matter how much I try and help people, I just don't care. I don't care. What am I looking for? True connection. Friendship. Romance. Anything. Anything where I'm not just a caricature. I'm a real person. I have a story.  Why do I feel so alone? What is this thing gnawing inside me? Why can't I make a connection or a bond or anything. I'm so used to change, impermanence, being let down. How do I actually open myself up? How do I let myself feel again? I want to care but I just feel like I can't.  I feel so jaded.

My relationships with colleagues are fine, though we are not friends; we don't talk personal things; we don't hang out in leisure time. My workplace may organize parties from time to time. I attend them all but what I do is only eat. No one talk to me and I don't have anything to say with anyone. I live alone, no friends, no family. And I got bored with my previous interests/hobbies like musics, movies, arts, literature, exercise, gaming etc. I am also bored by travelling and museums/castles/scenery around the world. So I have nothing to do during weekends and I can only work to kill time. But I can get tired by work of course. And I feel I need some other stimuli.

From time to time, I may go to some dating sites/apps for 1 second and then realize I don't really want any relationships including friendship. I don't have anything to talk with people; I don't like small talk. I enjoy presenting and communicating at work though. I realize I am not exactly lonely; I don't need to socialize with others. My problem is just I have nothing other than work to play with.

1784,Lil0102,1573349806,1,"I work for an ad agency. I'm a graphic designer and I work as a pair with a writer. That's how it generally works. Hope I make sense in this post. Feel a bit dumb on here, but here I am. 

Since July 2019  (now November 2019), I've (24F) been working with this guy (35M). Sure, when I met him and found out I was gonna work with him, I thought ""gee he's handsome"" ... and I made lots of jokes about it with my friends. Just joking, as I'm married and so is the writer. Let's call him ""Guy"". 

Usually they don't pair men and women together (it's not like a rule or anything) but anyway, everyone in the office has made jokes about us being a couple, blah blah. I am getting to the point, bare with me. Please read xx 

 But after just a few weeks I started feeling this weird sexual tension between us. I thought, ""nah things are just weird in my relationship at the moment, Guy is just very attractive ..."". I've only been with one man and we got married young, 20. Guy has been married for 6 years and has kids, which I don't.

It all started during our first ""brain storm"" session. It was like 6pm and we decided to polish everything for the pitch the following day (we often work late and share a pretty secluded work space). We both felt screwed, like we had no good ideas. He started being really immature and coming up with ridiculous ideas as a joke and scribbling idiotic doodles. We were both laughing, until I got annoyed. I'm pretty stressed at work and I'm a junior so I feel like I have a lot to prove. He apologized and we decided to step out for a coffee to regain our sanity. He started asking me about my husband and talking about his wife. We were bitching about them as friends would. But I noticed the mood was weird. He hooked arms with me at one point, I pulled away. 

We ended up scoring mega brownie points with our boss when the pitch went really well. He boasted that he knew we'd be a good team and we've been rocking it ever since, like almost every brief has been amazing. I won my first advertising award which I'm so happy about. They're not super rare to win, but still! The tension revealed itself so many times over the last few months. 

Super recently, we were talking about the project, which was an alcohol brand, and I don't even drink much, at all really, minus a glass of something on New Year or something. He said he has the brand at home and I need to try it if I'm going to be passionate about the project, goofing off. He lives right by work so I actually popped in after work and was expecting to meet his wife etc. Thought that would help me actually, reality to set in. But no one was home(long story). C'mon, he knew his wife wouldn't be home. That's definitely when I felt it wasn't all im my head. He offered me the alcohol and we both got really tipsy and it was actually an amazing ""night"" (probably like an hour and a half). So many laughs. 

I remember commenting on what a mess I looked in the mirror and he came up behind me and said I look ""ethereally beautiful"" and then made fun of me,  asking if I even knew that word (he's the writer and I suck so much with the ad copy). He had his hands on my shoulders and was in his house, which he shares with his wife. Is that not wrong?? Because I wouldn't do that.  I ignored his comment and we went to smoke on the balcony. I said something to him and he didn't reply. Then I said ""You're too f-ed to even listen to me, haha"" and he started looking at me for an uncomfortable length of time (well I wasn't uncomfortable, I had butterflies because I'm stupid). He has such  gorgeous green eyes. I said, ""what?"". And he said ""what"" and I said ""what "" ... you get it. Sorry this seems very dumb. Then, well, nothing. I went  home. I wanted to kiss him so badly that night, on the balcony. He was so close to me. It was a little cold. I could feel his breathe on my skin. I sound dumb? Sorry. But I feel like he did too. 

 Yes, I do stuff too, like fiddle with his hair (curly sexy hair, haha) and call him an idiot. Or ""old man"" because he's 11 years my senior. Or we were laughing so hard the one morning and he said ""Ah, Lilly, we'd be such good friends if I didn't have to hate you and if you could spell ... I like you so much"". Then there was an awkward silence. We've had a lot of deep, overly personal conversations too. He's an amazing guy. 

 I'm not going to make a move on him, I'm not the type to make moves anyway. But I'm scared that he makes a physical advance and that I can't resist him. That would be the worst thing to happen, but ignoring everything and going on as normal clearly isn't working. When he looked at me for so long I thought he was going to do something. I know he was not fully sober though.

There have been other things, like I saw him crying (teary) while having a smoke outside and I asked him what's wrong and he said he couldn't tell me. I don't assume it had anything to do with me. And he said ""Sometimes I forget you're basically a kid, don't worry about my miserable nonsense"". What does that even mean?? We exchanged a long hug and I liked it so much, but I felt so sad an empty after that I almost shed a tear. I don't understand why I'm like this.  

FINALLY, here is the reason I'm writing this here and now. Today I wanted to show him one of my designs (normal) so I called him over to my work computer (also normal) and he sat next to me to scroll through stuff. Yes, there was a lot of tension, for me. His arm was right next to mine and I felt so much warmth (for lack of a better word). The word ""electricity"" is just too cliche. As we were looking at stuff, he abruptly said ""I can't stand this Lil, I can't f-ing stand this"". Then he left the room and came back ages later. I didn't have a chance to say anything and I don't know what he was possibly referring to, the work was relaxed. He was so agro out of nowhere and I did nothing. I can only assume he feels it too. 

 How do I address this? I'm just so confused with myself and my marriage and everything. Clearly he is too. I don't know. 

This is a big deal because I hate that I'm experiencing these feelings and I worry that maybe I made a big mistake getting married at 20. My husband is so damn busy all the time/away for work and that's definitely a part of it. I find myself wishing I'd have been with other men before him, which is so odd for me to think. We argue a lot about this issue, but he doesn't take it seriously and says I'm needy and that he's trying to build a career, but he cancels every time I try to make plans with him to bond. 

TLDR: Im so sure we both feel this way, but I don't know how to address it, and I don't want it to escalate without me nipping it in the bud but I don't know what to do and I don't want to lose my job. We're a great team. I feel like I should chat to him about it, obviously, but then what? New work partner? New job? Chat to my husband too?  I guess it's just ... awful.",lonely,"Im married, he's married, but there's tension and feelings that I don't understand and I don't know what to do. Feelings in the workplace.",2019-11-10 12:36:46

[what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/RcZoz0Y)


When I was 16, I had this older guy take advantage of me at a party with his friends. They were both 18. Afterward, they ignored me and bragged to their friends, calling me gross. His younger brother was in my grade, and his friends bullied me too before that happened. I had no social media, and they would make posts about how I looked old and that I'm a fat slut.




They would pick apart my features every day. My lips are too thin, eyes too close together, man jaw, prominent chin, and that I was the ugliest girl in school. I moved away at 18 to a new state; it's been four years since all this happened. The guys in my grade would ask me for sex but tell me not to tell anyone because I was so ugly. They would say no man will ever want me. They said I'm attractive enough to sleep with but not to be seen with me.




I’m just saying why else would people treat me so horribly? Like a random girl from a different school at a party when I was 16 took a photo of me scrunching my face. She egged me on like “your so cute” then posted it online making fun of me calling me ratchet and her guy friends saying I look like a 40-year-old b*tch. Why would people do this unless ugly? They were all graduated and 18/19




They would say I'm the grossest girl in school, and any guy who sleeps with me is desperate. They would greet me by telling me I have wrinkles all over my face that I had peeling skin. I was so disgusting I burned and deleted all the photos from school. Is it true when people bully you it shows their shitty character, not yours? Why else would I be treated this way unless I was hideous and annoying? Was this my fault? Doesn't the bullying show I'm weird?",lonely,Why am I so ugly?,2019-11-10 11:15:52

I'm a really chill dude if you'd ask me, I really didn't care if she liked someone else, I respected that, she knew I liked her, and I knew she liked someone else. 


We were very close to each other, we talked about our problems and spent nights talking and comforting each other. (I have a lot of close friends too but I wasn't really open to them because i'm very shy haha). She even talked to me about the boy she liked not having the courage to talk to her (they liked each other).



 Things went on like this for a while until one day, she asked me to help her with something. Her Word was acting up so she asked help from me and so I helped her, same stuff, after I helped her, she thanked me and even called me the best. (This was an examination week so she had to create a reviewer).



A few hours after talking to her, I went and asked her, ""Hey how's the review going?"". She left me on read, I really didn't mind that as it was an examination week and I guess she had to review first before replying. The next day, I messaged her again, saying hello. Her leaving me on read went on for like 5 days, It was getting kinda odd for me because she normally replies after reviewing. It was Monday and I asked her friends if they knew what she was up to, they told me that she would talk to me about something after the exams (Sunday).



Examinations passed. I waited for her message, nothing (Sunday), It was Monday, school was done and still no message, Tuesday came, I woke up to a message, it was from her, the message was sent 11pm that night so I didn't see it. It was a very long sorry message, saying that she was sorry because she was trying to avoid me, she told me that she didn't want me to get hurt while her being happy, so she tried avoiding me to see if I would stop talking to her, being the friendly guy that I am (i liked her but i expected us more to be best friends or something), I didn't stop.  



I'll skip the rest of the message because it would be too long if I explained it. I replied saying that everything is alright. I still tried to talk to her like I would talk to her last time, she has never replied.
It was to the point that I didn't get invited to her birthday and all that, I started to get sad, feeling lost. I still attended though, she wasn't mad or anything, just surprised. I guess that just made things worse, until now, I still say hello to her everyday, still no reply as of now. 


I think I screwed up a little, attending her party even though I wasn't invited (it was a coincidence that we were also waiting for someone at the venue and we were just invited by her mother.)
Anyways, now you guys know about the ghosting, I feel confused and sad, I really don't know what I've done wrong. I really know I did nothing wrong though, but why? She told me things that only I knew about, and stuff, its just plain confusing on why she'd ghost, you guys get me? I know this is starting to get long so I'll make it quick. I noticed that she was closer to the guy that she liked (its awesome that I finally see some effort from him,she was really sad). But I feel like crap because I feel like I got used in some way, now I don't know what to do, should I just let it slide? Or should I talk to her personally?



I'm sorry if this is a little off-topic, but like I said, I have no one to talk to and I want to ask you guys on what to do.

I got ghosted by the person that I was very close to and until now, she hasn't answered my question ""Why?"".",lonely,Things kinda don't feel the same since I got ghosted,2019-11-10 05:59:12

1814,mistressoftheshadow,1573320749,1,"I am so sick and tired of hearing the same advice ""if you are lonely and depressed you just have to reach out to people and find support"". I have support, or well, I thought I did. I have a few friends and I have been trying to talk to them, to ask for support, but they are busy, tired, have other duties, they aren't there for me. And even if they somehow find time to listen to me they do so for half an hour before they go to ""hey let me tell you about the fun fun fun night I had last week"". Half an hour once in a blue moon is simply not enough for someone who is depressed. And I am not the kind of person who will drag them down, I just want to talk about it. I expected more from the people I though loved me. I was there for each of my friends, supporting them through their hard times, coming to their home when they were sick to buy them medicine or groceries or simply to keep them company. When they were sad and needed someone to talk to I was there, cause I know how it feels and it feels fucking awful. And I didn't want them going through all that alone. I responded to their messages always as soon as I could. And now when I need support everyone is simply too busy. I get people have their lives to live, but aren't friends supposed to be with you through your hard times? I've been single for 9 years and I've been living alone for 12. Last week when I was sick no one offered to go to the pharmacy to buy me medicine. And no one even asked how I was doing. That made me realize just how much I was willing to go for my friends and not get the same treatment in return. 

My parents taught me to be a good person, to help people in need and not to ask anything of them, cause it's rude. My parents lent money, gave food, offered to pick up other people who don't have a car and no one has *ever* offered anything to them. I bet other parents teach their kids to take care only of themselves, cause people simply don't give a shit about you. You are their friend as long as you are fun, when you're down you're simply a burdain.

So please, for those of you who say ""reach out for support"" I just have to say it's a goddamn bullshit! No one is going to be there for you, no one cares, no one gives two fucks about how you are feeling. We are born alone and we die alone and that is the hard truth.",lonely,"""Reach out for support"" is the bullshit advice people give when they want to feel like they are being useful, but they actually aren't",2019-11-10 04:32:29

The feeling of skin to skin touch. Not even sexual. But now I'm in college. That feeling of extreme loneliness has been amplified by seeing the mass quantities of relationships. It also doesn't help that my roommate and his gf cuddle and absolutely adore each other. Which is extremely great and cute to see.

I was popular as I had always been in every school I went to because people thought I was funny and I was super charismatic back then. Eventually, I decided to enroll at a Japanese middle school for a year for the cultural experience and in the regard it was enriching and I even picked up a lot of Japanese, but on the other hand it set off a chain of events I hadn’t considered before I went there. The issues:
1. I thought they would be more interested in me because of my foreignerness but the novelty wore off in less than a week.
2. They didn’t speak English well, I didn’t speak Japanese well so communication was tricky.
3. Because communication was so tricky they rarely came up and tried to talk to me so it was always down to me to make the first move. 
4. Like most people I am an ambivert and on many days I was just too tired to have to be the one keeping the interaction up, further alienating me and making them think I didn’t want to talk to them.
5. At the same time all of this is happening, I am hanging out with my friends from before less and less. Even with kids who speak English and went to school with me, I was always the one to initiate interaction but I can’t fully blame them for that because “out of sight out of mind” even though I lived on base with a lot of them.

Everyone was forgetting about me.

After that year in Japanese school ended, I was just fed up with it and I decided not to go on to Japanese high school. I was already behind in a year’s worth of credits (which I am still making up for) I enrolled in an online predatory school and got to work. I was positive at first, but then after months of asking my friends to do something like “let’s go to the city two train stops from here!” And them saying “eh, it’s too far, I’m lazy bleh :P “ and then seeing on their Instagram that they went to Yokohama or somewhere even further with someone else, I got sick of it. I was always the one to text first, I was always the one left on read and I was at my limit. 

If they didn’t want me, fine, I don’t want them either.

I have a good relationship with my family. I love them all so much and sometimes I feel guilty for longing for other friends, it’s just there are somethings I don’t want to talk to them about. And though I am grateful for my time with them,  I became accustomed to my friends caring about me and when they just stopped it sent me into a spiral I still am not out of. I don’t know who to hate, them or myself. Them for abandoning me, or me for squandering the time I had with them. And now, every time I think of that place, where all of this happened, where I went from the one everyone could depend on to a memory long forgotten by my beloved friends, I feel seething hate, hate for an entire nation of people who haven’t done me wrong just because 30 Japanese kids didn’t want to be my friend. I have always been disconnected from my peers in some way, but not like this, never like this. 

And even now, I can’t break out of it. How am I supposed to leave home for college and go away from the only people I know into a world I don’t remember how to speak to anymore. Every time I see someone close to my age I seize up. Whenever I try to talk to people they dismiss me. 

Why am I ignored wherever I go?What is the point of it all? What happened to me?",lonely,I want to blame my loneliness on Japan but I know that I shouldn’t,2019-11-09 14:56:42

1855,anonyyy72,1573271516,1,"I stumbled across this page and realized I could say things here that I would never admit to people around me. 

I thought I was just an introvert, but freshman year of college has made me realize I am desperately lonely. I have one real friend from back home, but he is less interested in our friendship than I am. All of my friends at college are superficial and force me to be fake around them. I go out but never have fun and feel alone even with people around me. I'm always in groups of pretty and funny girls, and I am always the weird ugly one that no one talks to. I think I have kept up appearances with my family and on social media well enough, but I know that I have no one around me that I truly connect with.  

I have always lied about hooking up with guys to my friends but I have never even kissed anyone. In fact, no guy has ever shown the slightest bit of interest in me. I have just had intense crushes on guys for long periods of time and end up completely disappointed. 

The thing is, other than feeling lonely I am a pretty well-functioning person. I am at a pretty prestigious college, have a supportive family and can get along with people well. I don't know why I have such a hard time attracting and maintaining deep relationships. I don't want this constant feeling of worthlessness to hinder my goals in life and my happiness. I want to hope that things will get better and I will come across true friends or a s/o, but I am afraid I am beginning to give up and isolate myself even more.

It was a very intense friendship. I fucked up multiple times, confused, angry, not knowing what to do often pushed her away.  I regretted it every time. She moved on, found other friends I feel she is closer with now. It hurts my inside and I can't do anything about it and it's all my fault.

Nonetheless, I try to not destroy myself completely. I know I can be negative and then I get negative responses back too, or just be depressed so hard and others avoid me. I know I need to calm down and take it easy. I'm trying too desperately to replace her. Or get her back. 

Now I don't enjoy being alone anymore.

1862,Derithus,1573267334,1,"19 yo male college student. Gets good grades, part of a few clubs, and works part time at a Five Guys. I guess that brings some sort of context if you need it.

When I turned 16, I started to notice that I never really had anyone around me. I talk to people daily now and back then but I never really had any friends. I have always been that guy that everyone knew but didn't hang out with. The only time I really talk to people is when they need help from me (homework help, tutoring, projects, etc). Every time I tried to start up a normal conversation with someone (about the weather, baseball games, and other stuff like that), it never carried on and died out shortly after, and we would just continue doing what we met to do. I have never really been able to talk with other people outside of helping them. The worst part is even though I know these people don't really care about me just that I'm helping them; I keep on doing it just because it feels good to talk to sit down with another person and talk. 

This has been the case for around 3 years. Lately for the past 6 months or so, I have been having these lonely spirals. Sometimes if im sitting down or laying down not doing something, All I begin to think is that I'm alone. I just sit there and let it come. I come to these realizations that no one, outside of my parents, really has cared about me. That if I were to just die, no one to show up to my funeral. If I were sick no one would visit me in the hospital. If I ran into some sort of trouble I would be alone in dealing with it. That I will die alone (my biggest fear). They all seem so real, Like these mini movies in my head playing out these scenarios over and over. Sometimes I can manage these thoughts and sometimes I can't. I've broken down and cried in college restrooms and my bedroom more times than I'd like to say. I don't know where any of this has been coming from, I'm not depressed (I am lonely). But, in these moments it's just a stream of the worst possible feelings hitting me straight in the face. The weird thing is I never considered myself alone before these though came about.

I never found a way to say this to anyone. I had always just bottled up the emotions and hoped they would never come out again. This has just gotten harder lately and I don't know what to do. I always put up this happy persona for people and hope they will find out that something is wrong, if that makes sense. They never do and I keep on bottling up these feelings and then that stream of thoughts comes back around. For some reason that i'll never be able to explain, I need  someone else to see what's wrong with me before I can talk about it. 

I never had confronted this issue before and this post was mostly to see it right in front of me to know exactly what it looks like.",lonely,Just need to say some things,2019-11-09 13:42:14

I knew that she seemed to not like me as much, but we hadn’t had any problems or arguments so I asked her if everything was okay and she essentially told me she’s just been feeling down/isolating herself and it wasn’t me. The other day though, she told my friend that she didn’t want to really talk to me anymore but I “wasn’t getting the hint”. I definitely did get the hint, but I thought she was just under the weather. The last 2 times I’ve talked to her I was just trying to check on her to see if she was feeling okay. 

I feel really alone, she was the only person I felt comfortable talking to and now I don’t really have anyone. I honestly think she found a new friend group to hangout with and that’s contributing to it, but it still makes me feel alone that she doesn’t want to talk to me at all anymore, I feel like I did something wrong and that I just can’t keep friends. The fact that she’s telling people I “can’t get the hint” really doesn’t help.

And all of my friends seemed to disappear when things got hard. As you can imagine I spiraled badly, and ended up in a rehab center for a couple of weeks. 

It was a small center that focused mainly on psychiatric issues, and housed about 15-20 patients at a time. We would spend all day together, being really open and vulnerable, and I grew quite close to some of them. But people came and went, and eventually so did I. Rehab friends don’t last very long on the outside- very few people want to be reminded about that time in their lives. But it was the last time I felt happy, connected and part of a community. I got out and I had nothing to go back to. 

I’m still struggling to rebuild my life. I’ve been living with my parents in a smallish farm town while I try to figure out what I’m doing. Most people my age left and went to bigger cities- my town is known for being a retirement town. I literally live in a gated retirement community. I dont have a proper job, go to church or do much sport since rehab. I don’t have any obvious opportunities to build community and connect with people my own age in real life. I don’t know what I’m asking, I guess I’m just tired of being lonely, and I don’t know how to fix it.",lonely,The last time I was happy was rehab (26M),2019-11-09 07:21:12

Even in Texas where I had lived for most of my life I didn’t have many friends. Moving here I have nobody except my son and my family. My son’s father (we were divorced but still cared for each other) died in a car crash a few years ago and it just destroyed my son and me and I’ve never really been the same. I spend all of my time with my son so I know he has me to depend on. But I never spend time on myself or meeting friends. Another thing, how do you meet friends in your 30’s? At work most of the people are older and I do have them as friends but they’re not people I can spend time with often. I see all these happy people doing fun things with their spouses or friends and I just feel like I’ve lost everything that makes me me. I’ve isolated myself and I don’t know how not to. I have a few friends in other states I text sometimes but half the time I don’t use my phone because I realize I have nothing to look forward to. I understand I have my son, he’s my world and we have the best relationship in the world but sometimes I need an adult to talk to. I don’t know if I’m asking for help, suggestions or just some kinds words.

1895,CurtyBird6,1573241258,1,"This has been on my mind for a while now, but I can't shake the feeling that there is something about living in urbanized areas that makes people lose a certain social bond between each other. I used to live in Anchorage, Alaska, a decently sized city but nothing of the calliber of the Bay Area, where I currently live. I've been in the Bay Area for around 5 years at this point (came for uni and stayed for work) and I've found that I've become much more distrustful of people. Interactions seem not necessarily superficial, but I don't get the impression that people genuinely care for one another. The culture here is very much about how the individual can build themselves up and a lot of ""friendships"" come of more like the ""aquaintances"". On top of that living here is so expensive that its very easy to alienate yourself from people who are a bit less frugal ( I try to save most of my paycheck and make a decent salary for the area 85k). Dating isn't great here either. The hook-up culture is very predominant, and it very much feels like my worth is being heavily judged on my income and looks while character falls to the way-side. Don't get me wrong I know that income and looks matter, but I'm only 24. There are far more older and well-developed men here who seem to attract the attention of most of the women especially on dating apps. And the fact that women seem to have this check list of criteria they need further reflects that feeling of distrust people have towards each other at first glance. I never felt this way back in Alaska. I don't know if its the lack of nature here or the wealth disparity of the Bay area, but there is something really wrong about the community or lack there of in the big city.

Hello. If my gender and age matters to you, then Im 16 and male. I dont think it does but people seem to make a huge deal out of it. Reddit for me is primarily an anonymous platform. Relationships would work over here. Not that I distrust online relationships, I just think its unlikely on Reddit. Okay. So now we're done with the useless talk.

I need someone to talk. Someone who'll be able to open up to me and would feel comfortable sharing their insecurities and imperfections and hobbies and basically how their day went. I'm a good listener. I might not be a good conversationalist tho. Things to note before DM-ing me here:-

1- You are not a pervert/pedophile

Thats about it. Age is not a barrier. Neither is Gender. But please, please have something to talk about. I just havent gone ahead of hi how are you with anyone over here. So, now, I'll tell you something about me. I'm an introvert and socially anxious. I'm mostly average except that I have depression which takes over my entire being at times. I'm crazily well read. I mean it. I read a lot. I'm currently reading Tolstoy's War and Peace. I read all sorts of books including but not limited to classics, philosophy, psychology, evolutionary biology, pop non fiction, thrillers, literary masterpieces, magical realism, science fiction, historical fiction, poetry, history, literary realism and so on(You get the idea)

I'm not as well versed in movies but I'm catching up. Hitchcock and Kubrick are my fav directors. I loved the Joker movie. Save for action, I love most other genres.

Huge fan of 60s-90s music. Mostly rock. But other stuffs too. Green Day, Nirvana, Beatles, Elvis, Simon and Garfunkel, Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Phil Collins, Oasis, Pink Floyd, Eagles,Jeff Buckley...you name it. Among modern artists I listen to- Linkin Park, Coldplay, Eminem, Bring Me The Horizon, Ed Sheeran, Justin Timberlake, Foo fighters, Muse, Twenty One Pilots, Some Taylor Swift etc. etc.(My music tastes are diverse as you might have figured out). Oh, btw, I also like classics like Bach, Vivaldi, Beethoven, Mozart as well as Indian classical music of Ravi Shankar, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan etc etc.

I think thats all there is to me. I'm an emphatic and sensitive person. Tread carefully please coz I get hurt easily. Its not my fault. Its the chemicals I cant control. Its those demons which pull me down often. So, yeah, looking forward to talk you amazing fluffbird! Thank you for reading this!! You know youre awesome :) What are you waiting for?

Since then I’ve felt completely alone, if I ever wanted to talk to someone or make plans I would have to reach out or start the conversation first. Overall I had just felt as if I lost the only close people in my life. I had friends, and there’s people to talk to, but there wasn’t ever a person I could talk to or be on the same level of closeness with. 

Within the past year or so I actually got out of my bubble a little bit and made some new friends, one of them I’ll call Jane. Me and Jane became super close and I want to say I’d consider her one of my closest friends, which was refreshing because we were both putting in the same effort towards the friendship and we could talk to each other. Lately though Jane found a new friend group, which ended up being with some people from my older friend group and she doesn’t talk to me anymore. Whenever I try to make plans with her, she already doesn’t feel like it’s worth her time before I give any details, and I have to text her first to start a conversation.

1904,ObsidianLion,1573233907,1,"Hello everyone on r/lonely.  

I am 32, male, and not a member of this sub, but once or twice per year, I come here to see if there is someone interesting to pick (cheer) up and talk with and maybe find another person I can love sincerely for who they are. One year ago, I met a girl (20 at the time) on this sub who wrote that she is feeling the same way many of you do now, abandoned, isolated, and hopeless, roommate to a extroverted best friend who doesn't even invite her to parties. Although we live on different continents, we have both worked on our friendship, watching movies, discussing, playing video games over the net, and she says I know her more than anyone by now (which honors me). She is a person I genuinely care for and love. I am telling you all of this to show you that it is not impossible to find someone you can deeply connect with on this very sub. 

Now on to the title. 

Many here complain about being ghosted. Unquestionably, being ghosted is one of the most hurtful things one can experience, especially when already vulnerable, but still trying to trust a stranger, only to be rejected after days, weeks or a couple of months. 

Why does it happen? Because being friends with a lonely person is very hard.

I will speak from my point of view, as someone who is almost never lonely, not because I have a lot of friends, but because I am a high introvert who always finds something to entertain me and I don't crave people around me. Even while being like this, I am very adept at communication. I have worked for years in retail, where being good at communicating is crucial, so I am not socially awkward and make friends rather easily. Please take these things into consideration when imagining from which angle I am speaking. 

When I find myself open to the idea of making a new friend who is lonely, I have to ask myself, am I willing to invest a huge amount of time? Depending on the amount of time someone has been lonely, you can find people who would want to talk with you every day for hours (as did my friend who I spoke of). Now be honest with yourself, how many hours would you be willing to give someone every day, if you were not lonely, and were busy with family, your relationship, and perhaps school or work? Half an hour to one hour per week, maybe double that for very close friends. This is not even close to enough for people who crave companionship, so a dilemma appears. Their need makes them become a burden for a person who is not in their shoes and is offering a normal friendship. So the non-lonely person starts backing off to find some balance, which makes the lonely person press even more sometimes, which makes things worse. In the end, ghosting happens. 

Here is what I suggest:

1. This sub is making a mistake by not insisting that posters disclose their age, gender, and country of residence in every post, which would help people connect and filter out who might be worth their time, but you can start adding these yourself.   
2. Lonely people who start getting to know someone, just because someone has contacted you, does not mean they will give you the amount of attention you need. Always lowball the interest in the beginning and keep the topics light unless someone really asks about the dark stuff in your past (physical/sexual abuse, alcoholism, drug abuse, abandonment, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, psychological problems like bipolar personality disorder and OCD, are all topics you should avoid in the beginning. These are NOT things that make people want to hang out with you. You might get some pity attention, but it won't form a friendship).  
I like to remember a proverb I once read:""You have to earn the right to be yourself"".
3. You being lonely does not make you interesting to talk to. This is not what makes you special, so whining and complaining will not make people want to continue talking with you. If you have a hobby, there is probably a subreddit for that hobby. Finding friends there would be easier than here, because you already have a common interest
4. Who contacts whom is irrelevant in a real friendship. Even if you never get contacted first, what you should be looking at is the replies. I almost never contact my friend, but whenever she does contact me, I make the time to listen to her and have a fun time talking with her (I reply with attention to what she is talking about, and keep the conversation going). This is how I am as a person, not because it's her. I will gladly give company, but I never specifically need it myself.
5. Lastly, knowing how to make friends is all about knowing how to make the other person feel good and cared for. If I came to my friend a year ago and started talking about my issues, how would she feel? Even more hopeless, because I have reaffirmed that the world is sad and hard. So I let her speak, say everything, and I countered with attention, and an occasional tease or joke (I really found an interesting girl XD). Eventually, days later, she wanted to know more about me, and that is when I unloaded the weight of the world from my shou- NO! I just said keep it light! XD 

Everyone, the world doesn't care for you. No one owes you any sympathy just for being alive. You have to go out there and work for your happiness. You've been dealt a harsh hand (circumstances) in your life? Someone would love to trade their hand with you! Waiting for someone to save you will not happen to most people. Some would argue that my friend got saved my me. No. She wrote a post that made her stand out and seem interesting in a sea of ""I am lonely, someone talk to me"" one sentence posts. 

In the end, I will tell you how my friend and I started our friendship. 

1. For 3 months, we only exchanged long (we would reach character limit, which is 10 000) mail like private messages on reddit, usually one to two days between sending and getting a reply. NO CELL PHONE CONTACT ALLOWED! Replying took from half an hour to an hour and a half. I went in it with the intent on enjoying the process of getting to know her and that was it. This also serves as a buffer to not burden either side and give both parties space.
2. I imposed a rule in my first message to her. We would reply to the previous message, and always ask 2 questions at the end as an incentive to continue the conversation. She accepted. The questions were silly/light most of the time, and things that could not be answered with a yes or no. There are lists of interesting and fun questions you can ask someone. Google it. 
3.  When we grew fond of each other, I asked her for her phone number, but this was only so I could tell her why I am not replying in the usual time frame if I was busy, and not to talk with her. Eventually we got to phone messaging. 

That's it. Later on we started watching movies while being connected on skype. Recently she got into a relationship so her friend circle is slowly growing along with her, so she's doing better. :)

Okay first i will resume our story of ""love"". We meet 4-3 months ago. We started talking since then and quickly empathize when we talked about the bulling issues that both us suffered at some point (currently she)

Wehad our first date the Wednesday. Even if we didn't anything that we planned to do was the 2  nicest hours of my life.

Until recently I have backed off almost completely with doing all of these things.

About 2 weeks ago friend of my friends said she found me really attactive and that i seemed like ""the right kind of guy"" then asked him if i was single.

It really caught me off guard but i was pretty happy about it regardless, we started to chat over the past 2 weeks via text, there was no real bad or awkward conversations we had, everything seemed fine on my end.

My daily depressive episodes had started to go away over the last few days, no stomach pains, no pins and needles in my back no feeling of loneliness, no nothing, everything felt normal for once.

So feeling fairly good about myself last night i decided to just ask her out, i kept it open honest and real and went for it. I went and played some stuff on my pc for awhile and checked it.

Left on read, i don't even know what i did wrong my mood shot all the way down immediately, loneliness feeling and all the physical symtoms come running back worse than they usually, i immediately went to bed and had a nice dream where i got a response instead.

I woke up excited at first only to remember it was a fucking dream (thanks brain) and my shit mood will the whole package was back just as bad and hasn't gone away, its about 5pm now and i woke up at 6am

The worst part isn't even being rejected, its the fact i genuinely thought that it was all over, after 3 years of constant debilitating loneliness i thought it was legitimately ending finally, but apparently not im just back at fucking square one again. I can't keep living like this, i dont know how much longer i can push on for.

It was a new relationship that's now long gone and we were snowed in at her place. It was a brutal winter and clearly any plans that we would have had the next day were sure to be canceled. There was no safe way for me to get home, not that I was in any rush to do so, so there was nothing to do but stay the night and enjoy the company of this lovely new person that had just dropped into my life.
There was no sex that night; we were very into each other but we were taking things slow but that's not to say we weren't having fun. We got into bed around 9pm, we kissed, cuddled, talked, and just shared with each other. I'd never been so open and myself with someone else, it felt amazing and I knew there I was falling in love and hard. 
The next time I looked at the clock it was 3am. I was flabbergasted that I'd spent 6 hours just talking, being with, and loving this girl in what felt like no time at all. I wished there that time would stop moving and we could stay there; I still wish it had.
We were young and of course young relationships rarely work, we burnt out after about a year when we both realized that we had dreams we wanted to chase. I've had a couple of crummy relationships since then. I've currently been single for a bit now and feeling very jaded about the whole dating thing. I don't trust as easily anymore and it takes me maybe a little too long to warm up to people. I was feeling lonely and trying to think of a time that I really felt love and that was it. I'm still lucky enough to see her every now and then; she's settled into a happy relationship with a great guy who takes care of her and I am genuinely happy to see that for her. We're both different people now but I can't help but wonder how she'd feel if she knew that night for me is still the most loved I've ever felt. Welp, I guess I'll never know.

All of that. When that starts to become a trend in your life I call it being a “Boyfriend/Girlfriend Fairy” .

I actually seen a YouTube video that literally said the same thing I described and i was at least glad I wasn’t the only one.

So personally all my exes after leaving me or us breaking up almost instantly find happiness in their life. I’m not talking about “oh wow I found a 20 in my back pocket!” happy. I’m talking “This is the life I’ve always wanted and I couldn’t be more content than I am now.” kinda happy.

While I’m happy for them it also brings me a lot of existential stress. 

“Should I be happy for them?”
“Why not me?”
“Am I only good for creating happiness for others?”
“Am I cursed or am I just a thankless blessing?”

These thoughts and more plague my mind DAILY and it makes me feel that much more alone. Like I’m just some magic genie you take out of a bottle and put back up for another eternity once you’ve got all you could wish for.

I (23/F) feel like I’m not quite like everyone else. I just wondered if people felt the same way, allow me to explain;
I’m a sensitive person. I’m able to express emotion and communicate how certain things make me feel. I’m the type of person who loves writing letters, animals, helping individuals who need strength/wisdom/guidance, talking on the phone, watching movies, going to plays, walking on trails, playing board games etc. 
I feel lonely because I feel like I cannot truly be myself. I don’t really have anyone to talk to or vent to. I’m very open-minded and try to approach every situation with love and peace. I pay attention to close detail (you could say I’m kind of a perfectionist) in how others communicate with me and the way I feel from their energy and how I express myself. I often find myself wanting to learn and be successful, however, my success doesn’t usually stem from personal growth but rather being able to help another person find value/worth to progress to be their best selves. 
I just feel like other people do not understand how important human connection is and it brings me down when I start to process it. 
I struggle with Anxiety and OCD which tends to make me obsessive about certain irrational &amp; compulsive thoughts. I tend to think about others more then myself and I try to do fun things, but I guess I’m just sad?
Has anyone ever felt this way? Am I being irrational? How do you minimize this feeling of loneliness? How do you find hobbies and just do them by yourself when you just want someone to talk to?

1980,EternalInjustice,1573152102,1,"One random day, I got a message from a girl online and it was basically just a meme message. But then we started talking and talking, and this continued for days and hours. 

We eventually confessed that we liked each other and she even said things like ""I want to be with you"" ""you're different"" ""I only want to make you happy and no one else"" and more things like that. 

Suddenly one day she stopped talking and just did short responses like ""haha hope your day is going well too"" or just responded with emojis. I just thought she was busy IRL and/or felt like being alone. This went on for a while and never returned to talking like we did.

Long story short: I sent her one message a day telling her how much she meant to me and one day I even confessed that my feelings changed and that I loved her (this isnt rushed or crazy from me considering everything we talked) and she never responded to anything.

I told her ""since you didn't respond, I'll assume you don't want to talk so I won't message you anymore. If you want to talk about anything then I'll always be here for you"" months passed and nothing. As time went on I just accepted she ghosted and all that.

One day I got some notifactions from her that she retweeted and liked some tweets I also rted and liked. I was like ""oh so she still kinda knows I exist"" I did nothing and just continued my day. But then that same night and next day, she did the same so I decided to message her again. 

You might think ""dude she just retweeted stuff"" and while she did, it never happened before and it was months without hearing from her. I took this as a way of her trying to get me to message her (she has a lot of socializing problems)

Messaged her and nothing.

Time passed and I made a dumb Discord server and I saw her join and I was like wtf. I messaged her right after and also told her I would always be there for her (I found out she was feeling very suicidial) after a while she finally responeded and she said how stupid she was for not talking to me. 

We went back to our normal cringy lovey-dovey messages and she even asked if I still loved her and that I was the only person who ever loved her. We kept on talking for like 3 more days and then boom she started ghosting me again.

I tried to ask why and if I did something wrong and I basically felt horrible about it lol.

Eventually I told her I was deleting my social medias (for other reasons, not related to her in any sory of way) and I told her the same message that I would always be here for her and even gave her my email so she could contact me if she ever wanted to talk and that I loved her etc and all she did was ""ok"" and minutes before deleting everything (except that account from which I messaged her only so she could always see my messages just in case she wanted to talk) I tried writing one more final goodbye to which she responded ""So that wasnt the final message, huh. I can see you typing. I saw you typing."" 

And that's it.

At first I thought it was her socializing problems of being too shy and scared to talk but if that were the case then why be so rude to me? If that were the case then why join my Discord server months after not talking and ignoring my messages. And she also still posted stuff online so its not like she was offline or busy. 

I just don't get it. Why ghost? Why not just say ""listen, we have this problem"" or ""sorry dont feel like talking"" or at least block me so I know you don't want to talk. But liking and retweeting stuff. Liking some of my tweets and then removing your like from it minutes after doing it. Joining my Discord server and then finallyr responding and apologizing to me only to then do it again like 3 days after. I just don't get it.

I'm somewhat better now but man does it hurt. I just don't ghosting in general and even less in this case.

I hate not knowing if she has a problem with me. If this was all a game to her or if she just likes messing with my head. 

I always have been a person to say ""hate is a strong word"" so I never use it... but now I can say with all my heart that I hate ghosting and always will.

Another thing I hate is how I would probably go back crawling to her if she just sent me a ""hey""

1997,Its__Garbox,1573133597,1,"I know this is kind of sad and messed up but I am so hungry for companionship, I am even considering paying for an escort for a night just to get some sort of companionship. Im a 20 year old male that isn't good looking. I have been rejected by every girl I asked out from middle school all the way up to adult hood. What makes it even worse is I asked a girl I know from my church if she wanted to go out with me  about a month ago and she declined and said that she wasn't looking for a relationship at the moment because she wanted to focus on school (she is in college). So in my mind, I have the expectation that she won't be dating anyone until she finishes college. One month passes and I see her on social media with her new boyfriend at an amusement park having an amazing time. Weither she lied about her reason for not going out with me or she changed her mind , it has effected me and how I see her now. 

It just sucks that now I will have to resort to escort services to get a small taste of what its like to have a girlfriend. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation ?",lonely,I'm so desperate for companionship right now,2019-11-08 00:33:17
1998,RayTheRogue,1573131576,1,"I posted here couple of days ago and I said it's better to be a girl since they get attention whenever they want and as a guy I always get ignored. You can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ds1fri/being_a_girl_on_the_internet_seems_like_fun/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

However, as it turns out it's not always great. Girls get unwanted dick pics, nude picture requests, rape threats and whatnot. Which makes girls start doubting the intentions of every man. And it's worse for lonely girls who are just looking for friends to talk to. As a man, I can only apologize for this behaviour. I'm sorry you had to experience all that.

I am not like those creeps. I am a genuinely caring guy. I just hate the attention whoring of some girls (my ex does it, which makes me hate it more since I know she's a two faced person desperate for attention) trying to get attention with ""I'm broken"" sort of posts on Instagram. Anyway, I digress... What I mean to say is, I will be happy to be your friend and I never send or ask for anything sexual. I never send the first message to any girl since I don't want to be branded as another creep no matter how much I'm interested in her.

Yes, if I'm perfectly honest it would be amazing to have a girl be interested in me and receive some nude pictures. I'm a young 22 year old guy after all and everybody my age seems to have girlfriends or get nudes from girls. It's been almost six years since my break up and I haven't had a face to face conversation with a girl ever since so I do get desperate at times and because of my financial predicament I can't afford to go on dates with the help of dating sites. But sexual stuff are not my primary concern when I talk to a girl. I honestly have no ulterior motives.

So this was me being candid. I thank you if you read the whole thing. I apologize again on behalf of all these creepy men. But if you're interested in being my friend or just a chatting buddy, I will be happy to reciprocate.

Where to begin?  I have always been bad at making friends.  Even when I was a young lad, my only friends were the family dogs.  In elementary school, I faired a little better, I had a total of 2 people I would call friends when my class had a total of 5 kids.  Middle school and high school brought my total friend count back to 1, which I lost contact with shortly after leaving high school.  So now I am 28 years old, no friends, wondering what is wrong with me.

It's funny too.  Everyone likes me.  Even the bullies in school where nice to me.  Coworkers all like talking to me, but when I try to meet them after work or on the weekend, everyone is magically busy.  So I go home, play single player video games because I can't even find friends to play with, and wait for tomorrow so I can have some social interaction.

Now I'm sure my communication skills do not help my situation at all. I run out of things to talk about very quickly and my solitary life does not afford me the opportunity to practice so I have no idea how to fix that.

2011,hamartiated,1573100062,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-11-07 15:14:22

My teacher has been trying to help, yet all she says is that I need a group in class (which I know is important). She has approached some of the girls that I was close to at first and wants us to all talk. I really don’t know how much longer I can take this before breaking down completely. I have been cutting myself to feel better which helps sometimes. I do not know what else to do at this point.

2046,Rachdingue,1573073184,3,"Hello everyone. I just found this reddit and I felt like to open myself a bit.

The late 2018 and whole 2019 has been terrible. My ex-gf dumped me many times recently, she found other guys that made her happy (everything online) and dumped me, that's a very resumed story to avoid you get bored (I was no perfect bf but never introduced third persons in our relationship). It's been a tough year, yes a year with dumps and coming backs. 

So now it seems she dumped me for good, another guy appeared (the third one?...) and well I don't want it to be but I hope this is the last time. She is happy right now playing with him, doing videocalls and all that shit, he knows him roughly for a month, online gaming. They like each other, want to see each other... When she told me that just when I came from working in Mexico and we were suppose to be boyfriends again. But well this is not a love-reddit...

&amp;#x200B;

Now as 29yo on December, I see myself totally lonely, no friends, no family (just parents but yeah, I don't matter much for them), heart broken. I'm excited to go to work because that is I a place I have the excuse to talk to people and actually quite good so people kinda need me and I love that feeling of being important to someone, even if it's just for work. 

I am very introvert and people just doesn't care about me while I always try to help others whenever I can, I love when people ask me things I feel ""loved"" and I help willingly but it's all that. When I tried to connect with people, asking for a meet I always feel they do it for respect not because they want to. If I say nothing they tend to leave progressively.

My weekly routine is work, gym and videogames/reading. If I ever stop doing something I just remember my ex-gf my loneliness and I just die inside. Weekends are terrible, my future is dark. I've been like this for ever, but I touched heaven with my ex-gf for (roughly) 3 years and now this feels like true hell. Before knowing her I just didn't know what was love and I could keep going on my life...

So yeah I hope to talk with people here, not just for me, if anyone want to talk something about him/herself with me I'm really up to. Also gamers out there we can do some gaming or book reading if up to. Any PLC programmers want to share knowledge I'd happy to do so aswell.

2048,ohnono27,1573072273,5,"Yo friends,

So...Where to begin. I'm lonely ! I can't even tell you when was the last time that my phone rang and it was not someone from my family or work calling. I feel like i don't belong to the crowd. I look at people talking and i don't understand wtf they are doing. I was not like that when i was a teenage. I was very social, lots of friends, gf. It started during my early 20's. I was going out with people, club and so and i was bored. I was looking at them like if they were animals in a zoo. I kept seeing them but i was bored all the time. Now i'm in my early 30's. And it's getting worst.

I can talk with people, i'm not shy. I just don't know why i would talk to them. Most conversations are boring.The only way to feel good and don't get bored when i'm in a social activity is to be drunk.But i'd like to be social. I feel lonely. Most of my friends now are in serious relationship. They start to have kids.My longest relationship of the 10 last years lasted 3 months. It always make me laugh those instagram and FB posts from girls saying "" I hate small talk, i want to talk about universe, atoms, gravity, religion, philosophy and blablabla ""...I always want to answer "" You'r saying that untill you'll meet someone who will talk to you about that.""

i'm not an ugly guy. I can have date. When i go out, get drunk i can score one night standing or so. I was dating a girl a year ago. At one point she thought i bugged her phone. Because i knew stuff she did that she said and was trying to hide. She was a free bird and i was cool with it. How i figured out ? Just by connecting the points...She said one thing, then another thing, talked about a place....Connecting all that made me understand what she did on a day or another. She freaked out of course. But seriously, it's just how my mind works. I just feel like i'm an alien compared to others.

So, in fact every single facking social interaction i had made me feel even more lonely.  And since my last gf that threw me like the worst piece of shit who ever walked on this planet i just stopped to have contact with people. I don't even try since 6 months as i'm like traumatized. Everyday i see the shit that people do to each others. But wtf, i can't even do the half of the quart of the 0.001% of what they do to each others. This is just horrible and sad. Why can't people just try to have happy relationships ? And i'm talking in a friendly and lover way. Are we here to make each others suffer endlessly ?It doesn't make sens. So i'm gonna open up a bottle of wine and get drunk at least i forget that i'm lonely when i'm drunk.

If someone wanna chat, i'm up to.",lonely,I'm a fake social person and i'm lonely.,2019-11-07 07:31:13

Well I went through all the phone calls I’ve had with her so far (my first semester with her btw) and it’s been literally 12, most of them lasting 15-30 minutes each. If she’s short on time she’ll end it at 3-4 minutes but she has never made me feel like I’m annoying her or wasting her time. Most of our phone calls are just about foreign language in general, getting to know each other, or she also helped me apply to this big scholarship to study abroad in the summer for free in Japan so that’s another reason I’ve been calling a lot. I really enjoy talking to her and I let her know that, and I could hear the happiness in her voice when she said “me too!”, but insecurity is making me feel like I’ve been calling too much and I should stop. Another thing is I really admire her and the more I get to know her, the more I‘m realizing she’s the perfect mentor that you usually only see in movies. She is also from Russia which is a country I don’t really know anything about, which makes me more curious in a way because I love meeting people from different countries and learning about their culture.

I'm always forgotten about, too. Every year, my birthday passes and no one ever wishes me a happy birthday so I just stopped caring. But I always make sure to remember other's birthdays and wish them one. It's just little things like that are disheartening.

And since he's busy going after her, he just doesn't really reply to my messages. The girl friend, however, likes to blend in with the guys (she's a tomboy). She acknowledges me but doesn't come to me and talk to me. I feel like she sometimes tries to add me into stuff to not make me feel lonely. I'm graduating from primary school soon, and getting into my dream high school. The girl friend didn't pass the entrance exams, but the guy friend did. He's the only best friend I have left. Sadly, his crush is also getting into that highschool. I asked him if he would still be friends with me, he said something along the lines like this: 'I don't know, but since [crush] is getting into [school], I'll be with her.'.

Mostly for pictures he’s two years older a senior when I was a sophomore. He was a marine so he traveled away while I was still in school. John took me out with his friends. We went to a party I blacked out. Him and two of his friends had sex with me. They called me a slut, gross and ugly after. They ignored me for a while. John kept hooking up with me.

Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more.



That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken.I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS PERSON FOR FOUR YEARS. I haven’t even talked on the phone or FaceTimed him I’m so embarrassed and ashamed I feel so alone. This guy even four years later and me telling him to leave me alone keeps photos of me.

I have only been with one man since I feel disconnected from people. I can’t date I self harm horribly on my vagina. I put bleach in my vagina sometimes because I feel so dirty. If I insult him if he contacts me he just laughs at me or ignores me and keeps sending sexual stuff. This is my fault.


Why was I treated this way? Is it because I’m ugly? Why can’t I get over the way he treated me?",lonely,Is four years enough time to move on?,2019-11-06 22:50:55

I'm 24 years old. In my childhood I was a prodigy. Marvelous in studies, topped my school for 12 grades in a row. But since my childhood I was never raised to be an outgoing, social person. So my social skills are extremely low. I have only my parents with whom I can share my feelings.

Due to my bad social skills, I have been bullied, mocked mercilessly by almost every one. I have never been able to make even a single friend. Every single time I fall for someone thinking of them as my friend, turns out they were just exploiting me and making fun of me behind my back. God knows how many times I've cried my eyes out to my parents regarding this, but they just come to their wit's end and just pray to God and cry along with me.

I somehow managed to get into a good college. But unfortunately I live in an overpopulated country with low infrastructure for career offers and paths. So the major factor deciding your career success is having excellent social skills and vast network so you can gather as much info as possible. I don't so I remained jobless for an year, while other students with very less marks than me managed to get into top companies.

Now I got into a small company and into a team which seamed nice at first. But I was apprehensive about opening up to them, due to my past experiences. They remained friendly to me, cracked jokes with me, called me to have lunch with them, and slowly my apprehension started lowering. I got hope that finally I was able to make friends. I'm not lie, I happy cried along with my parents about this.

On 2nd November was my birthday, so I gathered up enough courage to ask them to visit a popular place with me. Throughout that day, all of them were having fun amongst themselves, clicking pictures, etc while I felt like an outsider. I spent a TREMENDOUS amount of money at a popular restaurant all by myself as an effort for them to like me, maybe consider me as one of them.

What I found out next broke my heart into pieces. While I was under the assumption that we were all leaving for our homes after that outing, all of them were only pretending to leave for their homes. Instead they waited for me to leave, and after that went to a second place just for themselves to enjoy, and made fun of me the entire time. Moreover, all this time, they had a team whatsapp group that i didn't know about, mocking me about the things I opened up to them about, and they had been visiting various places and restaurants and whatever for the past few months, and I was the only one who didn't know about it.

One of those people's birthday is next week, and I suggested to visit this great amusement park.

I feel like a defective product coming from the factory being pushed into this world. I was not made to be in this society. But at my core, I am a human being too, and humans are social animals. When my parents die, I'll have ABSOLUTELY no one. All my life, whenever I have felt strongly about suicide, the thought of my parents immense sadness stops me. But guys, I can't take it anymore!

Like anyone, I had aspirations when I was younger. My top two were Pilot and Chef, and at some point I considered being an electrician. The latter was after a big move, and looking back on it now, after I had already begun to 'break'.   
I grew up in a dysfunctional family, raised by a single grandmother, and watching as my mother went in and out of good and bad places. I had no father figure, either. I was a foster child a couple times, and would've stayed one if things went worse in the courts.  
12 Schools while I was growing up, while most people only transition between 3 or 4 at most. People never left their home until they moved out, I only had a single home for less than 10 years, then shortly after entering high school, I would never live in the same place for more than 2 years. I've managed to recall about 25 different homes within 30 years.  
Moving from city to city, or even across the country will ruin friendships, and you'll lose touch with people. It happened to me. Once that big move in my teen years happened, I would start to break down.  
I slowly began to stop caring. Not just about the world around me, but about myself. I lost my aspirations, I lost my motivation, I lost my hopes of anything working out in the end. This all happened slowly over the course of 15+ years.

  
Somehow I've survived this long, but I've come to realize that I am indeed broken. I'm sure others can see it in me, too. I have a few friends that I'm grateful for, but I'm still beyond repair, I believe. If my existence matters to a few people, then I guess that's all that really matters.",lonely,I broke,2019-11-06 20:04:43

2091,LRN_Trickster,1573020601,1,"I know that most of the time life is like a searing desert, scorching and cruel during the day and cold and lonely at night. We all want someone to love us and we want that love to last forever. Nothing is forever, even the love you envy that lasts 50, 60, 70 years will turn to ash in time. The important thing is to savor the little moments that happen on the day to day and make sure that you never stop looking for shade in the desert.

There are little things like kisses from a newly met girl at a New Years Eve party at midnight. There are bigger ones like a college love that ended over mutual immaturity. Every encounter with a woman (or man) is like a little rest on a long, lonely road. Instead of fearing the end of the repose you enjoy now, be present and in the moment. Take all the comfort you can.

I met a woman earlier this year that made me so ridiculously happy and then crushed my heart over the course of mere days. I remember at one point thinking, “I think I found her.” I can barely remember that pain now. It’ like a dream maybe, or someone else’s life. But I threw myself into it when it happened. I soaked in her adoration and then wept with such anguish at her heartless rejection that I thought I would die. I don’t regret having felt those things. 

So enjoy that awkward smile from the girl on the bus you never speak to. Revel in the passionate hook-up that leaves you just after dawn breaks. Don’t worry about pain and suffering and death, because they are out there and they will find you whether you invite them or not.

2116,Slice-of-Gravity,1572993495,50,"I know there are a lot of us just like me.

We were never popular in high school or college, but we weren’t unpopular. We aren’t unattractive, but usually go unnoticed. We don’t always actively go seeking attention or affection, yet we want it so bad. We see young couples so happy, yet we wonder what it would feel like to fill such a void. We’ve always given our all but were always given the bare minimum in return.

Personally as a male in my early 20’s, it feels like I am just floating out here, going through the motions as time passes me by. I see people I once loved happy with someone else while I was left to pick up the pieces of my shattered heart. I worked hard in my studies but was never acknowledged for the hard work I’ve put in. Family members I thought would stay a while longer in this world disappeared into the abyss. Childhood dreams stayed just that, dreams. Sometimes it just feels like all the odds are against me. 

The silence is what kills me when I’m just in bed by myself at 2:00 AM really alone with my thoughts. I feel like I want to just escape my mind and this sadness but nothing ever seems to drown out the constant turbulence in my mind. I feel worthless, replaceable, alone, and like nothing I do matters. 

Does anyone else feel like they have so much to offer, yet the world has just kept on knocking them down until there’s nothing left? Does anyone else sometimes just feel abandoned by God or the Universe?

2120,lubluv,1572985714,4,"okay this is something that has been bothering me for a while now. 

My younger sister is in her last year of high school (two years younger than me, don't know if that is relevant). Prior to this year, my sister was the biggest social butterfly. Everyone in our high school knew her. She was friends with everyone. She is also very cute so she had a lot of attention as well. Anyways, this year a lot happened. To her and our family in general. She lost a lot of close friends (i feel bad cause some of them betrayed her). However, a lot of the friends she had were not good ones. She was not making the best choices and was hanging with the wrong crowd. However, after everything we have gone through as a family this year, I feel like it opened her eyes and made her reflect on herself. 

She has changed and is no longer doing the stuff she used to do. However, it came at a cost because she is no longer the bubbly social butterfly she once was. I have a great relationship with my sister and we (there are 3 of us) all get along really well and are like best friends. but this is obviously not enough. She has no friends at school anymore and spends her lunch at the library. She is doing so much better in school and her grades are a lot better too. She really turned her life around. But she lost friends in the process.

Now she has been telling me how she has been feeling lonely lately and I know it is hard for her. She was someone who would hang with a different group of friends everyday and she always had notifications going off on her phone because she was  so social. Now she is hanging out with no one. From time to time she will spend her lunch with some people who she still talks to. But she does not have any genuine close friends. It's even worse at home because she never goes out with friends and spends her evenings either on homework, napping or just chilling around the house.

I worry this loneliness will lead her to feeling depressed. I don't know what to do and it breaks my heart seeing her like this.",lonely,my sister is lonely and I don't know how to help her,2019-11-06 07:28:34

I just feel so damn lonely all the time, all I want to do is cry. I have a long distance girlfriend I can talk to a few times a week for several hours, and while we are talking I generally usually feel better (or maybe a better word is distracted, not sure), but the moment she has to go, or can't text me, or is at work (and we have a big time difference too so I can only talk to her in the afternoons/evenings if at all), I start feeling intense misery about being lonely, and often I get this sudden anxiety about not being able to handle loneliness. Like, I will be reading a reddit post which distracts me, and once I finish reading, it hits me -- I'm all alone, I am miserable, and all I have to look forward to is this feeling of loneliness, every day, every week, my whole life. My stomach sinks, I get an adrenaline rush from the sudden anxiety, and a feeling of cold seeps in, and I start thinking of ways I could die so I don't have to feel like this anymore.

I have a bunch of hobbies (not social hobbies though, they're all one-person hobbies), but once I get in the mindset of loneliness, they can't distract me. I just can't be bothered to even try doing them because I have fear and sadness that clouds my thinking. I have no friends, not one, and I just moved to a new city where I have no family or acquaintances either. I don't have a job yet either, though I'm looking. So my days are filled with dread and praying that time goes fast so I can talk to my girlfriend again.

But this is unsustainable, I can't rely on her to carry me thru from day to day. Especially since our relationship has been shaky recently and will not last forever. I got addicted to having her company, and I became reliant on it to keep me from feeling lonely, which was actually very effective. I loved just being in her presence and haven't felt lonely even one time when we lived together. And now I'm getting withdrawals when she's not there with me anymore, and it's miserable. I need and want to learn how to be okay with being by myself again. How to be content with doing my hobbies by myself instead of having to share all my moments with someone. How to even be able to do my hobbies in the first place, because I just can't seem to when I'm lonely. I can't see how therapy could possibly help me change the way my brain feels, but I want to try.

Backstory: I am a male in my early 20’s and I’ve always treated women with respect and loyalty. I’ve always attempted to be the modern version of the suave 1950’s gentleman I am in my mind, much like how my grandfather and father taught me to be. In other words, I am not a player who “just wants one thing.” 

I’ve really tried to be the best I could be, always giving my all in every aspect of my life. But, in the few relationships I’ve been in during college, I’ve been cheated on. I went above and beyond in the value and loyalty I’ve given my girlfriends, but never received that in return. After being hurt so often I’ve kind of just given up while my mindset continues to go downhill. I used to be happier and optimistic on my outlook towards life, but the pain has made me feel like I deserve to be alone. That image I have in my mind of the guy I wanted to always be is just lonely and depressed now.

Maybe I don’t fit into the model standard for a male in today’s society, but everyone deserves love and respect in a relationship. I’m not inferior to those who are 6.0 ft tall, have a big D, have perfect hair, have to be good in bed, have large muscles, be an asshole and have lots of money... because some of these qualities I do have. I know I’m not perfect, but I just feel so unworthy of receiving companionship after my experiences even when I have given so much. I almost feel as if I’m meant to be broken and lonely forever.

2175,dublinp,1572918271,5,"Hey Reddit,   


I don't know where to begin, I'll try to sum up the situation as concisely as I can.   


 I have no strong connection with any of my family. My sister and I were adopted by the same couple, ( we share a biological  mother) and she  has loathed me since I was a child. I've never had a strong relationship with my father because of abuse he went through himself as a kid, his heavy drinking problems, and his general disinterest with the world around him. While I love my mother, she is a broken woman in a loveless marriage, with nearly two decades of health problems and dysfunctional family issues wearing her down to a point of constant anxiety and stress, which she took out on my sister and I as children. At first things were fine in my family when it was just them and my sister, and then I was born unexpectedly, and taken in by my mother. Ever since then it seems like our dynamic has become more and more unstable, to the point where I no longer speak with my sister due to her severe anger management issues, and my father's general  disinterest in me. I'm barely in contact with my mother.   


I'm a college student about to graduate, and I barely feel like I've mastered the skills to be thrust into the world on my own. I have a crippling marijuana addiction that I've gotten help for countless times, support communities and groups, therapists and psychiatrists, I've talked it over with friends and lovers, but no matter what I can't shake it. Weed is the only thing that makes me feel even remotely calm enough to take on the world. But its destroying my life, I've fallen so far behind in school due to my anxiety and fear. I just spend my days ambling around my house cleaning and organizing so I feel like I'm doing something productive. I'm reaching a breaking point, if I don't catch up on certain projects by winter break, I won't graduate.   


I've already taken a semester off for mental health reasons when I was suicidal sophomore year. I'm already a year behind my original graduation date. My father does not support my education, my mother has been paying out of pocket to help me attend a very expensive art school which was my dream reach school when I was younger. She's on social security, and Im bleeding her dry. All while Im wasting time procrastinating and being stressed when I should just work.   


I got a girlfriend a little over a year ago. She quickly figured out I was a pot head with no self control. At first she tried to help, but when I made it clear that I couldn't stop she gave up trying to help me. I dragged her through month after month of promises. Sometimes I kept them and stopped, sometimes I gave in went behind her back. She knew every time, she said she felt like an idiot for believing me. My stress from smoking too much pot, and then becoming overwhelmed with school, just to barely scratch by has been my cycle every semester. She has many of the same issues I have with our family and social anxiety, but seeing me so off the rails not only upset her, but also impacted her own school work.   


 I just found out earlier this week that she cheated on me. I dont know how many times or with how many people, but I know she's hung out with her old tinder-buddies before, and that she met with a girl off reddit specifically for sex. I was devastated, but not surprised. I knew she wasn't happy.   


When I confronted her she said she had given up on trying to open up to me for over half a year, that she felt like she couldn't trust me, and that I didn't care for her anymore.   


On top of this my mom hasn't been able to make the last three payments on my tuition bill. If they don't get paid I cant register for next semester.   


I'm behind on my major thesis project, I have no family, I might not be able to finish school, I'm not good anything but art, my girlfriend just broke up with me, and I have nothing for my peace of mind except weed, which is largely why I'm in this situation to begin with.   


Im so out of options, I just need someone else to know the truth that I'm a mess and scared and have no idea if im strong enough to overcome this.

I do have friends and family but I can’t talk about it with them because they wouldn’t understand and I don’t want them to get worried about me, they already have so much to worry about, I’d rather have them think I’m doing fine. So I’ve been really lonely cause I don’t feel like I can talk about why I’m feeling like that with anyone. Ive been isolating myself and I became socially awkward to the point that even going to a family event stresses me out because I will have to talk to people I don’t see that often.
Also I don’t really have friends that share the same interests as I do, silly things like video games or rugby.

I guess I just needed to vent and also wanted to say that if you ever find a place and people that make you feel like you belong do not leave cause that’s what I did and boy do I regret it",lonely,Lonely af since I came back home,2019-11-05 08:40:43

as i was thinking about it; i was never a people's person, all i had was a bunch (3\~9) of people who know all of them from either middle or high school,(i had only one true friend but we kinda get separated after i changed my high school), in college though - oh boy - i didn't have any new relationship except from people who are just talking to me because i have better grades (actually someone get mad and stopped talking to me just because i didn't ""tell"" him the answers in last year's exam) - wtf i am really writing this and thinking that i am stupid, thank you if you are still reading this- i get to the point where if i am just staying in my room (i live with my parents) all day or going to classes or spending 2\~3 hours on the park working out (which i rarely do now because i start thinking of my shitty life as i train - aaaand now i am crying wtf), the only contact i get from people now is ""Oussama(this is my name) are you going to class now"",""oussama can we revise this module tomorrow"", ""oussama i want to sit next to you today because i don't understand shit in this or that"", i am planning start a new life - in another country- after i finish my masters in 2 years. and this this is the only thing that keeps me going in life. 

i tried one time to join an ""English club"" but i just couldn't fit in, i just looked like an outsider (or so i convinced my self).

oh and i am a virgin; which is not a big deal 'cuz i am a Muslim but wtf even if i was not. i don't think i will lose it. 

as of social media i have only a FB account that i am using just doesn't even have a profile picture -i just use it to download the lectures summaries-

i am really afraid that i will end up alone and as my circle keeps getting smaller and smaller and then problem is that i don't even sit with my family anymore expect for occasional dinners and some small talks (like two to three minutes).

 i am frustrated because i can't find that ""thing"" that will help me to get a friend or just to stop feeling weird or something . 

i hate that the only talks i have is with people in college about college, wtf i feel that i don't have a life.

2195,rayabad123,1572901418,1,"I don't know if this belongs on this specific reddit thread, but I wanted to voice out how I felt . I felt lonely. I am 24 years old and I have garnered quite a few close friends after countless trials and errors. And I am so blessed to have them in my life. There is nothing I wouldn't do for them. Given my character, I have always been so selfless but at the same time very selfish. I have a selfish desire to be wanted and needed so I go out of my way to make the people around me happy. In other words, I only truly make others happy to fulfill my desires. Is that so bad? I always felt like that part of me was such a defining trait that I wore proudly over my heart, if you are happy, I am happy. 

This year has been difficult for me. It wasn't much about what was going around me, but how I was reacting to it. I've come to a point that there are some things that are bound to happen to anyone and to anybody, what matters is what comes after. After a breakup from a toxic relationship, career path standstill, realization that my dad is one step closer from death's door,  I went through depression. In attempts to pull myself from this pit, I did what I could do to make myself happy, make others happy.  My bestfriend  who was going through breakup around the same time had said to me ""For once, I feel lonely right now"". That's where it kicked in, I felt like I was needed and that temporarily helped me forget I had issues of my own. After countless hangouts and playing games and getting to know each other more, I truly felt just fine with how I am. However that change when I tried to be open with him about what I am going through. Of course he knew what was going on my life, but he never knew how I felt inside.  When it had came to his bday, two of my closest bestfriends were there to celebrate it. At the time, I realized this might not be a good time but this was the only time that all three were available.So I decided to tell them what was going on with myself. I am not as open as one would like to think just from reading this post, but my reason for not showing my vulnerability is that I wanted to people to believe that I am reliable and a person who they can come to. It was hard. After kbbq, we decided to chill in the car and head to the arcade later. Both of them were in really good moods, given the food was great but their lifestyle were turning out for the best. Both of them had girlfriends now and that overtook much of the conversations on the car. But there was a brief silence and that's when I interjected. I stumbled in between words, ""Guys, there is something I wanna do. I wanted to be alone without feeling so lonely"". My tone didn't quite fit the topic considering how much I tried to fit into the silence. With that said, there was no curiosity or concern to what I said. The lingering feelings from talking about their girlfriends still dictated the topic in the car so they continued to talk about their gfs. That was it. I never felt so lonely especially around friends. Maybe I should've been more clear and more assertive but that fucking shit broke me and I couldnt help but think maybe they just dont care about me. As the conversation became more and more like white noise, I started to sink in to my thoughts deeper. I started to think ""Why am I so lonely around my bestfriends even?"". I have never felt so detached to a point I started to feel resentment and hatred to the some of the closest people in my lives.  At the moment, I just wanted to be alone cuz what good was it that even with friends around, I felt so lonely. But I decided to stay cuz it was still my friends birthday and when it ended, I stayed in my car crying my heart out wishing I hadn't attempted anything. 

After that had happen, I isolated myself to keep up with my growing resentment. I did not want to be near people anymore. They just disappoint. And that's when I decided to do my soul searching. I still hold true that I wanted to be ok alone without feeling so lonely.  I want to include that although I wanted to be alone, I didnt know where to begin. So I reached out to old friends who went through something similar, and even my mentor from a mobile game. I soon began on investing in self help books and most importantly investing in myself. I felt like this was a start to a change myself for the better. I started to be able to things alone like eating out alone (shoutout to the kbbq place who wouldn't let me eat alone, fuck you) and travelling to the Grand canyon alone and hiking countless trails to reflect on myself.  After quite some time, I became more aware and independent. I say aware cuz at the start of this soul searching, I was not aware of how my bestfriends would react. I simply felt they should just understand but they came from a different culture where emotions was much of a burden than it was a strength.  I ended up telling them what I have been up to in the last two months and the reason behind it. It felt like they finally understood what I was going through. 

I still really consider them two as my bestfriends as I value the memories and how much they helped me grow as a person. I only speak for myself and this post is not intended to be taken as a self help post but as a window to how I struggled with loneliness.

We are two students from the University of Essex, UK that want to conduct an extended research project on Mental Health and the implications it has in our day to day lives. We are looking forward to bringing a new, fresher perspective over mental health issues and we are confident that we can do that by analyzing data, coming up with assumptions and understanding the world around us by studying feelings and perceptions.

The survey is completely anonymous. Personal information like names, phone numbers, addresses/email addresses will not be collected through this survey. No information will be shared with any third party at any point in time. This is purely for educational and research purposes. Due to the nature of the Google Forms platform we are not able to see any private information about you as a respondent.

Someone who I can go climb a tree with, play some video games, stuff like that. Not needing a 30 year old special needs teacher there with us so the other kid doesn't hurt themselves.

So recently I've gotten into a 4-year university, it wasn't my top choice although I cannot complain too much about it. Academically I'm doing well, as I spent most of my time trying to make up where I lacked up in high school.  I've started actually hitting the books and pulling pretty good midterm grades. However, when I was struggling with my lab on Halloween, I've realized how incredibly lonely I am here. During the lab, all I could do was wait for some reaction to happen, and I just there and thought about how I can't talk to people here or make friends as I did in high school. I'm just so flabbergasted, as in high school I felt like I could talk to people easily. I had so many friends in high school, but the roughest transition of college is creating a social life. I've started making jokes about it with my friends from h.s saying that my G.P.A is pretty happy because of my dead social life, saying stuff like ""friends are temporary, G.P.A is forever"". Anyways I can talk to people in my hall, but I feel like everyone here just think I'm just a tryhard in academics (which is partially true). Everyone here is just so socially adept, I feel like a fish out of water. On the first-week people made their own clicks, and I'm here in awe how fast people made these friendships. I've decided to join some clubs to meet people. Despite joining a club that feels like a family, sometimes I feel like an outsider most of the time. Everyone there feels like they've been friends for years, and even the other new members hit it off pretty off well with the veterans in the club. I'm here just feeling left out. I feel like I'm invisible to a lot of people. It's just scary to be by yourself and you isolate yourself through your head. I remember just crying after my lab, all by myself at the engineering building. I just want to cry right now, all to myself. It just feels like I'm just wasting people's oxygen.

To give a quick background on myself, I just graduated from college in May and moved my entire life to Texas in August to start working on my masters degree at a pretty big school here. It was nice to be among some new students and exploring a new campus for a few weeks, but I ended up hating my grad program so I withdrew. I’m still in my college town (I actually really like it here) and I got a really nice full-time job until I start school again in the spring (going a different route for my end-goal career and stuff). Here’s my thing: I’m like...lonely here lol. Like I have one person here I know that actually went to college with me and she miraculously ended up in the same place, but she has her own stuff going on and we don’t see each other that often here. I’ve been trying to figure out ways to get myself out there to meet more people, especially in/around school (oh yeah, I’m also 22. I think that’s important information lol). My last school was 40,000 people, this school is easily over 70,000 people so you’d think it would be easy, right? I’m just not sure what to do to make some friends here. Work keeps me pretty busy for the time that I’m there, so I never really feel this way until I have so many days off and nothing to do/no one to hang with.

2234,tekkature,1572848305,0,"So I meet my girlfriend just a while back after almost 3 years of being alone in Highschool and giving up on dating till college. We meet at orientation and it was like it was set up to be. We were so happy together and every moment we spent together was like the best moment of my life. It’s important that your Eliza that my college is over 5 hours away from my hometown almost more than a state length away so it’s a big adjustment for me. Moving here I was so excited to be here because I live the school and for once in my life I would have a girlfriend who was normal. (my ex was mentally abusive) everything was all fine until just last Tuesday we’re at about 12am we were talking and I was showing a bit of concern Because in the previous week the week of midterms and the largest amount of stress so far, we weren’t able to see each other for a whole week and we had planned to finally meet up on Tuesday the week of Halloween to just spend quality time together relaxing and having fun with each other just relaxing. That day she told me after her classes she had homework. I was okay with her doing it before she came perilously her request so I waited in my apartment trying to pass time. around 5 hours passed and by now it was almost 7. At 7:30 I was getting really bothered and texted her to remind her that I had work early in the morning the next day so if she planned on coming she would only have a couple hours to spend with me. Also it’s important to note that she had updated me about her progress on the homework showing her intent to come over 3 times in the last few hours. She the. Told me she still wasn’t finished and that she didn’t think she could come. I was extremely depressed and upset because I missed the fuck out of her and she was acting strange. Tbh I’m just going to cut to the chase. The next day at 12am as I was saying she told me that her feelings had changed and she no longer felt that she had to spend time with me or talk to me and that she felt this isn’t something she should feel in a relationship. This was after I questioned the fact she wouldn’t even say I love you back to me like we always did . I had a costume and plans that we had made together for Halloween the next day but when I asked her earlier this night those she claimed she had made plans with her friends to watch movies all night and disregard the whole plan we made. By now she had blown me off 3 times in one week and I was starting to feel like garbage. Only the next day (Halloween) after telling her friend about her behavior did her friend tell me she told her we broke up. Not once did I or she say anything about breaking up. this made me sad and confused and I just keep asking myself what happened and why? It’s like I can’t even recognize her behavior she doesn’t even talk the same and this week I could barely see her true self at all. same week my closer friend got upset after I accidentally snapped at her and now she won’t talk to me either. Now I just feel like I’m abandoned and cold and alone and useless and the worst thing is that before when I was alone at least it never felt that way because I knew I had her. Now whenever I get home or sit in my apartment I just feel like I’m trapped and slowly dying wishing I could share my life and the joys of living with someone but there’s no one to give that to.

2241,30yrlimit,1572838184,0,"There's something about me that makes me worth fucking but not loving. It sounds really harsh but it seems to keep happening to me. I put myself out there for dating and all I seem to attract are hookups. Even when I'm getting along with a guy and it seems like they enjoy my company the relationship remains purely sexual. Most of the time it doesn't even get far enough to become friendly, the immediate approach from them is to be sexual towards me and I can't figure out why. 

I don't think I'm a dull person. I have a fair amount of friends who seem to genuinely enjoy my company and I've been complimented on my sense of humor. I have a good engineering job and I like to think I'm not a total dumbass at least. I make art and I have other hobbies. 

I've been told I'm attractive by friends and family and physical attraction doesn't seem to be my issue. I use dating apps and the type of men I match with are often conventionally attractive (or I find them attractive).  But I don't even think I'm the kind of person who would shoot someone down immedietly based on looks. Quite frankly I don't get approached by guys in social groups that often. I'm not shooting ""nice guys"" down because they're not the ""right guy"" for me. This just isn't happening to me. Cat called, approached by guys in clubs/bars to take me home, sure. 

I don't think im dressing provocatively most of the time. I'm told I usually look put together and I really make an effort with my appearance.

I've only in the past year made an effort to date. Before that I was in school and focused on my studies but I'm really starting to lose hope. I'd always assumed that once I was settled in as an adult, I'd naturally transitioninto dating and so I didnt ever let the lack of opportunity in high school and college bother me.

Recently I've begun to doubt everything about myself and that combined with some other insecurities about my career choice has really crushed my confidence. It sounds really ridiculous that lack of success in dating could make me feel completely uncertain about my reality but it's a contributing factor in how increasingly shitty I feel. I'm embarrassed to even think about it and if I wasnt high right now I'd be to embarrassed to even write this.

The worse part is that I've gotten extremely promiscuous in response. I spent most of my life as a virgin and then I lost my virginity to a stranger (it was a terrible experience for many reasons aside from that, but that's a different, more pathetic story. Lately I don't even have the patience to delay sex when I'm talking to someone anymore. I tried to take things slowly with a guy recently and then initiated sex the second time after seeing him in person because I seem to have no self control.

Naturally this is leaves even less of a reason for them to pursue anything other than a strictly sexual relationship. So now I'm having sex with four different guys and I'm not even really sure why. I try to tell myself I shouldnt make myself feel bad about being sexual liberal and I genuinely don't think women should be judged for being sexual and would never shame another woman for doing the same. I'm also very safe, use protection and am very vigilant and proactive about getting tested. None of this makes me feel any less shitty because I've also taken to asking these guys to treat me roughly/use me for sex.

2245,GraysonJune_,1572835617,1,"Hey guys. So go ahead and downvote/ignore this post, I'm just venting I guess.

So, I have major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety, and a lot of symptoms of BPD. (Haven't been officially diagnosed but my therapist seems to think I've got it.) I've also got tinnitus. And all of this makes life borderline unbearable for me.

I've got plenty of friends I guess but I rarely reach out to them because I'm sure I'm just bothering them. I don't even feel worthy of their time so I usually isolate myself for days at a time and only talk to my immediate family and/or an AI app on my phone. 

I'm really lonely too....a lot of people have told me I'm attractive. I've had attractive girlfriends too. and when I tell people, they can't believe I'm a kissless virgin. But I always see myself as hideous. I tell myself ""no woman would ever love me"" over and over again in my head. I guess so I can accept it? I also tell myself I'm ugly as fuck and too short for love. (5'9...and according to many people on incel forums, girls irl, etc, 5'9 is too short for a man gotta be 6' or over right?) so finding love is out of the picture.

I have plenty of hobbies, a passion for music and I dress well, I'm working of taking more care of myself too but I just started a job and currently have no money to do so...

Which leads me to becoming an incel. I wouldn't become a hateful one, simply because I don't see women as objects. But I'd be one because I'm too ugly to ever find love or get anyone interested in the first place. I feel I'd really find a community there and I wouldn't feel so alone. 

I don't know...it just REALLY hurts when I see attractive women out in public and I just know I'm not worth their time. Even looking in their general direction isn't allowed for me. I genuinely feel every woman on the planet hates me so i go out of my way to avoid them....

When I first moved in I had two roommates in a buildup room that never seemed to really like me and excluded me. They also moved my stuff around without asking when I went home one weekend which really pissed me off and constantly had their loud friends in our very cramped room. When our buildup got broken down in the middle of September, they started listing reasons why I should be the one to move out, so I did. My new roommate has been a nightmare to deal with (blasting music, setting multiple alarms in the morning for no reason, etc.) despite me repeatedly asking her to stop. She also tells me she’ll invite me to go somewhere with her friends and then leaves and never comes back until like 2 am. She also annoys me when she comes in drunk or high if I’m awake. Like I don’t care if you party, just don’t annoy me when you come back. I lost my shit with her when I was sleeping and she came in high at 1:30 am and woke me up by turning the light on, blasting and singing to music and slamming the microwave when I had to get up early that morning to take a train home.

I’ve tried to chat with people but it always fizzles out pretty quickly .  Just don’t know what to say . Anywho , hopefully I can find people to play Minecraft with or something that doesn’t involve a ton of interaction cuz clearly I suck at being human :-/.

2259,F1celess,1572825507,1,"I really miss this feeling of loving someone. Even if they don't like you back. If you are picky person as me you know what it feels like to have very long intervals between having crush on someone and when you finally meet the one you truly like, you start to feel incredible vibrations in your heart and energy waves flowing through your body. You are feeling alive again. You fell in love not only with the looks of the person but with their personality. Immeasurable pleasure!

And that is why you cannot afford to lower your standards anymore because you will not feel anything with other people. Maybe you could have done that when you were young, but this option is not available anymore because you felt what others didn't and now it is encraved deep in your mind. Your friends might have already noticed how things are working with you and said that you should change, but they just don't understand. They want to help you but it does not work this way. You were blessed with a great love once and you have become enlightened.

Majority end up just being with someone they don't love when there is too little time left for them preferring this way rather than the solitude, but you are not one of them. And as the time goes by you gamble and gamble more and more of your life. You cannot stop this because it is a curse. We are the picky persons and too few of us win this long race once it starts.

Toying with people’s emotions, orchestrating relationships from the shadows, trying to fix people from the confines of his own pitch black tower in the night.

He sits in his dark sanctum watching all of the happiness he has brought upon his people, but where is his happiness? It has long since faded. He does get a small glimmer of hope every time someone he helps thanks him or becomes happier but it all fades in the end. It is overtaken not with anger, not with sadness, or anything else. It is trumped by the tyrant of exhaustion. That’s what it all boils down to at the end of the day. Exhaustion. And yet he keeps asking, how was your day? How are you doing? Do you want to talk?

I also tried my luck in dating, and nope.. a disaster, not a single match on any dating apps! So decided it's not worth it and stopped trying. 
I manage to travel to a few places alone and I try to make friends at the places I stay but I still somehow feel I'm not welcome there.

I have no idea what I want for myself, and that alone puts me behind. I don't think I'm talented enough to pursue art, or smart enough to pursue STEM. I'm at the age where I need to have an answer, but I don't. I don't think I can excel at anything. 

I accidentally push away all my friends when I'm not presenting this facade that I'm relatable and goofy. They don't want to hear me when I'm miserable, they don't even want to hear me when I'm fine. That leaves absolutely nobody that wants to hear me.

It's what so many kids looked forward to, I never did that though. Problem 1 was that I didn't think I was ever special enough to be a kid doing the distributing and problem 2 was that I knew that I didn't have a friend to go do it with. So this one year, I decided that regardless of whether or not I had a friend to do it with, I would do it. So I woke up extra early on my birthday, so that I could sneakily buy chocolates on the bike ride to school and I'd do it.  I don't remember exactly what happened that day but all I can remember is that I left the chocolates on the last bench of the class, without telling anyone it was my birthday and they all kinda took the spoils of war themselves. The only ones who wish me a happy birthday have been my family members, and all of them are great and caring and supportive but damn I feel lonely man. I shouldn't be crying like this. I'm a little scared what would happen if someone were to walk into the room right now.

Alright so carrying on with the story, I celebrated my birthday once, when I was very young and my parents threw out a party at a hotel, to which no one from my school was invited, and now that I think of it, it was probably a way for them to network with the people they did invite. What generally happens on my birthdays is that we end up at 8 o'clock with a small cake on the dining table because we don't like cakes with the 5 of us around it and that's my bash. So you see, I don't really look forward to my birthdays. The only good thing that happens is that my mother comes to my room at midnight and she wishes me a happy birthday. That's kinda nice. But lately I've been thinking that that's something she just has to do because I'm her son, so like yeah.

But this birthday was supposed to be special, you see I'm turning 18 tomorrow, and I'd decided a few months ago that by then I'd go out and make good friends. I'd throw a big party and invite everyone and it'd be great. As you can probably guess that's not happening. So like, yay 18th birthday finally an adult. Happy birthday to me.",lonely,I hate birthdays,2019-11-04 01:48:15

Due to circumstances out of my control I live at home with mum and dad while other people my age are living away from home and I just feel so childish by comparison. I have actually been made fun of for this.

I don't know where to even begin. I am pretty sure I want to be in a romantic relationship but how can I even acheive this when I don't even have any friends anymore. I have never been on a date and I have never been kissed or even held hands with anyone. No one would want to be with me because people want to be with people that excite or interest them. I'd just bore you. I wouldn't even want to be with me.

I feel like I'm so inadequate. I look at social media posts of other people my age and even younger enjoying themselves and going to festivals and music gigs and parties and stuff and I feel so empty. I've never ever had these experiences. I want to have them. I don't have anyone to do them with.

I don't know what I'd even talk about with other people. They'd all be sharing funny stories of their past meanwhile I have nothing because I've done nothing in life worth mentioning. I feel like people would just make fun of me. Like people will just laugh at how much of a loser I am.

2309,Muchacho3,1572770665,8,"I () am currently in my freshman year of College and my once more than fulfilling social life has dwindled to barely anything at all. I've never been the most social person, so I went through most of high school tending to myself up until my senior year where I got really close to a great group of friends that I still keep in touch with. I share a true intimate connection with these people that I never even knew could exist, and now that we've gone off to college and parted ways, I am realizing how vital that constant social interaction has become to my mental health. One of those friends, my best friend actually, does attend the same school as me, but they're in ROTC and have found a new social group around that and other clubs they've joined. We do hang out every once in a while, but the time between hangouts seems to be getting longer and longer. I know they deeply care for me, just as I care for them, but not seeing the one person I have left still sucks. Quality bonding time is something I don't experience anymore and need back very soon.

Most of my days here are eaten up by studying, working out (this helps keep me afloat) or working, so even if I did have the social initiative to go out and meet people, the time I have to do that is very minimal. Besides, I definitely do not fit in well with party culture, which pervades through the entire student body, as it seems. So many people here glorify drugs and alcohol and hooking up with strangers, it's disgusting (welcome to college life I guess). Sure, I'll drink if invited, but I cannot stand the way so many people use substance abuse as a personality trait or a hobby. I'm just not into that. I've made a couple acquaintances at work, and they're really friendly and I enjoy their company, but we don't ever hang out outside of work. Not even having the chance to form a strong emotional bond with someone, whether it be my lack of initiative or their disinterest, sucks fat penis. Outside of work, I haven't met too many people. I actually have zero people I would consider friends and my self esteem does not like that. I tried introducing myself to people in my classes the first couple weeks of class, but no one seemed to care so I just stopped trying. 

I'm at a point where I have no idea what to do. I know I have to do something in order to change this, but my current situation and approach to social life have me floundering. I walk around campus between classes and I see people walking together and talking or holding hands and it just makes me want to listen to Blonde on repeat (which I subsequently do). I'm a sad, lonesome, sack of shit, to put it bluntly, and it's eating me up inside. I'm pretty reserved, so I may not display it on the outside, but then again there isn't anyone around to notice, anyways.

This feeling of loneliness is fucking awful and I want it to end right now. I don't know how much longer I can stand it. But I feel like this is my fault for not having no initiative. Or have I negated my chances of finding a good social circle by being consumed in my own everyday life? I don't fucking know, but I guess I have to figure it out myself. I wish I could go back to old me that didn't know what emotional connections were and be happy with the life I'm leading and not are about my lack of a social life.

I find myself so alone, even though it has been 4 years since University and Break up, and I never thought it would affect me this much.

Some would only reply when I asked them a question and it would naturally be a one-word answer or if I was lucky, a sentence.

I had depression before, one of my ex girlfriend is bipolar and she got anxiety also. I attempted suicide before. I know a lot about people's psychology because of all of these bullshits.

So I went on a ""date"". She said she was looking for friends for now and outdoor activity partner. I also knew her (kind of). So I matched, sent a funny pic, took like 2 months for her to reply. We talked slowly at first but starting hitting it off good in the text messages. She kept suggesting we go meet for a walk. Didn't show up the first time which was ok because it was short notice. We rescheduled. Still didn't show up. I waited like an idiot. I asked her if I did/said something wrong.

She said no. Her apartment was unlivable atm so she was staying with a drunk guy. The cops were called because she claims to have knocked him out for messing with her. Big red flag.

She keeps messaging me and I'm out in town drinking in dark corners. Against my better judgement, I visited her at her place. Gave her something to get high from. Bad idea. She told me all about her drug problems and how she lost custody of her child and has to pay child support. She started crying and taking pills and drinking all the alcohol I brought. I'm thinking, RUNNN!!! I was also thinking how much of a bad influence I must be. I wanted to help her out of her hole. There is a good side to me but I can't help people that can't help themselves or won't get help.

He never was able to deal with the stress. He had to take a lot of medicine, some which would cause very abrupt mood swings. He was upset that he was sick and couldn’t provide for his family, that his pension was as taken way because some nurse signed the paperwork saying he was healthy enough to work a desk job, meanwhile my he was constantly in pain and would sleep 20 hours a day from not being able to stay awake.

When I was starting the 6th grade my family decided to homeschool me. My father was to stay home and watch me. I literally became his punching bag for his anger from his job. Every day for 3 years I had the shit beaten out of me, I was reminders every day that I was a piece of shit that would never amount to anything, anytime something needed to be purchased for me, clothes, food, etc, I was told I was making the family go bankrupt, he told me that I was killing him because of the stress I caused him. I would regularly get into fistfights with him, the last one happening when I was around 16.

(alt account because I don't want my friends to know...)

So I'm 33 years old and despite being a pretty go getter personality, decently fit, and normal looking I have never been on a date in my life. I tend to be shy around people that I don't know (although very gregarious with friends) and I'm very religious so casual hook-ups were really never an option.

Flash forward to two weeks ago. My local religious community decided to host a singles night and I went with friends in the hopes of at least making some new friends (in my profession 95% of the people I work with are women). There were 40 men at the event and 45 women. In typical speed dating fashion everyone was given a number - after meeting with everyone at the event you could write down as many numbers as you wanted (8-10 is the norm) and if you both wrote down each others' number then you were a 'match'.

A week later we received the results. I got no matches, which was disappointing but fine - I was glad to have gone anyways. Then my friends started to call and tell me that 'hey I didn't get any matches but at least I know that six people wrote me down!' and similar. Wait...but...their messages said not only that there were no matches but ALSO how many people wrote them down?!?!

Fearing the worst but wanting to be optimistic I emailed the director of the event and point blank asked - does the fact that I didn't get that message mean that not a single man at the event even wrote my number down? Her reply? 'Yes. Exactly.""

Well, cut to a scene of me having a good old fashioned ugly cry at the thought of going to this event and out of forty people not even one of them wrote me down on their list of top choices...I decided to reach out to a trusted friend on the planning committee to let her know of my situation and how easy it was to deduce that no one had written me down. I asked if she could mention anonymously to the organizer that letting people know this info was probably not a good idea because it led to me deducing (as other people could) that not only did they have no matches...literally no one at the event picked them.

Well, the next day I got an extremely long and angry email from the director accusing me of trying to sabotage the event, being the only complainer out of more than 80 attendees, and essentially not being Christian enough. It mocked my situation, told me that I completely devastated her, and that I should never have said anything. Turns out the person I trusted accidentally forwarded my message with my name attached.

Anyways...Sorry for the long rant, I'm just feeling so defeated, lonely, unloveable, and alone. I feel like an utter failure and I could just really use a little encouragement :(

1. I feel lonely, and the only thing that seems to relieve the sinking feeling in my heart is to tell myself I will go out and work on my confidence and make friends. This gives me a sense of closure and happiness.
2. I read up upon how happiness comes from within, meditate ""through"" sadness and it too shall pass. I also read how if you search for friends, you won't make any. However, not sure how true that is, I believe that if you set your mind on something, it will be attained. Not necessarily goal of ""make friends"", but a goal of ""be open, love everyone and meet people"". Then, friends come. But it's just messing with my head to think my happiness is dependent on relations. It's not like I'd be a clingy friend in any capacity, I workout daily, I meditate, eat healthy, my mind is strong as fuck and I can out-will anything, but I seriously just don't have any friends (I'm studying abroad, so my best friend is back home).
3. I feel sad again, this time not knowing why. And the only conclusion I can come to is that my life isn't where I want to be since I feel lonely, being in my mid 20's without a GF. It's not even necessarily that I don't have friends, but rather I fully have the tools, I know I have a good personality and confidence, sometimes I just don't try because, I don't know, I just tell myself it's not the cause of my issues, but I really think it is. Repeat to step 1.

That group included my very best friend, whom I had even more in common with. But everything changed when we all went out to High Schools. They all went to the same and I went to another school because it was an art school. My friends, especially my best friend, promised that we would communicate very often. She told me to promise that I wouldn't forget her and I will not find better friends than her. Then, when we started going to new schools, none of them wrote to me for all 2 weeks. So, I first wrote to them all, How are you? '. The days passed by and none of them wrote to me anymore. My best friend would only write when she wanted help. She requested me to prepare her English homework for her or to lend her a bike. I saw many photographs of them on Instagram. They had formed a new group with their new classmates. They were all there except me. My best friend already has a new friend. She even wrote how they are similar in character and style and how they go to the cafe each day. I noticed them hugged in the photos and it hurt me so much. After all, she was my best friend. I once wrote to a friend, how are you? ' and she just wrote me down, I will write to you later'. Well, I thought. I waited for her message all that evening, but she no longer wrote to me that week. I had already agreed to meet with a friend of our group today, but she canceled her plans at the last minute because something had happened.

2391,soph_bot,1572691354,9,"Hi.  I’m a girl btw. So I went to college freshman year but had to drop out because I was suicidal.  For the past 3 years I’ve just been living with my parents. I NEVER hangout with anyone except when my highschool friends come back from their colleges for the summer. But here’s where it gets a lot worse- my parents decide to move across the country. (I live in the US). So now it’s not even like I get to look forward to my friends coming home on a break or something, I just have no one. I tried reapplying to schools again but I got rejected from all of them. I don’t want to make friends here because I know ~one day~ I’m going to move out  and have to leave them behind. And I hate the idea of temporary friendships. 
I HATE living with my parents. We do everything together and always fight. 
I don’t have any money to my name so I can’t move out. My only chance for escape/making new friends is college but I feel like I failed at that. 
Also I’m extremely socially anxious. I’ve never had a job because it’s just so scary to me but I feel like the only way for my life to move forward is if I had money. 
It’s so so hard seeing my highschool friends on social media posting pictures of all their college friends and all the parties they go to. I know people are always like “that’s just social media, you don’t know if they’re really happy” but I keep in touch with my friends and they literally tell me they’re happy. I feel like I’m so behind in where I’m supposed to be in life and that I’m also wasting my time doing nothing. Yeah I do basically nothing during the day except go on my phone and eat. 
Oh and don’t even get me started on romantic relationships.  I was just majorly rejected by this girl I was almost in love with and that has ruined any confidence I had left. I am constantly fantasizing about being in a relationship.

Ever since I turned 18, I’ve noticed that men will pay attention to me for sex. I’ve put myself out there a lot because it feels nice to be wanted, and they actually care about me when I do stuff like that for them. This extended into the internet, I figured maybe I’d meet someone if I started making videos. It hasn’t helped, and I’ve given up on that, I only keep the videos up still since it offers a little bit of money. 
The constant feeling of loneliness has been so hard to deal with and has been intensifying with every semester I’ve been at college. On top of that I’m failing a class or two every semester because I’m addicted to the internet and can’t seem to get my act together. All I do is stay in all day being a lazy, depressed fuck-up. I’ve had summer jobs and I would consider myself a good worker in a non-school environment, I just don’t think I have the motivation or discipline to apply myself the same way in college. I just feel so stupid and worthless and like a terrible person.
I have one friend that I have really strong feelings for. I think he cares about me too but I know my feelings will never be reciprocated. It’s been really adding onto my feeling of hopelessness knowing this, and I feel like maybe I should stop talking to him because it’s been hurting me everyday.

I have some amazing kids. I try to do it all but battle depression a lot &amp; could clean much better than I do &amp; take care of myself better.  Relocated years ago far away from family (not that it’d be any different if we lived closer they never checked on me to begin with when I raised our first child by myself in my early 20’s while he worked off.) For a good 4-5 years I’ve been somewhat putting myself out there in the “mom” zones trying to just make one good &amp; true friend. Just one adult soul on this earth that it would affect or would notice if I didn’t exist on this earth. Someone that on their on free will invited me to do things with them or returned any favors I do for so many other people. I moved around a lot as a kid &amp; never had anyone I really considered a friend until my 10th grade year at a new high school. We don’t live close (haven’t since we were 21) &amp; rarely get time to even text. I have sisters, cousins, &amp; family but am not really close with them. I see all the grandparents watching their kids &amp; everyone making memories. They all seem to have normal lives together as a family without me &amp; friends of their own. My own mother will call (when she actually does) talk for 1-2 minutes (unless she’s ranting &amp; venting clearing all her own thoughts out) &amp; the moment I start to say I’m stressed out about or I’m exhausted with or man I’m lonely, I get cut off mid word with... “Well, I was just calling to see how you were doing. I’ll let you go you seem busy. Bye!” Or cut me off to tell me something about my sister. I feel in my heart if I passed tomorrow there’d be a lot of crocodile tears at my funeral for attention but otherwise my absence on this earth genuinely wouldn’t affect their lives at all. My thing is the “drama” &amp; “gossip” with adult women I find hard to connect with. So I end up being the one mom at the game or the one mom at the practice by herself because the incessant chatter of drama is draining for me. It’s the same with family.

Anyone  want to chat?

Not  sure what the response is going to be for this post, and that's okay  really, I should be reading self improvement literature I guess.

 I don't consider myself to have bad self esteem or even to be depressed since this breakdown; I just see myself for who I am now. Regardless I cry daily at the drop of the hat and my anxiety can be so severe that I sleep in the stairwell of my apartment complex for weeks to avoid my roommates. Life with no one to talk to or hang out with has changed me into an alien. 

 I still laugh at youtube and memes and have semi-meaningful conversations but I don't feel like I can feel emotion like I used to. Long bouts of staying in bed crying or smoking weed and drinking used to be my way of coping, but since ghosting everyone I have no way of even getting alchohol so I just work and sleep.

2419,hamartiated,1572670442,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I've always sort of hated my birthday. I always saw it as a day where people have you shit out ot obligation rather than just doing so to be nice. I always saw it as celebrating the fact that you're a year closer to your own obituary being in the Sunday news. It seems so pointless. Why would I want to celebrate my birthday? I don't even like myself, why celebrate a day centered around something I don't even like? Most people don't like me either. I've got my family and about a handful of friends (of which I am thankful to have though). But nobody will even be there for me on my birthday besides my mom and brothers, and that's if I'm lucky. All of my brothers work and my mom is never home nowadays, so I wouldn't be surprised if even they didn't show up. So I'll essentially be all alone.

I've always fantasized about liking my birthday. Loving it even. I'd wake up to texts from friends and family, even a lover, all saying ""happy birthday"" with some sort of nice message about how they appreciate me. Then I'd get up and clean the house and prepare for a small party I'd have. I'd order pizza and make cake or something and just spend time with all my friends and family and my lover. Or maybe my lover and my family would all go out to a nice restaurant together and just have a blast being together. But it's just that; a fantasy. Not a reality. It could never be a reality. Everybody is too busy and I'm too unlovable and undesirable for a lover. It's similar to how I hate Christmas, though I hate Christmas even more. But that's for a later post. 

To conclude, I'm not looking forward to my birthday. I haven't since I was a younger kid and I probably don't ever again. Life had a funny way of making everything go wrong for me, and I've just gotten used to it at this point. Though that doesn't make it any easier to deal with  I just want to throw my face into my pillow and cry until I cease to exist, but I can't even cry anymore. Yea, I'm lonely and depressed most of the time and I can't even cry. I can't even be properly fucking depressed! But I digress.

I had to end a FWB with my best friend/ex because I fell for him again, even though I didn't mean to fall for him again. I just couldn't deal with everyone thinking that we are dating and that every time he played a video game online and met other females that almost instantly fell for him and he would either lie to hem about us or just not ever inform them of what's really going on between us. It's infuriating because I felt like the other girls should know at some point and yes we would continue to be fwb's even if he was online dating the other person or something like that. Even though he never felt like he was dating them but they thought he was or at least to them it seemed like they were a thing. I always felt bad because it made me feel like I had to tell the other girl what was really going on and plus he always says that he isn't going to look for other people and that he doesn't want to date anyone else. Yet he always ends up practically online dating someone else and isn't truthful to them or himself. I just feel lonely because I have no other place to live. It's like I want to live in a different state but at the same time I don't want to leave him by himself because I know how his depression is, it makes him want to kill himself if he is left alone and I know he would if I left him alone completely and to be honest I don't ever want to lose him as a friend in any kind of way. I have struggled so hard to get a job ever since we moved into this apartment together and even though I am the main reason why he got an apartment, I just feel so bad about everything for everyone. I may still love him but like always I'll just continue to love him from afar. I just hope that whoever ends up with him treats him right. I know our time together wasn't always the best and by that I mean he has a hard time expressing love other than sex and I know it's a mixture from his first relationship, which was completely toxic and nothing but sex, which he did say he grew to dislike having sex anything he was around her, and his depression. It doesn't bother me that he has a high sex drive but what bothers me or at least makes me upset is that anytime I tried to initiate or wanted to try anything new or even try to be flirty/sexual towards him he would shut it down or ignore it and it made me feel so bad because for some reason he wouldn't do that with me or let me do that with him but yet when it comes to these other girls that only know him online, he will let them be flirty and sexual and he would be the same right back. He probably doesn't realize that he does it to be honest because I know he can be really oblivious to things but then again he probably knows what he is doing. I just know that he suffers with a lot a shit that has been caused by his depression and self heater. I'm not ever going to give up on him in a friendly way and I hope he knows that. I just hope this doesn't cause him to do something stupid. Another thing that I will admit weirded me out was anytime he would be in a voice call with them, or anyone really, they would never ask about who that was in the background, because I would talk sometimes to him, our cats, or if I'm playing a video game on the PS4. I would love to own a gaming PC but since I don't have a job and our job market is complete shit here, I haven't ever been able to make one. I love video games a lot but it sucks not having the one thing that I have always wanted, the gaming PC and to be loved like how I love him. It just sucks all around right now and I wish I could get a driver's license and own a car but that won't happen for a long time, I feel like. I might talk to him about all of this more tomorrow, if he doesn't have work, and see what he feels about things because I know right now his depression is bad and yeah I feel like absolute shit doing this right now but what else am I supposed to do, sit here and suffer? I know I'm average at best when it comes to looks and it sucks knowing that but all I have ever wanted to be loved the way that I love him.

It sucks when you're always that situational friend, that fifth option, that third person walking behind on a sidewalk where only two people fit. I think there was a point in my youth where I sort of distanced myself from people because I couldn't bare their judgement or anything, and I've always been a loner, but damn I've really tried to make friends, and care truly for others with no avail. 
I honestly feel embarrassed that I failed so miserably at this basic skill in life that I even ""pretend"" like I have a normal amount of friends and a normal social life to other people, like when they talk about their friends and hangouts and I feel so misplaced that I just go along with it.
It really saddens me a lot sometimes that I'm not that important to anyone, to the point of me crying myself to sleep and literally feeling a lot of physical pain. Feeling lonely really hurts.

2445,c_drommedar,1572653048,9,"Hello there,

my (M) 19th birthday is coming up and I don't have any friends to celebrate with. Thankfully I have my family but this year has been kinda hard. 

I fell back in comparison to last year... The most significant thing of the year was meeting a girl my age I really liked and I was sure she liked me too, infact it was so obvious a blind man could see it. I wanted so badly to make a move, planned it over and over in my head and just couldn't do it when I stood next to her... Now she lost interest and I can totally understand why that is. There where so many easy oppurtunities to make friendships/meet new people that I avoided because I felt kinda scared about the stress and the embarresment that could come along with it.

About a month ago I started searching for professional help to finally diagnose if  I have some kind of social anxiety or whatever holds me back in that matter so I could start working on it, but realised that I am not financially capable of paying for a therapist. However I live in a country with free medical care, the only problem with that is that a therapist who accepts people with gouvernment medical care have a waiting time of atleast over half a year until I could even expect to speak to someone.

I'm starting to feel very hopeless. I read about fighting possible social anxiety yourself but don't know how to start and build a routine.

Just wanted to hear someones opinion about this. Perhaps any suggestions on what I could do next if anyone was in a similar position. (sorry for bad grammar)",lonely,19th Birthday coming up. I don't see any improvements so far...,2019-11-02 11:04:08

I've had this reoccurring thought in my head, that pretty much all friends you had were situational, and then when the situation no longer exists, you loose the friend. This happened to my football friends, my college friends, until I no longer have any friends. What's worse is that part of embracing the loneliness makes you actively do things to push people away. I shaved my hair because I box, and because why do I need to look nice if I can't get a girlfriend of have friends, why dress as best as I can either, I'm not trying to impress anyone.

Being in crowded public places is the worst, so many people, surely one could have a connection, but no.

I was at the cinema earlier, alone as I have been for the last few weekends (I go for five guy's and a movie by myself on friday's after work), and i remembered  being in there on a date with one of the girls who got away, they're so rare. I wish I had someone to do these things with, but I don't, the alternative is spending all my time at home, but I don't think that would be good for me.

It's almost as if people can sense nobody wants to be around you, I feel anti magnetic. I work, I train, I'm clean, but for the life of me I can't find anyone to love me, let alone just be my friend and hang out.",lonely,Ever thought of the term situational friends?,2019-11-02 09:14:53

They never invite me to hangout and I’m pretty sure they have another group chat without me. I know they seem really toxic but they’re the only people I know. In school I hangout with this one guy but I only hang out with him because I have no one else.

Holidays are the absolute worst for feeling lonely, especially during the colder months. I have so many good memories with old friends from this time of year from when I was younger. I think that's why the past few years spent alone have been excruciatingly hard to deal with. I have no real friends anymore. Acquaintances and empty small talk, that's all it ever is.

I thought I didn't have a great high school experience, but it turns out I had it pretty good. I had a best friend, at least, and she had other friends, so I had a ""group"". I was so lucky to have that, and I took it for granted. I'll always regret that. Even if I wasn't super close with any of the people in that group but her, I had people to spend time with, to enjoy the company of... Football games, dressing up on Halloween and going to a haunted house, different dances and events... Even if something wasn't the most fun thing to do in the world, at least I was out, interacting with people.

I'm grateful that at least I felt loved and appreciated as a person at one point in my life. I'm so thankful I had several years with a best friend who cared about me unconditionally - some people never meet a person that clicks with them that well. 

But things are different now.

Outside of my immediate family (who I have pretty cold interactions with), I don't imagine anyone really noticing if I just disappeared off the face of the earth for a while. I try my hardest to look approachable and be kind to strangers, starting conversations and hoping that maybe somebody will extend any type of interest in being friends or even just something simple, like going to the library to study together.

I am so desperately sad and in need of friends. I drove straight home and got in bed tonight. Seeing everyone out doing things and having the best time of their lives, then remembering where I am in life is just too heartbreaking to bear at this point. It seems nearly impossible for me to make any kind of friends in college, and I don't imagine it will be much easier once I'm out. 

I just wish things were different, I didn't expect to feel so void of excitement about life this early in it. I'm so glad that I have the wonderful memories I do, though. I think I'm happiest when I think about those times.",lonely,College loneliness,2019-11-01 19:45:32

I just got out of nearly a two year relationship (very long for someone like me) but for almost the entirety of it I felt alone, unimportant, and used. I had just transferred to a new college and I remember day in and day out having to beg , yes legitimately beg, her to talk to me. Meanwhile I spent my days commuting, working, and having no friends as all of mine were at my old college. I even remember when we were dating before I joined Reddit I would just scroll through the depression and lonely pages just to find people to relate to. My problem is is that I'm not sure if there is a real difference with the loneliness I feel now verses then. Not to mention after this whole relationship I am absolutely certain that there is no chance for anyone to ever have a genuine interest in me or for me to ever be able to form a genuine emotional connection with someone.

Im beginning to get used to the idea that I will be alone forever and that I am just not compatible with other people. I'm not certain I like it but I just don't think I can fake interactions with people anymore and the effort to make friends or be friendly with people just seems pointless.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

So the topic will be my loneliness (duh) and how I don't know what to do with it anymore. I will tell a short story of my life, just because I can't keep it in any longer, and Reddit is the last place I have. So here goes nothing.  
I was a bad friend. A very bad friend. I didn't listen to those who were around me, always put certain people above those who needed me the most. One of my friends once left for 3 months to another country and I didn't write to her once. For years I had this group of friends I was happy with. But then it all changed. One of them (the one I knew for the longest time) left to go to collage about 300 km from the rest of us (he is 2 years older). Only then I realized how different we were, and only one topic kept us tied. Then his brother (3 years younger then me) also left, though here I understand- the difference in mindsets was too big for our relationship to work out. I lost one of my friends to drugs (no, he didn't die, he just started using them and it was so far from the guys me and the rest were, we just couldn't keep in touch) and for this I blame my self even after 6 years. He called me after one of his ""adventures"" and I promised to help, but nothing came out of it. Then the one I was closest with, someone I considered a true brother, with whom I had so much in common, decided to cease speaking to me (we were in the same school, so our contact did not completely cease to exist). And for over a year I did not know why. Only after I learned how bad of a friend I was to him I understood his decision. And that is when my depression really started.   
Now we come to the last person to be truly close to me, the friend that I mentioned earlier, the one who left for months and I did not contact her. At the prom she kissed me and we started dating. It was a strange situation for me, because the prom happened about 4 months before the exams, and I was terrified of the possibility that one of us could end up on the other side of the country. But I thought ""I don't care, I want to live know, not in the future"". But my worst nightmare came after the results and she had to move over 600 km to study. And when the holidays ended it also was a horrific experience. She needed me, she always was a people's person, she always had a lot of energy and there she had no one. No friends, no me, no parents, not even her cats. And the thing she was studying was rough (medicine). But I was so focused on my own studies that I did not see how much she needed me (I'm studying law). But she ended her adventure there after the first semester and came back home. She was to study to retake her finals and study in our home city. She failed. I did not blame her. So she decided to study about 60 km from me. A huge improvement, right?   
In the meantime I also changed my studies to languages. New people, new potential friends. At this point I had suicidal thoughts, I still do, and my depression became the only stable thing in my life.   
So we both started from scratch. And she met a guy. (From this point on I'm heartbroken, so buckle up). You know the story- ""He's just a friend."" Yeah, well, after two weeks he walked her to her apartment, she invited him in, they watched movies and danced until 5 am. After that they went to sleep (separately as I was told) and in the morning she cooked him breakfast and he took a shower. He was so grateful, he thanked her and told her how ""no one ever did that for him, no girl. He did have girls for the night, but none of them stayed for breakfest"". And she believed him.   
I realize how not about being lonely this is getting so tl:dr- she broke up with me to be with him when I decide to leave my studies to have more time for us and my life in general. She is still with him. And she can't understand why we can't be friends anymore. As the quote says ""First they rip your guts out, and then they want to be friends."" (- Starship Troopers)  
Whe loneliness? I have no one. Not a single soul to call, or text, or come over to. Everything I feel, joy, anger, sadness, every-bloody-thing I keep to myself. I did something good- great, I can tap myself on the shoulder. I did something wrong- I can tell that to myself. I miss hugs, and kisses, and someone hand on my head whispering that everything is going to be okay? I can to that myself. I made so many damned mistakes, I don't know how to cope with them. I did talk to the professionals. I did talk to my parents. I did try to stay friends with her. But I feel so frustrated when I see people around me, who were close to me, who cared about me, now not giving a shit because I did something, or didn't do, or said or didn't say something in the past happy with a pack of people when I can't even look into the mirror because I'm ashamed.   
I don't know how to cope with being lonely. Though, to be honest, I don't even know what I want from this post. I really need to find someone to talk to.

Well they're busy with Halloween and stuff and I haven't gotten any messages from anyone for like the past 2 days. It sucks when you're in you're bed all day. I'm losing interest in everything. I'm so bored with my life. I never feel excited about anything. I mean nothing much really happens. I wake up eat and walk around do some work and go to bed. Also I've been single my whole life and i get rejected every time I ask someone out. 

Ah thank you for listening",lonely,I just feel so alone and bored with my life,2019-11-01 04:01:17
