3,only-he-stands-here,1567257786,1,"I'm 37, male, have nobody I can really call a friend and feel extremely lonely.

1 year ago I moved from Canada to Europe, to live in the very large and lively city of Berlin. Since I've been here, I have realized I never really learned the social skills to make friends.

Even back home in Canada, I really only have 1 person I could actually say is my friend. 

I have people I could ask to do things, but I never write or ask them to do something because I always feel like I would be bothering them by asking, or that they will think it's strange that I'm asking them to do something because we're not friends and honestly, I don't know why someone would even want to be my friend. I have the feeling constantly that people don't actually like me, and are only nice to me at work or in other social situations because the have to be.

I had a girlfriend for several years, but was never actually attracted to her or wanted to be in a relationship with her. I just didn't want to be alone. Everytime I've actually had genuine feelings for a woman, they have never been returned. This has left me thinking that there must be something broken in me because I always end up falling in love with women who don't love me back.

As a very young child my mother left me and moved several hundred Kilometers away. It just happened suddenly. One day I woke up and she was gone and I didn't see her again for several years afterwards.

In the meantime my father remarried. His wife turned out to be a horrible human being. She was very physically and emotionally abusive to my sister and I. Things like getting thrown down a flight of stairs when you are 7 years old and being screamed at because you forgot to close the car door leave a mark.... nuff said. That marriage lasted until I was old enough to fight back. One day I broke her nose and gave her 2 black eyes. Yes... I beat up my stepmother. My dad was always at work and really just didn't pay attention to the situation. He just drank beer until he fell asleep. He has suffered from extreme depression his entire life.

In school I was bullied constantly and never had any friends. I was always angry and withdrawn, which was understandable considering what was going on at home. Because of this I never really learned how to socialize well. I eventually quit highschool because being there was so painful.

As a teenager and into my early 20s I did copious amounts of Drugs. By 14 I was doing 8 balls of cocaine and selling weed to finance my habits. By 18 it had evolved into doing Crystal Meth.

Somehow, at about 22 I pulled my head out of my ass, went back to school, and became an electrical engineer. At 22 years old I started at a grade 8 education level.


Career wise I've managed to be fairly successful, although no matter how many projects I successful complete, I always feel everything I do is shit, and could have been done better. I never feel like I've done a good job, although my coworkers always comment about the high quality of my work.

Being here in a foreign country has made really think about who I am, and what it is I actually like. I'm trying to make friends by doing activities with various groups on a regular basis. (Playing frisbee, learning German, photography) but I always leave after the events are over as I always think people don't actually want me there.

I would also really like to start another relationship, and one day have a family, but how can that ever happen for me when I always feel I have nothing to offer.

Any advice is welcome. It was helpful just to write all this junk anyway.",lonely,Never learned to make friends,2019-08-31 23:23:06

6,hamartiated,1567249254,7,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat),2019-08-31 21:00:54

9,2020sare,1567242397,5,"Hi,

I have no friends and in the past three years I haven't gone on summer vacation even though I can afford it. I went twice alone and I hated it even though the beaches etc were beautiful. I just wish I had someone to play ball with in the water. I don't ask for too much. I grew up in a rural village with almost no one my age, I used to have friends but they had to commute to me for an hour or I had to commute to them so all friendships died off eventually. I'm moving out of that rural village next month but I'm not too excited. I will be 25 next year. I want kids one day because I have so much love to give and I want them to have the freedoms I didn't have - I'm gay, which I would have **never chosen to be**. Nobody would choose that. I don't like the gay scene, all the hyper focus on sex, I don't like any of these apps etc. and hooking up tires me to death. I don't pitch my voice up for no reason or emphasise words wrongly. Also I have never really felt romantically for a guy, I always ""felt"" guys as friends, colleagues. I don't know if I'm able to be romantic with a guy, to me it feels rather ridiculous because I see guys as friends and not romantic partners. 

Back to my future kid. It will not have to fight their parents for years to eventually get to the job they want to do. It will not be  forced to apply for dozens of jobs they would absolutely hate with no regard to what they want to do. But still, I don't know how to have a kid. I might have to save $100k for a surrogate and I don't know if I will have that much by age 30. Also, it will be hard for me as a single full-time working man to be accepted to have a baby. As of now, the more realistic future for me is that in my 40s, 50s and beyond I will still be childless and single - and miserable. I try to avoid that though. I try to save for the baby. I could raise a kid with a woman but I don't know if she will enjoy a sexless relationship. I don't know any guys who are too interested in raising a kid with me. The guys I know just continue looking for hookups in their 40s, 50s.. and stay forever childless. Even the couples stay childless. There is no long-term happiness for me in that lifestyle. There is no pressure on me to have kids, I just can't imagine never having one. I don't see a future without having a kid, and I don't want to adopt.

Anyways, yesterday I found out a band I really like (Tool) released their new studio album - the first after 13 years of break. I feel alive for the first time in ages. I don't remember when was the last time I actually felt anything at all. Occasionally I have tears of joy in my eyes as I'm listening to it right now because I didn't realise how much I missed them. I can't really describe it. Ever since I listened to their first album I became hooked and just loved them. I don't know. They just somehow gave me hope and I feel much better now. I feel *less alone*. My saviours from the past are back.",lonely,"no friends, gay, want kids - Tool (band) just made me feel alive",2019-08-31 19:06:37

Because we were in the same friend group I couldn't hang out with them either. They didn't hang out that much anyway and I lived through my worst year all alone.

11,wt_anonymous,1567240732,15,"I came out the womb being naturally quiet and too myself. In pre school I always liked playing by myself with these dinosaur toys they had. I never had a sibling of any sort so I never really had anyone to hang out with and I naturally learned how to entertain myself with toys. As the years went on and I went into elementary school there was much more pressure to play with other kids but I was still wanting to be on my own. I made a few friends here and there but most of the time I was on my own. Since I was on my own a lot too I began to lack social development. I struggled to make friends since I wasn‚Äôt used to it, and I wasn‚Äôt really into trends since I often didn‚Äôt like trends or even know what trends were. I didn‚Äôt have Pok√©mon cards until I was 13. I kind of struggled with a lacking social status. I didn‚Äôt really know how to treat other kids and I kind of became a tattle tale just from natural progression (I feel bad about it now). I was like this until middle school where things got bad. Since I didn‚Äôt really pick up on social queues, people sometimes took advantage of me and would kind of treat me like an animal since I was predictable. It‚Äôs kind of hard to describe. For an example, I didn‚Äôt want a kid to say something so he said ‚Äútell you what if you throw this away for me I won‚Äôt say anything‚Äù and I threw it away thinking he was serious, and they laughed at me. There was just lots of stuff like that but eventually I picked up on it which kind of destroyed me. I felt like I had been bullied for years and I didn‚Äôt know who to trust anymore. I decided at that point to consciously double down on being quiet so at least no one could do that anymore. This was an even worse mistake though because I grew somewhat... I don‚Äôt know a good word for it. I was way too protective of myself and was quick to snap at anyone. Usually they‚Äôd just laugh if I did though. I grew out of that now thankfully and I‚Äôm mostly functioning but the fallout still affects me. I still have the same 2 friends who stuck with me since elementary and no one else. I‚Äôve tried a few times to make friends. In fifth grade I tried befriending someone who turned out to be a manipulative bully. Another guy ended up just being selfish and didn‚Äôt care about actually being friends. In eighth grade I tried joining this friend group who ended up doxxing my steam profile to students and doxxed my real name to a small game server I played on. At that point i had lost all hope and trust and made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm not going to make any more friends in K-12, not as long as this fallout of a past I couldn‚Äôt really predict haunts me. I‚Äôm 16 now and although I carry myself well whenever people *do* talk to me, it‚Äôs such a rare occurrence that it might as well not matter. I‚Äôm ignored 9/10 of the time. Exceptions apply during group projects or when someone *particularly* extroverted who knows nothing about me is forced to sit next to me.

Sometimes I wonder too if my living situations affected this at all. My parents were divorced from a very young age, first off. And for most of my life I haven‚Äôt lived in very nice homes. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, my parents are okay-pretty standard, but the other people I‚Äôve lived with were crazy. I had a step mom for about 5 years that wasn‚Äôt great. She had her moments but the way she was just did not work with the way my dad was and it resulted in a lot of tension. I also lived with my uncle for 5 years with my mom until this year. He was fucking horrible. He was an alcoholic, has a mood disorder, was a hoarder, and all around a fucking nuisance. I shut myself in my room everyday for 5 years. We called the cops on him once because we thought he was going nuts from alcohol but he wasn‚Äôt even drunk. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm out now though. But I do wonder if living with those people affected the way I communicated with my peers. 

As of now I am still lonely. I actually decided recently to enroll in a program that‚Äôs like dual enrollment but I get off school earlier in the day, and that reason alone was a big incentive for me. I don‚Äôt like high school. Nobody likes me, the teachers barely. I figured if I‚Äôm going to get an education I‚Äôm doing it in a place where I feel accepted. Plus I can get lunch wherever and it‚Äôs free too.... Even so, it‚Äôs still a lonely existence.",lonely,I‚Äôve been pretty lonely my entire life,2019-08-31 18:38:52
12,Jimmy244,1567239656,1,"Why does this ALWAYS freaking happen to me?

Sorry this is long.

A bit about me. Growing up, I never really had any real friends apart from acquaintances in school which we would talk mostly about school stuff because I was always afraid of my interests and personality being weird to others or afraid of getting picked on which has happened a bit. I am still in college and nothing really changed. Everyone has their groups and cliques it seems and they don't seem welcoming. I always was the shy and quiet kid, usually content with being alone though so it never really bothered me too much until I was about 20 and started feeling more lonely. Longing for friends and relationships. I just turned 23 not too long ago and every now and then feel like this. I've suffered from anxiety and depression for years and only recently started taking something for it which seems to be helping a bit and now I don't think too negative unlike before, but the negative and self-loathing thoughts are still there every now and then.

I've made a few online friends or chatted with girls on online dating sites here and there, but they were pretty much strictly online or strictly business related, except for 1 girl that catfished me when we met on a date, she was a lot different from the pictures and was a bit rude. All have ghosted on me. Last month, I made an online friend on a website after I asked about a product she was selling which we have a mutual interest in, and one thing led to another and we found out we had a lot in common more than that and became friends. We'd talk to each other with long messages every couple days, not everyday as she has a busy life which is fine I get that. She seems like a genuine, caring person who seems to really listen a lot. She has told me that I am such a nice, friendly, interesting, and awesome person, but sometimes I don't believe it. I feel like I have nothing to offer and always in self doubt.

A few weeks ago though, she met another friend the same way as me, and it turned out they actually live very close to each other. He has also came in contact with me too when she told him about me. Though he doesn't talk to me much privately but whatever. We do have a 3 person chat too which is fine, though I never feel comfortable with more than 1 on 1 conversations and always end up feeling like a 3rd wheel. Over the past week though, my friend has been talking to me a bit less, lately it's more her responding to say she was busy, etc. Not much responding to previous messages. I don't need to message first with her which is a great thing even when we do have normal conversation. But my assumption thanks to anxiety and negative thoughts usually occuring at night, is that she probably enjoys talking to him way more than me, plus they actually have met so there's that. The other friend seems like a funny person who makes jokes, one of those types of people who post memes and stuff, seems outgoing with his friends (yet from what she told me he said he doesn't seem to have many friends) On social media for example, she seems lately to gravitate towards responding to &amp; liking his posts where as she used to do that to mine before. She seems to always be online and so does he, sometimes it seems they log off &amp; on around the same time. She does have other in person friends that she had for years though which she told me about. This is also not about romantic stuff which is also perfectly fine as she has a boyfriend which I knew about from the very beginning. It's purely a friendship thing which I am more than happy with as I usually have fun talking to her.

All in all, I deep down feel like she doesn't really like me that much after making a new friend that's probably better than me. Despite telling me how much I mean to her, etc. Even going so far as telling her family and friends all great things about me which nobody really does, and even goes out of her way sometimes for me. She has even told me that she loves me which I found a bit shocking at first. All these negative thoughts about our friendship is thanks to anxiety. Like I feel like she's going the path of my other friends I had. I.e. ghosting me. Probably because I have nothing better to offer than their other friends.

I really want to ask her about this, but I had a previous friend 2 years ago and things ended badly when I asked her about why she wouldn't respond to me. Except with that friend, I always had to message first, and so on.

18,33forever,1567234543,3,"5-6 months ago everything felt pretty hopeless, I worked a mediocre job. Had no plans for my future and was actively planning to kill myself within a few years. 

Fast forward a bit, I woke up one day and slowly but surely I kinda perked up a bit. I didn‚Äôt get happy overnight, I still wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm happy. I just finally fancied the idea of bettering myself 

I started working out, very minimally and have been inconsistent for a while, I‚Äôm trying to get back into athletics and fix myself up. I‚Äôm trying to start over in a sense, while I‚Äôm still young. I‚Äôve cut a lot of people out of my life and I‚Äôve truly believed for the past few months that things really CAN get better if I give it time.

But in moments like these, I guess it just all comes back. How I‚Äôve been for years. I dwell on every little ounce of shame I carry with me.

After the excitement wore off though it hit me like a ton of bricks that I don't have a lot of people to share my excitement with and I feel pretty alone.


It makes sense though I basically have self-sabotaged my own life for the last 5 years and have been left at a stand still not progressing at all. I'm 27, underweight, have a heart condition  and have been avoiding my reality for so long that my social skills degenerated. On the flip-side though I feel like for the first time in a long time I'm in tune with life and it's great to feel like I have my head in the game again but also a little depressing to realize how much time I lost and how far I have to go.


I don't feel like my expectations are too grand. Just want to feel at peace, have a job that won't leave me dirt poor but gives me satisfaction and a girlfriend to hangout with me and my dogs while we listen to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

I've been very lonely for quite a while now. Mostly because of divorce, even though I picked myself off the ground a few years ago. The marriage was troubled from the start and we lived together for two years knowing we'd be divorced, which made it worse for me and the kids. She'd sleep around with guys she met at the bar she worked at, while I was always home with the kids. I have custody of the kids and they keep me on my toes, but certain weekends they're gone. 

I'd like to meet new friends or more but my job gets in the way of potential mates. I have a morality clause and my boss let me know that I could be fired if I started dating, because I'm still considered married. It's very hypocritical.


I don't have the confidence any longer to put myself out there, not that I was great at it to begin with. I have trouble meeting new people and often am alone when my friends are not around. Desiring to do something, but frozen to act. It's not supposed to be this way. 

I'm told that I'm decent looking, funny, and kind, so I guess I have a few good qualities. My first job is Dad, and I love having custody even though it can be exhausting at times. 

A job is something I can change, but it'll take a little more to find time and put myself out there.

50,Yodalling,1567194121,1,"I've come to the realization, a few months ago, that throughout my entire life, the people that I am surrounded by don't care about me at all as a person (except for my wonderful family which I couldn't be more grateful to have) and that there's something different about me that has caused me to further isolate myself. I've always had this sinking feeling in my stomach that says, something is wrong, that ""I don't belong here"" I can remember a moment in primary school, when I was 6 years old and I was silenty sobbing in my seat while the other kids were packing up their things from the lesson, when my teacher asked ""What's wrong?"" I could only respond with ""Everytime I'm happy every one is sad and when I'm sad everyone is happy"". I felt and still feel as if everyone is in their own bubble in life and rarely consider someone else emotions rather than what they can do for you.

This would be something that would plague me throughout all these years to today, 18 M. I've tried many different ways to get out of this zone but to no avail, people don't care about me at all no ""Hi how are you?""  ""What's wrong?"". I don't want to be the first to contact and that last one to receive messages, I don't want to be the one helping those who will not give me the time of day. No matter who I face no matter how ""nice"" and ""cute"" or ""considerate"", it all ends the same. They have left me for dirt. People only care if I have something they don't. I'm always ignored and I honestly cant find any solutions to my issue and it infuriates me on an unhealthy level, where I'm pent up with some much rage and confusion that I'm terrified as what will happen to me. The only reason I have committed suicide is because my family doesn't deserve any pain of that caliber especially since my sister past away.


I don't have anyone else beside my family but even then, they are that helpful in giving advice. My father has depression but he deals with it by smoking and coffee. It hurts to see people in groups happy chatting whatever and here I am the spector only able to eavesdrop.  I have tried interacting people of course but it always feels empty. The depression from my isolation has manifested itself has pains in my chest, I've been to the doctors and have been told that nothing is wrong with my heart or chest. 

The only way I'm coping right now is learning a new language (German), playing piano, reading books and studying alot, as a substitute for my porn addiction as a result of depression. I'm also avoiding people as they've disappointed and hurt me so much that I try and keep my head down and not talk to anyone. It feels satisfying to when they're walking with you and they stop to talk to someone as you keep moving passed trying to get to your destination. Only to have them confused and wondering why am I not waiting for them like a puppy dog so I can entertain when they return from their conversation and resume walking with me. I'm also planning to delete and block most of my school ""friend's"" numbers so I don't have to have my hopes when they respond to my messages.

About a week ago i blocked her on snapchat just because i couldn't stand seeing her. Seeing her made me feel sad and like a fuck up for not asking her out. 

Anyway i thought that blocking her would kind of help me move on but it didn't work at all. I think about her more then ever and i think i made her really sad. So **I might have fucked up.** Now i cant even say hi to her in school without feeling like a complete and uder mongo.

56,throwaway94639251,1567190335,6,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short, even tho it‚Äôs a bit of a doozy. 

I just moved out of my hometown for college a little over a week ago, after being almost entirely alone through high school and middle school (except for a half dozen people moving in and out of my life). I was generally happy, especially with the few friends that I did/do have, but I never got into a relationship. 

To put it more accurately, I‚Äôve never been with anyone because no one has ever seen a potential partner in me. 

I‚Äôm not horribly unattractive, but not conventionally pretty either. I have and have had lots of friends, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my personality. But at this point, I half want someone to just grab me by the shoulders and tell me straight why no one has ever liked me that way. 

All that to say: I‚Äôm now at college, in a situation where I‚Äôve made a fair number of friends, some guys some girls (probably close to 50/50 mix) and over all I‚Äôm having a really good time. 

Then I met X. 

He‚Äôs really funny, and a lot like some of my best friends back home. We click pretty instantly, and have a really similar sense of humor and interests. 

Yeah, I‚Äôm not gonna try to lie to myself about it. I really like him. As a person, and as a potential partner. He‚Äôs just a really solid, good guy. 

So here‚Äôs the kicker: over lunch a few days after X and I started talking, a friend confessed she had a big crush on him. 

My first instinct was to help her talk to him. Get her his Instagram. Invite him with us when we went out for dinner. I‚Äôm not totally sure why I did that, but I did. I guess my fight or flight decided a friendship was worth more than a potential relationship, but now I‚Äôm kind of worried. 

X and I have been hanging out a lot the past few days - mostly coincidentally, being in a lot of the same clubs and such - and it‚Äôs dawning on me that no matter what I do here, I‚Äôm kind of fucked. 

If I try to bottle or get rid of my feelings for him to let my friend in, I could lose the only real shot at a relationship I‚Äôve had in forever. 

If I continue letting my feelings and our friendship grow despite my friend‚Äôs feelings, I could really hurt her and that‚Äôs the last thing I would want. 

And even if I do do that, there‚Äôs still the possibility of him not liking me the same way, and then I‚Äôm left with neither of them. 

I don‚Äôt want to stay lonely forever, but I have no idea what to do. 
Any advice is appreciated.

 I'm slowly losing everything I've worked so hard to achieve. I always find myself coming back to this app to bitch and moan because in real life, I don't have anyone I can do that with. Yea they'll listen to me speak, but they won't actually listen let alone help. I can't tell if I'm being selfish or selfless. I use myself as comedic relief and sometimes let people walk over me, but then I'll just be a complete tool out of nowhere. My friends are doing early college so the people I hung out with on the daily go to a completely different school now and boast about how their school is so much better which is true. I'm stuck in an LDR with someone who very clearly doesn't care about me but I'm trying to convince myself they do. Like I know she isn't the perfect person and has a multitude of her own problems, but she just forgets I exist and gives no fucks about my own feelings. I haven't seen her in fucking months, I thought she liked me and I liked her and we'd be good together but fucking no. Everytime people ask how she's doing I have to lie because to be honest, I have no fucking idea.

You know I WANT to break up with her, but I don't have the balls to. I always second guess myself when I say I'm going to, ""you've waited so long, give her one more chance"" when that one more chances leads to 10 more chances.. I don't have anyone to talk to, I can't confide in my parents because they won't understand or listen long enough to, My friends would tell me to suck it up, I have mainly confided in myself for the past 15 years because when I boil it down, I'm the only person I can trust.

72,Throwaway108830636,1567175062,57,"Hi all,

So basically I always thought I was straight and still kinda do but am very confused (atm define myself as bicurious). Anyway about 4 months ago I met this gay guy on reddit, wasnt intentional or anything like that. I was just struggling with my sexuality and he sent me a message. I just assumed he would be like everyone else and ghost me after a while but then we started talking deeper and deeper about things. As usual I got attached and actually started developing feelings for him, I'm not sure if these were true genuine feelings looking back and probably more were that I felt like someone actually cared about me for once. 

Then I just started thinking about him a lot, I wanted to text him all the time and just be around him. BUT the issue was we were in different countries, me in UK and him Norway. I did not care however in his eyes it did matter. 

Now this is where it all went wrong, he was giving me hints and signs such as saying I would totally date you and I would kiss you that I got super happy, ok he was a guy and I never experienced that before but the truth is not any person in my life has said that to me. So for someone to tell me this after feeling so damn lonely for so long was just like wow I can't believe it. However alongside this he played games, tried making me jealous of saying how he can get any guy he wants irl, was kinda proud that he cheated on his own bf with a girl at a club and even his actual bf was underage üôÉ. 

But still after all this because I thought someone actually gave a fuck about me I just pursued him and got rejected over and over again. He sent me on break after break to say I need to clear my head and it's all my fault, on one of my lowest nights ever when everything was getting to much for me I reached out and told him everything I was worrying about and said this is your issue so you deal with it. 

I was absolutely heartbroken, a complete mess. I have told him multiple times since I can't contact you no more and need to end this, but everytime he suddenly opens himself completely up and says sorry and all of this, however a few weeks later it's all back to normal, everything my fault and my feelings are not worth the time. 

Ik full well he doesnt give a damn about me. I managed to break away about 3 weeks ago now and was doing ok however stupidly I looked at his reddit profile and hes just been showing off about how many guys like him on tinder, hes above everyone and it just made me feel so shit in thinking what havent I got. Yes we may have not worked out cos long distance, like I know this full well but did he really have to string me along, blame everything on me and make me feel totally worthless. 

I'm sorry if I dont make sense, it just hurts so much to be treated like I am nobody, here I am still wanting to care for him and think about him whereas off he goes not even a single thought about how I am and just yh it sucks that I'm so damn lonely and all I ever do is gravitate back to the same type of people all the time. 

I'm sorry it's so long, is there anything I can do to get over this once and for all? How do I stop attaching myself to bad people like this?

Now my uncle D was in a wheel chair for reasons i don't remember and at the time he was taking care of me and also slowly dying he knew my father was in no way shape or form  able to take care of me and unlike his other kids i had no mother to take care of me so my uncle D decided to find me a home luckily for me his sister or as i call her mom knew my story came to see me like everyday and help my uncle D take care of me and just absolutely loved me so much that her and husband adopted me into their family despite having 3 kids of their own and raised me no different now my mother got out of jail and wanted me back after a court battle my new family was able to keep me. They allowed my mother and father to be in my life still because they thought i deserved that much i guess so growing up i knew my father and mother. My father was in and out of my life same as my mother for a while and life was prettt smooth my uncle D died and my mom took it hard but i don't really remember that around age 5 or 6 my mom and and dad seperated now 2 of there children where young adults and out of the house but me and their youngest who i will refer to as BM had to love through it with front row seats during this time my dad left and started livong out of town and my father was a deadbeat who didn't do much for me at all except let me know and meet his side of the family my half brother and sister, my aunts and uncles and cousins and to be honest i never really fit in with them mostly because they enjoyed bieng stereotypes and i was never really liked that. So with no one else to take over BM took over as my dad basically finished off where our dad left off he tought me how to ride a bike,make friends,play basketball,how to be fubny and over all was a great roll model after during this tome our dad was still in our lifes but had to fix himself before he could a dad my mom the other moved and took me with her to house after house for about 5 years and then tried and failed to get back together with my dad during this time it became pretty obvious that was really intelligent not reallt Einstein level but smarter than the average smart kid and i quickly started devolving intrest opposite of the rest of my familybwhere they all chose just to live life like we where raised and really only care about yourself and family in that order i decided that i wanted to fix the world and help people and that i didn't really matter  which caused and still continues to cause conflicts between me and my family because they don't understand how they're idea if thinking that you are only here on earth to take care of yourself and family and if you try to take on the world's problems by yourself you will lose yourself is the problem because if i everyone tried to take care of the world's problems we would be fine but digress. These conflicts have made me cinical towards my family and  to society because this is how i generalize how people think.
So now im just a doing nothing im to angry at the world to help it but i feel to guilty about it and punish my self in dumbways like i have a weight problem and anytime i make any progress on losing weight i eat like there's no tomorrow gaing more than i lost. I hang around people who use me and work a job i hate more than any thing in this world just to punish my self for bieng angry at something i know is so stupid and unfair but i cant help it. Finally my new way of punishing my self is to form great bonds with people i care about and sabatoge them not consciously but it always seems to happen and i think its because i can't stop telling lies about dumbshit because im embarrassed like i make up storys about parties girls i slept with and a strong family bond to cover the fact up that im a virin shut in who couldn't bed a girl if his life depended on it who barely talks to his non immediate family.

It took me like 3 hours to type all of this and i don't feel any better but ima post it any way maybe some one can help with my obsession with subconsciously punishing my self or maybe im delusional and its a conscious choice idk any advice could help also i know my writing kinda jumps around alot with little structer towards the end sorry",lonely,Basically telling talking about life looking for some closure.

93,maxipadsforeveryone,1567143421,0,"I have selective mutism so I don‚Äôt talk to people. It‚Äôs not a choice it‚Äôs just a thing my anxiety has caused. If someone talks directly to me i‚Äôll usually nod my head or give a 1-3 word response but nothing much.

Last year I stopped going to school halfway through the year due to panic attacks. I ended up doing this program for the rest of the year where I went to this room and worked on Apex Learning for 3 hours. It wasn‚Äôt a very good program, didn‚Äôt teach me much.

I‚Äôve been back in school for about 2 weeks and i‚Äôm already considering suicide. Hell, I have a manipulated schedule where I only go 4 bells a day and I still can‚Äôt handle that.

I‚Äôm taking 4 classes this year. English ll, Geometry, Psychology, and Biology. I‚Äôm usually a math hater but so far I understand what‚Äôs going on so i‚Äôm good with that. What I absolutely hateee it‚Äôs Biology. There is so much group work. I never end up talking in the group and it‚Äôs so much harder for me to learn working in a group.

This is the worst part: I‚Äôve been lashing out at my dad. It‚Äôs not his fault i‚Äôm just a bitch and feel terrible about it. He got me on a modified schedule for my benefit and I still don‚Äôt appreciate it. He tries so hard to help me but I pay him back with yelling at him and ignoring him. He‚Äôs all i‚Äôve got and I treat him like shit. Its like can‚Äôt control myself.

My dad doesn‚Äôt want me to do homeschool because he thinks it will just make me every less social (which is probably right but it‚Äôs not like I talk to anyone at school anyways. haven‚Äôt had a friend in years.) As much as I want homeschool I know it‚Äôs not gonna solve anything. I‚Äôll still be depressed, anxious, and suicidal.

The main reason i‚Äôve been suicidal lately is because I see my life going nowhere and i‚Äôm just a burden to my father. He talks about how ‚Äúhe does so much for me and I pay him back by being rude‚Äù which is right. I‚Äôll never enjoy living no matter how hard anyone tries to help. I have no aspirations. No talents. The only people I really look up to are actors and singers cause all my ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù are recreational stuff like that. In fact a lot of the best actors and famous people die young (but they tend to be at least in their 20s, i‚Äôm 15 and don‚Äôt know if I can make it till then.)

I‚Äôve tried manyyyy therapists and meds but none have been successful. I would tell my dad all this stuff that i‚Äôve been writing but I don‚Äôt want to further stress him out.  Also when I do tell him how I feel he goes and says one of his few repeating phrases ( you need to work out, life isn‚Äôt supposed to be fun, i‚Äôve tried everything i can do, just deal with it, go live with your mom.) I know he‚Äôs just trying to help but i‚Äôm tired of hearing the same stuff.

I‚Äôve been thinking about how I would kill myself if it actually ever comes to that. I was thinking about an overdose, a lot of celebrities die from that. I don‚Äôt want something messy like Hannah Baker (speaking of Hannah Baker, i‚Äôve only watched the 1st season of 13rw and it fucked me up for weeks.) Being murdered also sounds cool, puts less blame on me and is easier for my dad to deal with.

This is really long but i‚Äôm a complainer and have no one else to talk to. People on twitter have just completely stopped interacting with my tweets cause of how annoying I am. I‚Äôve been on there for 5 years and haven‚Äôt made a single friend.

You don‚Äôt need to message me being like ‚Äúhey wanna talk?‚Äù cause if i‚Äôm being honestly that never helps me. It‚Äôs always just small talk that I can never get past. Man this is one of the longest things i‚Äôve ever written if you‚Äôve read this far thank you.

Everything in me just wants to quit. The thought of doing these things, dragging myself through one more assignment makes me want to cry. I end each day wishing I wouldn't wake up. 

But it's not like I always want to quit. Some days are good and I have fun. It's the inconsistency that kills me, the ups and intolerable downs exhaust me. 

I used to see a therapist for depression and anxiety and took medicine but I've abandoned both because I never really noticed a difference and because I needed more time to do my schoolwork. I also felt like they never really understood what I was going through and they saw me as just another patient. 

I used to self harm a lot but I've been clean for several months now. But I'm thinking I might go back to it just to make days easier, I can't think of anything else to help. I feel like there's no escape, like each day I'm fighting for something I don't even want. 

But I'm also a huge pussy. My professor made a joking remark the other day about me going back to elementary because I was having some trouble with basic math and I almost cried in class.

98,Forgottensun1969,1567138382,1,"For years I thought I had depression and  anxiety, but I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just really really lonely, which basically feels the same. It‚Äôs a constant ache and longing in my chest. I figured it out, because of the few times I‚Äôve had quality interaction in the last several years, all the symptoms go away like that. Trouble is, I‚Äôm an introvert, weird and hard to figure out and always have been, so I can‚Äôt connect with hardly anyone so going down the pub or to a meeting or talking to colleagues or even family does nothing to alleviate it. It‚Äôs actually exhausting. I hate being fake and since 80% of the population is fake, it‚Äôs limits how much I want to have to do with people. I have a kind of bf/fwb that I‚Äôve known for years but he makes me feel even more lonely and unlovable but I often have no where else to go as I don‚Äôt always get on with my family. 

I have met people who I‚Äôve connected and made me feel great instead of sad and misunderstood but they are gone now. This fucking sucks. I know you guys understand the pain and how loneliness fucks you up, because I tell you, hardly anyone does. I see people with so many people who love and respect them all gathered round them in a loving embrace, but we have nothing but longing. I can‚Äôt even sleep properly anymore I‚Äôm so desperate to just talk to someone. Not even talk, just be held and understood and accepted. I can‚Äôt focus. People say that you need to know you don‚Äôt need others. Bullshit. Humans are social animals. You leave a dog or a horse alone, it‚Äôs going to get pretty depressed too. It natural to respond this way to loneliness, we are not weak, just human. 

On top of all this, I live in one of the most boring, isolated places on the planet so no I can‚Äôt just ‚Äòget out and meet people‚Äô.

105,hamartiated,1567131235,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I'm conscious of my overthinking, but it's like I can't convince myself to knock it off. I just want to take care of somebody who deserves it so badly, it transcends the desire for physical affection. The confident person in me is saying ""why didn't you just introduce yourself to that guy you thought was cute, don't complain if you aren't doing anything to help it"", but I can't push out the fear that I'm undesirable, and would just embarrass myself. I don't talk like this in my daily life, but I know this much self doubt can't possibly be attractive.

Maybe I just need to be patient and wait for somebody to approach me, but then there's the question, ""what if nobody comes?"". What if somebody does come, and we don't connect? When will I get my next chance after that? I can't beat myself at this game, I never come up with a good enough answer. So maybe I should just take this shit into my own hands already.

I have friends and family but I honestly feel like none of them really get me. No SO. Even when it comes to my best friend I don't feel like I can actually talk to him about real shit. We never really talk about how we feel about certain things and if we do the conversation is usually pretty short and equates to something like ""Ah, that sucks man I'm sorry about that"" and nothing else. It might sound messed up but I wish I could just disappear and start somewhere new where no one knows me. It would be lonelier but I think it would be better than constantly having this feeling that I'm at the bottom of everyone's list. I think about ending many of my friendships because of this and other reasons but if I feel like I did, then I would be the asshole for ""forgetting our history"" or something like that.

170,T-Guy-T,1567053283,3,"3 weeks ago I met a girl. I used to be on a dating site but had not used it for a few months, then I got an email someone messaged me, it was her. We started talking and found out we were so similar. Everything went fine, she added me on all the socials and we called later that day. A few days later we decided we should meet up in real life. It wasn't too far for me, just 1 hour by train. We had an amazing day and we concluded we were in love. Since then until two days ago we were in a relationship, probably not how it should be, but it felt so good to just have found someone that actually liked me for who I was. She had her problems, I was there for her. And she was there for me. We met up again two days ago at my home, everything went fine, I gave her a necklace, we played some music together, cuddled and kissed. And this part I don't understand, all of the sudden she stopped, she stood up and told me something didn't feel right. She texted her parents to come get her a few moments later. She told me it didn't feel right and she didn't feel what she thought she was supposed to feel. Then she left. I have never been so devestated. She removed me on all the socials, removed our relation status on Facebook which she wanted in the first place. Now I just feel lonely and stupid. I miss ""the good morning, how did you sleep?"" and the ""I love you""s. I miss seeing her smile, hearing her voice, just seeing her face made my day perfect. And now she just left me, although I would have done anything for her. I was prepared to change my life for her, just to make her happy, that is all I wanted, because seeing her happy was all I needed to keep going. I just feel so empty. This was the first time I was allowed to love someone and it happened all so fast and was over so soon. I just hope she is happy.

I can't rely on them to keep me company all of the time, they are loved up and have a busy schedule. We see each other socially once a fortnight maybe. The rest of the time it's just me, myself, and I.



I spend a lot of time playing a word game on mobile that has a chat function. In my experience it's very rarely used apart from the occasional 'Great word!' etc. That is until B came along in May.



We played several games consistently. B was on a winning streak and when I finally won a game I sent a message to say it was about time. From then on, we messaged almost every day. We were in different time zones so it was usually morning for me and evening for B. Chats would sometimes last for hours in between playing the game and I would always look forward to the next time.



B was becoming my substitute for a lack of any meaningful relationship in my life and I began to rely on them a little too much. I would feel genuinely upset if they were busy and couldn't make it to play, like something was missing. Over around two months there were only a handful of days that we didn't chat. Now, we don't chat/play at all. It's my fault, I got carried away with my emotions. B no longer wants to talk to me and I feel like something has been ripped from my soul.



It's been around two weeks with nothing, it's such an intense loneliness. For a while I felt happy and needed.

182,hamartiated,1567043585,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I () joined a new boarding school in India in Grade 11. It has been three weeks since school started and I feel terrible pangs of loneliness. Everyone here hangs out with their old groups and is generally not welcoming towards me.

196,platghost,1567031856,2,"I guess this is a rant... I'm not sure. Sorry in advance if this went into the wrong place. It might also be a bit messy... 

Sidenote before I behin: my childhood was very traumatic to me so this has also shaped me in some ways. Keep this in mind... 

I have been a terrible friend throughout my life. I'm too possessive, I snap at you for irritating me even the slightest, I have the urge to boss over you and ill threaten or blackmail you if needed. I'm in my early 20s and while I was laying in my bed, I remembered my best friend I lost about 4 years ago - but thinking back about it maybe we weren't. We first became friends in kindergarten, and even back then I had trouble making friends. He was the one who decided to be my friend even though he was quite popular. Anyhow time went forward and eventually we'd grow up and we sort of developed a bad reputation (not getting into what it was) and people began bullying us.

Here's the fucked up part. I started picking on him for nothing at all, like his stutters, how he ate, if we were arguing I'd call him stupid words and be a general dick to him. At this point he couldn't make new friends, neither one of us could. He was forced to stick with me, and for that I'm truly sorry. I'm sorry for the pain and embarrassment I've caused you.

Then we slit up. A short time after getting into uni, he found a new group of friends and even though I attempted to keep him to myself, he was quick to reject me and being the rude idiot I am, I told him we were never meant to be life long friends anyway - even though it hurt saying this, because I had no one else. I'd see him grow into the wonderful person he was meant to be and he was actually really chill with his new group, I'm happy for him. 

This lead me down on a path of depression and I eventually developed multiple anxiety disorders throughout the time we got bullied and also the time I spent being lonely. I couldn't stand being in the same school with him seeing his new friends anymore so I dropped out and recently got back to studying. Recently I've been reflecting on my life choices and after reading so many stories of toxic friends... I'm sure to say that I was one. No one likes me.

Even though I'm more aware of my personality now and I'm trying to improve (I've got a very impulsive and destructive anger issue so it's not that easy, but I'm trying), I'm laying here in my bed with severe anxiety and I just want to cry and wish I could redo my childhood or my entire life. I'm so messed up in my head that no one wants to deal with me, and I'm insecure in every way.

My life feels like a failure. Even though I'm back to studying, I don't know what to aim for, nothing either interests me or I don't believe in myself enough to achieve my dreams. I even suck at my hobbies that I love doing. I'm so lonely and have been for years, no one to vent to, and even though I've attempted to bond with people online I can't seem to keep them around me for very long - or they just can't relate to me and end up labeling me as needy and annoying. Of course no one likes an asshole... 

Up to this point in my life I've done so nasty things. Nothing illegal, just extremely morally wrong in every way, and I'm sure to take that with me to the grave...

You see victims of people like me come forward and I'm ashamed for what I was and what I have done, I don't even deserve the right to post this honestly. But I've caused this upon myself and now I gotta sit in my own shit, as they say. I'm just so damn lonely with no one to relate to and I want to cry for this to be over, but I don't deserve anything from anyone, and I'm slowly coming to terms with being alone for the rest of my life.. I guess.

Tldr: I'm that one asshole people warned you about and now I'm crying for sympathy and attention while I reflect on my past behaviour.",lonely,I'm that one toxic friend,2019-08-29 08:37:36

What an alien concept. Literally. People say it‚Äôs so prevalent in society and I guess that‚Äôs true, to an extent?

But like‚Ä¶ the whole idea of two normal people doing that with each other‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ how? How does it happen?

Sometimes I think about it but always catch myself and laugh.

*Lmao. Who would want to have sex with* ***\you****\?*
It‚Äôs not like *that‚Äôs* ever going to happen.

Besides, even *if* I were to, I wouldn‚Äôt want it to be a one-time thing like with a prostitute or something. I‚Äôd want it to be with someone who loves me back.

But it‚Äôs not like they would ever want to date me. *sigh. imagine what it must feel like to touch their skin, feel their lips, or just hold them close‚Ä¶*

I‚Äôd even settle for being friends if it meant I could look into those gorgeous eyes.

Hahaha. Though it‚Äôs not like anyone would want to be friends with me. Could you imagine? Going somewhere outside of school with someone? Way too stressful.    
And why would anyone want to talk with me? They‚Äôd probably listen for 5 minutes and then go talk about how that weirdo has stupid interests.

Besides, it‚Äôs not like I have any social skills. I‚Äôm so glad McDonalds installed those new self-serve kiosks. *yikes*, imagine trying to talk with a cashier. I‚Äôd probably say something stupid. They‚Äôd probably talk about how that one customer looked like and couldn‚Äôt say their order properly.

It‚Äôs not like I can do anything to clear my face or become stronger anyway‚Ä¶

Everyone would silently mock me in their heads if I ever went to a gym. Everyone there already is in better shape than I am. It‚Äôs not like I could ever be like that.

Besides, what good is it to look slightly better if I still won‚Äôt go outside anywhere or do anything with anyone because I have no friends to do stuff with. I‚Äôm scared of leaving my house anyway.

It‚Äôs not like I could meet anyone new anywhere. Besides. It‚Äôs weird to go alone anywhere. And that requires money and a way to get there.

Anyway, I try to get close to her and I tell her my feelings, and she says that she doesn‚Äôt date. That alone is annoying enough, even though I can live with her decision, I had put a lot of effort into meeting her and trying to get to know her for the sudden Brick wall to appear.

I‚Äôd like to share my feelings regarding to life in order to get some advice, recommendations.  because those are the things really hard to tell anyone but here. By the way, sorry in advance if you encounter any grammatical mistakes since it‚Äôs not my native language.

I grew up in a small town and lived in a poor conditions and throughout my childhood I had to work in order to save some money to continue my education. I continue the same way during my teenager years. I never had a chance to gather good memories. My parents were always fighting, beating each other. I never felt they love and cared me. I always felt lonely.

In my early twenty, I also had to work but that time I also had a chance to travel a round the world. Now I‚Äôm twenty seven and I found a job in abroad and I‚Äôm living here about a year. But again I feel lonely and I‚Äôm having hard time to find a companion to share life together. I installed one of those apps like tinder, ockupid But it didnt worked out. I saw some people easly  found their partners. Sometimes this loneliness really really gets me and makes me really weak.

All I want is to find a love, to feel how is it feel like to be loved, cared. But I‚Äôm not sure how, where, when I can find it.

Here I wanted to share you to my all story and I thought it might help. I hope you don‚Äôt mind to share your thoughts. Thank you so much.",lonely,"Sometimes, loneliness gets me and makes me week.",2019-08-29 03:45:47

I'm 20 years old don't have friends anymore. Over the past few years I feel like it's gotten harder to make real friends and I think I've pushed the few people I held close further away from me. My friend circle has gotten smaller and smaller for years and I convinced myself that the people still around me care but I now realise they don't. These people are are in my life because it's convenient, my coworkers and I only talk at work and my other ""friends"" only really talk to me if they need something. I've always been introverted and I know that; I blame myself for not taking initiative and being more engaged in other people's lives but I've been foolish and shut myself off because I liked isolation. Now it's so hard to get out of what I've created.

I started university this year and haven't made any connections, it was never this hard at school and I don't know where to start, it's been months and I feel like I don't fit in with anyone anymore.

My life at home hasn't been much better either, I still live with my sister and mother but I barely talk to them. I'm gay but not out and grew up in a religious family, I still deep down blame them for being the reason I hated myself during my teenage years even though I probably shouldn't. I'll be moving out soon and hope that will help but it will probably only make me feel worse.

I'm single and wish I wasn't. I tried Grindr hookups nearly a year ago as a distraction but they do nothing for me as I crave a real emotional connection. I can't have that while I'm closeted and I feel like I'm wasting my youth.

I've kept myself so busy lately that I've forgotten I need people in my life that care about me but I'm intimidated and worried about opening up to people because they will probably end up leaving my life too.

I made up my mind a few seconds ago that I would go to a street food festival thingy this saturday, because I like street food. So I'll enjoy it even if I don't meet anyone.  

Now, this might be a good opportunity to try making friends? Problem is, I'm completely clueless on how to even try making friends, and I have questions.  

1. I'll be going on Saturday evening, maybe around 6pm. Is that a good time to go there to meet people? Should I go later? Earlier? It's open until like 11pm.  

2. I always feel out of place at events like this because I don't drink alcohol and everyone else always has a beer in their hand, should I just buy alcohol free stuff even though it's disgusting just to fit in?  

3. I'm very introverted and get a bit intimidated by very extroverted people, how do I handle this?  

4. How do I even start talking to someone, is it okay to like ask someone ""oh that looks good, which stall did you get that from?"" That's the only thing I can think of, but I don't know where to go from there. Any better ideas?  

5. Is this even a good idea? Since I'm very introverted and quiet I feel like I would mostly meet extroverted talkative people, which isn't my favourite type of person honestly.  

6. What do I do if there are only groups of people there? And almost nobody that went alone? I feel like I don't want to disturb a group of friends having fun.  

7. Is there anything else I need to think of?  

8. If I get along well with someone, when is the right time to ask for their phone number or social media thing or whatever, to keep in touch? And what should I do afterwards to keep in touch?

I was also sorta proud of myself for putting an effort aswell.. like making sure the argument didn't go further by apologizing.. but I'm not gonna get my Hope's high n stuff coz with depression you just never know.. but nevertheless I was happy this week.. but I still feel it lurking.. I feel like a different person.. it dsnt feel like me.. it can get really scary sometimes n you feel like your all alone. Maybe that's why I become needy at times.. your like really scared n you feel alone. I would never ever think il have problems with having sex lol but now days I get scared like il fail at it n my gf would just leave me or cheat on me but I know she's not like that.. but just sometimes her actions n my stupid paranoia gets the best of me n I only just hurt myself about it.

Family? Well, I just feel like lately I'm being told what I should be doing but I'm stuck. I'm trying to go to school for a degree and get a better job. I feel like I'm just a failure at everything, and I should be somewhere else in my life than I am right now.  


Friends are definitely around when they need to cry on your shoulder. My one good friend, actually cares but she has a life and family so it's hard to really want to reach out to her, because she has her own shit but my other friend, she just wants to drunk cry on the phone (she lives back in IL , hometown) and never once just ask if I'm alright. Never. Just as soon as I pick up the phone, she's going on about some bullshit and then hangs up when her 'better' friends hits her up.  


Then the single life...yeah, well I have nearly, if not already accepted the fact that I will be alone for the rest of my life. I attract shitty people, and maybe it's because I lack confidence and self-esteem. I reek of an easy, vulnerable girl apparently. Which I'm not but...I'd love to have romance, but I write about it instead. I hate trying to go out and finding someone because 99 percent of the time, whoever I'm hanging out with (like an outing) guys pay attention to the other girls. I'm holding purses and drinks instead so they can go dance or hang out with guys that approach them...

I realize I‚Äôm not super close with the bride or groom, so I get why I was left out of the wedding party.

246,jaehyun123,1566963976,1,"Throughout school I've always felt left out of any social groups which I was apart of. I never feel accepted at school, I feel like no one understands me or wants to understand me.

Having a mixed ethnicity and living in a place where there aren't much people like you has definitely changed me, but how and why do I always feel so left out. I feel as if no one wants to understand me. I'm not saying that I don't have any friends. Because I have some really great friends which I have decided to surround my self with a lot more recently.

But when I have tried to let someone into my life and becoming vulnerable in the situation I got hurt. Basically what happened was that I liked a guy and at that time we were friends for a good while and I had a feeling that he liked me, then one time he sent me a heart so I sent him one back and he didn't text me for a long time. He then started texting me and then he stopped all sudden. I then find out that he blocked me on Instagram and I had no reason why he blocked me. I asked my friend to ask him and he said that I did something wrong and I have no idea what I did wrong still. Later I told my mum that he blocked me and a few months went by and I found out that my mum went up to the guy that blocked me and she asked him why he blocked me and stuff like that, the thing was that she went up to him while he was working at his families business while it was super busy. I found that out the day before the ball. Ever since then I wasn't able to face him. The guy which blocked me is really popular among our year group, I stopped liking him but the guy that I recently have crush on is mates with him. So I decided to keep my distance from the whole friend group. 

Since then I've left so lost a left out from our year group. I stopped hanging out with my friends which dragged me down and I started hanging out with people which truly care for me. But I feel like I've been left out recently. I tried being there for all my friends but never in return they ask how are you doing, or if I want to hang out with them or if I was okay. Because recently I had been suffering from depression and anxiety which I see my counselor about but, because of these mental illnesses I overthink everything and I can't help it or stop it which recently has been impacting my life a lot.

A week later, I was feeling optimistic and decided to try to chat up with this shy girl in my class I had made friends with, but she apparently wasn't looking for a relationship. I made a joke later which she misinterpreted as flirting, and ""turned me down,"" again, which felt fucking great even though that wasn't my intention, and now there is tension between us. Felt shitty for an hour or two, and although it hurt I was still optimistic. Ok, last week, my friend from camp, who I thought liked me, and who's friend told me she liked me, and I were arranging to hang out. As we kept talking the arrangement seemed more like a date, we were going out to dinner together although that wasn't the original plan. Tonight, she texts me she can't come, because HER BOYFRIEND won't let her. I feel led on, and bad about this, even though she never mentioned him.

253,hamartiated,1566958071,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I started at 6 am and decided to go home at 8 pm so i literally just wandered around new york for 14 fucking hours straight and for like 6 hours (not in a row) i just felt real fucking sad cause i just all of a sudden felt so lonely and felt like i had  nowhere to go. I was in between manhattan and brooklyn the whole day and would commute to each borough like 3 times each but the 3rd time i went to brooklyn was because i just felt like i really just needed a quiet place to just sit and cry by myself so i decided to hop on the train to brooklyn with my tears again for the 3rd time that day and went to brooklyn bridge park and theres these rocks that are on the edge of the water so i went to the far end cause i didn't want to be around people and found little spot where i could just sit and cry but then i started writing some poetry (which i used to do alot) but then a park worker told me i couldn't be that far out on the rocks so i just found another spot on another ledge but boy i felt so fucking lonely because i kid you not there were so many couples, one couple talking wedding photos with the brooklyn bridge, someone else literally proposed with a sign and everything, another couple (seemed to be bf &amp;gf) on a photo shoot, like i couldn't turn my head without seeing something romantic and it just made me feel very overwhelmed because that is something i long for and to just see it repeatedly like that WHEN I WAS ALREADY feeling bad but all the crying and shit did make me feel a little better for a little while but intrusive thoughts just started to come in. Another thing that kinda made me feel better was that i was wearing a spiderman shirt that basically has the spiderman suit on it and i really do have a peter parker type of look cause i have pale skin, i wear glasses and i just look dorky and the fact that im a photographer and was taking pictures even sold it more and the fact that i was in new york helped to95o and lots of people noticed me. I was in the financial district and this truck driver was like ""hey look it's peter parker "" and i gave him a smile and this one cop saw me and was like ""don't start doing my job man"" and we chuckled and then i went to a cheesesteak spot in midtown and when i was leaving, this one guy who was with another a girl (couple? relative? Idk) stopped me and said "" ay yo i was really tryna tell her (pointing to the girl with him) THAT YOU'RE REALLY PETER PARKER and we laughed and he was like ""but yo fr you really do have a peter parker type of look tho"" and then i was walking to a comic book shop at like 8pm before getting on the train to go home and these 2 girls walked past me all with pep in their step and happy and singing and one of them saw me and was like ""yeah go spider man woo hoo!"" and it made me smile cause it's like people noticed me and were glad to see me, and even though they forgot about me and went about their day a second later, it still felt good, because tbh (and i don't say this trying to sound edgy or exaggerated or anything) i really starve for attention, and its for the simple reason that i don't get it alot, so having random new yorkers acknowledge me felt kinda good, not that i didn't wander around feeling like my heart had been removed from my chest, but it helped a little in those moments. I went to midtown too around 12 or 1, reason is because I have an old friend from high school who works in retail, and i happened to remember exactly where that spot is, so i thought i would fo see her, maybe catch her in the middle shift, even if it was just for a minute, just to say hi and bye. Got to the place, looked around for a while but didn't see her, and thought that maybe she was in school or maybe doesn't work here anymore but idk. I was kind of disappointed when i didn't see her, i was feeling lonely (sorry for being repetitive) and was hoping to see a familiar face, even if it was just for a moment. but i guess not. got on the train leaving new york to go home at around 8;30 but i still was still feeling shitty, but i was also tired so it gave me something else to feel besides pain. At the end of the day, I got on the train to leave new york and go home and was hoping to feel better by then, but tbh, i just felt like a bum who had nothing to do but wander and take pictures with nowhere to go. Tbh i kinda felt homeless. i cried on the way home, but felt a little better because at least i knew i had a home to go to at the moment. but yeah, i've been a very lonely person for a long time and recently have been going through something very emotionally painful for me, a certain situation that i've been involved in for more than a couple of years that has resurfaced recently. just found this subreddit, probably gonna try to talk to some people here.

There was a time in my life where I was TERRIBLY LONELY. I lived with my brother but we barely talked to each other. Had friends at work but somehow couldn't make them more than colleagues at work (couldn't hang out with them much, let alone share personal stuff).  


Felt so miserable inside and since I am an introvert, part of me enjoyed being alone but there was also part of me that was breaking apart because of this lack of real support system. It was so bad that I had PANIC ATTACKS.  


I just want to encourage you. Though it's not easy, there are steps you can follow to get you to a better place. 

We can't expect an instant result, we have to bear some inconvenience and give our effort some time until we can see the results. We also have to risk the possibility of having someone hurt or disappoint us.  


It's a long process, but we will get better at it.  


Here are the steps, but this is just a nutshell of the whole process:  


1. Find a community or a group you can join. What worked for me was taking a short course related to my hobbies, like writing or photography. This will help to make conversation a lot easier as we learn similar topic together with other participants. We probably have homework or assignments we can discuss with each other.
2. Detect different types of people. Some people talk a lot, some people don't. Some tend to be dominant. Some like to throw jokes. 'Mark' the ones you feel you can relate to or ask a few things. Who seems to be an expert? (you can ask more about skills). I personally would 'mark' the ones who seem relaxed and approachable. If it's a long term community (for example a church community), I will find a couple of people who seem wise and mature.
3. Expect to get hurt. If that happens, MOVE ON. There was a small group that I joined in the old days. I was so happy at first, they seemed caring and the atmosphere was positive. But I was still emotionally unstable. I was still seeing my therapist at that time, but I was terribly judged by one person, who happened to be the leader. She said harsh things that eventually made me cry uncontrollably. I decided to quit right away, and a friend who invited me to join this group was so upset with me because I didn't tell her that I quit. I was crushed! But at that time I had a supportive online friend who comforted me. It was a long story, but I finally managed to move on and keep pursuing new communities or friendships.

It has been quite a long journey, but believe me, at the end of the day, it will be worth it.",lonely,It IS hard to find true friends but WORTH a try :),2019-08-28 09:39:40

And did about 10-11 years of online schooling until we moved because my grandfather died, it was wayyyy to expensive and we had to move to where we are currently, so where my grandfather died I went to a public school, it was amazing because even though I had grade 10 social anxiety I still managed to have someone talk to me, etc, we became friends (I never talked to anyone until the end of 6th grade tbh) then seventh, and in the middle of seventh we moved, and I'm back in online schooling lonelier than ever and I hate it. I can't go to a public school yet because it's 'dangerous' and I could get shot, but I honestly don't care, death seems better at this point.
I am so fucking tired of being lonely.",lonely,I'm so lonely,2019-08-28 09:30:36
266,nitaoos,1566948116,3,"Hello everyone, I am taking a few minutes of my life to take this off my chest and admit to my very lonely life. 

So I have to say that I do prefer certain people as friends and I don‚Äôt really count the ones who don‚Äôt see me as close, or a go-to person. 
The people I had as friends have always told me how I am ‚Äúimmature‚Äù and ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù because I ask for reassurance from them way too often. 
This is why my friendship of 9 years ended tonight. Because I am fed up from the lack of investment in maintaining the bond. I am tired of being the ‚Äúobsessive‚Äù friend who is delusional and selfish for asking for reassurance when things don‚Äôt seem the way they used to, when we haven‚Äôt had quality time in months even though we live 10 minutes away, when we haven‚Äôt talked  about everything the way we used to. I have always wanted only ONE best friend who I could rely and turn to and the ones I had, have betrayed me or let me down. Someone who I could invite for a movie at my place, who I could invite to travel to another city just for the sake of it. Someone who doesn‚Äôt need to be begged a thousand times in order to just have a coffee downtown. Someone who doesn‚Äôt take 4 hours to reply shallowly to a text which was meant to start a conversation. I am tired of feeling unwanted, unworthy, delusional, obsessed and psychopathic for just pointing out the fact that my own best friend has been distancing themselves from me and try to maybe, fix things and go back to how things were. 
Tonight I was scared, because yes I really am scared of loneliness. I am scared of feeling like I am no one worth befriending, no one worth spending time with because I really try to make it worth while for anyone who hangs out with me. It hurts to see days passing me by as I lay in bed and wonder what could be so wrong with me for having no one in my life ever want to do things with me. I have always been an adventurous energetic person and I can see it going to waste day by day. I am depressed now, I am ruined. I used to be a lively soul, now I feel like everything‚Äôs sucking the life out of me as I take a look at the ticking clock. 

As scared as I am, I think this might be a healthy decision for me because I am maybe a fucked up person who can never have good things in life. Maybe because being with no one around me will never make me wonder why and how a person sees me. Now I‚Äôll just have to worry about my sanity.",lonely,I ended the only friendship I had left,2019-08-28 09:21:56
267,SamuelCiv,1566945922,1,"Hello everyone.
I recently broke up with my partner which basically was the only person I hang out with. I‚Äôve moved about one year and a half ago to the place where I currently live from another country. During this period I barely made any friends. All my friends are in the country I left, I talk to them often, but I would also like to have friends here. As I said I mostly hung out with my partner and sometimes with his friends. Now that we‚Äôre not together anymore I don‚Äôt see myself hanging out with these people. My co-workers are either too old or too young compared to my age (I‚Äôm 28) and, due to my shyness, I am seen as the ‚Äúweird one‚Äù at work, so nobody would really hang with me. I don‚Äôt really have money to start attending sociable places like a gym or a class and I don‚Äôt think that going to pubs/bars alone would help me make any friend. I like playing games like Yu-Gi-Oh! but I would have to travel to get to places where I can play and I really can‚Äôt due to my work schedule. I don‚Äôt want to end up lonely with no one to hang out with. How do you make friends? Even in the country where I used to live before I had trouble making friends, but mostly thanks to school/university I managed to get a few good ones. There were times as a teenager where I really didn‚Äôt have any friends though. I don‚Äôt want this to happen again, but I don‚Äôt really know what to do.

So, to start off, I'm moving onto a new school, I failed in my old school, I got the worst possible grade from maths and had to leave. It's not necessarily a bad thing, a lot of teachers there were aholes (even tho some other ones were genuinely good people as well). The headmaster is a corrupt POS who's planning to ban mobile phones just to make the children a little more miserable. She also gives protection to said ahole teachers and they can do whatever they want.

My new school has a great headmaster, I personally talked to him when I applied, he's very nice and understanding, which is good. But now onto the main problem.

The school is focused on medial graphics and polygraphy, so it's an art school basically. That's a huge problem because I already know it's gonna be full of alt-looking artsy and nerdy girls, and I'm hopelessly attracted to them.

317,Behndic,1566883299,13,"I am an extremely unpopular high school junior, because I moved to a white suburb in 7th grade from my old school in Chinatown which I went to for 9 years, and didn't know how to act, because of the culture shock. I was extremely socially inept, and I admit, I deserved a lot of the harassment, but I went from being surrounded by fellow dorky Chinese kids to normal people. In 8th grade, I learned how to act, and realized what a donut I was, so I changed, and still got shat on, so I tried again 9th grade and acted normally and got teased the same fucking way. I had 1 friend from middle school and 4 close friends from the grade above me. I went to a summer camp, where surprisingly I was pretty popular, and fell for one of my friends and asked her out, and got rejected. It took a year to get over her, and I tried staying friends, but her parents didn't want her associating with me. Idk why, I didn't say anything creepy or do anything, I was making feeble attempts at small talk, which she kept shooting down, only to tell me last week she didn't want to be friends anymore. 10th grade, I was tired of this shit, so I was rude and aggressive back to everyone, and ended up getting falsely accused of being a potential school shooter. Twice. And I got fucking suspended for this, and police interrogated me and searched my fucking house to find nothing. But, there was a pretty girl in my English class, who was smart and sweet, so I started trying to chat her up, which was difficult because she's really shy. I got my ass rejected again, big surprise. Went back to the summer camp, where I have a lot of friends, and fell for another friend. Asked her out. She said yes... and then I see her holding hands with one of my male friends, and later they were stargazing while he said romantic shit to her. That felt great. Afterwards, I didn't show that I noticed anything and was friendly the same way I was before I saw that.

320,bakewellroyal,1566880606,1,"Hi All,

Been getting treatment for major depression for about 5 months now (combo of anti-depressants and therapy). Felt like I finally got to a good place with a therapist I got along with and a dosage/medication that was working for my symptoms.

And now, my world got turned upside down in the last 24 hours and I‚Äôm not feeling that great and am nervous about how this situation can impact my depression negatively.

My boyfriend of a few years just broke up with me pretty suddenly. We had moved in together 1.5 years ago, so now I have to look for a new place ASAP in the NYC market, and buy new furniture. I feel like I don‚Äôt really have any friends or family (nearby) to lean to for support. Also, to make matters worse, my birthday is in less than 2 weeks. My bf and K had planned a weekend getaway and now that obviously won‚Äôt be happening anymore. 

I know plenty of people have survived this situation before, so I‚Äôm wondering what can I do to not feel so down, to move on from this nightmare in the best way possible? I‚Äôm just feeling overwhelmed, and it feels nearly impossible to find the strength to go to work and take care of myself, and not burst into tears every  10min.

334,poppyqueensssy,1566868387,2,"Playlist that mixes Andromeda by Weyes Blood and Satan in the Wait by Daughters - check.

Long duration bus that will take 2 hours to take me home - check.

Some kind of melancholy that's taking over me over the past months/year - check.

(Also, I'm kinda hungry)


Ok, so this is poppyqueensssy's lonely feeling. This is a feeling. We don't compare feelings. We feel it. I feel lonely. Keep it in mind, please.

I am poppy. I just turned 21 one week ago (woohoo!). I'm in the last semester of college. I have a girlfriend. My friends vanish like all the time.

I never really had friends outside school. My parents were/are over-controlling to the point I grew up all alone in my grandma's house (zero childs besides me).

My relationship with my parents was always... cold. I kept myself in my room. They mind their business. They got a new child that isn't atheist, and that's cool. We are in separate worlds, and that's it.

 I always lived distant from everything and everyone. My friends lived near downtown, and me in the ""countryside"", but we used to make efforts to see each other. We studied togheter from middle to high school.

Finishing high school, we stopped seeing each other as frequently as before. I choose to attend to a college in the next city. I spent a year following the routine: wake up 10 am-1pm, play some games (OW, TBoI, Ori...) 'till 4pm, take a shower, go to college, arrive there 6pm, go back home 11pm, arrive home 0h30am, surf the net 'till 4 am.

I was lonely as fuck. I lied about having a girlfriend. I lied about going out with my friends. I lied a lot. I didn't live, so I just didn't have stories to tell, then I lied.

I had two girlfriends before this one. One lasted one month and the another one day.

Everytime I messaged my friends to go out, they did the same thing (and still do):

""Allonz-y, my friends!"" 

""Yep, California here we come"" 

""Okay, see you there"" 

Then, when I'm in the location:

""Sorry bro, I forgot it"", ""sorry bro, this happened"", ""sorry sorry sorry...........

The second college year was were I first met my girlfriend (she was gf of some other guy then). She was just like me. We had so much fun together. We were the best friends I could imagine. I never had this kind of approach with another human being before, besides a friend that lives across the country (we used to talk by messages). I loved it.

She told me everything about her. Everything. The tastes in music, food, games, the stories, the fucked up cheating on her boyfriend, everything.

Later that year, she broke up and we started dating. Later on (when we were already a couple), she said she was already in love with me, even when with the other guy. And I felt for her too.

I finally got a job, and her too, and I thought of asking my best friend to be my gf. She said yes. I was so happy.

Bad trait of personality? I am a jealous person. Can't control it very well (but I see some r/selfimprovement lately).

I think my passive aggressive gf is the only person in the world that keeps me in reality. She is my sun. She is my ruin. She is the heavy. She is my hero. She is everything for me.

Everytime we find a point we disagree, I fight to win (for I am a proud person - another bad trait of personality), and she gives up and ignores me. I hate it. She is everything to me. And she stop talking to me? This is hell. At this moment I regret everything. At this moment I know I'm wrong. At this moment, I swallow the pride and come back to her.

She's there. Like she doesn't care. With her ""conquer me back,, motherfucker"" face. It kills me. It really does. Because she knows that my pride vanishes in front of her.

There was a time we ""broke up"".

She became so mad that she decided to don't talk to me anymore. We would see each other, but she would be silent until I asked her a question. Now picture that. She said ""I will be silent because everytime we talk, we fight. If I remain silent we'll get along just fine.""

Picture that.

I asked for a time. We didn't fight for the rest of the day. The same day I kissed her and hold her hand. She asked me about the time. Well, she turned from water to wine after the ""brake up"".

And everytime she goes out with her friends I think she's going to cheat on me. ""She already did this"" I think. I know that my mind is fucking me up. But it happens all the time. I just try to keep it cool, dying on the inside.

I think I don't just think I will lose my gf. I think I will lose my only friend. This is double damage. Fatal damage.

Sometimes I feel suicidal. I don't have the courage, keep calm. And I know my case isn't that hard to manage. But we are talking about feelings.

My third (listed) bad trait of personality is laziness.

I never finish my projects and always push them to tomorrow. I tried to write dozens of novel books, tried to make a rock band several times, even tried to build a Minecraft house. My projects just don't evolve.

I know if you read until here, you will say that I need to find friends. 

I'm very introverted and I have social phobia. My mind turns every small talk in hell.

I tried tinder to make friends. I am very lazy, and people turn away.

All my gf's friends hate me because I am very defensive around them and I know stuff that they what to keep in the cult.

My friends are missing and I am too proud to try to call them again to go out. It's been years of rejection.

Well, that's the lonely and sad and melancholic side of my life.

It took me 2 hours to do so.

I'll use 2 minutes to write a couple of things that I like:

Music: Idles, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, Grimes, Interpol and Alona Chemerys playlist.

Games: TBoI!!!!!!! and Skyrim, Submachine Series by Mateusz Skutnik and Cards Against Humanity.

Movies: Amelie Poulain, Pulp Fiction, Friday The 13th and Interestelar.

Books: Stephen King, H.P. Lovecraft, George Martin and Tolkien.

Anime: Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan, Another, Revue Starlight and Devilman Crybaby.

Favorite color: purple.

Favorite food: grandma's lasagna

I have a dog, Bob Dylan.

I am trying to learn how to draw.

I want to do something meaningful with my life before I die.

I want to be remembered forever.

And that's it. My life.

349,BoreSnoozeJack,1566852708,4,"Life is all about distractions. Without them, you start to realise how boring and repetitive it can be. Friends are something which helps us with the mundaneness of living. So when you lack them, it‚Äôs quite miserable because socialization is the biggest distraction of them all. And as we all know, humans by nature are social creatures. Even people who are closed off need some social interaction. Having friends provides a support network of sorts. If the friendship is strong enough, you can talk about just about anything and they can do the same. 
Now my problem here is that I‚Äôve always been socially retarded. I‚Äôve had friends in the past, but as the years went on, they slowly drifted away. (Much like a Nintendo Switch Joycon) I believe how I even made friends in the past was a complete fluke because I‚Äôve been trying for years now without much success. Perhaps people can detect social retardation from a mile away. 


You would think lonely people on lonely communities would be easy to make friends with. But no, that‚Äôs not the case. You‚Äôve got to match some of their hobbies or interests, which I mean, it does make sense. It‚Äôs just that a lot of the time you don‚Äôt really know what their interests are exactly, because most of them are very vague in their posts.  The quirky jokes they sometimes put in there are alright, but I‚Äôd much rather know which movies they‚Äôve watched or what video games they play or even other hobbies they may have. Just saying they like movies isn‚Äôt helpful since let‚Äôs be honest, the majority enjoys a good old movie. 


Another issue I have is people using friendship communities as a way to try get laid or find a partner. I understand that most are at that age were settling down with their dream girl (or boy) is what‚Äôs always on their mind, but the chances of them finding their dreamy delight on these friendships communities are going to be even less than making a friend.

Eventually I'll make a few friends, and slowly but surely we'll drift apart. It's normal human nature. 

It feels awful though, especially when you feel almost crippling loneliness no matter what you do. I can be in a room with a million people and feel alone. I can make the closest friend, and feel alone. Then I push people away because I feel like I'm being a burden to them no matter what.

372,Boopity_Snoopins,1566809375,1,"Hey. Not feeling too great right now. Been doing a lot of excessive introspection to the point where my rooms filled with early morning light and i haven't slept, so could do with just getting some stuff out there. Might be a Tl;dr at the bottom, this is gonna be long. Posting to both r/vent and r/lonely because idk where this should really go to be honest.

I was born in 96 and lived in a decent wee neighbourhood for my early years. About a dozen or so homes looked inwards to a central square car park. I had a few good friends on the street and there was no conflict or animosity between the kids there. We had all been brought up together to the point where we could practically wander into each others houses u invited Anne be welcome with open arms. The memories i have are all wonderful ones.

I was brought up by my mother and the dad of my younger sister. She is five years younger than me. At the time i occassionally went to see my dad but after i was returned home with a hand mark across my face after being under the care of his girlfriend, my mum declared that he would other see me without her present or not see me, and so he fucked off.

At school i had a good amount of friends I played with, and was generally happy. I was good at my classwork and surprised my teachers with my ability to read and write more fluently than expected of someone my age (there was a TV show i used to watch that was literally just a floating pencil going through the alphabet and words for each letter that I used to sit down and watch with some crayons and paper. I still vaguely remember the chalkboard animations but nothing else).

Even this dearly on though, looking back i can see that i was a bit different. Not in a good way, mind you, i just seemed to be unable (or at least have difficulty) to see the perspectives of other people. These days i know i have the social aspects associated with autism, as told by my current psychologist (more on that later). It started go cause problems around the half way mark of primary school.

When my sister begin to outgrow being in the cot/sleeping in the same room with mum (i would have been around 7 or 8) we had to move house. We moved into a much rougher neighbourhood. I had no friends on the area since it was the area of a different primary school. I still went to my previous one though, as mum didn't want to move me away from my friends and it was only a twenty minute walk away. I made a couple of friends in the area but they were very different from the ones i knew previously, who I didn't see as much anymore.

The place I was in was not a sheltered community, but it may as well have been compared to this place. The kids were rough and i didn't fit in very well, but was generally liked. However, it didn't take long for a group of kids to decide they didn't like me and shit started to go downhill. If I was with my friends everything was fine since everyone knew each other, but otherwise I was scared to walk around.

At around the time when I was entering primary 3/4 - a split class of both year groups, i began to be bullied quite heavily outside and inside school. Outside school, i had lost contact with some of my friends on the area due to the group of kids that didn't like me saying stuff about me. I remember arguing with one kid who was determined i had been saying things about him. I didn't go outside much after this as I didn't play with anyone and whenever I played outside by myself something would happen involving these kids. Didn't help that i lived amongst them - one was next door, another just around the corner, another down the other end of the street and another over the back garden fence. Even in my back garden i would get shouted at by kids who would scale the high fence to hurl insults. By this time i hadn't spoken to anyone from my original home in quite a while. I think mum didn't speak to the parents too often and I had these current issues on my mind so I just forgot about them to be honest.

Inside school, I was being bullied by a pair of primary 7 boys. Now i was a little, frail ginger fuck who wasn't exactly the best at confrontation, but when in aw these kids stuffing random jackets and bags from the cloakroom into bins and hiding them and throwing them around for no reason during out break time, i went and got the teacher, who had me go with her and she practically pointed at me and went ""Boopity here seen you two do this."" And they had to clean it up.and put everything back. Worth noting that the only toilet for boys above p3 is accessible only from this cloakroom (notebthata the cloakroom wasn't a room let say, it was three walls with a double door sized opening rather than having a closable door.

They Megan o wait for me during breaks and lunch time and would trap me within the cloakroom. I would go for the toilet, walk out and they would be standing in the opening and not let me out. They would punch and kick me unless I did some incredibly degrading shit. Since i was the cause of them having to clean the cloakroom they made me ""clean"" it by crawling around on my hands and knees wiping the floor with my hands whilst they point, laugh and occassional throw things at me, and if i stopped or protested they would hurt me.

This went on for a while before mum found out due to the bruises and some of my stuff going missing. During that time not one of my friends had questioned where i was, and not one of the kids walking by the cloakroom to the only toilet, or up the stairs visible from the cloakroom (the only stairs the boys could go up to reach the classrooms as the first floor was mostly storage) had said a thing. Several classmates had walked by bit didnt even eem to notice.

Now these days i know that kids aren't exactly the most perceptive of this kind of thing. A lot of things go by unnoticed as they're too busy doing their own thing to really care. Not out of maliciousness, just childish tunnel vision of ""I need to be outside playing asap"", but this hurt me deeply that people I spoke with often didn't seem to notice or care. I became more and more distant with friends who began to become angry since i was never around anymore. I didn't tell them out right what was happening because it was humiliating and shameful.

When mum found out she went straight to the school. They said they would keep an eye out for any such activities. Nothing changed. After a while mum went back in after the newly replaced jacket i had been given went missing. In fact it never went missing, i could just never pluck up the courage to tell her if had been stuffed into a urinal and pisses all over. Onyhoo, the school.said they would have teachers check in often to ensure it wasnt happening anymore, and advised that i stay out of the cloakroom, as it was just allowing the bullies to repeat their actions. Keep in mind this is the way to access the only bathroom i could use during break time.

They didn't really look into the cloakrooms too often. It went on as normal with an occassional.teacher coming in. The.teacher that did this saw me standing in the centre if the cloak room once, with the two boys casually standing by the cloakroom entrance, but just left after seeing nothing was happening at that moment. She came in a second time to me on my hands and knees scrubbing the floor, trousers and hands black with mud and shit, and she simply shooed the bullies out of the cloakroom and told me to stop.being silly and to go wash my self off. This is probably one if the reasons why i stopped seeing teachers In a Positive light.

Since they weren't helping me in any way i could see, i decided to stop going for the toilet so i could avoid the cloakroom. That meant i never ate or drank at school, which made the teachers angry during lunch, but they couldn't force me to eat. After lunch though, i would still need to pee quite often, so i used the excuse of having forgotten of having not needed to go earlier to get to go after lunch had ended and class had resumed. Eventually the teacher thought inwas taking the kiss though, and put a stop to that. One day i needed the toilet really badly and jt we about five minutes before the end of the day. I asked to go she said no, i put my hand up again and explained i was desperate, she got angry and said no again, and it ended up with me peeing myself not long after i had stepped out of the classroom into the end of school rush of students.

Mum of course stormed back into the school after taking me home. No idea what was said but once again nothing really changed. Mum tried desperately o get me to change school but wouldn't do it if I didn't want to. Considering how shitty things had gotten the last time locales were changed i was practically begging to remain there.

Didn't take long for me break down crying in class though. The teacher then add me declare to the lass what was wrong with me. I should.mention that I didn't know the names of the boys or anything btw, So i couldn't point them out without he schools support. Onyhoo, i cried something along the lines of nobody likes me, and the teacher said that I was being ridiculous and made thale class give a show of hands of who liked me and who didn't. Of a class of about 22 around half raised their hands, but I didn't really believe any of them, even my friends - who i only occassionally got to play with. Probably the first genuinely cynical thought I can clearly remember to be honest. Infant remember when abouts it happened but one of my few closer friends witnessed me being bullied once tried to get me to just alknoast the boys who violently shoved me back into the cloakroom, so my friend went and got a teacher, who surprisingly, just shooed everyone back outside. Idk why i though this and don't know if it's true or nit, but it seemed to me like my friend was annoyed he had ro get involved. I distinctly remember him sighing as he left, and I thought he had just abandoned me to the pair of cunts.

Onyhoo, i started to avoid going to school, my workrate and quality dropped sharply and then as my attendance hit rock bottom, with my mum going inconstantly to try and figure out a solution, the school phoned social work on my mum for being an unfit parent who allowed her child to avoid going to school. Mum explained fo the social workers who came what was going on but they must've not believed much. They straight uontold my mum that if she didn't hlget her act together they would be forced to fake serious actions to ensure that i am with a family who would ensure i get the education I deserve.

So mum, between a rock and a hard place, was forced tonresoubke her efforts to make me attend school. I wasn't cooperative since I obviously isn't realise how serious the issue was. However, i went often enough to realise he school had put in more effort. Of course shit started up again not long after the summer holidays, and according to mum that's because the social workers had left by then do the school had stopped putting in a show for them. Mums been quite forthright with me about the entire situation over the years. She hates both that school and the social work in general for the way they acted.

Things didn't let up until that year of primary finished and the bullies moved on to high school. Up until this point I didn't actually know they were primary 7s, until they were on stage with the rest of their year for their shitty leaving assembly. By this point, I had been bullied enough inside and outside of school that my favourite pass time of playing computer games had become a major form of escapism for me. To this day it's still a hobby of mine, but back then it was an unhealthy obsession.

Around then my dad came back and got me on the weekends. I was admittedly a spoiled brat that didn't have to do much around the house by this pint, as mum had coddled me since the bullying, but that all changed at dads house. I had to clean and take the bins out,.and by the end of primary school i had to cook for myself too. No.idea if it was his laziness or him trying to get me to be less of a spoiled shit, and although I hated him for if at the time, I'm grateful for it now.

The year after the bullies had left, I still let disconnected from my class and spent little time interacting with hem unless necessary. A girl.transferred into our class mid way through the year and ended up playing with our group of friends. To say i had an unhealthy attraction for her would be understatement. She treat me normally and was pretty cool, one of the smartest people i had met in that point in life sonwas great to talk to as well, but it was the fact that early in she shot down someone who tried to befriend her by saying nasty shit about someone she didn't get along with in class that made me gain said unhealthy attraction. She was a good friend of mine and we spend a lot of time arguing and bickering for that year. it was a good year.

The year after though i started to have serious motivation issues and just lost interest in a lot of things. Once again I stopped going to school as much and when i started going back frequent, the girl had moved to a different group of friends. We still spoke, but not as often. I had began do isolate nyzwkf from some friends and by the end of primary school there was only two i really spoke with. One i would never see again after primary school, the other followed me into the same secondary school.

By this time my dad had introduced me to the wondrous worlds of PC gaming, Warhammer 40K, reading fantasy novels (shoutout to trolltooth wars and the dragons of autumn twilight forgotten realms books) and the biggest one of all, Pen and paper rpg games. Specifically 2nd edition dungeons and dragons. I read a fucktonne of books (a lot of Terry Pratchet, Margaret Weiss, Tracy Hickman, and Trudi Canavan) and played a fuckfonne of tabletop/pen and paper games with my dads group of friends who I still speak with to this day.

High school was hard. I had no motivation to do much, no idea what unwanted to do with myself, no self esteem, and seen the worst in people. To make matters worse the only thing people knew of me in the first year of high school was that i stank of stake cigarette smoke. My mum and her current BF (not the father of my sister, who had broken up around primary six I think) stayed up late in the living room where the clothes were drying, chain smoking fags.

So my music teachers idea of questioning me about his was to declare that I should just admit that I was a smoker in front of my entire class. This utter nugget was your stereotypical ""None of that new age nonsense, classical only"" arrogant musician who had to be correct all the time so he gave me detention for.lying to him when i argued that i had no idea what he was talking about (i didn't realise the smell because I was used to it, unfortunately. I can still remember a couple of students dry heaving when they were like 3 metre away once. That still stings a bit).

So the rumour that the quiet dude that never spoke was a smoker got around. As time passed it shifted into I was stoner. The.reason being that during the holidays of my second year of high school, I had a full blown meltdown in a bowling alley with my family in a nearby city. At some point I had managed to develop an anxiety disorder and it accumulated to a panic attack in absolutely heaving ten pin bowling/arcade building that could about a fucktonne of people in it, which it was doing. No idea when it started but my symptoms of anxiety must have been obvious to those round me because me being on god knows how many drugs became a rumour next. I would have been maybe 14 or 15 at the time btw.

Around this time a dose who was pleasant to speak to pointed out the awesomeness of Xbox live. I didn't have internet at home and had no idea it was even possible to play with others online. So i got home and practically launched into an informsrcial and since it had been ages since i seemed that inferstsdx in anything mum went ahead rmand for it all and i ended up playing with this dude on good ol' modern warfare 2 and red dead redemption online. From there I found out he spoke tonseveeak classmates of mine aho were food friends and they were shocked to know i played Xbox and were exceptionally cool.aboit it all. They became good friend throughout high school, although it was still a struggle.

My attendance dropped and peaked quite a lot and my tardiness was notable to the teachers. They were understanding when they found out I was attempting to avoid the morning rush of people so aa to avoid any panic attacks, which were frequent enough to cause anxiety in and of themselves. There was a chemistry teacher who didn't see my anxiety as a real issue though and had a habit of making students stays up in front of class to answer problems or otherwise tonchastisebrhem if they've made mistakes. These days i see it as him.bringing attention to common pitfalls during experiments and the like, by using in class examples,.but it fucking terrified me at the time and so i avoided his class like the plague.

The Social work were involved again after my tardiness became a major issue in my third or fourth year. They were much more understanding this time since it was to do with my mental health. Mum still hates them though as apparently heybseen it as her fault I was in such a condition. The social worker took me out to play pool and stuff with a group of other kids, but the other kids were ones with properly difficult home lives, or so i would guess from their behaviour. They reminded me too much of the kids that were still bouncing around the streets outside my house - where i still spent all my time indoors. By this fine i literally had no friends in my local.area outside of those i spoke with online and the one dude from primary school.

At some point around here, intrude to kill myself. Depression wasn't something i had been diagnosed with, as i never really spoke about my feeling with people. Past events had made it seem like nobody really cares. I took a total of 37 assorted tablets and pills from the medicine drawer. Mum was on all kinds of pain medication and had a whole bunch of stuff sfored for different situations. I took then with. Bottle of water and lay in bed. The next day or so as utterly excrutiating. My body was unresponsive, and my heartbeat was slow, weak and painful. Every time it beat pain flared up and i couldn't think straight. The next couple of days i slowly recovered but thenoainnwas songreatbthat i will.never ever attempt that again. Of that I'm certain. Nobody noticed this though. Mum was run off her feet. She had just had her bird child and spent very little time in the house as her daughter wasnahtistic and she was running to all sorts of sermons, groups and medical meetings to fijd out as much s she could. (Fun fact, she now goes fo the same primary school I went to and is about as enthusiastic to go there as I was. kinda worried that something similar is happening)

Money became an issue for a while when the Xbox One first appeared, and the other kids i spoke to were either better off financially, or were their parents only children. As such, when everyone shifted to the affectionately named X-bone, i was left behind. By the time i rejoined then about 6 or so months later, the group had fallen apart. Only one of those lads and my mate from primary remained. The dude that introduced me to that group in the first place had fallen off the face of the earth a while back after both his parents succumbed to cancer and he moved away to live with his aunt - last I heard he unfortunately went off the deep end into some pretty hard drugs.

Secondary school continued and eventually i found myself failing my highers and not having a backup plan, as i had been pretty messed up.for a while in a mentality of who gives a Fuxk hat haole s to me, i sure don't.

I eventually pulled my finger out about a year after dropping out suddenly at the end of fifth year,and entered college to study IT. My pair of friends had left before me.and were a year ahead, so i woukd be foing into a class fully comprised of strangers. I waked to college with them.some mornings though, and theough them met anduse that became a good friend. Many a tike was spent on hisncouch playing fighting games and discussing politics and science. He was a stoner but i didn't care. In fact, after a while I was curious. I had been labelled a stoner for long enough - once had a dude threaten to kick the shot out of me if Indidnt stop.lying and just admit i was a low life stoner (Good times) - so any stigma around them was kinda hazy for me at best. I had known the dude for a while and seen him and a mate of his smoke enough times to realise irnsodnt alder heir personality in any scary ways drugs had been represented to me as doing back in school. In fact, they just seemed relaxed, happy and hungry af.

Thus i became that which i was labelled as. My mate was flooded when i took my first draw. One he dubbed as being ""The kind of draw he would.expect Snoop to take"". It fycking floored me. I had never smoked even a cigarette until that point so after a few minutes of coughing, i just sank into the couch and Kay there, playing DBZ, Tekken and Soulcalibur 4. I met many people through this dude. Met many faces that i would otherwise be terrified of through their appearance d ay of handling of themselves, all through the medium of weed. I don't smoke now, as I'm on several mexications for my mental health, but i don't regret it. If really helped me see that people i judged as being awful, egotistical and down right British, were sometimes really nice people who were just trying to get by like myself. Some ere utter cunts mind you, but that's people for you.

I left college about half way through my third year as my mental health deteriorated sharply. A while later I looked into getting help and about half a year later I was introduced to a psychologist who i am still Seeing two years later. My only friends, primary dude, group lad and stoner boy, are all but abscent from my life. Primary has not been in touch for the better part if those two years. Stoner boy has been distant for a while since i moved in with my 96yo great grandmother around two and a half year ago as a live in carer, and group lad has been getting ready to go to university, has gotten himself angfnand isngenerally just on the right path in life.

So to give a rundown of my current situation, My list of friends has been slowly deteriorating since high school, my mental health is still a shambles, i have no communication skills or emploabilitybskills, without much chna e of holding a job as it is right now, I have no future plans, constantly thinking about death but don't want to  suss u h pain r those who have stood by me all my life, am soul crushingly lonely and I'm only about a third of the say through my life expectancy without anything of worth having been achieved. Oh and I don't really speak with dad too often. He has four kids he lives with and the oldest of my half siblings came up from England to live with him.and ended up leaving to live alone not long after.

Tl;dr coddled kid meets a harsh neighbourhood and then school bullies in quick succession, school staff fail to help, cause deep rooted mistrust and eventually leading to issues of self esteem, anxiety, and depression, friends have came and went, mostly went. Tried fo kill myself, failed. Haven't found a purpose in life, lacks motivation,is soul crushingly lonely and finds it difficult to put this into words. No social or emplability skills, scared of strangers, is deathly afraid of what the rest of his hopefully shirtnlife will be like. That's basically me summed up into a paragraph.

 I'm not expecting any thread this. Ifs quite literally my life story after all. People care less for strangers in the end and regardless of how nice of a person you are, its impossible to stay sane of you care foo much about the issues if others.

All the best to you all. If you need help with anything and are fortunate enough to realize it then do what you can for it whilst you can before you lose the will to actually care about it. Sorry if this all sounds silly and childish. I'm not really proofreading or anything, just passing time. That being said this is like the third tmie ive attempted this and the formatting keeps destroying everything when i paste it. Hopefully fixed. If not il just assume i shouldnt post this.",lonely,Story of My Life,2019-08-26 18:49:35

Hey.¬†Not¬†feeling¬†too¬†great¬†right¬†now.¬†Been¬†doing¬†a¬†lot¬†of¬†excessive¬†introspection¬†to¬†the¬†point¬†where¬†my¬†rooms¬†filled¬†with early¬†morning¬†light¬†and¬†i¬†haven't¬†slept,¬†so¬†could¬†do¬†with¬†just¬†getting¬†some¬†stuff¬†out¬†there. And by stuff i mean pretty much my entire story so far so feel free to just ignore this post. Might¬†be¬†a¬†Tl;dr¬†at¬†the¬†bottom, otherwise.  


I¬†was¬†born¬†in¬†96¬†and¬†lived¬†in¬†a¬†decent¬†wee¬†neighbourhood¬†for¬†my¬†early¬†years.¬†About¬†a¬†dozen¬†or¬†so¬†homes¬†looked¬†inwards¬†to¬†a¬†central¬†square¬†car¬†park.¬†I¬†had¬†a¬†few¬†good¬†friends¬†on¬†the¬†street¬†and¬†there¬†was¬†no¬†conflict¬†or¬†animosity¬†between¬†the¬†kids¬†there.¬†We¬†had¬†all¬†been¬†brought¬†up¬†together¬†to¬†the¬†point¬†where¬†we¬†could¬†practically¬†wander¬†into¬†each¬†others¬†houses¬†u¬†invited¬†Anne¬†be¬†welcome¬†with¬†open¬†arms.¬†The¬†memories¬†i¬†have¬†are¬†all¬†wonderful¬†ones.  
 I¬†was¬†brought¬†up¬†by¬†my¬†mother¬†and¬†the¬†dad¬†of¬†my¬†younger¬†sister.¬†She¬†is¬†five¬†years¬†younger¬†than¬†me.¬†At¬†the¬†time¬†i¬†occassionally¬†went¬†to¬†see¬†my¬†dad¬†but¬†after¬†i¬†was¬†returned¬†home¬†with¬†a¬†hand¬†mark¬†across¬†my¬†face¬†after¬†being¬†under¬†the¬†care¬†of¬†his¬†girlfriend,¬†my¬†mum¬†declared¬†that¬†he¬†would¬†other¬†see¬†me¬†without¬†her¬†present¬†or¬†not¬†see¬†me,¬†and¬†so¬†he¬†fucked¬†off.  
 At¬†school¬†i¬†had¬†a¬†good¬†amount¬†of¬†friends¬†I¬†played¬†with,¬†and¬†was¬†generally¬†happy.¬†I¬†was¬†good¬†at¬†my¬†classwork¬†and¬†surprised¬†my¬†teachers¬†with¬†my¬†ability¬†to¬†read¬†and¬†write¬†more¬†fluently¬†than¬†expected¬†of¬†someone¬†my¬†age¬†(there¬†was¬†a¬†TV¬†show¬†i¬†used¬†to¬†watch¬†that¬†was¬†literally¬†just¬†a¬†floating¬†pencil¬†going¬†through¬†the¬†alphabet¬†and¬†words¬†for¬†each¬†letter¬†that¬†I¬†used¬†to¬†sit¬†down¬†and¬†watch¬†with¬†some¬†crayons¬†and¬†paper.¬†I¬†still¬†vaguely¬†remember¬†the¬†chalkboard¬†animations¬†but¬†nothing¬†else).  
 Even¬†this¬†dearly¬†on¬†though,¬†looking¬†back¬†i¬†can¬†see¬†that¬†i¬†was¬†a¬†bit¬†different.¬†Not¬†in¬†a¬†good¬†way,¬†mind¬†you,¬†i¬†just¬†seemed¬†to¬†be¬†unable¬†(or¬†at¬†least¬†have¬†difficulty)¬†to¬†see¬†the¬†perspectives¬†of¬†other¬†people.¬†These¬†days¬†i¬†know¬†i¬†have¬†the¬†social¬†aspects¬†associated¬†with¬†autism,¬†as¬†told¬†by¬†my¬†current¬†psychologist¬†(more¬†on¬†that¬†later).¬†It¬†started¬†go¬†cause¬†problems¬†around¬†the¬†half¬†way¬†mark¬†of¬†primary¬†school.  
 When¬†my¬†sister¬†begin¬†to¬†outgrow¬†being¬†in¬†the¬†cot/sleeping¬†in¬†the¬†same¬†room¬†with¬†mum¬†(i¬†would¬†have¬†been¬†around¬†7¬†or¬†8)¬†we¬†had¬†to¬†move¬†house.¬†We¬†moved¬†into¬†a¬†much¬†rougher¬†neighbourhood.¬†I¬†had¬†no¬†friends¬†on¬†the¬†area¬†since¬†it¬†was¬†the¬†area¬†of¬†a¬†different¬†primary¬†school.¬†I¬†still¬†went¬†to¬†my¬†previous¬†one¬†though,¬†as¬†mum¬†didn't¬†want¬†to¬†move¬†me¬†away¬†from¬†my¬†friends¬†and¬†it¬†was¬†only¬†a¬†twenty¬†minute¬†walk¬†away.¬†I¬†made¬†a¬†couple¬†of¬†friends¬†in¬†the¬†area¬†but¬†they¬†were¬†very¬†different¬†from¬†the¬†ones¬†i¬†knew¬†previously,¬†who¬†I¬†didn't¬†see¬†as¬†much¬†anymore.  
 The¬†place¬†I¬†was¬†in¬†was¬†not¬†a¬†sheltered¬†community,¬†but¬†it¬†may¬†as¬†well¬†have¬†been¬†compared¬†to¬†this¬†place.¬†The¬†kids¬†were¬†rough¬†and¬†i¬†didn't¬†fit¬†in¬†very¬†well,¬†but¬†was¬†generally¬†liked.¬†However,¬†it¬†didn't¬†take¬†long¬†for¬†a¬†group¬†of¬†kids¬†to¬†decide¬†they¬†didn't¬†like¬†me¬†and¬†shit¬†started¬†to¬†go¬†downhill.¬†If¬†I¬†was¬†with¬†my¬†friends¬†everything¬†was¬†fine¬†since¬†everyone¬†knew¬†each¬†other,¬†but¬†otherwise¬†I¬†was¬†scared¬†to¬†walk¬†around.  
 At¬†around¬†the¬†time¬†when¬†I¬†was¬†entering¬†primary¬†3/4¬†-¬†a¬†split¬†class¬†of¬†both¬†year¬†groups,¬†i¬†began¬†to¬†be¬†bullied¬†quite¬†heavily¬†outside¬†and¬†inside¬†school.¬†Outside¬†school,¬†i¬†had¬†lost¬†contact¬†with¬†some¬†of¬†my¬†friends¬†on¬†the¬†area¬†due¬†to¬†the¬†group¬†of¬†kids¬†that¬†didn't¬†like¬†me¬†saying¬†stuff¬†about¬†me.¬†I¬†remember¬†arguing¬†with¬†one¬†kid¬†who¬†was¬†determined¬†i¬†had¬†been¬†saying¬†things¬†about¬†him.¬†I¬†didn't¬†go¬†outside¬†much¬†after¬†this¬†as¬†I¬†didn't¬†play¬†with¬†anyone¬†and¬†whenever¬†I¬†played¬†outside¬†by¬†myself¬†something¬†would¬†happen¬†involving¬†these¬†kids.¬†Didn't¬†help¬†that¬†i¬†lived¬†amongst¬†them¬†-¬†one¬†was¬†next¬†door,¬†another¬†just¬†around¬†the¬†corner,¬†another¬†down¬†the¬†other¬†end¬†of¬†the¬†street¬†and¬†another¬†over¬†the¬†back¬†garden¬†fence.¬†Even¬†in¬†my¬†back¬†garden¬†i¬†would¬†get¬†shouted¬†at¬†by¬†kids¬†who¬†would¬†scale¬†the¬†high¬†fence¬†to¬†hurl¬†insults.¬†By¬†this¬†time¬†i¬†hadn't¬†spoken¬†to¬†anyone¬†from¬†my¬†original¬†home¬†in¬†quite¬†a¬†while.¬†I¬†think¬†mum¬†didn't¬†speak¬†to¬†the¬†parents¬†too¬†often¬†and¬†I¬†had¬†these¬†current¬†issues¬†on¬†my¬†mind¬†so¬†I¬†just¬†forgot¬†about¬†them¬†to¬†be¬†honest.  
 Inside¬†school,¬†I¬†was¬†being¬†bullied¬†by¬†a¬†pair¬†of¬†primary¬†7¬†boys.¬†Now¬†i¬†was¬†a¬†little,¬†frail¬†ginger¬†fuck¬†who¬†wasn't¬†exactly¬†the¬†best¬†at¬†confrontation,¬†but¬†when¬†in¬†aw¬†these¬†kids¬†stuffing¬†random¬†jackets¬†and¬†bags¬†from¬†the¬†cloakroom¬†into¬†bins¬†and¬†hiding¬†them¬†and¬†throwing¬†them¬†around¬†for¬†no¬†reason¬†during¬†out¬†break¬†time,¬†i¬†went¬†and¬†got¬†the¬†teacher,¬†who¬†had¬†me¬†go¬†with¬†her¬†and¬†she¬†practically¬†pointed¬†at¬†me¬†and¬†went¬†""Boopity¬†here¬†seen¬†you¬†two¬†do¬†this.""¬†And¬†they¬†had¬†to¬†clean¬†it¬†up.and¬†put¬†everything¬†back.¬†Worth¬†noting¬†that¬†the¬†only¬†toilet¬†for¬†boys¬†above¬†p3¬†is¬†accessible¬†only¬†from¬†this¬†cloakroom¬†(notebthata¬†the¬†cloakroom¬†wasn't¬†a¬†room¬†let¬†say,¬†it¬†was¬†three¬†walls¬†with¬†a¬†double¬†door¬†sized¬†opening¬†rather¬†than¬†having¬†a¬†closable¬†door.  


Theybegan to¬†wait¬†for¬†me¬†during¬†breaks¬†and¬†lunch¬†time¬†and¬†would¬†trap¬†me¬†within¬†the¬†cloakroom.¬†I¬†would¬†go¬†for¬†the¬†toilet,¬†walk¬†out¬†and¬†they¬†would¬†be¬†standing¬†in¬†the¬†opening¬†and¬†not¬†let¬†me¬†out.¬†They¬†would¬†punch¬†and¬†kick¬†me¬†unless¬†I¬†did¬†some¬†incredibly¬†degrading¬†shit.¬†Since¬†i¬†was¬†the¬†cause¬†of¬†them¬†having¬†to¬†clean¬†the¬†cloakroom¬†they¬†made¬†me¬†""clean""¬†it¬†by¬†crawling¬†around¬†on¬†my¬†hands¬†and¬†knees¬†wiping¬†the¬†floor¬†with¬†my¬†hands¬†whilst¬†they¬†point,¬†laugh¬†and¬†occassional¬†throw¬†things¬†at¬†me,¬†and¬†if¬†i¬†stopped¬†or¬†protested¬†they¬†would¬†hurt¬†me.  
 

This¬†went¬†on¬†for¬†a¬†while¬†before¬†mum¬†found¬†out¬†due¬†to¬†the¬†bruises¬†and¬†some¬†of¬†my¬†stuff¬†going¬†missing.¬†During¬†that¬†time¬†not¬†one¬†of¬†my¬†friends¬†had¬†questioned¬†where¬†i¬†was,¬†and¬†not¬†one¬†of¬†the¬†kids¬†walking¬†by¬†the¬†cloakroom¬†to¬†the¬†only¬†toilet,¬†or¬†up¬†the¬†stairs¬†visible¬†from¬†the¬†cloakroom¬†(the¬†only¬†stairs¬†the¬†boys¬†could¬†go¬†up¬†to¬†reach¬†the¬†classrooms¬†as¬†the¬†first¬†floor¬†was¬†mostly¬†storage)¬†had¬†said¬†a¬†thing.¬†Several¬†classmates¬†had¬†walked¬†by¬†bit¬†didnt¬†even¬†eem¬†to¬†notice.  
 

Now¬†these¬†days¬†i¬†know¬†that¬†kids¬†aren't¬†exactly¬†the¬†most¬†perceptive¬†of¬†this¬†kind¬†of¬†thing.¬†A¬†lot¬†of¬†things¬†go¬†by¬†unnoticed¬†as¬†they're¬†too¬†busy¬†doing¬†their¬†own¬†thing¬†to¬†really¬†care.¬†Not¬†out¬†of¬†maliciousness,¬†just¬†childish¬†tunnel¬†vision¬†of¬†""I¬†need¬†to¬†be¬†outside¬†playing¬†asap"",¬†but¬†this¬†hurt¬†me¬†deeply¬†that¬†people¬†I¬†spoke¬†with¬†often¬†didn't¬†seem¬†to¬†notice¬†or¬†care.¬†I¬†became¬†more¬†and¬†more¬†distant¬†with¬†friends¬†who¬†began¬†to¬†become¬†angry¬†since¬†i¬†was¬†never¬†around¬†anymore.¬†I¬†didn't¬†tell¬†them¬†out¬†right¬†what¬†was¬†happening¬†because¬†it¬†was¬†humiliating¬†and¬†shameful.  
 

When¬†mum¬†found¬†out¬†she¬†went¬†straight¬†to¬†the¬†school.¬†They¬†said¬†they¬†would¬†keep¬†an¬†eye¬†out¬†for¬†any¬†such¬†activities.¬†Nothing¬†changed.¬†After¬†a¬†while¬†mum¬†went¬†back¬†in¬†after¬†the¬†newly¬†replaced¬†jacket¬†i¬†had¬†been¬†given¬†went¬†missing.¬†In¬†fact¬†it¬†never¬†went¬†missing,¬†i¬†could¬†just¬†never¬†pluck¬†up¬†the¬†courage¬†to¬†tell¬†her¬†if¬†had¬†been¬†stuffed¬†into¬†a¬†urinal¬†and¬†pisses¬†all¬†over.¬†Onyhoo,¬†the¬†school.said¬†they¬†would¬†have¬†teachers¬†check¬†in¬†often¬†to¬†ensure¬†it¬†wasnt¬†happening¬†anymore,¬†and¬†advised¬†that¬†i¬†stay¬†out¬†of¬†the¬†cloakroom,¬†as¬†it¬†was¬†just¬†allowing¬†the¬†bullies¬†to¬†repeat¬†their¬†actions.¬†Keep¬†in¬†mind¬†this¬†is¬†the¬†way¬†to¬†access¬†the¬†only¬†bathroom¬†i¬†could¬†use¬†during¬†break¬†time.  
 

They¬†didn't¬†really¬†look¬†into¬†the¬†cloakrooms¬†too¬†often.¬†It¬†went¬†on¬†as¬†normal¬†with¬†an¬†occassional.teacher¬†coming¬†in.¬†The.teacher¬†that¬†did¬†this¬†saw¬†me¬†standing¬†in¬†the¬†centre¬†if¬†the¬†cloak¬†room¬†once,¬†with¬†the¬†two¬†boys¬†casually¬†standing¬†by¬†the¬†cloakroom¬†entrance,¬†but¬†just¬†left¬†after¬†seeing¬†nothing¬†was¬†happening¬†at¬†that¬†moment.¬†She¬†came¬†in¬†a¬†second¬†time¬†to¬†me¬†on¬†my¬†hands¬†and¬†knees¬†scrubbing¬†the¬†floor,¬†trousers¬†and¬†hands¬†black¬†with¬†mud¬†and¬†shit,¬†and¬†she¬†simply¬†shooed¬†the¬†bullies¬†out¬†of¬†the¬†cloakroom¬†and¬†told¬†me¬†to¬†stop.being¬†silly¬†and¬†to¬†go¬†wash¬†my¬†self¬†off.¬†This¬†is¬†probably¬†one¬†if¬†the¬†reasons¬†why¬†i¬†stopped¬†seeing¬†teachers¬†In¬†a¬†Positive¬†light.  
 

Since¬†they¬†weren't¬†helping¬†me¬†in¬†any¬†way¬†i¬†could¬†see,¬†i¬†decided¬†to¬†stop¬†going¬†for¬†the¬†toilet¬†so¬†i¬†could¬†avoid¬†the¬†cloakroom.¬†That¬†meant¬†i¬†never¬†ate¬†or¬†drank¬†at¬†school,¬†which¬†made¬†the¬†teachers¬†angry¬†during¬†lunch,¬†but¬†they¬†couldn't¬†force¬†me¬†to¬†eat.¬†After¬†lunch¬†though,¬†i¬†would¬†still¬†need¬†to¬†pee¬†quite¬†often,¬†so¬†i¬†used¬†the¬†excuse¬†of¬†having¬†forgotten¬†of¬†having¬†not¬†needed¬†to¬†go¬†earlier¬†to¬†get¬†to¬†go¬†after¬†lunch¬†had¬†ended¬†and¬†class¬†had¬†resumed.¬†Eventually¬†the¬†teacher¬†thought¬†inwas¬†taking¬†the¬†kiss¬†though,¬†and¬†put¬†a¬†stop¬†to¬†that.¬†One¬†day¬†i¬†needed¬†the¬†toilet¬†really¬†badly¬†and¬†jt¬†we¬†about¬†five¬†minutes¬†before¬†the¬†end¬†of¬†the¬†day.¬†I¬†asked¬†to¬†go¬†she¬†said¬†no,¬†i¬†put¬†my¬†hand¬†up¬†again¬†and¬†explained¬†i¬†was¬†desperate,¬†she¬†got¬†angry¬†and¬†said¬†no¬†again,¬†and¬†it¬†ended¬†up¬†with¬†me¬†peeing¬†myself¬†not¬†long¬†after¬†i¬†had¬†stepped¬†out¬†of¬†the¬†classroom¬†into¬†the¬†end¬†of¬†school¬†rush¬†of¬†students.  
 

Mum¬†of¬†course¬†stormed¬†back¬†into¬†the¬†school¬†after¬†taking¬†me¬†home.¬†No¬†idea¬†what¬†was¬†said¬†but¬†once¬†again¬†nothing¬†really¬†changed.¬†Mum¬†tried¬†desperately¬†o¬†get¬†me¬†to¬†change¬†school¬†but¬†wouldn't¬†do¬†it¬†if¬†I¬†didn't¬†want¬†to.¬†Considering¬†how¬†shitty¬†things¬†had¬†gotten¬†the¬†last¬†time¬†locales¬†were¬†changed¬†i¬†was¬†practically¬†begging¬†to¬†remain¬†there.  
 

Didn't¬†take¬†long¬†for¬†me¬†break¬†down¬†crying¬†in¬†class¬†though.¬†The¬†teacher¬†then¬†add¬†me¬†declare¬†to¬†the¬†lass¬†what¬†was¬†wrong¬†with¬†me.¬†I¬†should.mention¬†that¬†I¬†didn't¬†know¬†the¬†names¬†of¬†the¬†boys¬†or¬†anything¬†btw,¬†So¬†i¬†couldn't¬†point¬†them¬†out¬†without¬†he¬†schools¬†support.¬†Onyhoo,¬†i¬†cried¬†something¬†along¬†the¬†lines¬†of¬†nobody¬†likes¬†me,¬†and¬†the¬†teacher¬†said¬†that¬†I¬†was¬†being¬†ridiculous¬†and¬†made¬†thale¬†class¬†give¬†a¬†show¬†of¬†hands¬†of¬†who¬†liked¬†me¬†and¬†who¬†didn't.¬†Of¬†a¬†class¬†of¬†about¬†22¬†around¬†half¬†raised¬†their¬†hands,¬†but¬†I¬†didn't¬†really¬†believe¬†any¬†of¬†them,¬†even¬†my¬†friends¬†-¬†who¬†i¬†only¬†occassionally¬†got¬†to¬†play¬†with.¬†Probably¬†the¬†first¬†genuinely¬†cynical¬†thought¬†I¬†can¬†clearly¬†remember¬†to¬†be¬†honest.¬†Infant¬†remember¬†when¬†abouts¬†it¬†happened¬†but¬†one¬†of¬†my¬†few¬†closer¬†friends¬†witnessed¬†me¬†being¬†bullied¬†once¬†tried¬†to¬†get¬†me¬†to¬†just¬†alknoast¬†the¬†boys¬†who¬†violently¬†shoved¬†me¬†back¬†into¬†the¬†cloakroom,¬†so¬†my¬†friend¬†went¬†and¬†got¬†a¬†teacher,¬†who¬†surprisingly,¬†just¬†shooed¬†everyone¬†back¬†outside.¬†Idk¬†why¬†i¬†though¬†this¬†and¬†don't¬†know¬†if¬†it's¬†true¬†or¬†nit,¬†but¬†it¬†seemed¬†to¬†me¬†like¬†my¬†friend¬†was¬†annoyed¬†he¬†had¬†ro¬†get¬†involved.¬†I¬†distinctly¬†remember¬†him¬†sighing¬†as¬†he¬†left,¬†and¬†I¬†thought¬†he¬†had¬†just¬†abandoned¬†me¬†to¬†the¬†pair¬†of¬†cunts.  
 

Onyhoo,¬†i¬†started¬†to¬†avoid¬†going¬†to¬†school,¬†my¬†workrate¬†and¬†quality¬†dropped¬†sharply¬†and¬†then¬†as¬†my¬†attendance¬†hit¬†rock¬†bottom,¬†with¬†my¬†mum¬†going¬†inconstantly¬†to¬†try¬†and¬†figure¬†out¬†a¬†solution,¬†the¬†school¬†phoned¬†social¬†work¬†on¬†my¬†mum¬†for¬†being¬†an¬†unfit¬†parent¬†who¬†allowed¬†her¬†child¬†to¬†avoid¬†going¬†to¬†school.¬†Mum¬†explained¬†fo¬†the¬†social¬†workers¬†who¬†came¬†what¬†was¬†going¬†on¬†but¬†they¬†must've¬†not¬†believed¬†much.¬†They¬†straight¬†uontold¬†my¬†mum¬†that¬†if¬†she¬†didn't¬†hlget¬†her¬†act¬†together¬†they¬†would¬†be¬†forced¬†to¬†fake¬†serious¬†actions¬†to¬†ensure¬†that¬†i¬†am¬†with¬†a¬†family¬†who¬†would¬†ensure¬†i¬†get¬†the¬†education¬†I¬†deserve.  
 

So¬†mum,¬†between¬†a¬†rock¬†and¬†a¬†hard¬†place,¬†was¬†forced¬†tonresoubke¬†her¬†efforts¬†to¬†make¬†me¬†attend¬†school.¬†I¬†wasn't¬†cooperative¬†since¬†I¬†obviously¬†isn't¬†realise¬†how¬†serious¬†the¬†issue¬†was.¬†However,¬†i¬†went¬†often¬†enough¬†to¬†realise¬†he¬†school¬†had¬†put¬†in¬†more¬†effort.¬†Of¬†course¬†shit¬†started¬†up¬†again¬†not¬†long¬†after¬†the¬†summer¬†holidays,¬†and¬†according¬†to¬†mum¬†that's¬†because¬†the¬†social¬†workers¬†had¬†left¬†by¬†then¬†do¬†the¬†school¬†had¬†stopped¬†putting¬†in¬†a¬†show¬†for¬†them.¬†Mums¬†been¬†quite¬†forthright¬†with¬†me¬†about¬†the¬†entire¬†situation¬†over¬†the¬†years.¬†She¬†hates¬†both¬†that¬†school¬†and¬†the¬†social¬†work¬†in¬†general¬†for¬†the¬†way¬†they¬†acted.  
 

Things¬†didn't¬†let¬†up¬†until¬†that¬†year¬†of¬†primary¬†finished¬†and¬†the¬†bullies¬†moved¬†on¬†to¬†high¬†school.¬†Up¬†until¬†this¬†point¬†I¬†didn't¬†actually¬†know¬†they¬†were¬†primary¬†7s,¬†until¬†they¬†were¬†on¬†stage¬†with¬†the¬†rest¬†of¬†their¬†year¬†for¬†their¬†shitty¬†leaving¬†assembly.¬†By¬†this¬†point,¬†I¬†had¬†been¬†bullied¬†enough¬†inside¬†and¬†outside¬†of¬†school¬†that¬†my¬†favourite¬†pass¬†time¬†of¬†playing¬†computer¬†games¬†had¬†become¬†a¬†major¬†form¬†of¬†escapism¬†for¬†me.¬†To¬†this¬†day¬†it's¬†still¬†a¬†hobby¬†of¬†mine,¬†but¬†back¬†then¬†it¬†was¬†an¬†unhealthy¬†obsession.  
 

Around¬†then¬†my¬†dad¬†came¬†back¬†and¬†got¬†me¬†on¬†the¬†weekends.¬†I¬†was¬†admittedly¬†a¬†spoiled¬†brat¬†that¬†didn't¬†have¬†to¬†do¬†much¬†around¬†the¬†house¬†by¬†this¬†pint,¬†as¬†mum¬†had¬†coddled¬†me¬†since¬†the¬†bullying,¬†but¬†that¬†all¬†changed¬†at¬†dads¬†house.¬†I¬†had¬†to¬†clean¬†and¬†take¬†the¬†bins¬†out,.and¬†by¬†the¬†end¬†of¬†primary¬†school¬†i¬†had¬†to¬†cook¬†for¬†myself¬†too.¬†No.idea¬†if¬†it¬†was¬†his¬†laziness¬†or¬†him¬†trying¬†to¬†get¬†me¬†to¬†be¬†less¬†of¬†a¬†spoiled¬†shit,¬†and¬†although¬†I¬†hated¬†him¬†for¬†if¬†at¬†the¬†time,¬†I'm¬†grateful¬†for¬†it¬†now.  
 

The¬†year¬†after¬†the¬†bullies¬†had¬†left,¬†I¬†still¬†let¬†disconnected¬†from¬†my¬†class¬†and¬†spent¬†little¬†time¬†interacting¬†with¬†hem¬†unless¬†necessary.¬†A¬†girl.transferred¬†into¬†our¬†class¬†mid¬†way¬†through¬†the¬†year¬†and¬†ended¬†up¬†playing¬†with¬†our¬†group¬†of¬†friends.¬†To¬†say¬†i¬†had¬†an¬†unhealthy¬†attraction¬†for¬†her¬†would¬†be¬†understatement.¬†She¬†treat¬†me¬†normally¬†and¬†was¬†pretty¬†cool,¬†one¬†of¬†the¬†smartest¬†people¬†i¬†had¬†met¬†in¬†that¬†point¬†in¬†life¬†sonwas¬†great¬†to¬†talk¬†to¬†as¬†well,¬†but¬†it¬†was¬†the¬†fact¬†that¬†early¬†in¬†she¬†shot¬†down¬†someone¬†who¬†tried¬†to¬†befriend¬†her¬†by¬†saying¬†nasty¬†shit¬†about¬†someone¬†she¬†didn't¬†get¬†along¬†with¬†in¬†class¬†that¬†made¬†me¬†gain¬†said¬†unhealthy¬†attraction.¬†She¬†was¬†a¬†good¬†friend¬†of¬†mine¬†and¬†we¬†spend¬†a¬†lot¬†of¬†time¬†arguing¬†and¬†bickering¬†for¬†that¬†year.¬†it¬†was¬†a¬†good¬†year.  
 

The¬†year¬†after¬†though¬†i¬†started¬†to¬†have¬†serious¬†motivation¬†issues¬†and¬†just¬†lost¬†interest¬†in¬†a¬†lot¬†of¬†things.¬†Once¬†again¬†I¬†stopped¬†going¬†to¬†school¬†as¬†much¬†and¬†when¬†i¬†started¬†going¬†back¬†frequent,¬†the¬†girl¬†had¬†moved¬†to¬†a¬†different¬†group¬†of¬†friends.¬†We¬†still¬†spoke,¬†but¬†not¬†as¬†often.¬†I¬†had¬†began¬†do¬†isolate¬†nyzwkf¬†from¬†some¬†friends¬†and¬†by¬†the¬†end¬†of¬†primary¬†school¬†there¬†was¬†only¬†two¬†i¬†really¬†spoke¬†with.¬†One¬†i¬†would¬†never¬†see¬†again¬†after¬†primary¬†school,¬†the¬†other¬†followed¬†me¬†into¬†the¬†same¬†secondary¬†school.  
 

By¬†this¬†time¬†my¬†dad¬†had¬†introduced¬†me¬†to¬†the¬†wondrous¬†worlds¬†of¬†PC¬†gaming,¬†Warhammer¬†40K,¬†reading¬†fantasy¬†novels¬†(shoutout¬†to¬†trolltooth¬†wars¬†and¬†the¬†dragons¬†of¬†autumn¬†twilight¬†forgotten¬†realms¬†books)¬†and¬†the¬†biggest¬†one¬†of¬†all,¬†Pen¬†and¬†paper¬†rpg¬†games.¬†Specifically¬†2nd¬†edition¬†dungeons¬†and¬†dragons.¬†I¬†read¬†a¬†fucktonne¬†of¬†books¬†(a¬†lot¬†of¬†Terry¬†Pratchet,¬†Margaret¬†Weiss,¬†Tracy¬†Hickman,¬†and¬†Trudi¬†Canavan)¬†and¬†played¬†a¬†fuckfonne¬†of¬†tabletop/pen¬†and¬†paper¬†games¬†with¬†my¬†dads¬†group¬†of¬†friends¬†who¬†I¬†still¬†speak¬†with¬†to¬†this¬†day.  
 

High¬†school¬†was¬†hard.¬†I¬†had¬†no¬†motivation¬†to¬†do¬†much,¬†no¬†idea¬†what¬†unwanted¬†to¬†do¬†with¬†myself,¬†no¬†self¬†esteem,¬†and¬†seen¬†the¬†worst¬†in¬†people.¬†To¬†make¬†matters¬†worse¬†the¬†only¬†thing¬†people¬†knew¬†of¬†me¬†in¬†the¬†first¬†year¬†of¬†high¬†school¬†was¬†that¬†i¬†stank¬†of¬†stake¬†cigarette¬†smoke.¬†My¬†mum¬†and¬†her¬†current¬†BF¬†(not¬†the¬†father¬†of¬†my¬†sister,¬†who¬†had¬†broken¬†up¬†around¬†primary¬†six¬†I¬†think)¬†stayed¬†up¬†late¬†in¬†the¬†living¬†room¬†where¬†the¬†clothes¬†were¬†drying,¬†chain¬†smoking¬†fags.  
 

So¬†my¬†music¬†teachers¬†idea¬†of¬†questioning¬†me¬†about¬†his¬†was¬†to¬†declare¬†that¬†I¬†should¬†just¬†admit¬†that¬†I¬†was¬†a¬†smoker¬†in¬†front¬†of¬†my¬†entire¬†class.¬†This¬†utter¬†nugget¬†was¬†your¬†stereotypical¬†""None¬†of¬†that¬†new¬†age¬†nonsense,¬†classical¬†only""¬†arrogant¬†musician¬†who¬†had¬†to¬†be¬†correct¬†all¬†the¬†time¬†so¬†he¬†gave¬†me¬†detention¬†for.lying¬†to¬†him¬†when¬†i¬†argued¬†that¬†i¬†had¬†no¬†idea¬†what¬†he¬†was¬†talking¬†about¬†(i¬†didn't¬†realise¬†the¬†smell¬†because¬†I¬†was¬†used¬†to¬†it,¬†unfortunately.¬†I¬†can¬†still¬†remember¬†a¬†couple¬†of¬†students¬†dry¬†heaving¬†when¬†they¬†were¬†like¬†3¬†metre¬†away¬†once.¬†That¬†still¬†stings¬†a¬†bit).  
 

So¬†the¬†rumour¬†that¬†the¬†quiet¬†dude¬†that¬†never¬†spoke¬†was¬†a¬†smoker¬†got¬†around.¬†As¬†time¬†passed¬†it¬†shifted¬†into¬†I¬†was¬†stoner.¬†The.reason¬†being¬†that¬†during¬†the¬†holidays¬†of¬†my¬†second¬†year¬†of¬†high¬†school,¬†I¬†had¬†a¬†full¬†blown¬†meltdown¬†in¬†a¬†bowling¬†alley¬†with¬†my¬†family¬†in¬†a¬†nearby¬†city.¬†At¬†some¬†point¬†I¬†had¬†managed¬†to¬†develop¬†an¬†anxiety¬†disorder¬†and¬†it¬†accumulated¬†to¬†a¬†panic¬†attack¬†in¬†absolutely¬†heaving¬†ten¬†pin¬†bowling/arcade¬†building¬†that¬†could¬†about¬†a¬†fucktonne¬†of¬†people¬†in¬†it,¬†which¬†it¬†was¬†doing.¬†No¬†idea¬†when¬†it¬†started¬†but¬†my¬†symptoms¬†of¬†anxiety¬†must¬†have¬†been¬†obvious¬†to¬†those¬†round¬†me¬†because¬†me¬†being¬†on¬†god¬†knows¬†how¬†many¬†drugs¬†became¬†a¬†rumour¬†next.¬†I¬†would¬†have¬†been¬†maybe¬†14¬†or¬†15¬†at¬†the¬†time¬†btw.  
 

Around¬†this¬†time¬†a¬†dose¬†who¬†was¬†pleasant¬†to¬†speak¬†to¬†pointed¬†out¬†the¬†awesomeness¬†of¬†Xbox¬†live.¬†I¬†didn't¬†have¬†internet¬†at¬†home¬†and¬†had¬†no¬†idea¬†it¬†was¬†even¬†possible¬†to¬†play¬†with¬†others¬†online.¬†So¬†i¬†got¬†home¬†and¬†practically¬†launched¬†into¬†an¬†informsrcial¬†and¬†since¬†it¬†had¬†been¬†ages¬†since¬†i¬†seemed¬†that¬†inferstsdx¬†in¬†anything¬†mum¬†went¬†ahead¬†rmand¬†for¬†it¬†all¬†and¬†i¬†ended¬†up¬†playing¬†with¬†this¬†dude¬†on¬†good¬†ol'¬†modern¬†warfare¬†2¬†and¬†red¬†dead¬†redemption¬†online.¬†From¬†there¬†I¬†found¬†out¬†he¬†spoke¬†tonseveeak¬†classmates¬†of¬†mine¬†aho¬†were¬†food¬†friends¬†and¬†they¬†were¬†shocked¬†to¬†know¬†i¬†played¬†Xbox¬†and¬†were¬†exceptionally¬†cool.aboit¬†it¬†all.¬†They¬†became¬†good¬†friend¬†throughout¬†high¬†school,¬†although¬†it¬†was¬†still¬†a¬†struggle.  
 

My¬†attendance¬†dropped¬†and¬†peaked¬†quite¬†a¬†lot¬†and¬†my¬†tardiness¬†was¬†notable¬†to¬†the¬†teachers.¬†They¬†were¬†understanding¬†when¬†they¬†found¬†out¬†I¬†was¬†attempting¬†to¬†avoid¬†the¬†morning¬†rush¬†of¬†people¬†so¬†aa¬†to¬†avoid¬†any¬†panic¬†attacks,¬†which¬†were¬†frequent¬†enough¬†to¬†cause¬†anxiety¬†in¬†and¬†of¬†themselves.¬†There¬†was¬†a¬†chemistry¬†teacher¬†who¬†didn't¬†see¬†my¬†anxiety¬†as¬†a¬†real¬†issue¬†though¬†and¬†had¬†a¬†habit¬†of¬†making¬†students¬†stays¬†up¬†in¬†front¬†of¬†class¬†to¬†answer¬†problems¬†or¬†otherwise¬†tonchastisebrhem¬†if¬†they've¬†made¬†mistakes.¬†These¬†days¬†i¬†see¬†it¬†as¬†him.bringing¬†attention¬†to¬†common¬†pitfalls¬†during¬†experiments¬†and¬†the¬†like,¬†by¬†using¬†in¬†class¬†examples,.but¬†it¬†fucking¬†terrified¬†me¬†at¬†the¬†time¬†and¬†so¬†i¬†avoided¬†his¬†class¬†like¬†the¬†plague.  
 

The¬†Social¬†work¬†were¬†involved¬†again¬†after¬†my¬†tardiness¬†became¬†a¬†major¬†issue¬†in¬†my¬†third¬†or¬†fourth¬†year.¬†They¬†were¬†much¬†more¬†understanding¬†this¬†time¬†since¬†it¬†was¬†to¬†do¬†with¬†my¬†mental¬†health.¬†Mum¬†still¬†hates¬†them¬†though¬†as¬†apparently¬†heybseen¬†it¬†as¬†her¬†fault¬†I¬†was¬†in¬†such¬†a¬†condition.¬†The¬†social¬†worker¬†took¬†me¬†out¬†to¬†play¬†pool¬†and¬†stuff¬†with¬†a¬†group¬†of¬†other¬†kids,¬†but¬†the¬†other¬†kids¬†were¬†ones¬†with¬†properly¬†difficult¬†home¬†lives,¬†or¬†so¬†i¬†would¬†guess¬†from¬†their¬†behaviour.¬†They¬†reminded¬†me¬†too¬†much¬†of¬†the¬†kids¬†that¬†were¬†still¬†bouncing¬†around¬†the¬†streets¬†outside¬†my¬†house¬†-¬†where¬†i¬†still¬†spent¬†all¬†my¬†time¬†indoors.¬†By¬†this¬†fine¬†i¬†literally¬†had¬†no¬†friends¬†in¬†my¬†local.area¬†outside¬†of¬†those¬†i¬†spoke¬†with¬†online¬†and¬†the¬†one¬†dude¬†from¬†primary¬†school.  
 

At¬†some¬†point¬†around¬†here,¬†intrude¬†to¬†kill¬†myself.¬†Depression¬†wasn't¬†something¬†i¬†had¬†been¬†diagnosed¬†with,¬†as¬†i¬†never¬†really¬†spoke¬†about¬†my¬†feeling¬†with¬†people.¬†Past¬†events¬†had¬†made¬†it¬†seem¬†like¬†nobody¬†really¬†cares.¬†I¬†took¬†a¬†total¬†of¬†37¬†assorted¬†tablets¬†and¬†pills¬†from¬†the¬†medicine¬†drawer.¬†Mum¬†was¬†on¬†all¬†kinds¬†of¬†pain¬†medication¬†and¬†had¬†a¬†whole¬†bunch¬†of¬†stuff¬†sfored¬†for¬†different¬†situations.¬†I¬†took¬†then¬†with.¬†Bottle¬†of¬†water¬†and¬†lay¬†in¬†bed.¬†The¬†next¬†day¬†or¬†so¬†as¬†utterly¬†excrutiating.¬†My¬†body¬†was¬†unresponsive,¬†and¬†my¬†heartbeat¬†was¬†slow,¬†weak¬†and¬†painful.¬†Every¬†time¬†it¬†beat¬†pain¬†flared¬†up¬†and¬†i¬†couldn't¬†think¬†straight.¬†The¬†next¬†couple¬†of¬†days¬†i¬†slowly¬†recovered¬†but¬†thenoainnwas¬†songreatbthat¬†i¬†will.never¬†ever¬†attempt¬†that¬†again.¬†Of¬†that¬†I'm¬†certain.¬†Nobody¬†noticed¬†this¬†though.¬†Mum¬†was¬†run¬†off¬†her¬†feet.¬†She¬†had¬†just¬†had¬†her¬†bird¬†child¬†and¬†spent¬†very¬†little¬†time¬†in¬†the¬†house¬†as¬†her¬†daughter¬†wasnahtistic¬†and¬†she¬†was¬†running¬†to¬†all¬†sorts¬†of¬†sermons,¬†groups¬†and¬†medical¬†meetings¬†to¬†fijd¬†out¬†as¬†much¬†s¬†she¬†could.¬†(Fun¬†fact,¬†she¬†now¬†goes¬†fo¬†the¬†same¬†primary¬†school¬†I¬†went¬†to¬†and¬†is¬†about¬†as¬†enthusiastic¬†to¬†go¬†there¬†as¬†I¬†was.¬†kinda¬†worried¬†that¬†something¬†similar¬†is¬†happening)  
 

Money¬†became¬†an¬†issue¬†for¬†a¬†while¬†when¬†the¬†Xbox¬†One¬†first¬†appeared,¬†and¬†the¬†other¬†kids¬†i¬†spoke¬†to¬†were¬†either¬†better¬†off¬†financially,¬†or¬†were¬†their¬†parents¬†only¬†children.¬†As¬†such,¬†when¬†everyone¬†shifted¬†to¬†the¬†affectionately¬†named¬†X-bone,¬†i¬†was¬†left¬†behind.¬†By¬†the¬†time¬†i¬†rejoined¬†then¬†about¬†6¬†or¬†so¬†months¬†later,¬†the¬†group¬†had¬†fallen¬†apart.¬†Only¬†one¬†of¬†those¬†lads¬†and¬†my¬†mate¬†from¬†primary¬†remained.¬†The¬†dude¬†that¬†introduced¬†me¬†to¬†that¬†group¬†in¬†the¬†first¬†place¬†had¬†fallen¬†off¬†the¬†face¬†of¬†the¬†earth¬†a¬†while¬†back¬†after¬†both¬†his¬†parents¬†succumbed¬†to¬†cancer¬†and¬†he¬†moved¬†away¬†to¬†live¬†with¬†his¬†aunt¬†-¬†last¬†I¬†heard¬†he¬†unfortunately¬†went¬†off¬†the¬†deep¬†end¬†into¬†some¬†pretty¬†hard¬†drugs.  
 

Secondary¬†school¬†continued¬†and¬†eventually¬†i¬†found¬†myself¬†failing¬†my¬†highers¬†and¬†not¬†having¬†a¬†backup¬†plan,¬†as¬†i¬†had¬†been¬†pretty¬†messed¬†up.for¬†a¬†while¬†in¬†a¬†mentality¬†of¬†who¬†gives¬†a¬†Fuxk¬†hat¬†haole¬†s¬†to¬†me,¬†i¬†sure¬†don't.

You're my soulmate and person, and hearing you say that broke my heart. It felt like I was just a burden, I feel so very unwanted and lonely. I am so hurt and heartbroken by what you said. Do you really hate me? Do you really not want me around...?

381,Drake_Sinclair,1566803713,2,"Man it's been a crappy evening and I don't have anyone to talk to about it.  A little over 24 hours go I met someone and felt a pretty instant connection.  In our first conversations we quickly noticed that we had a lot o similar life experiences and quirky views on things.  We opened up and shared stuff and it felt good.  I can truly say I did not have an agenda other than to get to know her better.  Yes I found her attractive but I wasn't necessarily looking for a romantic relationship I just wanted to get to know her better and see what happened.  If we had landed on being friends that just had cool conversations because of the connection it truly would have been amazing because I am so fucking lonely and just having someone to talk to like that would have been pretty life changing.

The crazy thing is she felt it too.  All of the same connections.  It was a strong feeling for both of us but where I saw possibility she saw vulnerability. The connection scared her and she cut it off.  Even in our conversation about it I felt a connection, she said so many things that were fascinating and I really wanted to explore the feelings and experiences she was alluding too. She said the fact that I understood her fear and didn't try to change her feelings made her feel like we had even more of a connection and that scared her even more.  I didn't want to tray to talk her into anything that wasn't good for her so I made it easy for her to say goodbye by telling her I understood her feelings even if I didn't agree with them and telling her I would totally respect her decision and not try to reach back out.

It sucks!  I know it's not about me that it's about her and where she is at emotionally but still this really hurts.  Of course I feel rejected and hurt.  It isn't like we got far so I am not distraught or anything like that but I am sad.

The problem is that most of these close friends are a year older than I am and left for college so now I am pretty much all alone. Since they‚Äôve left it‚Äôs so different because I used to be running all over the place all of the time to go places and do things, but now they‚Äôre all hundreds of miles away and I‚Äôm stuck by myself. That is the base of my loneliness but I‚Äôm going to go a little deeper into everything so be prepared. I am ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with almost everyone in my class, I play sports and participate in different activities which has allowed my name to spread. Everyone knows who I am and for the most part everyone likes me, but I always feel so astray and alone. I have a bit of a ‚Äúboy problem‚Äù so to say. I have a twin brother and everyone in our class knows and likes him too. The problem I have is that boys tend to stray away from me because of my brother. Whenever I start ‚Äútalking‚Äù to guys and hanging out with them, they always cut it off before anything happens because they ‚Äúrespect my brother too much‚Äù. This has happened at least 6 times since I started high school. After I realized that I could never make anything work with kids in my grade, I started looking else where. This is how I became friends with the kids that are older than I am. One of them is someone who I wasn‚Äôt attracted to at all in the beginning, but is now becoming someone who I really love. We‚Äôre such close friends, I talk to him all the time, and I know that both of us feel the tension but neither of us want to do anything in fear of fucking up our entire friendship.

I understand there may be other factors, but if you‚Äôre letting your love life, or lack there of control your life to such an extent, you need to take a look in the mirror. No one is going to want to be around you when you have this mentality, it‚Äôs depressing, and whether you like it or not, it‚Äôs very draining being around people with such terrible outlooks on life. 

Having a SO should never be the primary goal you are working towards in life, it won‚Äôt get you anywhere, it will just slow you down. It‚Äôs said very commonly, but the truth is you need to learn to love yourself before you can love someone else. You don‚Äôt have to immediately start faking a positive outlook towards life, faking it till you make it never really works in these instances, but even if your miserable, at least try and drag yourself out of bed to make some sort of improvement to your life; I would highly suggest getting a job, work is work, but try and find something you‚Äôll get even a little bit of joy from. Retail is great, being forced to talk to people all day long, while very tough at first, can help you overcome anxiety, learn social skills, improve your communication, the way you express yourself and portray yourself, etc.

392,123zaj123,1566793166,3,"So some background, I just came back from 4 years of college abroad and had a great time actually, not alot of sexual encounters nor did I have a girlfriend in college but the amount of interactions with girls was pretty nice for me. Also made alot of friends and went on some cool adventures all the time.

Skip to today, I recently moved back to my home. I live in a place where pre marital relationships are condemned and basically banned (obv muslim country). Dating here is incredibly hard and very secretive. Like 95% of your interactions with your SO will be over the phone. Even if you‚Äôre lucky and can see your SO often it will be mostly in private places with just the two of you. Its also really fucking hot outside theres not much to do anyways. It just seems hard for me to adjust after living 4 years in a western society.
With that being said,

I just sit and wonder everynight if I will meet a girl I will truly love and how difficult it would be. I dont accept the idea of marrying someone I barely know. I just sit and miss the times where I could like a girl in class or talk to a random girl somewhere and think about her later. It‚Äôs just weird that that is something I won‚Äôt experience here. I just want to be able to love someone that i think is super cool and do stuff together but the idea that i cant do that is weighing heavily on me.

I‚Äôve talked to girls here but it all just seems not serious. I get tired of texting and calling all the time knowing that the girl is literally in the same city but we cant meet. It‚Äôs just all very frustrating. Which leads me to think alot at night which leads to insomnia and I hate staying up late. I also gave up smoking and drinking for good, due to the lack of booz and greens where I live, which makes me more frustrated. Sorry for going off topic haha.

394,EastCoastAA,1566790795,22,"It's been around 10 years since I've felt any real physical contact with another person. For the last several years it's either been me needing to defend myself from physical attacks or the gloved hands of doctors and nurses for physicals or to draw blood.

My teenage years was spent in a collapse as I went to a technical high school despite wanting to pursue art, being yelled at and hit by my parents for not doing well enough, losing all the friends I ever had, being heartbroken over my first girlfriend, and being exploited by mental health professionals that were more interested in their own agendas than helping me.

I've spent the last 7ish years shut inside my family's apartment, barely going outside for months at a time, not having or knowing fundamental adult life skills like how to get a job or what I need to do to get a bank account or a cellphone because growing up I was told to focus on schoolwork if I wanted a good job until I fell apart and communication with my parents broke down. The apartment we live in has become more and more of a bug-infested mess, my parents having a hoarding problem and refusing to throw things out or help clean up, telling me to just leave if I hated our living situation so much. Things are only peaceful if I behave complacently.

I've become incredibly weak and underweight. I struggle to breathe when waking up, feeling a buildup of mucus and dust in my nostrils every day that needs cleaning out. Some days I just don't leave my bed because I just want to close my eyes and pretend not to exist. My teeth are yellow from years of not taking enough care of them and they won't whiten no matter how much I brush these days. My social skills are also completely gone.

Once upon a time, I used to love to draw, it was a core part of my identity, but these last few years I've become unable to. Whenever I have a pencil and a blank sheet of paper nearby, there's nothing I can do.

I've gone through a couple long term, long distance relationships the last couple years that have all gradually dampened my views on people, women, trust, and love, until I finally closed my heart for good two years ago.

I only really have two friends and one social group, all entirely online. The social group consists of some tough-guy personalities that I usually only enjoy being around 20% of the time. The two friends I have usually don't have my high on their priorities and often forget to write back to me, sometimes weeks at a time.

I know right now, I should be focusing on improving my physical health while figuring out how to establish some of the fundamental life stuff. But I've spent the last couple weeks in my bed wondering what the point is. If I do get my life back up and running, I'll still be all alone. And if I'm not all alone, the anxiety of knowing just how easily everything can collapse and disappear will always be there.

I hate my birthdays, nothing good ever happens and I always wish I were never brought into this world. I keep wondering how long this can go on, if I could just disappear...

I wish a nice lady could hold me and tell me that things would be alright. But I know I'm not good enough for something like that and even if I were, I'd be too afraid to feel comfort or affection again.

I don't know why I typed all of this. It took so much effort to type a boring and depressing wall of text.

I try to make things better, I try so much. I go to the gym, I style my hair, I pluck my eyebrows, I take care of my hygiene, I try to learn about more mainstream things, I read books on how to get social skills, I've tried countless medications, seen countless therapists, I read through all of /r/socialskills, I try my very best in my education, I try to do medidation/mindfulness...but every day I just get worse and worse and sink lower and lower. My mental health has alienated me from many of my best friends since they understandably don't like me anymore, I have no clue how to make new ones despite trying really hard to (no-one likes me since I have nothing to like), and obviously I have never had any luck romantically since, well, why would anyone be attracted to me? I don't blame anyone but myself, but I'm trying my best to improve myself and nothing's working I'm just getting worse year after year, month after month, day after day, I'm so tired and I just want it to end so badly.

I don't know how to fix this, I don't know how to make things better, I miss the people whose friendships I ruined because I have such an insufferable personality, I want love, I want to be held and kissed and I want someone to look me in the eyes and tell me I'm good enough. I try to improve I do everything I can but it's not working!

I'm out of ideas, why should I live when nothing works? When nothing makes me happy? When nothing ever gets better? I know a relationship alone won't make me happy, but man it'd sure go a fair way. I try to organise social events but no-one's interested, people don't respond to my messages when I try to talk to them (because I'm boring and shit to talk to), even when I meet new people I still fuck it up and they realise how bad and uninteresting a person I am quickly af. 

I try to ""fake it til I make it"", but people see through it instantly, it just doesn't work man. People say ""just be yourself"" (as if that isn't contradictory to the first statement), but nobody likes ""myself"", least of all me. How can anyone like me when there's nothing to like? How can I have confidence when there's nothing to be confident about? 

I want to be held and loved and appreciated and valued but I don't know how to be good enough to deserve it, I'm trying really hard and I'm just getting worse. I'm really scared, I feel like I am losing control of my mind and myself, I feel like I am losing my mind. I don't want to be like this, I want it to be better, I want to wake up and I feel ok and I don't want to die and there's somebody by my side. I don't want to be alone anymore, I want to be worthy of love. I'm trying my best and it's not doing anything I feel like I have some neurological degenerative disorder wherein I'm slowly and inevitably sliding into insanity and I can do nothing but watch in horror...

Please, what can I do?",lonely,I don't know how to fix myself.,2019-08-26 13:07:46
396,BallBreaka,1566788516,6,"I (34f) live with severe anxiety and depression and being the one to maintain all my friendships is too much of a drain on my already limited mental resources most days.  Even when I do put in the effort, it‚Äôs not always acknowledged.  This past weekend I organized a surprise get together for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday (his birthday was last weekend, but he had to work all weekend, so I scheduled for this weekend since he is off) - invited close to 40 people, some of who were his high school friends that he still talks to, some of his coworkers, but mostly mutual friends (friends we met through playing hockey together).  ONE person showed up for the surprise part (his best friend), one person showed up an hour or so into it, then one person and his gf showed up like 3 hours later.  I felt HORRIBLE for such a terribly low turnout.  Luckily, my boyfriend is super cynical and jaded as well, and was actually glad not many people showed up.  As he put it, ‚Äúif anyone had invited me to something like this, I wouldn‚Äôt have gone and wouldn‚Äôt have felt bad about it.  I can‚Äôt really expect people to go out of their way for me.‚Äù  He took the disappointment way better than I did. He was still very appreciative of my effort, though.  

And then my former roommate, who also got me a very good job at her company and is my boss, had a gender reveal party today and my boyfriend and I weren‚Äôt invited - we play hockey and are ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with most of the people who were there, so it wasn‚Äôt like it was family-only or wouldn‚Äôt have known anyone there.  That was a second kick to the hoo-hah that I really wasn‚Äôt mentally prepared for.  

I work from home full-time - there are stretches of days where I have zero interaction with another human being, both in person and virtually.  If it wasn‚Äôt for my boyfriend and his family, I‚Äôll probably be a complete shut-in.  Honestly, it doesn‚Äôt even matter if I put in the effort to spend time with friends - any time I try to make plans or organize something with friends, no one is interested (like my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday party).  I‚Äôm not a bad person - I‚Äôm just quiet.  It‚Äôs tough to explain, but I don‚Äôt have that ‚Äúringleader‚Äù type of personality.  I‚Äôm not the life of the party.  It‚Äôs honestly like I don‚Äôt exist to other people sometimes.  I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm quiet and shy or for some other reason. 

Needless to say, I am re-evaluating my social circle (for like the 10th time in my life).  I meet people, talk to and spend some time with them, then the second I stop putting in the effort, all interactions with them stop.  This is the cycle - it literally has to be me that is the issue because this happens so damn frequently.  I hate relying on my boyfriend for all my social interaction, but frankly, people just suck.  I‚Äôve turned to Reddit lately and have been commenting and giving people advice on various subs - it at least makes me feel like I‚Äôm being useful to SOMEBODY, even if it a random stranger on the internet.  Even my family sucks - my mom and sister are vampent narcissists (the main reason why I struggle with anxiety and depression so much as an adult) and try to avoid them as much as possible.  My dad is great, but always busy with his social engagements with my stepmom.  Just wish I could find people who can relate to me, understand me and are willing to pull their own weight in the friendship.",lonely,"Friends come and go, but mostly go",2019-08-26 13:01:56

398,hamartiated,1566786813,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

413,poppingt,1566769011,6,"I‚Äôm a freshman at a school that is super far from my hometown. Only 2 other kids that I went to high school with are at this school. Ones a guy and the other is a girl. The guy and I are roommates. We weren‚Äôt like best friends in high school and we only hung out once before going to college but he‚Äôs a good dude and a decent roommate. We pretty much do everything together because we can‚Äôt find friends. I mean it‚Äôs fine and better than having a roommate that just ditches me but it‚Äôs a different kind of loneliness. We‚Äôve hung out with some kids that we met in our building a few times but the other day they kicked us out for no reason. 

We went and bought beer for them (they paid us for it we did not cover the cost of beer lol) and some stuff for us because we thought that maybe we‚Äôd hang out but they kinda kicked us out. We had gone to a few sporting events around the school with them and explored the school really late at night the first time we hung out which was super fun. I just always sort of felt like I was tagging a long and not really invited though. But finally they decided to ditch us the other night. It might‚Äôve been only the one kid that kicked us out of their room cause the other two seemed like they had wanted to hang out because I had been texting them. But we found some girls in our building too that wanted some alcohol so we thought that maybe we could make friends with them by helping out.

We got money from them and got them a lot of stuff and we tried to ask if they wanted to hang out with us since we also had stuff. They said they‚Äôd text us later and they never did. So we just ended up going to a bar. It was pretty fun but it was just me and my roommate. We ran into a couple of guys we knew but the one guy‚Äôs roommate was too messed up and he had to take him home and the other was meeting up with a girl so they left us after about 20 minutes. I thought the one girl we had bought alcohol for seemed super interesting so I snapped her the next day asking if she wanted to meet up at our dorm later to hit a cart or something. She said she‚Äôd see and didn‚Äôt really text me back until much later. She said she wanted to come through and asked if her roommates could. I was happy because we literally haven‚Äôt had anyone over in our dorm yet because we‚Äôve kinda been out doing stuff and our floor isn‚Äôt very friendly. Doors are always closed and some of the guys are kinda dicks. But the girls basically stopped in for 15 minutes talked a little bit and got high and went to go out with some other people. But when they were over I said that we had met like a good amount of people but it was still kinda lonely. And the girl and her roommate agreed. Idk

Basically it feels like people are only hanging with us when they want something we have. And then the second they get it they just act like we don‚Äôt exist. 

For the first few days we couldn‚Äôt really reach the girl who we went to high school with but she‚Äôs always been bad with texting back and she‚Äôs rushing for a sorority so she‚Äôs been busy. But we finally bumped into her and we hung out the whole day. It seems like she knows a bunch of dudes and she‚Äôs met people through her sorority thing. It was fun and it actually felt like we were with people who wanted to hang out with us but we haven‚Äôt really been able to reach her or meet up since. I think she‚Äôs almost done with the rushing process but I‚Äôm worried that she‚Äôll probably not talk to us once she gets into a sorority because I‚Äôve heard that they only really talk to frat guys and stuff. And it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre trying to get with her or anything we just want people to hang out with.

Part of the issue is that there‚Äôs nothing going on right now. We don‚Äôt have any sort of clubs or anything until next week. I think I‚Äôll definitely rush a fraternity and join clubs because it just sucks so much being alone. I had a really good relationship with my family and a good sized but really tight knit group of friends from high school who i could always count on to be there to do stuff with. It seems like everyone is finding groups to do stuff with or having people over here. I thought college would be like a good place to meet a girl or something and have a lot of different and interesting friends. I mean any sort of way to have more contact with people would be nice at this point and I‚Äôm not just upset about not meeting any girls. And I get that I‚Äôm not instantly gonna find my crowd in the first week and have replacements for kids that I‚Äôve been friends with for years. It just sucks because like I said me and my roommate aren‚Äôt like best friends and we‚Äôre not super similar. We both like parties and stuff but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm more outgoing and I like to explore more (like go on long walks and stuff) than he does. 

I just miss having a crowd to go do stupid stuff with or just walk around outside and know that they wanted me to be there without having to have something that benefited them. I just feel constantly used and that everyone I meet won‚Äôt talked to me unless I can do something for them. I like helping out and making sure people have a good time but I usually only get runs and stuff if I‚Äôm going to be there too. If anyone has any advice or anything I‚Äôd appreciate it.

415,mintminute,1566768637,3,"I (23M) am posting on reddit for the first time ever.

The reason for me posting this is that I saw somewhere, expressing your problems in an organized fashion might help with your problems. So I am just trying to get all this off my chest since I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

I cannot say that I am experiencing full on depression as I don't really know how that feels and i feel like I can still function normally right now. So i would call it mild occasional depression. When I was in primary school I had a normal amount of friends with who I would hang at at school and at each others place a lot of the time. My best friend at the time with which I spent a ridiculous amount of time together joined a high school quite far away so we very rarely saw each other, at first only on the weekends and later he wouldn't even come back home for months. After joining high school I started smoking (only cigarettes at first and later also pot) and that's also how I met a lot of people both in high school (in the capital) and in my home town. However 95%+ of my friends were also smokers. I still consider that as the most fun times I have ever had in my life. As my best friend was absent for most of the time I got 2 new best friends, 1 from high school and 1 from my hometown. I was also in a relationship with a girl which didn't last for very long. But because I was an undisciplined and lazy student I failed my second year and had to redo it again in the following year. Because of that I stopped hanging out with quite a few friends from school as they weren't on the same schedule, I did however meet a small handful of friends (like 3) in my new class. After failing a school year I decided my smoking habits were really unhealthy for me and my education, so I decided to slowly wind it down. In the following 2 years I stopped completely and that is when I lost a majority of my friends. I used to be in a large group of friends from my hometown but after I stopped smoking it was like they didn't see me as one of their own, stopped calling me to hang out and didn't even want to meet up if I tried to initiate (and I tried a lot). That's when I realized these people weren't even really my friends (even my hometown best friend drifted away). I had quite severe anxiety and mild depression which led me to hate my school and to me failing it once again. So I had to go to afternoon classes at another school to finish the last year of high school. I didn't meet anyone there as it wasn't really a normal school environment. However I did meet one person through a very popular online game, this person was very understanding and willing to help with my problems so this person took over the role of my best friend (one of my previous bf's drifted away and the other two had school/job a long distance away from me). I would go out with friends but night life was never really my thing so I very rarely met new people and if I did it was just an acquaintance and not a friend. I decided I would give college a try as I heard its a very good place to meet new people and work on your career path at the same time. After 1 year the online friend seemingly wanted to have a change in life which didn't really include me and therefor we drifted apart). The first day of college I met a guy who I recognized from my hometown so we hit it off going to classes and getting food together at the start. At this time it was obvious people weren't really acquainted and were still forming groups within the large class (60 people). So one time I meet up with this guy after a class to get some food and there's another guy with him. Quickly I realized this guy was very anti-social and wouldn't really fit into a normal friends group (he would loudly burp during the lecture and loudly express his strange thoughts during lectures and a handful of others things that just made him very strange and awkward..) I knew that if I hanged out with this guy no one would want to talk to me, thinking I am an awkward person too. But of course this guy thought we were best buddies just because we had a coffee one time during a break. So he would follow me and the other guy literally anywhere we went so it was impossible for us to talk to other people because they would see him and just not want to associate themselves with me or the other normal guy because we kept getting followed by this awkward guy which was making every conversation into a mess. This is when I started going to the Gym which really helped me with keeping my anxiety levels at bay. However because of the inability to meet new people I started to have periods of sadness. I started thinking about how I don't want to keep studying for another 3 years when I know no one at college. I stopped attending and decided to get a job. I now work at a job which I like a lot but I am by far the youngest employee the others all being 10+years older. So there is really no way I could meet someone at work with which I could grab a drink or anything like that. So now I have less than 10 friends with which I could go out and have a normal chat and even out of these few none of them ever want to do anything exciting such as go on a hike or go to new places, do activities. Mostly I only meet them to grab a drink and talk. I always felt like people liked me as a person when I got closer to them and especially 1 on 1 I think I am a really fun person to hang out with. I used to be excited when my birthday was coming up as I could have fun with all my friends, nowadays I wish I didn't have a birthday because i have almost no one to celebrate it with. Even my first ever best friend didn't wish me happy birthday for 2 years in a row now... Even tho on the same day we were getting a drink and he always memorized it because its a very easy date. I don't think I have any true friends, all the people I used to spend a lot of time with are either abroad or I can never get in touch with. Finding a partner feels more difficult than ever and if it weren't for my hobbies of cooking, going to the Gym and playing video games I don't know what i would even do with my lonely life.

This is where I am at now. I don't know if anyone will even read this or reply.

But if you do, I would like to ask you, what do you think about my situation after reading all this, have you ever been in a similar situation as I am in now? Did time heal your loneliness or did u just have to accept this is what life is going to be, going forward?

I got a little false taste of what it feels like to be liked and like someone back for a bit, but then that didn't work out immediately. Then I heard about my friends escapades and endless sex he had, and then eventually may have overheard him and his girl in the other room and I freaked out a bit and went outside to calm down (they don't know about that). 

I've had no relationship experience in my life due to a long time unofficial relationship in my past. I have had options then and now but I've denied them just cuz I'd rather save my first experiences with someone I think I'll actually stick with.

Now normally, I'm unmotivated to keep up with my appearance but I'm hoping this trip has actually made me feel so lonely that I consistently go out of my way to do things I've been wanting to do: work out, keep up with my hair, keep a clean trim on facial hair, put myself out there maybe on dating media and even sing. It just really sucks that I feel like this on my final days here with my friends. I'm happy they're such a good couple, but I feel like I have so much to do and I can't do here.

Most people like me, but in my friend group everyone seems closer to eachother than they are to me, I often see friends of mine going out or hanging out with me having no knowledge of the plans. All of my friends have been travelling with eachother or with outside friends and I've never known about the plans until they have been already booked.

I'm pretty unlucky in terms of dating,  although girls that I've hung out with in friend terms or if they are seeing my guy friends have flat out told me I'm a good looking guy just out of the blue. -

(Though for a long time i could never figure out whether or not they were just teasing me. I wouldnt say 'bullied' but i was quiet and was teased a lot in middle school so even now nearing the end of college my self esteem is low.) 

- in spite of my apparant good looks I have a hard time getting a girl to speak to me in the first place.

As of now i do have a tinder match who i knew already, (actually one of the people who used to complement me). Although i get mixed signals, most times I'm the one texting first (as usual), and i get left on read for days at a time. But the good signals are literally ""I want to go out with you, how about [insert day]"" and she does text me first the odd day. We still haven't actually went out since we're in different towns for the summer. I dont really know what to think of it all but it makes makes me as disposable as my friends do.

Going on a vacation to a off shore island for a week. Something I have been planning for years and just kept postponing it


I'm in my mid 20s,
I always have been "" don't need anyone, can do anything on my own"" which idk if it's the right thing 

I have/had alot of friends but are always on the ""hi/bye"" basis. 

Those whom are supposedly close, always seem to realize my existence only if they need some from of help. Or I'm always the last plan. But I totally understand them, they have their own life some are married or gonna get married have their own group of friends etc 
And this is always the case ever since I was young. I am always the ""hilarious popular guy"" and it ends there. And I've never been take seriously.
And the friendship just ends there. They laugh at me or my jokes and it ends there. 

Example: I am quite successful in my career.  when I bump onto a friend/s and when they ask what am I doing in my life, and when I tell them what I do, most of them burst out laughing saying "" please don't joke, tell the truth"" as much as it hurts, I always laugh it off with them. As there is nothing much I can do. 


 I never had a best friend or significant other whom I can share everything with. 
I do literally everything alone.
I dont know if im just lucky.
Example: in my job(I work in IT) I am a one man department.
I don't have any work friends I could go for like a simple lunch with. This was the case for my previous job as well. I got out of my previous job ( which was literally the same solo department) 
cuz I was thinking I would make a good friend or significant other in my new job.

I was recently called back for reservist, only to find out I was posted out to another role. And again it's a solo role.

I go on my own dinner dates alone at fancy restaurants or at a bar or just going out anywhere. I tried calling some ""friends"" out but I have to always end up paying for them. 
To an extend I had to call out some ""friends"" I have to  mention "" it's on me"" only then I usually get an okay otherwise it's always "" let me check and let you know "" and they don't reply back.
The last time I had a meal with someone was almost a year ago

The only notifications I get on my phone is my work emails or someone asking some IT advice.
Been weeks without anyone messaging me saying hello.. and when I try start a Convo with someone, the conversation just dies off within minutes

I've tried everything under the books I could but nothing seems to help this feeling of loneliness.
I am/was diagnosed with chornic depression which doesn't help. I've followed everything my psychiatrist asked me to do nothing helps 

To an extend of getting used to doing everything alone. I get paranoid and very uncomfortable when I am with people socially.
Expect for work.

I deleted social media expect for the amazing reddit where no one judges and Twitter ( for OSINT) changed my handphone number as I didn't want people just coming to me for favours 


I've picked up aircraft model building recently and gaming (bought payday) It's fun but doesn't help at all.

So, for long I've been contemplating a vacation.
So I decided on this trip, I asked around if anyone would wanna join me 
Received the same "", I gotta check let you know "" And no replies back 
When I check back from their conversation, I realized I could need to pay for the accommodation instead of splitting it. Which I was okay with that. But it's like paying for friendship.
So, I thought of going myself, applied leaves booked the flight and hotel its for a week on an island anyway from civilization.

But idk what am I to expect. Its a place for group of people or couples on a honeymoon.
So I dont know what to expect. I am not exactly good with making new friends.

Back story, I've been a victim of bullying from grade school to college. I'm an introvert, I don't like talking that is not interesting for me. I don't like having more friends because I treasure the quality of friendship, not the quantity. In high school, I discovered myself that I am good at drawing/making art. So when there had an art project/drawing, they're went to make them an art. I feel that I am used to have their grades. And every time that has a major event (like NBA Finals and a movie release, particular the Marvel ones), they talked about it, and no one wanted to talk to me because I'm not interested at it.

In college, I discovered (again) that I am good at video editing/photography/graphic design. So, when the project comes, they choose me as a member of their group, sometimes a leader. I feel that I'm used again 'coz after the project finishes, no one wanted to make friends with me.

One time, I had a crush on my classmate, and I'm happy that I make friends with her. But after 2 months, she is very cold to me. I've just found out that her friends influence her. They make sure that we will not be together. Also, they sent me very long messages on facebook citing that there are many reasons why should we go in a relationship. I was really upset 'coz I built a good relationship with the girl and because of her friends' influence, it pop like a bubble.

They graduated on time, and I'm still here at university. I deleted all of my social media accounts for not being jealous on their success.¬† It makes me toxic. And now, my family is questioning me when do I have a romantic relationship? What's my plan? Do I still have friends? What job do I take? I feel pressured, and depressed. Every night, I can't sleep because of overthinking. *""Why are the bullies is more successful than me?""* I cried a lot every time I remember my past. I experience more mental breakdowns than before.

Moreover Im not really close to any of these people from  work, there is noone I can say ""I could hang on with him/her"".

I  feel like Im gonna embarrass myself under these conditions. I feel like i  was invited just out of courtesy and better to not go. Then again there  will be that ""wtf dude"" moment with the guy if i dont attend. Should i  just make up an excuse?

Other than that I have no real social footprint despite the fact I was very active on them posting multiple times a day sometimes. That alone would let people know I am still around, so basically for the most part I have gone MIA. I stopped using them mainly because social media holds nothing for me anymore of anything meaningful, but in some part because I'd like to know who would notice I'm no longer on there.

And not a single person has reached out to find me.  

It's nice to unplug and I'm going to continue to see how far I can go. I think the main motivation of not going back in the end will be the fact the will be no notifications of me being tagged.

Well, rather be six feet in the ground

Had to break up with my girl, she don't believe in my route
But how could she? I don't really either and can tell
I don't really need another reason to beat up myself
But I do it
Till I'm ruined
Till I don't understand that I'm stupid
Taking all the drugs, I think I fucking lost it with the music

I don't really have any friends.

With fakes smiles and hands

458,whomst89,1566714858,8,"Idk maybe being alone has made me not fun. I cant remember the last time I went out and actually had fun, ie. Go hand out with friends or go to the movies or downtown. Heck I dont even know what I would consider fun anymore

Usually my day is I wake up and sit in my room and watch netflix or play a videogame. Which can be fun but these games arent giving me joy vmuch anymore. So either sitting and doing nothing or I sleep until I have to go to work (i work nights. That's a plus) then I get off work and the nights pretty much over so I go home and smoke till I go to sleep. 

I'm not in a relationship, never have been I'm more of a tomboy I guess so guys dont see me as a romantic partner. Plus I'm tall, taller than most girls maybe ( I hype myself up I'm 5'8 nothing special) and  im skinny no boob really no butt either it get into specifics. I have had my friend in high school say to me straight up ""I will never have any sexual attraction to you"" or the classic ""I see you as a guy"" and it's very deterring. 

I had regular friends in school but by the end of senior year I was having to waste lunch alone; going to get food then coming back on campus and have to chill for 5-10 either outside the classroom or.....in the toilets. I felt really alone during those moments, like I had no friends. But I had friend A, we had our ups and downs in the friend group but we stayed friends but she got into a relationship and then they went off together. They just got an apartment together it's really nice! I'm happy for them! Though, it always reminds me about how by myself I am.

The only time I really have fun is at work, so I try to work I guess so I can get that social interaction with my peers. I even work with friend A which is a plus! But that's work and when I go home it's back to the same thing. Same soup just reheated.

465,DesiresToBeCute,1566709885,1,"So I'm a pretty fucked up person to put it bluntly. I graduated a year ago and in high school I never spoke to a single person really. There were occasional moments where I was forced to interact with people that I secretly loved (but also hated). I remember in my high school gym class a group of girls kind of accepted me into their little clique. I had trouble communicating with them because of the pain. But it made me feel human. I am attracted (and relate exclusively) to women and I haven't spoken to a gal my age since junior year. So approximately 2.5 years ago. It's rather lonely. It does kind of make me a little crazy. I have absolutely zero interest in dating... I just want to speak to a girl my age. I think about it often now. 

I have never really had anyone that I can speak to about personal stuff before. I read stories online about people having friendships and I become so jealous. Makes me pretty upset honestly. Years ago when I was still in middle school I used to play video games online with my best friend Christian. He was really emotionally distant but I still cared about him a lot. I still do. Junior year he told me I was really depressing recently. He told me that he couldn't be around me if I kept acting like I was. At the time I lacked the perspective to really see how I was acting. So that was kind of the end of socializing for me. I said goodbye to him and haven't spoke to him since. He made it obvious that he wanted to speak to me senior year. I accepted that I just couldn't communicate with people anymore. All of senior year I never said a word. 

I look on Facebook and see all of those people. What's weird is that I consider them all my friends. Even though I haven't spoken to them in years now. We went to high school together. That makes us friends to me.",lonely,Kind of miss speaking to people my own age.,2019-08-25 15:11:25

473,someonerandomwhat,1566704496,1,"The past 2 and a half year I have been lonely. Today I have an successful clothing brand and I sell online. Obviously I work at home. Often I meet new people related to my company but my daily work is at home alone with my brother that works with me. This started 2 and half years ago.

I dropped my job at an advertising agency where I never had a real good friend, just job colleagues. So I don't miss that. My real friends where made in elementary school, high school and college. My friends from the time I was a kid are there, I can call them. But they are all with new friend's, and it's not like I would feel comfortable to say ""hey, dude, im lonely and I have nobody"". They actually don't know that, they probably think I'm going fine just like them. These are the real and deep friends I had.

I never made any friends on High School and I think this time was when my social phobia began. Everyone there where just stupid for me and treated me like I was a weirdo just because I was new. I just said fuck them and lived 2 years pretending it was ok. No one knew that too. Not even my parents.

At college I had maybe the best time of my life. I had a girlfriend she was hot, I was always at parties, I started smoking weed and that helped me a lot on hanging around with people. When I broke up I met some other girls, but never had a second long term relationship. 

Well, after a while I saw that almost 90% of my college friends where superficial friendship that depended all on smoking weed. 3 years ago o had drop it because it was fucking me up with anxiety and paranoia. Also, I began using other drugs wich I was never addicted, but I was on the path to it. So I decided to change my life and don't do any drugs anymore. Consequently my ""friends"" started losing their interest on me and i lost my interest on them either. 

So I decided to make money and do what I loved, Wich is graphic design. As I said I started a company and I am doing really good with my brother. 

The problem is as I work at home I just don't have friends anymore.

We as humans adapt to anything you know. And I thought I was adapted to being lonely. But this weekend I was trying to hookup with a girl that came to me on Instagram and I was feeling so good just because I was having a deep connection with her.

We was going on a date today. But she said in the last minute she would not go because had a personal problem. I know we are not going to chat anymore as we did in the last 3 weeks. I know that I am absolutely lonely again and I don't have no perspective on meeting new people or girl's. 

I know I'm doing fine on the rest of my life. But life without other people around and deep connections like love is not worth it.

482,ksswannn03,1566699551,53,"So the other day I got into a horrific car accident with my mother. A truck ran a stop sign in an intersection straight into us. If our car had gone a millisecond faster, the truck would have hit straight into me and killed me on impact and maybe even my mother. The air bags didn‚Äôt go off so that almost got us too. But we were able to walk away from a completely wrecked car with only a few scratches and bruises and like things. It was easily the most terrifying moment of my life and I find myself depressed and wondering if I‚Äôd have been better off dead.

Now here‚Äôs the fun part.

Earlier before the accident, I planned to have lunch with a girl from my college. I also have a best friend and she‚Äôs going to the same college as me. The girl I mentioned has been ignoring my ex best friend, let‚Äôs call the friend Betty for now, and they are roommates so it‚Äôs been pretty hard on her dealing with homesickness and being ignored for other girls. I thought this lunch was going to include Betty for a gift exchange; according to the girl, it was just going to be me and her. Not even four hours after the crash while I‚Äôm still in the ER with my mother getting checked on do I receive angry text messages. The first immediately began with calling me bitch, and I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs in that funny friend way or a mad way or both. The rest are things about how I betrayed her and went behind her back with this lunch. Things about purposefully excluding her. Basically the nobody-likes-Betty-please-pity-me card. I told her it was never my intention to leave her out because it never was, but she didn‚Äôt listen and insisted that I was lying. I warned her repeatedly to stop, that I‚Äôm not in the mood for some petty bullshit after almost dying today and having my mom in the hospital, and I kept telling her to stop the conversation over and over. But Betty was. Not. Amused. Betty decided to escalate the argument and talk about me barely having a scratch, as if therefore I should be completely over it by now and ready to move on with my life. Betty compared my car crash with the car crash of her mother who now suffers from nerve damage issues, sending various laughing emojis as if me and my mother‚Äôs situation is nothing compared to hers. And maybe it isn‚Äôt. Sure, no one died, no one has life-threatening injuries, but that doesn‚Äôt change the terror of knowing that if either car had been going a little faster or if his hit ours a few centimeters sooner, we‚Äôd likely both be dead right now. I‚Äôve been shuddering and shaking and thinking about death ever since.

So then it‚Äôs my turn.

I tell Betty I never want to fucking talk to her ever again in my life. She does the same. I say bye, she says something to the tune of go fuck yourself, while I delete her number, block it, and block her on all social media. Betty is gone, and I never want her back in my life. I would never EVER yell at a friend over something so stupid and basically call their near death experience nothing in comparison to others. I would never have said the things she said to anyone after something like that. I figure if you‚Äôre yelling at someone on the day they almost died, you‚Äôre in the wrong. And it shows me how little she ever cared about me from the beginning. And now, I‚Äôm here at my new college after transferring, I don‚Äôt know anyone or about anything really, and she was the only friend I‚Äôd ever made and gotten close to in my life and now she‚Äôs gone. I don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôs doing without me. I saw her on another person‚Äôs post, looking happy and content, obviously just a way to dig into me more. I don‚Äôt know if she sees she was wrong or if she misses me, and most of me doesn‚Äôt give a damn because I have classes in less than 48 hours and I need to prepare for them. But I feel tremendously lonely and I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to reach out to people or if it‚Äôll even work, as last year I tried so hard to make friends at college and never made one.

Is it me or are there a lot of people who don't understand how draining feeling lonely is, how much it can suck the life out of you and make you extremely sad. Like honestly I don't consider myself depressed anymore, I'm just always sad because I'm lonely. I haven't hung out with friends IRL since March and before that it was since July last year. In March I met up with my online friends I met on Discord and spend 4 days with them. Those days I felt genuinely happy, didn't feel alone and just was enjoying being around friends. Since March I've just been talking over Discord with one of those friends, a girl who I consider my best friend. 3 weeks ago she told me she considered me her best friend and I'm one of her favorite people to hang out with on Discord and play games with or talk to. Reading this made me extremely happy of course because I genuinely believed her, which doesnt happen often that I believe someone who says that because of bad past experiences. But now the past 3 weeks I haven't been able to talk to her because she is visiting her boyfriend. So the past few weeks I've been even more lonely than usual. Whenever I mention being lonely to her, she just kinda ignores it for some reason. She doesn't seem to realize how much it affects me. And I feel like a lot of people don't. All I think they see is me complaining and being negative online complaining about being lonely but nobody reaches out to me when they hear it or see it. This then makes me even more lonely because it feels like nobody cares... A few days ago I mentioned to my friend that I would love to make a trip somewhere for a few days, to be gone from home for a bit. I hoped she would suggest flying over to her and her boyfriend (he is also a good friend of me btw) and spend some time with them. But she didn't which now makes me feel like she doesn't wanna hang out with me. Very often I have the feeling that everyone I talk to finds me annoying and would rather not talk to me or be friends even when my best friend sometimes tells me she cares a lot about me and that we'll always be friends. Yet it doesn't feel like it to me. I feel like a burden, a bother in their lives.

I'm just gonna end the rant/vent here. There is so much more I wanna say but this got a lot longer than I wanted it to be already. Thanks for reading if you did, means a lot.

501,RyanPerson8890,1566672206,1,"Am I crazy for being so obsessed with being found attractive?  On one hand, that's all I think about to the point where I have been having mental breakdowns on a regular basis for the past nine years, I have suicidal thoughts from the fact that I am probably going to live the rest of my life alone.  I shouldn't be this obsessed with women liking me, and it is only women.  I could not care less it a guy doesn't like me, I have had plenty of male friends, and good ones.  I don't care if people think I'm lazy at work, I have always busted my ass at every job I've had, and have had no trouble moving up and getting promotions because of my work ethic.  I recently got turned down from a gig as a drummer because of my drumming style.  Once again, didn't bother me in the slightest, because I've played in plenty of bands and have been told I am an amazing drummer.

But a girl doesn't like me?  I'm a disgusting creep, she probably thinks I'm a sexual predator, and I'm going to live the rest of my life alone.  I could be crazy, but then again, I've been rejected by almost every girl I've asked out, I am still a virgin(being a virgin does not mean you only want sex), I have had one relationship that lasted two months.  I went through a huge amount of rejection by women when I was younger, got called ugly a lot when I was younger, and it still fucks me up to this day, though I still get rejected and ignored constantly.  

I have quit drinking, quit smoking, quit heroin after being addicted for five years, started lifting and put on about 50 pounds at this point, I've seen a dating coach, four therapists over the course of the past five years, started paying women to cuddle with me(yes, that is a thing, look it up), I have become financially stable with my own car, own place, I have volunteered at various animal shelters to meet people, taken up yoga to meet people, gotten back into music, playing in bands, and for what?  Women don't like me any more than when I was a severly  underweight heroin addict with my face covered in acne.  In fact, they seem to like me less, if anything.  At this point suicide does seem like my only option.  

I refuse to live the rest of my life like this in constant mental turmoil. I constantly feel like I am going to snap, and I want to hurt people.  Not kill, I just want to bash people's faces in.  Am I entitled?  Sure, but every body on the planet is entitled.  In fact, the more entitled you are the more you date, so maybe I should be entitled.  Doesn't matter, because I'm going to turn 30 soon, and I'm probably not going to make it that long before I blow my brains out.",lonely,"I have become obsessed with female validation over the years, and I am done with it",2019-08-25 04:43:26

505,Imthatguy0029,1566669382,1,"Hey everybody,

It's been a while. I haven't posted here in a bit. I've been traveling a few US states to a couple friends places and back, and I'm even at a friend's now in Delaware. They're not home at the moment. Yesterday I was over in Virginia at their parents house playing VR while they were at work, which was most of the time.

I didn't expect to enjoy VR chat in particular so much. I figured I'd check it out and get bored immediately. Instead, I instantly made a bunch of friends and played all sorts of games, it was really fun. Some girl even seemed to kinda fall for me while I was there. It made me feel good about myself. I was able to get a couple discord and steam names before leaving Virginia, but I don't have my own VR set. I won't be able to interact with people like that for a long time.

On my way to Delaware I was talking to to my buddy who's a really good guy. Just man to man talk to really keep us awake for the long drive. Apparently he's had tons of sex, from about 17-24 he never went 2 days without it. It was consentual with no problems for the most part, so nothing bad. And he's had a bunch of relationship experience. 

Meanwhile, I'm here at the age of 25 and I haven't even had a real relationship yet. It's not that I haven't had the option, I've just always wanted to get to know someone well enough that I think I could actually be with them before I jump into anything. You know, save my first experience and try to make it special. Its okay if it doesn't turn out great, but I figured whoever it is down the road will appreciate it, even if they've had their own experiences already.

That doesn't make me any less envious of my friend. I can't help but to think that despite doing what I think is the right thing for me, I'm missing out on life.

I guess I haven't been the greatest at keeping up with my appearance and putting myself out there. I know that could help.

Anyways thanks all for listening. Looks like my buddy's home, so maybe I can get my mind off this stuff for a bit. See ya",lonely,Venting I guess,2019-08-25 03:56:22

507,Justdriftingalong,1566663034,2,"Before I go on this rant - just want to preface this with: not really looking for a solution or a fix. Just word vomiting and getting these thoughts out ...

I've been going out with a friend every week now for about a year or two. He's the extroverted type who tries to bring some social interaction to my introverted life. He's developed a friend group of about 20 people that we'll sometimes see a few of when we go out. I like them, they like me, it's fun during the night and it's always a good time ... In the moment.

Then after I wake up and shake off the hangover I start to realize ... I'm actually just a +1. I'm kind of always in the back of pictures the group takes, always at the edge of the group, edge of the conversation. I don't actually feel any emotions towards any of them really ... Like if they just weren't a part of my life anymore - it wouldn't actually matter to me. Wouldn't be sad, wouldn't be happy, just whatever. 

It just leaves me emotionless, and lonely. Honestly it makes me feel dead inside. Not in like a meme way like I used to say when I was a little younger and being emo - but *actually* dead inside. Lacking emotion that normal people should have. 

On the other hand ... I also feel like I can develop connections with people too quickly and too deeply that aren't reciprocated because they simply just don't form them that quickly with people ... So maybe it's just a defense mechanism I've developed ... A ""wall"" I've put up to prevent myself from getting hurt. I don't know ...

Like I said in the beginning, not looking for anything. Just getting this off my chest and out there ... Don't feel like anyone around me would want to hear this and wouldn't want to make them worry about me ... Also curious if anyone else can relate to this.

Thank you for reading and letting me get this out &lt;3",lonely,Actually dead inside? ...,2019-08-25 02:10:34

509,BackIn2001,1566661886,290,"I got completely depressed this summer, and some part of that was because of Instagram. I always see everyone post a picture or a story about where they are, they post about the food they eat, the activities they do, what they buy, and how much fun they're having. I'm not envy, I just get sad because some people are able to afford multiple vacations aboard and here I am in my home just going to the beach. It makes me compare myself, makes me feel like a loser. Like I'm losing out on something. Also, people on Instagram are so toxic. I caught some of my ""friends"" printing my conversations with them and sending it to someone else, and also printing their conversations with someone else and send it to me. Like what the hell is wrong with you? Respect someone's privacy, something that seems impossible to achieve if you're not careful in social media. Even with people you think you can trust. 

But then I realized that these people only post pictures and stories about good moments only. Where are the posts regarding how you've failed in school last year? And let's not talk about those people who post ""Pray for Amazonia"" posts and then their next story is eating a Big Mac at McDonald's.

So yeah, now I'm feeling a lot better. There's just one thing I'm afraid of. Will I be seen as a loser or an anti social if people know I don't use Instagram?

I am 21 years old, and I have absolutely no hope for the future. I am too depressed and anxious to try and do anything to improve myself or my standing. I was kicked out of college when I was 17 for being too depressed and not worth their time, and as a result lost 90% of my friends pretty much the day after. Over the past few years I have lost the friends I had left here and there and now I have none left. 

My parents have never said anything about it but I know they are disappointed in me and annoyed that I don't do anything with my life, but I have no idea how to explain to them why I am like this when I do not understand it myself. 

I am the only child they will ever have so that really compounds the anger and frustration I feel towards myself. I have never really had any direction in life during the best of times so I have absolutely nothing I have wanted to achieve or any dreams of any kind. I also do not have a job, or any skills of any kind so getting even a shitty job is pretty much out of the question.

511,hamartiated,1566659566,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

This is not all of what I regret, but this is enough to justify me being absolutely alone, and now I'm lost, confused and honestly scared. Please, don't be mean and ask me to go out and make friends. I've tried it, and I've failed at it. Yes, one thing that I have not tried is drinking to let this pain go away, but I really don't want walk down that path. I hate on the type of person I've become over these years. I can't make anyone enjoy my presence, so why am I even here... I can't appreciate anything I do, so why do I even try... I don't even know if begin happy is what I want, but I really crave for peace of mind. I'm stuck in this endless cycle of trying to look for happiness, trying to make connections, trying to be calm, but I fail at each one of them, but I'm still trying.

This feels like something I should be able to text my friends about to get a little support or reassurance but I can't bring myself to do it because I don't feel like we're close enough for me to bother them with my problems...

If this was happening in my teen years, I absolutely would have had friends to turn to. But I'm in my mid twenties now and the friendships I have just aren't the same. I miss feeling like I have an actual connection with someone rather than feeling like we're only friends just so we're able to claim we have friends and not look like total losers in adulthood.

578,KushKenobi,1566588521,6,"I'm 21 and I've been through a few relationships that lasted quite a long time. I know a lot of you post about how much you wish you could find a girl to be with, etc. The truth is, the reason good relationships end is because of getting replaced by someone perceived to be better. Couples get comfortable together, and eventually one person gets the idea they can have things just as they are but with a different person. That is almost always the core reason. 

If that doesn't make you a little more apprehensive about wanting one SO bad, then I don't think much else will help you besides getting into a relationship and getting burned first hand.

For me personally, I didn't care less about what was going to be the end for me and my past lovers, I just wanted the loneness to be gone. One after the other, I let myself get brutally betrayed in the end every time. 

Now, well over a year since my last relationship, my mind is still traumatized and damaged from them, I now have extreme trust issues, I never can see a happy future for myself when sometimes I used to be able to, every night without fail I cry, sometimes I get so angry I smash things till my arms are bleeding and need stitches. 

The world feels more like a lie and even more lonely than it ever did before relationships. I was never this bad before.

I hang out with a couple of friends/colleagues once a month or so. I am not entirely isolated from people that way.

But I feel SO lonely. I hate to admit this since I try very hard to stick to the philosophy of 'not needing a person to make one feel happy' but I want a loving boyfriend so bad. My past relationships were just sad with me getting dumped. I have tried hard to get over those experiences and get on with my life and pursue things I enjoy doing in my professional sphere. But I really really want to have a deep meaningful connection, to share the little things of day-to-day life with someone. To have someone to turn to for comfort after a long day of hard work.

I don't believe/not comfortable with online dating sites or asking out guys at a bar, so there is really not much I can do right now except for suppressing these feelings so that my professional life doesn't get adversely affected.

Any time I have a good conversation with an attractive guy, my mind starts wondering whether they find me attractive/appealing, whether anything could ever work out between us. Honestly, it is so absurd of my mind to do that, it makes me laugh at myself sometimes.

But the underlying emotion stays the same at the end of the day. I want a loving SO to share my life with, I really long to have that kind of a genuine relationship.",lonely,Happy about my goals but also feel incredibly lonely,2019-08-24 03:02:54

Im able to relate so much to another person emotionally ( I bet a lot of you can also) but i never sense a real reciprocation of what i give. Nowadays for me just finding a connection is an impossibility. Maybe I just stopped looking because i know its fruitless. 

My last relationship was 4 years ago. I haven't had a hug, held someones hand, felt another human close to me for 4 years. When i was in that relationship, it only lasted 3 months. 

It was 2 years before that relationship that I was dating someone. But our dynamic was largely loveless, more of a living situation, violent and unfair at times, with me just as much at fault. but we both needed a roof. 

Before that was highschool. I only dated one person in highschool, for 3 years. She never let me touch her, and she cheated on me at the end with someone i considered at least somewhat of a friend. 

I dont have family. My mother died almost 4 years ago and my father is awol, I have no wish to speak with him. I'm not in contact with any extended family, I dont know most of them well enough to reach out too, and i know even fewer of their names. 

I have one best friend that lights up my world. She's the best and i cherish her friendship. But its only her. And although I'm supremely grateful for her presence, I know there's much of life I'm missing out on.

In this post you will find a link to a survey which is a part of this research project.

The questions primarily target people who have felt/feel lonely at work. That said, most people have some kind of relationship to loneliness, especially at work, and even if you don't, you are welcome to fill in the questionnaire. To answer the questions you do however need some experience with being employed (either currently, or previously).

There are no right or wrong answers, so do not worry that your experience or idea of loneliness is incorrect. All input is valuable at this stage of the research project.

The form should take somewhere between 10-30 minutes to complete (more or less depending on how thorough your text answers are. You are encouraged to be as elaborate as possible).

Your participation is completely anonymous.

This link will remain active until the end of 2019. Fee free to share it with others.

597,ThrowawayLove959,1566545952,3,"It's weird. I'm 24M, I was able to get a job as an assistant manager in retail, become part of a video game team, get a car, and move into an apartment with a roommate, yet I have never felt lonelier my entire life. It doesn't help that I have what I feel is crippling social anxiety. I probably don't but whenever I'm in a situation where I meet new people it sure as hell feels like it. 

It's so difficult for me to make friends. I definitely feel like it's my personality. It could be something else. Maybe I've been ugly this whole time but I haven't noticed. I'm nice all the time. I don't like confrontation so you won't catch me trying to instigate issues. I listen to people tell me about there problems or that really cool thing that totally has them psyched. I may not find it interesting but I like it when people radiate happiness. I crack a lot of dad jokes (I'm single) and puns. I get a lot of laughs so they can't be that bad. I play on a video game team. I tried out and me and this other guy were so good that they formed a second team. I moved into an apartment with a friend whom I've known for about 10 years. After all of that, I'm still incredibly lonely. 

I hardly talk to anyone unless it's work related or it's my family checking up on me. I don't really have friends. Well, my roommate used to be my best friend. She has a boyfriend now so she spend all of her time at work or with him. I don't like him that much. He is loud too. Ugh. So I don't talk to anyone really.

I'm struggling with depression again too. I have in the past. It was hard not to be. As weird as it may sound, I almost fell in love with the sadness. It was all I had. Almost like Stockholm Syndrome. I knew I didn't want to stay like that forever. So I tried changing my life. Everything I listed above was what I had done. I got a decent paying job, new car, started a hobby and met some really cool people... But I'm still lonely. I didn't realize it till recently though. 

I also like this girl. She works at my job and I'm in a higher position so that imagine how I felt when I realized things weren't gonna happen if we both worked there. I knew she was single. Another person said so. Actually, a lot of my coworkers seemed to think that she did like me. I even got the vibe on my own. There were issues going on with the store manager. Everyone hated the new manager. IDK why but I felt like that was the time for me to shoot my shot. There was a reason why I didn't make the middle school basketball team. I don't know why my shot missed. I asked her out on a simple date. ""I'm sorry but I can't"". I had a few relationships in the past that didn't work out so well. My last girlfriend cheated on me. So just imagine how afraid I was to even ask why she couldn't. I just didn't want to know so I kind of just moved on and operated like normal. I mean, IT SUCKED. Don't get me wrong, I had talked to her for a while and it did actually hurt but I didn't want to be super depressed again. 

I wanted to take that shot, because I felt like she would have been worth it. If I had her, my life wouldn't absolutely fall apart. I wasn't too concerned about my job. At that point, it would have been a thousand times easier for me to find a job then for me to find someone else that would also like me. I also took the shot because I thought she liked me too. Like I mean LIKE LIKE. I mean, who wouldn't? 

Now a few months later, we still talk. We talk quite a bit at work. I'm not a scientist but OH MY GOD I feel oh so much gravity when we are both there. Honestly, if you set a timer for 5 minutes, I can guarantee you she will eventually make her way to me. Like the way light can't escape a black hole. She will tell me about a rude customer, or maybe some thing she read on the internet, or maybe she did something super embarrassing. We might start talking about her life/childhood or mine. She will tell me about anything and everything. Weird thing though is that maybe about a quarter of the time after she tells me about something embarrassing that she did, she will say something along the line of ""Why do I always tell you these things!"" followed by uncontrollable laughter and a rose red face. 

My brain won't stop telling me that she likes me, but here I am. Still single. No friends to bide the time either. So that is why I feel lonely. Now that I think of it, it sounds more like a story about a broken heart but I would have felt the same way even it she wasn't there. I guess I really just want love.

I've been lonely all my life. I have trouble forming connections with other people. I think it's a trust issue thing.

It feels wrong to experience love. For friends, for family. I instinctively repress feelings of compassion and love. I don't know what's wrong with me. I find it so difficult to love.

I wish I could experience love for even my parents. But it's so difficult to let myself have those feelings.

I've never loved a girl. I know what to say, I can pretend to love her, but I can't actually express love naturally other than through sex. But that's not what counts.

Same goes for my parents.

611,HozayX,1566533276,2,"Howdy,

So after crying for some time, I decided to come here and ask the community. (Also I just need someone to hear me out)

I am not handsome, tall, funny, or have any good traits, and that cursed me from ever having friends. Well, I have two: incredible people that I love to talk for hours, but they're not on all the time to talk. Throughout my life, I have been excluded. Doing so caused me to have social anxiety, became awkward and an introvert. I normally have a rough time to even break the ice! 

I had Math today in college and when I was walking to my seat, someone already took it. The room was already filled, 30 tables, so I stood up in front of the class waiting for the professor to get me a table and I sat in front of the table, alone. When it was time to discuss, everybody in the room talked, oh boy was it loud! Then there was me, alone, in front of the class. I was always a big baby, even though I am a 20 year-old ""man"" (I use quotations because we are told men do not cry), so I was on the brink of tearing up. I held it in. Going back home using Lyft, I realized how lonely I am and how lonely I was throughout the whole day- throughout college (3 years) and throughout my entire life! 

Today, I went to school, alone. I had English, talked because we were obligated (though it felt REALLY good to talk to others) but still left alone. Went on a run, alone. Ate, alone. Laughed, alone. Went to the library, alone. Walked by a bunch of students having fun (today was Spirit week, we have it weekly) and just smiled acknowledging how happy they are. Came back home, alone. 

I'm really bad at making friends and hard to call someone a friend. My two best friends always text me, either it's me who starts or them, but few other people I know don't even text ""how are you?"". I learned something today about myself and that is that it is I who follows others to remain a connection, they don't bother in starting. 

I went to Japan last month with a group as study abroad and keep in touch with a few of them. (We are thinking of going to Japan next year for the Olympics) But what makes me depressed is that NONE of them ever ask about my well-being. Sure we talk and make jokes, but it's not on a daily basis. There was this one guy in particular who I hung out for the majority and I was glad to think we were becoming friends.. until we came back to the states. I would try to make a conversation but he would just leave me on read or reply with a dry text. I bought him a Gundam as well as a present for our friendship, but I forgot to give it to him and now the set is sitting in my bedroom. I thought the people who I laughed with, ate with, walked with, explored with, would become good friends... but I guess not?

No matter where I go, I go alone. My two friends are always busy so I cannot ask them, especially when college semester started. 

In college, I haven't made a single friend. 3 years in there, and 0 zero friends nor acquaintances. 

I always over think situations and think of scenarios that could happen if I stopped and talked to a person. The scenario goes a little bit too deep and I get lonely just by thinking about it. It's not plausible what I think can become reality.

I always think of how lonely my future will be. How I continue eating alone, how I will live alone, and how I will die alone.

I want friends and I feel like I am a weird, awkward, not so easy person to click with. Hell, I don't even know what a normal conversation is. What should I do? College clubs itself won't solve the issue, I tried but it makes me feel worse how everyone around you is smarter than you and you sit there like an idiot alone wishing to go home and cry.",lonely,I Don't Want This Anymore,2019-08-23 14:07:56
612,shaal,1566532645,4,"I am 40f and today 9 years ago my partner took her own life. Since then I've never been able to date or just be with anyone since then or even experience the joy of sex. I just can't move on. 

I have in that time lost all my family and friends to either cancer, suicide or old age. And the burden of being so alone is weighting me down. I now have the no one living in my life. I come home to an empty cold house.

Everyday is a struggle. I am only able to function because I have a decent paying job that give me lots of leawy. i work in an office which is full of women around my age I am just left out of my of the office talk. Because I look angry or upset me at of the time and the other women just don't know how to deal with that. 

I think I've just grown to hard now being alone and not having any real joy in my life for years. So it's not uncommon for me to go days with only saying a few words to people. Trying to engaged in conversation is meet with polite answers and then they wander off.

616,BattlEyeAgentZero,1566530913,2,"I normally wouldn't advertise my life like this but I felt like sharing as simply as I could. I'm 33 and have had only 2 serious relationships. The first one was with a woman I met online in the UK (I'm from the US), things dating online were really good and soon enough I went over to stay with her and her family. Everything was great except when I came back home to get some things and tried to go back. One of the airport immigration officers in the UK were being rude and racist towards me and thus I received a 10-year ban. It was the hardest time of my life waiting 10 years (for the both of us really) unfortunately after my ban was up I found out she was cheating on me just a few weeks ago from finding out.  


You can imagine how that felt so much like a blade piercing through. She basically tossed me away after the fact but all was not lost, I was in pain for a year but then met someone else who wanted my company and friendship so much I felt better and we ended up being together. She only lived a few states away and it seemed like I was working out but to spare myself the agony it ended up being a waste of 5-6 years of her mentally abusing me and mistreating me.  I was that person who couldn't go and end it. I've spent all the money I ever had, sold things to get her things, and worst of all I met all her family even proposed to her and bought her a 2.3k ring and for what? To be abused and left for other people not worth her time.

630,Raizand,1566510291,3,"I had a 2 year relationship in high school with someone I genuinely loved. She cheated and I forgave her. I ended it months later because I eventually realized how incompatible we were. 

Another important thing to note is that there were a lot of outside influences that created a lot of turbulence. Rumors being spread, lies being told. After getting around to my parents, they weren‚Äôt on board with me being with her anymore. After I broke up with her, essentially they were right for the wrong reasons I feel. Everyone involved invaded my privacy in some way.

Looking back on it, she was also abusive. She used to complain about how I look (im on the shorter side and not skinny), how I didn‚Äôt take initiative like a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù, etc. I‚Äôll be honest with you all, since then till now I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough for anyone physically. It‚Äôs strange because I‚Äôm happy with who I am as a person and lately I‚Äôve begun to appreciate myself in some ways I haven‚Äôt before. I don‚Äôt have a problem with my own shortcomings because now it doesn‚Äôt affect me and what I want to actually do with my life. At the end of the day, sometimes you just secretly want someone to compliment you, but it just doesn‚Äôt happen. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone would find me attractive. Its something I‚Äôve accepted.

On top of that, I moved to a more conservative country for education. Dating is common here though not as straightforward. I only have 2 years left here though.

Years later since my first and only relationship, I‚Äôve been completely single. I got over here a few months after ending it but since then till now I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to look for in a woman. I haven‚Äôt hooked up with anyone since then either. I‚Äôd like to but I don‚Äôt see why anyone would be down to with me.

I had a major bout of depression last year after losing a few family members. Some were old and it was time, but others I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. The greed and fighting that happened after is what broke me. It made me feel like this is where I came from and I won‚Äôt ever escape. And going into the field of medicine, it just desensitzes you furthur.

Sometimes I feel it‚Äôs because my only ideas of relationships I‚Äôve ever had (of all kinds) have been either abusive or conditional. It‚Äôs never the relationship itself that ruins me, it‚Äôs what comes after and the repercussions of what happpened that makes you lose your trust in everybody.

I‚Äôve found people physically attractive but thinking about the fear of being disrespected always prevents me from even trying. And on top of that, there usually is a huge red flag that makes me walk away. I‚Äôd say its one positive I‚Äôve taken from all this but it‚Äôs left my life constantly empty.

Not that I want to completely change, but I just feel like during high school I was boxed in and limited by the way people saw me. I never took risks, I did everything right, I got straight A‚Äôs, but even though I was successful, compared to everyone else I was never super exceptional in anything. 

Perhaps the most stressful was the feeling all of high school was the feeling that I could never be anything sexual or have romantic feelings even though I yearned so badly for it. I just... feel like I wasn‚Äôt allowed to because no one saw me as someone who wanted a relationship or was worthy of one. The truth is, I want love just as much as anyone else, but I was always fucking terrified to express it and be belittled for it. I feel like I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be girly even though really the only person limiting myself was me. I rarely even fucking talked about anything having to do with my own feelings and attraction towards people, whether it be someone I actually knew or a celebrity. Meanwhile at home I‚Äôd fucking read stupid fucking fanfiction and daydream to fill the void, realize how fucking pathetic it was, cry, listen to music about being lonely, and then repeat in an endless cycle. I never went on a date, kissed anyone, got asked to anything, etc. I know that at the end of the day, the only person responsible for my loneliness is myself. If I really wanted, I could have put myself out there. There‚Äôs so many people in this world, and if I had the courage to actually talk to people I could probably find someone. 

At college, I have the opportunity to actually persue relationships and be the person I want to be. I don‚Äôt know if I can though. I don‚Äôt know how to, and I don‚Äôt know if I can get myself out of the identity and habits that I‚Äôve created. It‚Äôs like a really old ugly sweater.

In addition, I feel like if I do find the courage to put myself out there and talk to people, I‚Äôll just find that no really likes me. I find it hard to imagine anybody ever actually finding me attractive, and if they do I feel like my lack of experience will turn them away.

I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've never had much luck with girls. I had a few sort of casual relationships in my early 20s but they've been few and far between. I have pretty bad depression and anxiety and all sorts of other issues but I won't get into it.

Anyway I've been trying to put myself out there, and honestly I just want something casual. I just want to have sex and mess around. I don't want to settle down, I don't want to start a family or whatever the fuck. Probably not ever. I'm in a pretty good place, I can do my own thing and it would take a lot to make me give that up for a relationship.

So I've been on Tinder and have met a couple of girls outside of Tinder but a common thing I'm noticing is that girls only want a serious relationship with me, and pretty quickly start talking about settling down.

It's depressing because it feels like I'm not physically desirable or something, and that the only reason girls want to be with me is for the financial security and stuff. I hesitate to call it gold digging but it sort of feels like the girls who are interested in me have already slept with a bunch of other guys in their early 20s and now that 30 is approaching their biological clock is ticking louder and they want to settle down and start a family. It feels like I'm not good enough to be the guy they mess around with, but I am good enough to be the guy who pays half of the mortgage on their house in the suburbs.

It's honestly depressing as shit. Settling down is the *last* thing I want to do, but it feels like the only way girls are willing to sleep with me is if I do.",lonely,Now that I'm in my late 20s and pretty stable it feels like girls just want to settle for me...,2019-08-22 10:17:45

697,The_Lone_Musician,1566425796,1,"My father is a loser through and through. He quits jobs weeks if not days after getting them, lives with his dying father of 76 years, mooches off of him by using his debit card for almost everything he buys, and that's not even scratching the surface. (If you want to skip an explanation of how terrible my father is and simply hear of what he did today l, just skip the wall of text below and go to the next paragraph.)

The man is a semi-unpredictable, unintellectual (though he thinks he's smarter than most), nearly nonnegotiable, and belligerent manchild of a father. I gaurentee that he at least played a significant role in giving me the anxiety issues I have today. He's been a scumbag since I was little. ""Borrowing"" me and my brothers' (I have three older brothers) birthday/holiday money, hitting my second oldest brother, almost never holding down a job, always being impatient and mean with us. I remember one instance where my third oldest brother, Ethan, had been bickering with my father almost all day (for reasons I'm sure a little kid couldn't start up.) At one point, when we were at my mother's house when we were about to leave, he ran into my mother's car to get away from him, then sticking his tongue out at him. Very juvenile and petty, as to be expected from a kid, that is easily ignored. So, how do you think he handled it? Did he ignore it? Did he scold him later on? No. This nearly middle-aged (at the time) got out of the car and sped walked over to my mom's car, opened the door, dragged my brother out and proceeded to spank him. And I don't believe it was as light as regular parents may spank their kids. That's just one of many examples from my childhood. I've probably subconsciously repressed a lot of them. It'd explain why I can't remember a lot from my childhood.

He's been especially worse over the past few years. Today, while I was talking to my brother Ethan on the phone (because he is in Germany on vacation currently), my dad was messaging me about when to pick me up from my mother's, since I had mentioned that I was ready to go whenever. I didn't get to answer his texts because I was in a call, and I didn't answer his phone calls because I didn't want to miss the chance to talk to my brother. After I hurriedly finished my conversation with my brother, I rushed to call my father, anxiety washing over me like a Tsunami. He was super ticked off. I could tell from the texts. He asked where I was, followed by him saying he was ""getting pissed off"", followed by him spamming my phone with gumbled up text messages to try and get my attention. I then called him back. I could tell he wasn't happy. While my grandfather drove us to Mighty Taco (a fast food place) because he wanted to get me a meal, he took just a second or two more to turn a corner. My dad then promptly said ""Are you going to turn already?"" in a rude way. To this, my grandpa pulled over and said ""Do you want to drive the car then?"" I could tell the had been at it for a while, since my grandpa can usually ignore his shit. They argued shortly, then we drove to the restaurant. Upon waiting for my food, whilst my grandpa waited in the car, my dad said ""I really gotta get away from my father."" and shit about how they butt heads all the time, even though it's his fault. Then upon me not responding, because I genuinely didn't know what to say, he said ""Are you gonna say anything?"", to which I replied with ""I don't know what to say!"". He then said ""Alright then"" angrily and stormed out of the restaurant as I waited. Upon getting home, we were walking upstairs (since it's a two story apartment of which we own both floors), and my dog barked. This pissed him off even more, so as he walked in, he fucking kicked my poor dog in the face like she was a soda can on the ground. Though a lot harder than that. I get irritated by my dog too, since she's young and doesn't listen well yet, but I only ever give her a little bop on the nose or something. He always takes it too far. I'm so, so fucking sick of him. I wish I had a normal father. One that actually treated me like a son, and that had integrity, and kept a goddamn job. Instead, my father is a pot-smoking bum that does nothing but mooch off of people and bite the very hands that feed him. I really just wish I had a normal family and didn't have to always feel anxious.

Sorry for this long, most likely grammatically jumbled and messy post. I gaurentee you I left some stuff out. I doubt this does a justice to explain how terrible he is, but I just really had to vent.

719,pastelhunie,1566392573,2,"My name is Lys, I'm in my junior year of college, and over the past summer, I've cut off every friend I've ever made since 7th grade. I've had great experiences, laughs, and memories with all of them, but those individual good times couldn't cover up all of the peer pressure, emotional insecurity and turmoil, and inferiority I began to feel every time I was around them. One of them did awful things to me under the roof we shared, one of them hadn't done anything but support me, one of them was among the most toxic influences in my life since middle school, but she had no idea. It made no difference though, after I deleted my social media (which I'd only made to keep up with them) and started blocking and deleting phone numbers, I went on a rampage and all my past micro-issues flared up at once as pain and anger. And now I'm all alone. My mom, brother, and cat are all hours away, and have lives to live without my issues clogging them up. I don't have the heart to meet new people knowing they'll likely be caught in this loop in another 5 years. So now I bide my time trying to remember just how I got by as without them; repeatedly cleaning my room, checking out tens of library books and breezing through them in days, reading my textbooks until I fall asleep at my desk, watching TV shows I've got no interest in, gorging myself on healthy food and going to the gym with stomach aches right after. And in the end it still all does nothing.

720,mninp,1566391399,9,"Recently my girl left me. She was the woman of my dreams. Now I feel like I have no one. Im lost. Now I‚Äôm back to surfing the web all the time and watching tv, I spent the last three years revolving my life around her and now that she‚Äôs gone I feel so lost. A lot of thinking has led me to the conclusion that we spend way too much time on our phones, on social media, watching tv, etc. We‚Äôre not living. We‚Äôre not in touch with our nature selves anymore. And over half the people in the world are either lonely or depressed. I want to get a group going.  Whether you‚Äôre depressed because of a relationship, or you haven‚Äôt had human contact in years, and everything in between, let‚Äôs get something going. Let‚Äôs meet up, maybe start a project or go do volunteer services. I want to form a group. It starts with two people, and maybe eventually we could save lives and extend even beyond Long Island. In our group, no one gets left behind. I‚Äôm thinking big with this one guys. If you feel stuck, depressed, anxious, lazy, or lonely and you want to do something to start making a change, let‚Äôs start right here. Regardless of gender, race, etc, everybody is welcome. If you feel like you don‚Äôt have a place, you‚Äôre welcome here. Let me go over some of what I want to achieve.

- A support group for anyone that is lonely, depressed, anxious, isolated, or has no one

- Come up with actual plans to get each person to a better place in life, whether it‚Äôs to stop drinking, or get a job, or build confidence, etc, anything you can think of

- Group projects that could involve volunteer work and other stuff (we‚Äôll come up with it as a group)

- A weekly log for people to document their changes

- Weekly ‚Äúmissions‚Äù like doing something nice for somebody or reconnecting with a family member or apologizing to somebody you wronged or don‚Äôt use social media for the full week, etc

- Embracing more of the Stoic lifestyle. If you don‚Äôt know much about Stoicism then research it a bit, it‚Äôs great stuff. There‚Äôs even a subreddit on here for it

Remember, YOU have the power within you to succeed. When you‚Äôre on your death bed, will you be happy about your life? The change starts NOW. Who gives a shit what others think. Become the change you want to be, the change you fantasize about in your mind. BECOME that, the ideal you. It starts here. Your true powerful potential is just waiting to be unleashed.

Let‚Äôs change the world one step at a time. Right now I‚Äôm looking for FIVE people to get an in-person meetup going. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with meetups or you think five people is too much, then we can talk on here in this topic. I‚Äôm not in any rush to get a meetup going asap.

Btw i do have experience in helping people. I was a volunteer Long Island Crisis Counselor for about 6 months. We used to get hundreds of calls per night. I know you‚Äôre out there.

If you‚Äôre not from Long Island, THAT‚ÄôS OK. You can be a part of the group on here, you just you can‚Äôt come to the meets unless you can travel. Everyone that joins I will write their Reddit name in a log book, and if you‚Äôre comfortable I‚Äôll put your real name. Remember guys, I‚Äôm thinking HUGE with this one. It starts with this post. Let‚Äôs see if we can change the world. And even if we don‚Äôt, helping just that one person makes a difference.

Comment right here if you‚Äôre interested. Tell us  a little bit about what you‚Äôre trying to change in your life if you feel comfortable.",lonely,"Everyone from Long Island that is feeling depressed or lonely, let‚Äôs get a group going",2019-08-21 22:43:19

    Ok first I know this is not the appopriate group to talk about this kind of topic but the community here is so kind. 

    So I have this friend that I had a fight 3 years ago,we are a quite bestfriend because we share the same intrest that no one else does in litterally the school so we always talk with each other,so it begin when we had a small fight, I teased him and *accidently* push him to the wall resulting his lips to peel and bleed a little, and suddenly he just got mad.

   I forgot to mention that we are still teenagers. So after that, he is talking with our friend and I try to join them bit suddenly rejected by him, he yell at me by saying 'can you please shut up', )it is more brutal in my language) and I got seriously pissed so I go somewhere else,since that he never talk to me whenever I greet him so then I do the same.

   Fast forward, 1 year had passed,it is 1 Jan of 2017 and I think it is the best time to finally talk to him,but he still kept his ego and he just keeping the same attitude like he is not affected by not being friend for 1 year. I again pissed off by this and continue doing what I did for last year.

   So as you can guess for the last 2 years 2017,18 and present ,it is march an I still havent talk to him and eventually I join a camp with him and we share the same dorm,I realise something over this years, he got more lonely and lonely. I pitty him and try to start a conversation,a small one atleast, and to my suprise he reply me, eventho it is just yes and yeah but it fine, a new achivement for building our friendship back. Three month passed and things get like normal ( we didnt talk) 

And then suddelny this day, his friend bump with me an we had a little talk and she say that he missed me and wanted we to talk again. I guess he has this feeling because he didnt have much friend and he is kind of 'not good at talking and confronting' kind so that is what holding him back from apologizing to me.

  So guys, please help me by giving me advice on how to start back our friendship. You guys helps is really neded for me. Thanks in advance for who help me.

 TLDR; I had a small fight unrational with my bestfriend and then he got too emotional about that and deciding to stay away from me for 3 years, today his friend said to me that he missed me, I need advice on how to build our friendship back.",lonely,I haven't talk to someone for 3 years and he tell his friend that he miss me,2019-08-21 20:17:50

736,JasonRedux,1566372341,1,"Lack of commitment

When you‚Äôre young, in love, and in a relationship, you find new ways every now and then to make your partner feel special. You never miss a chance to tell your other half how much they mean to you. You feel grateful to have them in your life and you‚Äôd do anything to keep them with you.

On the other hand, when you‚Äôre married, you start taking your partner for granted. You don‚Äôt appreciate them as much as you used to before and slowly, you start bridging a gap between the 2 of you.

You were overly affectionate in the beginning.

According to a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, couples who are overly affectionate during the beginning of their relationships are more likely to get divorced after getting married. When you display constant affection toward your spouse all the time, to the point that your ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù don‚Äôt even surprise them anymore, things start to get a little boring after marriage.

This not only makes your partner feel that there‚Äôs nothing exciting left to do in your relationship, but it also puts you under immense pressure. In fact, you start feeling that your efforts are going unnoticed and not being received properly. You then start to feel less desirable.

It wasn‚Äôt really ‚Äúlove‚Äù.

The worst mistake we all make is confusing love with infatuation. People in long-term relationships confuse being in love with being comfortable around a person and that‚Äôs where they go wrong. It‚Äôs usually after they get married that they realize they weren‚Äôt really in love.

Being in love with somebody and being fond of them are 2 entirely different things! But by the time couples realize this, it‚Äôs often too late.

Your needs have changed.

People change with time and so do their needs! Recently, celebrity power-couple Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, who have been dating for years, got divorced only a few months after getting married. Wondering why this happened? It‚Äôs because their priorities changed. In a public statement, the couple‚Äôs rep revealed that the 2 have agreed to separate as they wish to grow, and want to focus on themselves and their careers.

Change is inevitable and it comes with time. You can either grow and move forward with your partner or you can simply focus on yourself and your goals first. Marriage is beautiful but it also requires a high level of commitment, patience, and love which is the reason why after getting married, people start to feel burdened by the responsibility and prefer to be on their own to focus on their individual goals.

You just wanted to get settled.

Getting married for any reason other than love is just not going to work out. Marrying a person who you‚Äôve dated for a long time simply because you don‚Äôt wish to go out there and do it all over again should never be a reason to get married. By doing this, you will simply waste your time and your partners. The marriage will soon fall apart due to a lack of love in the relationship.

Everybody wishes to settle down one day but you shouldn‚Äôt let peer pressure or any kind of societal expectations get the best of you. Marriage is like a bicycle that needs 2 equally dedicated tires to climb up the journey called life. If you or your longtime partner feel that you are not ready to take the next step, listen to your gut!

You discovered a new side of your partner.

Being in a long-term relationship doesn‚Äôt mean you know everything about your partner. When you get married and start to live together, juggling through life every day, you‚Äôll discover new things about your lover ‚Äî some interesting and some ‚Äúbad‚Äù.

Disloyalty, dishonesty, money issues, insecurities, and over-possessiveness are some of the major red flags people discover in their relationships after getting married which often leads to their separation.

You didn‚Äôt ‚Äúclick‚Äù like you thought you would.

Most of us have unrealistic expectations when it comes to relationships and marriage. The image of the ‚Äôperfect happy life‚Äô pops up in our heads thanks to having been brainwashed by movies and it‚Äôs not even close to reality. Your partner is not going to complete your sentences or memorize everything you like. Not every day is going to be full of sunshine. There will be times where your partner feels a little off and days when you need your space. Marriages work on mutual understanding.

Couples who rush into getting married without giving it deep thought, thinking that everything will work out because they have known each other for so long, end up divorcing each other after only a few months because they‚Äôre likely not mentally ready for the responsibilities that come with the entire package. They feel disappointed when reality hits them and overwhelmed by the commitment marriage requires to function correctly.

If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

764,xLonesomeThrowawayx,1566345735,4,"I honestly just wanna vent. This is a throwaway account because it feels more comfortable this way.

Ok so...
I'm the type of person who tries to be there for others. I'm awkward and shy in person (I try, I'm just not as good at it) but through text, I honestly 100% try and I feel like I do great. I've been there for so many people through the years. I've heard their stories, cried with them, felt their pain... even tried my best to help them fight through it even though I knew it wasn't my battle.

I've gone through my own motions as well. I have my own ups and downs and ocassionally, if I'm feeling comfortable enough with a person, I'll let it out. It feels good in that moment but later down the line... I feel so distant, even from myself. I know we can only be there for each other so much without being one another and beating each other's pain but... I don't know. I just feel so alone.

I met this person who gave me hope. But I got scared and I fumbled. I apologized but I don't think it's ever gonna be enough. It wasn't anything terrible... we weren't officially anything. We tried having that talk but honestly... they don't want me. They want to want me. I know it and it makes me so sad.

They're not over a past situation. I can only be there at a distance and it really sucks. It's like looking in a window and seeing everything you want... but you can't get in. I know I should just give up. Try to find whatever it is I want or need. I'm scared to because then that means they're just going to go find someone else and I have so so much to offer, I just wish they could see that. They say they do but like... there's too many mixed signals.

It makes me feel so inadequate and just not good enough. I know they're struggling right now and I am trying really hard to be a friend. But honestly... it's tough. It's hard to manage all of these emotions. It looks pretty good one day then just so cold the next. They reassure me and give me that hope again... and again it gets pulled away.

I don't want to lose this person. We've been decent friends, something I haven't had in a long time. But I won't lie, I'm emotionally tired. And I'm lonely.

I cry myself to sleep sometimes. Sometimes I stare at a wall and wish it was someone staring back at me. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I wake up alone. Day in, day out. I love with family but even so, I'm still alone. That's one of the worst feelings I've ever felt. Feeling alone in the company of people you love. It's like they can't really see me and that makes me question if maybe they choose not to see me. So then that makes me get even more down... the cycle repeats. Over and over again.

It's just so exhausting. I want someone to be here, I want someone to see me and actually care. Everytime I think I've found that and everytime I try hard to let it in... it's never enough. I'm tired of goodbyes. I'm tired of losing out each and every time. I'm not perfect, I know that. But I also know that I'm not a terrible person. Sometimes I feel like people use me because they know I'm good hearted then run off to play house or whatever with someone else, simply because that person is more attractive or funnier or has one small thing more to offer than I do.

It makes me feel so bad and I'm left questioning every little thing that's wrong with me. And I'm tired of waiting for someone to come and stay... especially if that means I've gotta go through this so many more times. I hate it. It makes me wanna turn into a cold hearted bitch but that ain't me and I know the world doesn't need more of that.


Everyone matter. Every single human being breathing right now, with a pulse, with a heartbeat... they matter. I can't pretend they don't just to spare my own feelings. Sometimes I wish I could... but I just can't. So, I'm left with this big heart that keeps getting shut down and out, keeps getting pushed away.

If you actually read all of this, thanks. That means a lot to me. I apologize that it's so long but I just needed to get this out and off my chest. Thank you.",lonely,"Here, but not here.",2019-08-21 10:02:15

793,_e-bone_,1566292096,1,"I know that not a single soul will read this, I know that no one ever cares about my thoughts, but here goes my inner monologue:

It's 4 am. It's not that I can't sleep, I just don't want to. I feel really sad and crappy, there's garbage all over my bed and I suddenly got a flu and I'm willingly sleep depriving myself just to add to the awful feelings.
Yesterday was my first day of let's say University (It's only three days a week and very few hours a day and it only lasts one year so it doesn't really feel like University, but I guess it is.) The class was just starting when I got a sudden realization that I miss my high school friends so much and I almost couldn't contain the tears. We were a large group and we called ourselves a family. People always say that high school friendships last forever, but now that everyone is going to a different school, I know that very shortly I'll stop seeing most of them, I mean, one of them hasn't said a word in our chat group since graduation and he's also an introvert, so he won't leave his house to attend to the rare occasions when we reunite.
It's the hardest thing for me to make friends, I've been told before that I'm very selective with people and I also find it hard to open myself unless I get really close to someone or (in this case) I don't know them at all (I don't even trust my secrets to my mother, we have a very broken relationship) I've been going to music classes for over a year now and it still feels as akward as the first day. Nobody there really knows me and I don't feel like a talk with them would go well at all, and I know it's gonna be exactly the same with the one I just started yesterday.
I don't think I've had a best friend for the past six years and Ive never been in a relationship because I always screw it up. No one ever puts me first. Everyone around me has their ""bestie"" or ""favorites"" or ""one and only"" but I've never been that for anyone. The one who I considered my best friend had someone else in that position and she made sure to show it and I think I might have hurt her or something, or maybe she was just waiting for the moment to throw me away because she doesn't talk to me anymore and she doesn't care when I express that I'm feeling like crap, plus, the last semester of high school, she sort of started talking more with a different person and pushing me away. Our friendship might have been a little toxic, I know I treated her bad too, but I had gotten really attached to her and sometimes it seemed like a real, long-term friendship.
A couple different people from that group started caring more about me, but I have (amongst many) this problem that just makes me want to be alone and push everyone who gets close to me away or move to someone else and I also feel like I might overwhelm people with my problems or my personality, so these past weeks I haven't really been talking to those two either. (I know I suck as a human, I'm sorry)
I plan to study for another career in a more formal University after I finish the current one, and since the new one lasts longer, there is a slightly bigger chance that I'll make new friends (but there's also the possibility that I'll be alone for the rest of my life.) In the meantime, It's gonna be a long, sad year.
I get these kinds of episodes when I don't talk about my problems to a trusted one or when I've been spending too long inside my house without going out or going only to school and back home: the emotions gather up and the weight of my whole problematic life crumbles upon me. I get really stressed and angry and sad and I just want to yell and cry my eyes out when I am home alone. It feels like dying but I guess that taking it all out helps. Sometimes I write to help me cope, but I hate that I have to get to my lowest and be on my worst for my best ideas to flow (even though writing those emotions out really helps). I haven't written for about six months but I'm pretty sure it's coming back.
When I was a kid I didn't care about all the superficial crap and I enjoyed loneliness more that anything (I still appreciate it, but it's been taking a toll on me) I was very active and actually an extrovert, I used to be the one to make sure that the lonely or ""weird"" kids wouldn't be alone, being one myself.

My parents isolated me from a pretty young age and I grew up with trust issues and paranoia. That, plus social anxiety, gives me a real hard time talking to people and feeling close. I‚Äôm good at making friends, but I cannot for the life of me carry on a conversation about myself or how lonely I am. So I‚Äôve got this... superficial relationship with all my friends, where I‚Äôm just there on the surface, but I don‚Äôt have anyone that I feel truly cares about me and actually enjoys me being there.

5 years of this and nothing‚Äôs changed. I‚Äôm majorly depressed mostly because of this horrible loneliness, and it‚Äôs not even getting any better. I‚Äôm about to head off to college across the country and I know nobody and god, talk about loneliness when you have to restart and you‚Äôre not sure if anyone even likes you.

And the thing is, I hate being lonely, but each time someone asks me out or starts to show interest in me I shut it down real quick because I‚Äôm just so afraid. It‚Äôs like I want this to happen.

820,hamartiated,1566266811,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Just find myself constantly by myself , lonely, and more often then not turning to moderate drinking. My brother lives a hour away..and our relationship is strained. Baby sister moved from away but is settling 3 hours away. I work at different work sites, with a schedule all over the place..

I just don't know what to do to break out of this. Trying to force myself to excerise but..thats a pretty solo time (weights /jogging)

Tinder/Bumble results in an occasional date but otherwise.. bust.

Tried looking up social groups...not much in the area.

843,justathrowaway1923,1566237532,6,"So, as a bit of back story I‚Äôve struggled with school my entire life. I had an extremely traumatic experience as a toddler in preschool, got bullied throughout elementary up until 7th grade. 
My mom found this school, it was a Sudbury school and the concept is basically that you don‚Äôt HAVE to do anything, you just study what you want when you want and how you want. And if you need help, you ask staff. 
Anyways, this was a game changer for me. 

The first time I arrived there, I was so mind blown. As soon as we stepped everybody was so welcoming, and the person who I‚Äôll call James who became my best friend walked up to me, smiled and told me how cool my makeup looked. We quickly became close, and he was friends with this guy who I‚Äôll call Mark. 

Me, James, and Mark were a trio of best friends and we used to spend all day exploring the forest and going downtown. It was literally the best time of my life. But this is where it gets fucked up.

The school had planned a camping trip, and we were all excited. We packed our things, and drove into the mountains. The first two days were fine, then the third night happened.
I remember laying there, next to a friend I‚Äôll call Jack and then Mark and James were on the other side. 
Jack was fast asleep, and I was trying to but I was reminiscing on the day. That suddenly got interrupted when I heard whispering. 

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù
‚ÄúWarming my hands, haha‚Äù
‚ÄúWith my thighs???‚Äù 
‚ÄúI mean yeah, why not‚Äù

So I heard this and I was decently weirded out by the fact that Mark had been harassing James like that. So eventually I hear James go ‚ÄúPlease stop, I need to talk to you about this in the bathroom‚Äù then I hear mark angrily shrug and agree.

They got out of the tent, and because of the lack of noise I finally dozed off. But then what James told me what happened in the bathroom the next day horrified me. 

James said that when they went in, he was going to try to tell Mark he really wasn‚Äôt into him and really didn‚Äôt like what he was doing. But Mark got mad, and forced himself into James. 

We were terrified. I can‚Äôt imagine how James felt but the fact that everything had just been changed, flipped, set alight. It hurt. 

After this we tried reporting it to the head of the school. It was ignored. Due to that, we just gave up and avoided Mark. It wasn‚Äôt until he did it to two other people that they did something.

The entire friend group grew apart, me and James grew closer. 
Then I suggested ‚ÄúHey! What if we do drugs‚Äù. And in about two months we were full blown alcoholics, and we would ditch school to go on benders. Or sometimes even just leave in the middle of the day because we needed a fix and didn‚Äôt come back.  

It just got worse and worse, we stopped going to school altogether, we stopped talking to our old friends, we were practically homeless. And then eventually we started arguing with each other.

We then decided that we shouldn‚Äôt be friends anymore. 
And now here I am, alone, dropped out of school and drunk as fuck every day.

I‚Äôll never forget when he complimented my makeup, and I‚Äôll never forget how good it was to finally have people.",lonely,"I made friends for the first time in my life, and then it all went downhill after one night.",2019-08-20 03:58:52

So today I actually got to talk to 2 people! One person is a lot to me, but two!! 
First interaction was when I just finished doing an exercise, one very fit girl/woman came up to tell me that I was doing it the wrong way. Even tho I knew what I was doing and it was supposed to be different,  I took her advice and let her show me the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to do it.
Another interaction was when I noticed that another girl/woman was lifting pretty impresive weights I asked her if she was powerlifting and going to competitions. The convo was REALLY awkward to me, because Iam not used to talk to people at all and I kinda noticed that I made her feel a little awkward too during the convo, but hey, when we ended the convo she was smiling and when she went to talk to her bf and *mother*(im not sure if that was her mother but there was an older woman together with her and her bf) she was smiling a lot, I hope that she took my comment on her strength as a compliment :)

I told someone who i can only show my weakness to. I told him, how i actually feel. He did not get me. I was misunderstood. He responded negatively. So it added as well to my burden.

I was told off. And i was given a solution to my problem. A solution that i actually do not need. I explained. But I felt like we were just both having one t something that will make me feel im not alone.

877,pugnayshuss,1566183450,9,"My husband is a good guy, but his priorities are kids, then work, then me - and the first two take up most of his energy.  His job forces him to be more outgoing than he would really choose to be, so when he gets home he's just sort of done with talking for the sake of talking.

I don't have many adult friends my age.  They've moved away and we don't stay in touch, or their lives went different directions and we don't stay in touch.  I have some neighbors and moms at the school I'm friendly with, but that's about it.

I stopped therapy for the summer because my kids are out of school so it just wasn't logistically possible to keep going, and I feel like it made me start spiraling down to lose this person (for a few months) that I get to talk to who's ""interested"" in what I have to say.

I feel like it's such a burden for my husband to have to be my only constant point of adult contact.  And I also know I can be draining to be around.  Too critical, too quick tempered, too low a threshold for discomfort/change/surprises.

I just miss going to work.  I was well liked.  People cared about what I said and thought I was funny.  I don't miss the work really, just the people.  

I feel like such an AH for being lonely and depressed when I have an otherwise good life.

So I'm [20/f] a really lonely person and I think about why this is a lot and it seems to me like I literally push away every single person in my life no matter who they are.

I've always had social anxiety and been shy every since I can remember but I had friends when I was younger. In middle school I stopped talking to all of them for seemingly no reason. I even switched schools in 8th grade. At that school I made only 1 friend even though other people tried to be friends with me. I'm still friends with this girl to this day even tho its been 6-7 years and I feel myself pushing her away these past few weeks like not returning texts or calls, I was even supposed to visit her and didn't.

I had this other girl I was friends with and she blocked me because I was being distant and I just let her go and we're not friends anymore.


The first two years of high school I was homeschooled, maybe I subconsciously wanted to be in an isolated environment? The last two years I went to public school and made friends with this one girl who was also friendless but I'm not sure if it even classifies as friendship.

After high school I lived with my cousins for 5 months. I was literally LIVING with them and I didn't form any sort of connection. It's not that I don't like them I would have loved to be friends and form a bond but something in me blocks me from doing so.

I had this one guy try to date me and I ghosted him after a few dates.

Then another guy came along and I was starting to fall hard for him and then I broke up with him through text out of the blue which now I regret but I feel like I kind of damaged the relationship and it wont be the same.

Even my family. I live with them but I don't talk to them. I don't tell them about my life, my hopes and dreams, I don't bring my problems to them or ask them for help. I just keep everything inside. This guy that I almost dated was really trying to get to know me and I just didn't want to open up to him. I remember thinking to myself ""I don't want you to know me.""


Wtf is wrong with me? Being this alone causes me a lot of depression and its been getting worse lately. I'm scared that if this gets worse its gonna get really hard for me to go on and I just wanna be ok and be a good person and live a good life.

Any advice is really appreciated! :)

I got Klinefelter syndrome I believe(I tick all boxes). Believe no one will love me. Don't like body contact and always aware of who's around me. Distanced myself from a girl I tried to pursue thus resulting in me being ignored by her due to my lack of self esteem.

My Little Brother has a girlfriend and is living his highschool life great compared to mine which was just me being a shy kid while he's going outside with his friends arranging things. Makes me feel really shit about myself especially when my mum speaks with our Family back in our home country about how awesome my little brother is and how fat and introverted I am. Im proud of my brother tho.

Am I depressed?? I don't know, I've always seen myself immune to that. 

Kinda not well in school because I'm lazy and my self destructive behaviour.

Klinefelter syndrome makes me develop less muscles, don't want to get it checked by a doctor because it means I have to tell my parents and it might disappoint them. Discourages me from exercising. My acne scars is fucked. I'm fat.

Only reason I have friends is my jokes and humour. I don't interact with girls very well and girls out right call me ugly in my face sometimes.

It sucks. My life sucks. 1 in 5000 people and I was chosen. I sometimes think of suicide or scenarios where my life would end and feel a sense of relief which worries me.

I‚Äôm a 22 year old female from a small town that is near a city. I have a small handful of friends, but I don‚Äôt have much in common with them other than the fact that we‚Äôve known each other for years. I love and appreciate them dearly, but a lot of the times I feel empty because I don‚Äôt have anyone to share my interests with or do things I would enjoy with. 

Out of the minimum friends I have, all of them have boyfriends. I am really interested in music and going to gigs, but I never have anyone to go with. I am interested in books, but have no one to share books with or talk about them with. I love films, but have no one to go to the cinema with or even watch a film at home with. Sometimes I will go to the cinema myself, I don‚Äôt hate it but it gets lonely. 

I would love to just have friends to go out with to a cool bar/restaurant with after work or to see a band, and make impulsive fun plans with on a Friday night, but there‚Äôs no one in my life I can do that with. All my plans with my friends have to be arranged months in advance. They don‚Äôt want to go out exploring because they spend the majority of their time with their boyfriends, and even if they go out it‚Äôs to gay bars where I can‚Äôt meet or talk to guys, or places that just aren‚Äôt my scene. I‚Äôm so young and I‚Äôm tired of spending so much time alone. 

It‚Äôs been like this for years that I‚Äôve ended up in relationships with people that aren‚Äôt right for me, just because I‚Äôm lonely. If I had a larger social circle with friends with similar interests I wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to even date, because I would have people to spend my time with.

It‚Äôs a weird place to be in. I‚Äôm starting university soon and I will hopefully meet new people there, but I just want at least one friend that wants to do the same things as me. 

After crying all day due to the loneliness I took a step today and admitted that things need to change, and joined an app for meeting new friends. This is something I felt too embarrassed to do before, but I can‚Äôt continue feeling so lonely. Hopefully I will find someone in the same predicament as me, that I can just have fun with. 

I even reached out to some old friends today and asked if they would like to go to the cinema, and made an Instagram account to hopefully meet new people that share common interests on there too.

Okay so ya know how when you‚Äôre going to sleep at night you imagine cuddling with a girl/boy because you just feel so alone under the shade of darkness and quiet that comes with nighttime?

Okay that may be oddly specific but keep reading because it‚Äôs about to get even more specific.

This may or may not be important, but if you dream every stranger you see is a face you‚Äôve seen in real life. I.e. you can‚Äôt just generate new faces with your brain for dreams. You‚Äôre about to see where I‚Äôm going with this so hold tight.

The same way you can simulate feeling hugged by wrapping your arms around yourself and remembering the last time you felt their skin touch yours. By the same principle, you can simulate sex in dreams the same way.

Not because you‚Äôre not a virgin, but because masturbation is a thing that exists and you‚Äôve definitely done it before because at some point humans develop a sexuality need.

So using the experience of hugs and masturbation and other information your brain has gathered, it can piece together a sort of simulation of what it‚Äôd feel like to cuddle or have intercourse with another person and play that out in your dreams.

This is great and all, *until you try to kiss them*.

That‚Äôs right.

You can imagine it. You can play out the moments just before it happens. The buildup. Those quick looks from their eyes to their lips and back. Slowly getting closer to each other; hell, even the slow breaths on your lips because you‚Äôve definitely seen that happen in a movie or show somewhere.

But the moment it happens:

¬≠

¬≠

¬≠

¬≠

¬≠

¬≠
         
‚Ä¶nothing.   


¬≠
It‚Äôs impossible for you to kiss them.

Because you don‚Äôt know what it feels like.    
Your brain has never registered what such an experience feels like.

And sure, you could try it out with your hand, but unlike hugs and touching yourself, kisses can‚Äôt be simulated, even ones with no tongue.

You can‚Äôt feel it because to your brain which is you controlling the body you use to travel in this world such a feeling literally *does not exist*.

This is sad.

Her mother is dissolving our family and not me. I was willing to do anything to try and make her love me again. I have not had a single physical touch or affection in 6 months from her. I'm so lonely. Last night I told her what she was doing to me was unfair and I didn't deserve this. That's when she told me she wanted a divorce.  How can I glue my heart back together and go on? Part of me just wants to end my life to escape the constant pain, but the only reason I dont is my unconditional love for my children. It seems so selfish to put them through anymore pain than what they will go through in the divorce.  I am just kind of venting here so thanks for listening.

None of my friend text me and I think my mom worry about the situation that she call me three time a day just to talk to me. I know thats sweet of her but I didnt really like it because our conversation just consist of her demand me to change myself, how I could be thinner, how I should worked hard secure permenant job instead, basically how Im not enough which she always remind me. I try to hold it in for awhile until yesterday I ordered food delivery. The delivering girl hold my hand while passing the food. Then it hit me. I cried for a long time. Wonders whats wrong with me. I never hug my parent and I only give friendly hug to my friend only when they initiate it, even then its feels awkward to me. But at that time I just want someone to hold me which I never know how its feel. I do have friend, best friend and family. Its just I always the toughest one. I really want to be weak once, cry.

I don't have a lot of friends, and the ones I do have I don't get to see very often. I've never been good with social interaction, most people think I'm the quiet shy type until  we interact long enough (which is when my filter is taken off and I become a rambling chatterbox about whatever subject we both like). 

Of course the various people I've known growing up are the ones to make the comments. Not so much my family but their friends who have watched me grow up. Their comments follow along the lines of ""so have you found a boy yet?"" 

Whenever I say no they follow up with, ""weeell you've got time."" 



You see I'm a woman in her early 20's who still looks like a child (Hence my name on here). I'm very short, with a high pitched voice, and dress comfortable (usually with a shirt displaying a show/book like am a fan of).
Because of this, even if I were more outgoing, no one would approach me in a romantic way.

It doesn't help that the idea of being with someone romantically terrifies me. I do want to find someone but I grew up seeing too many relationships go bad ( in both the general bad break up way and abusive. Not with my own parents but close family members and my friends themselves). 

These past few weeks have been rough on me already due to multiple family health scares, one of my closest friends becoming distant, and failing very important exams by a few points. Then I get the comments about my lack of a love life as the big cherry on the top of my depression sundae.

I now live out the back of my parents, because of the breakup until I can get some cash together to get out again. I have my parents and sister here but the family is pretty fractured due to my dad's alcoholism. Everyone does there own thing. I don't even feel like discussing my life with my family because I'm not proud of where I am at the moment.

The second part that strikes me now is that all of my lifelong friends, as of the past 2 years, are all married off and now having kids. I may get the occasional call on the weekend to fill their void of loneliness, when their wife and kid are off doing something else. It makes me want to sever ties with them because I feel like I'm becoming the void filler and coming in at second best. 

The relationship I just came out of was the first proper relationship Ive had in my life, I'm 32, and searching through tinder, dating sites etc the dating scene is very thin. It scares me that I will be alone forever, or that I will jump at the first opportunity to be with someone to not be alone.

But I saw a video of my classmates hanging out with each other on snapchat today. And it instantly tore my heart apart, I could literally feel the pain in my heart. I instantly started tearing up. 

School starts in about a week and I started thinking about how I don‚Äôt have friends and how I‚Äôm going to be alone for the entirety of high school. 

I never had friends and I don‚Äôt want it to stay that way. But the truth is, I don‚Äôt want to be friends with any of my classmates. I don‚Äôt connect with any of them and I don‚Äôt want to be in a fake friendship. I already had to suffer in one for 5 years, I don‚Äôt want it again.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I get into this dark place in my head all the time. And each time it gets worse. I feel like I‚Äôm drifting away from everyone. Even my own family.

The hardest thing is, I can‚Äôt share my problems with anyone, because no one would take me seriously and they‚Äôd just laugh at me. I don‚Äôt trust my own family with my problems.

I have to deal with these thoughts alone and it just kills me.

989,Soup_Kraken,1566068398,11,"I can't really describe it, I have recently had many thoughts about life and the universe, until I realized things like:


There no such thing as a ""modern"" human, just tall monkeys who pretend to be civilised. We haven't adapted to this new world yet, making many lose sleep and gaining stress from how the world works. And this just feels weird to me, I don't understand how humans are so much more intelligent than every known creature, but we still have primal urges. This makes me feel empty in a way I can't describe.

""Is the human intelligence a curse or a blessing?""
Think about it, what does a dog do when it looks at the moon? It doesn't, it's not interesting for them. But we humans have always questioned everything, trying to ""quench the thirst for knowledge"", but always found more. I heard an interesting statement form a podcast:

""When humans cast light upon the unknown, we always find more darkness to light up""

This is really screwing with me, I don't know if I want to know all the knowledge in the universe, so that I can answer all our questions. Or if I want to delete my knowledge, and get a new life as a more primitive human / animal.

I can't wrap my brain around the concept, ""Why do we want more knowledge?"" ""Can't we just go back to not bothering about it?""


I know that it's good for us in many ways to have a modern society, but I still wish it was better, I wish I could escape and live in an infinite dream. I wish I could sleep forever, and just get a new world whenever I have learned everything I want to know about the last world. I think your happier as a child due to questioning everything. I was very thoughtful as a child, and learned how everything worked by thought experiments, and I really miss that


I really don't know if this fits the sub, but I feel lonely due to questioning my existence. And I feel like I lose more and more happiness by learning things. I recently watched a video about an evolution simulation, made by a YouTube channel with the name ""primer"". And the video teached me that:

 ""An advanced creature such as a chicken or human, doesn't just pop into existence, they are created by each other. But if there's an organism, basic enough to be ""popped"" into existence, but still being able to replicate, then it would make a copy, with a few ""mistakes"", and that clone would be a new ""evolution"" of the species, so if it countinues getting food and replicating, it would in the end, be an advanced creature""

(I can't describe it in text better than that, sorry.)

And this information makes me a little sad, I feel like we have solved the mystery to life. And know I have lost a little motivation to learn, making me feel lonely.

I am just wondering if there's anyone else being a little let down by overthinking the world.

Sorry if I sound like some ""deep fourteen year old"" but I really need to know if anyone else is feeling the same.


TL;DR: I have many ""deep thoughts"" that make me feel lonely, and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced it as well.",lonely,"I have friends, but I still feel lonely in the world due to overthinking life",2019-08-18 04:59:58

It stopped when I went to high school but the damage was already done. All through high school I was a loner until I met a few friends. We were pretty close but that all changed.. and I was back to being alone. I am well in my thirties now and I dont have friends.. My best friend is my sister.. but when she is dating that friendship gets put all the way at the back burner. 

Weekdays are fine. I work a 40 hour job and go the gym 3 days a week so that keeps me pretty exhausted. Too tired to feel lonely.  Its the weekend when I start to really feel alone. When my parents and sister are busy with their significant others and I am alone at home.. doing.. well not much. 

The bullying has left a lot of damage that makes it hard for me to go out and make friends.  I did that before and I had friends or.. well sort of friends I guess because they only had time when something was bugging them and they needed someone to talk too. Friends with loads of other friends to keep them busy. 

I only ever had one boyfriend. I met him online and we met up and dated for a bit. It was long distance so we grew apart and broke up. I have been alone ever since.. I stopped counting when it was 10 years.. I dont think I even remember what it is like to have a relationship... I dont think I would even know how to start let alone have a relationship. It would feel to awkward. 

I have learned to be alone. I am good at being alone..I fear I have become too good.. I just wish I would stop feeling so lonely..

Always dear to me was this solitary hill
and this hedge, which, from so many parts
of the far horizon, the sight excludes.
But sitting and gazing, endless
spaces beyond it, and inhuman
silences, and the deepest quiet
I fake myself in my thoughts; where almost
my heart scares. And as the wind
I hear rustling through these trees, I, that
infinite silence, to this voice
keep comparing: and I feel the eternal,
the dead seasons, the present,
and living one, and the sound of her. So in this

1019,Irakles,1566032726,6,"I shut down completely around 5ish years ago, i was 15 when my parents put me on ADHD medication. I never realized the effect the meds had on me, I kept taking them even though everyday I was more and more suicidal, I never thought for a second that it had anything to do with the meds, I took them for almost an entire year. I think my brain is trying to block out that entire year from my memory,  I cant remember why I stopped taking them but thankfully I did, I do however remember the first time I actually felt something once I had stopped, I remember it felt incredible. But I also think the damage had already been done.

Since then it has been better, bad thoughts were still around but they werent as intrusive. I even had a girlfriend for about 7 months, but in all honesty I didnt feel anything for her, I only went along with it because I wanted to try to feel something for someone. I havent had a crush or attraction to anyone since before this happened. same goes for friendships, Ive had many really nice people attempt to be my friend but I've always pushed them away. I finished high school without having any friends or doing anything outside of school. Spent weekends by myself playing TF2 sometimes chatting with people online but eventually I've stoped talking to all of them, even one of them who was the only person in the world who knew that I was going to kill myself (now that Im thinking of it he is still the only person who knows how serious I was)

after highscool wastnt much easier, I expected that maybe college and work could be a new opportunity for me, that maybe I could be normal. but i continued to pushing people away who wanted to get to know me. there was another girl who I could tell was interested in me, but i didnt give her the same chance that i gave the other girl few years ago. she would always try to talk and flirt to me and I mostly replied in one word answers or just enough to not be rude, she was very nice and I didnt want to be rude but once I didnt have class with her I stoped talking to her completely. There was also this situation that I kinda find funny now, this guy at work is the kinda guy that I would like to be friends with if I could have friends, we joked around sometimes and it was all good but once while we were working together he just came out of nowhere and went ""hey when we get off, you wanna get lunch?"" immediately I replied ""NO""  he looked disappointed and latter i felt really bad, that could have been my shot at ""being normal"" and my anti-social lizard brain kept me from it. havent heard from him after I quit that job. 

For the past 3ish months ive been talking to a therapist, this is the first time in 5 years that ive had anyone to talk to, to really actually talk to, not just one word response or just enough to not insult someone, im talking about all the things that i cant talk about to anyone else. its pretty difficult for me but im sorta just forcing it out of me. And I think that maybe I am beginning to wake up from this poisonous slumber that ive been stuck in. since ive started it ive been alot more, lets call it, ""emotionally expressive"" a month ago I freaked out and punched a few holes in my door then tore off my shirt (my favorite shirt too) like the hulk and then I crumpled to the floor face first sobbing for maybe 10 minutes straight, i know that sounds scary/kinda hilarious now but I felt really good after. also a few nights ago I had what my therapist described as a panic attack but i feel better and more capable now.

ok final paragraph i swear. Man Im not sure why I wanted to write this all down in the first place but i feel alot better then when i started writting. sorry if this is difficult to read, i was sobbing though writing half of it Hahaha. When I started writting it was from a very bad place but now I do feel alot better. idk if this is the sorta thing that people post, but i feel like this needs to be shared.

I'm an only child. I've been lonely my entire life. I was never allowed a furry pet. I didn't grow up with a dog, a cat, or any mammal. A fish or a lizard does not bring companionship, and I was always desperate to spend time with friends.

It's something I've never been able to shake, that aching loneliness. My last relationship, my ex was part of a large, loving family and she was one of several siblings. I was elated to feel welcomed and be part of something I had only seen in movies. In contrast, my family is small, petty and dysfunctional. I had never seen so much love before, and I didn't think anyone would be able to love me as much as my last girlfriend. Things ended for a multitude of reasons, and I learned a lot about myself, and what I want in a partner. 

I'm doing well for myself, I have a career, I'm not in debt outside of a minor student loan and I don't really worry about money. I game a lot in my free time, I like nerdy stuff, fashion, sneakers and lately I've been putting in a lot of extra effort into my health - Short and long term.

I'm not expecting you to like everything I like, or have the same experiences in life as me. I just wouldn't mind the company of another person who I click with - Male or female. Preferably people with their shit (mostly) together. An insightful potential friend who can pull me out of the void I tend to get sucked into more and more frequently.

Welp, this probably came across far edgier than I planned. I feel like I poured my heart out, though. This is how I currently feel. I'm not always like this. Enough people laugh with me to know I have a good sense of humor... At least most of the time.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I was suppose to go to a concert with my former roommate and best but he bailed a few days ago because he said hes broke. I was waiting to get paid today to buy it but decided not to go because I didn't like the artist enough to go solo but been looking forward to it since February. Tbh we have hardly hung out and I feel like he's actively avoiding hanging out even though we agreed we would be over at each others places often. 

Anyways, then I decided to squeeze a photo shoot instead to get back into my portrait photography (been doing it for 2 years now but its been on hold since I moved.. Never picked back up) and spent the last few days planning it with a model interested in my work. Even bought props for framing manipulation. I showed up and she ghosted &amp; no showed. I got a more attractive replacement model but she's leaving for Cali for the rest if the month and I have to wait til the third.

Complained about it to my ex on messenger. She's visiting and been talking on and off all year.  we recently started talking constantly again.. I haven't lost feelings for her honestly. She asked to replace the girl this weekend for shooting practice at the least. 3 mins later she let me know she's been seeing someone for 7 months and they are very very serious. Her life has been getting better in all aspects and I can't even get a real post graduate job. Did date an attractive asian girl a week ago but she ghosted immediately after.. I thought we hit it off.

Now I'm just laying in my room feeling like I just went 5 rounds with Mike Tyson emotionally and I just wanna never leave. Don't even care it's a Friday night and tons of good shows are happening rn. Scrolling through tinder not even getting matches.. Haven't really in days. Lastly my new roommate just brought a girl over and their having loud sex. I'll rebound but damn.

This is kinda long but I'm fucking done with everyone's games and at least I have the comfort of thousands of years of evolution and technology that can help me find the few people who might actually care about me. So here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few vague memories of early life, but they are mostly happy. I remember a nice house, plenty of toys and no yelling (though my brain wasn't even full size but thats what I remember.) Some time around twelve years on this planet and 10 years of them being an outcast in the school I went to, I moved away from that nice house and into a small apartment. I spent a year or so growing up and dealing with parental fights and maturing and whatnot and it gets to me and I fake depression for a while to get a shred of attention from my classmates which fails. A little while later my grandparents think my parents are unfit to parent me, and try to forcibly take custody of me, and fail. While they are not emotionally supportive in any way, they did manage to put a roof over my head and pay for school. There is now and forever an insane amount of tension between everyone in my family, except of course for my perfect cousins and their perfect Santa Barbara life and the perfect parents who aren't even in my family so I never get to see them. I deal with it, and manage to graduate 8th grade with stellar grades in the false hopes my parents will love me for it, and fail. And then summer. Ah, summer vibes. I think life is getting better. My dad has taken me hunting, my mom is slightly happier and I'm living the life in Napa. I ask a girl on a date and she says yes. And then summer comes along and everything goes to fucking shit. We cannot go to Napa anymore for private reasons. The girl backs out. I spend three weeks with my grandparents lifeguarding and three days in my grandma goes to the hospital for a heart attack. Coincidentally the Tahoe trip is cancelled. My grandparents force me to conceal my grandmother's state from my parents and I'm torn between telling them. It works out though and I have one month of summer left. I spend it at home with my insanely overworked father and my constantly angry mother and I play my guitar and spend time with me. Until of course something else happens. My father confesses he simply can't take it all that longer and that he plans to divorce my mother around when I'm a sophomore. I of course cry like a fucking coward. A few weeks later he has a seizure. I spend an agonizing night in the hospital with my mother who scolds me the entire fucking time. I deal with it and I don't cry like a man. But I do cry of course. And they don't care even in the following weeks. High School rolls around and I see it as a new opportunity to meet people. I do meet people and I come home to a worse life and worse attitude from my parents every day. I wonder if I am depressed, and the few friends I do have leave because I refuse to do their homework. I'm doing theater and sports now and filling my life with whatever I fucking can to get me away from home and I don't know if I can take it any longer because crying and reddit rants and exercising and playing guitar and locking my parents out of my room so I can't go to school so I won't get bullied aren't working. I don't know what I have to live for anymore. And as I read over this sad summary of my life I realize it ended a long time ago, not long after my birth. I don't know what I meant to get out of this but I did it anyway. And like a coward I don't have the balls to kill myself so ill just have to keep dealing with it.

I have thought about suicide multiple times but never actually tried because I always thought back to my parents and if I went out like that unexpectedly and knowing that if I do this they will be sad for along time.

You accepted it. Like I have. It's unbelievable how content you start to feel when you stop searching or yearning for a connection. Remove it all from your mind. Have no expectations for anything or anyone and just enjoy the solitude. It might be crazy for some but what better alternative is there. If a connection is meant to be, it'll find you.

Acceptance will do wonders for you. But when you accept don't immediately associate this with negativity, but be positive and enjoy the fact that you can have fun by yourself.

I moved in with my partner, to live in the UK and I left my home in America. Since being here I‚Äôve had time to reflect on my past relationships with friends and family. I feel really sad and lonely, everyone just kinda stopped talking to me. My brother and I used to be really close, almost inseparable, but he never talks to me anymore within the last three years. It hurts really bad, because I grew up as an only child (he didn‚Äôt live with me, we saw each other on occasion but we still were incredibly close) I just wanted a brother figure, and my partner has two older brothers. I worry if me coming out has something to do with being distanced by family. 

My mother and I have a very dysfunctional relationship. She‚Äôs been struggling with drugs in the last few years and I‚Äôve hated her because of it, I can‚Äôt get along with her for more than a moment. Before this, she never was the easiest to get along with. It‚Äôs a love hate at its finest.

My dad doesn‚Äôt feel like a dad to me, he seems completely unbothered by my existence. Him and my brother are closer than they used to be, and I feel jealous and alienated. 

My friends feel like they‚Äôve just forgotten my existence, I get that it‚Äôs easier to continue a friendship in person sometimes, but they don‚Äôt ever talk to me anymore. Sometimes, but not nearly as much. My phone is always quiet, and it just hurts. 

Being here is a completely different vibe, I‚Äôm around people who don‚Äôt share the things my friends share with me, some interests and things sure but there‚Äôs just something different. It‚Äôs probably just the accent to be honest but I miss my people. I feel incredibly alone and isolated, all I‚Äôve wanted to do since being here is just stay in bed and be on my phone. I‚Äôm hoping it will go away, but I face the issue of going back and leaving my partner, even though I‚Äôd want nothing more than to live with them they‚Äôd never leave the UK to come to the US. 

I can just feel myself diving back into a rut, after I had a really short lived peak of pure bliss and happiness. I‚Äôm just sad and I feel empty.

One lost his closest friend a year ago to a heart attack and now he is messaging me constantly and getting on my nerves all the time.

One got schizo went to a mental hospital and is afraid to attemp anything new since then

And the last has epilepsy and is afraid to leave his house (not like he was very outgoing in the first place but now he has a reason that he can tell other people)

I know those are serious problems, and i may sound like an asshole when i say i dont give a crap anymore, but its really tiresome when all your friends are depressed sacks who are too afraid or too lazy to change their lives. Who just wanna meet up to vent their problems to me. I always give good advice to them, stop smoking, start to leave your house, try something new, be more compassionate with others, start going to the gym etc. but not once did they listen. They just keep repeating their stupid destructive behavior and wonder why their lifes are getting worse. Im really thinking about ditching them all and going my own way. Im feeling pretty depressing for a long time now and having ""friends"" who just drag you down more just doesn't help. 

Sometimes I wonder why im even friends with them in the first place.

1062,Fallicacy,1565987550,0,"Share insanity stories related to loneliness. I'll start.

21 y/o and haven't had a social relationship for three years, and have had roughly one conversation every three months since then; small exchanges count. I remember being soul-crushingly depressed the first week of it(as was the norm for at least a decade) and by the 100th day I was convinced I was a ghost and that this was indeed the afterlife. Now, post day 1000, I usually just laugh maniacally at the absurdity of it all, become slightly bored or annoyed with the loneliness, become consumed with abject horror at the past 15 years, or devolve into a full-blown rage.

With respect to the insanity, recently had a \~60 minute session where I rambled into the mirror the entire time about how many times I'd folded a piece of paper and unfolded it, talking about something that was catching my eye through a window, making sure to comment every single time I made a grammatical error or stuttered, and made sure to note how many times I'd noticed a failure in vocalization. I also kept talking about how strange it was that same person (me) was in fact the one doing all these things and not person A, B, C, D, ad infinitum. Ended up repeating many sentences word for word and thinking in the back of my mind that I have a vague feeling I've said that sentence before and try to stop myself, but the words just kept coming out. Also kept talking about how very strange it was that I'd been talking nonstop for 20-30 minutes, etc. I can't remember all the subjects.

Also worth mentioning that it was last night that I had a strange experience: I looked at my hands, and for the first time, I was \*certain\* that they existed and were part of my body. Usually when I wonder if any of the ""real"" world is real or not, I get frustrated and just shift my attention to something else.

I'm no authority on psychotic episodes but I've had them before. Unfortunately I have the dignity and self-discipline to suffer in silence; why can't I have the fun episodes where I knock on random strangers' doors and tell them God has sent me the codes that will save them from the government agents down the street?

It looks fun that you will come here make a long post about you and someone will read it. They will message you and you will become bestfriends.

Maybe if you dont have that courage to make post then you will reside to reading posts and messaging people with hope of getting a reply. 

BUT ITS NOT AS EASY AS THAT

The conversations never really go beyond 15 mins of late reply filled small talk. Theres also a catch to that too, it only happens if someone either messages you or gives a reply. Otherwise you just either keep posting every 3 to 4 days or keep messaging people.

Lets say, if you find a person you really find easy to talk to and you feel comfortable. But are they a creep? Should you really trust them? There are a million questions like that. After clearing those up and chatting for almost a week. All of a sudden everything is blank again. You leave them a daily message but get no replies. Then you stop messaging too because you know you've been GHOSTED. The word we all hate. But we are either at recieving or giving end of it all the times.

The purpose of writing this is that don't give anyone false hope that they might have a chance to make their life less lonely. The lonely is much better than being lonely+hurt. If you are only looking for a 10 mins small talk because you feel bored then mention that. If you dont want to chat to someone tell them you don't want to, give them a reason and say goodbye. Don't leave them hurting. Don't make promises you can't hold.

Some genius once told me ""Lonely people tend to fall for anyone who is nice to them"". Most of us here are really lonely so don't be nice to us when you know you can't stay.

1067,TehSpicyNoodle,1565984043,6,"I have felt alone for a really long time, which is truly amazing considering I'm living on a planet with billions of other people on it. Maybe it‚Äôs a me problem. I‚Äôve said this before, but the same event, or the same feeling, can only occur so many times before it‚Äôs time to acknowledge that you may be the problem (and if not the problem, then maybe the causation). There are times when I‚Äôm happy. Everything seems to be working out, and I‚Äôm surrounded by one or two people that make me feel connected. They become my everything, although they don‚Äôt know it. The sad thing is that, for as much of everything as they are, they‚Äôre still, in the grand scheme of things, next to nothing. I have a theory, but I think I‚Äôve gotten so used to leaving others behind that I don‚Äôt even LET myself get attached. Why would I? It‚Äôs always another fucking heartbreak at the end of the day, and if I can save myself that extra little bit of pain, why wouldn‚Äôt I? One huge problem is the other people though. Guys thinking they‚Äôre in love with me because they‚Äôve never been friends with any other girl before. I know that I should be flattered when so many people have liked and continue to like me, but in all honesty, I am sick of it. You don‚Äôt know how irritating, how painful it is to have people think your friendship isn‚Äôt good enough. They always want something extra out of you; more attention, more time, more touching. Why can‚Äôt I be good enough? Why do I always have to end up being seen as some sexual object? All I‚Äôve ever wanted was to find a group of people who could love and accept me for me. Forget my fucking body, because that‚Äôs not really me. I believe there are things that are more ‚Äúyou‚Äù than others. For example, your face is more ‚Äúyou‚Äù than your pinky toe is. As nice as that fine toe is, your face is what you‚Äôre putting out and presenting to the world everyday, whether you like it or not. My consciousness, this entity inside of me‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs me. That‚Äôs what I want to be appreciated for. When no one is there to accept me for that, I find myself in places like this at 11 at night. So much on my mind that I need to get it out somehow, and so lonely that I‚Äôm typing it out on a fucking computer. If this is you, or this has EVER been you, understand that you are not alone in this feeling. You can feel and be lonely in many other ways, but this is not one of them. Whether that‚Äôs comforting or not I leave to you. I know it‚Äôs nice to be your own special little emo snowflake, but much like everything else, you‚Äôre not very special. You can see it that way, or you can take comfort in knowing that you‚Äôre not quite as barbaric and unlovable as you might think. Maybe you are, but maybe, just maybe, your feelings are entirely human and redemption from them awaits you. There‚Äôs simply no saying, and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to get your hopes up too high in the event that‚Äôs not the case.

1078,al95eng,1565966773,1,"23 M I've been feeling a bit down over the past year or so, as I've never been in a relationship, or even kissed a girl. For some reason, I never felt comfortable even talking about love/romance, etc. It would be extremely awkward, and would get giddy, as if I were 12. I think this was the biggest hurdle. I suppose I was always suppressing my desire to be with someone, until I finally couldn't anymore, and decided to do something about it. I went on several dating apps, and got a handful of dates out of it that led nowhere. I think I'm getting past this barrier, at least. However, I still have general social awkwardness/not understanding social cues. I've also had some other bad experiences while doing this. One of my dates ghosted me after the first date, and I also got catfished by another girl. We exchanged numbers and agreed to a date, and then she stopped replying, and unmatched me. I came across her profile on facebook, and it turns out she was using a fake name on the app, perhaps for a laugh, or just to practice her English skills. I reported her to tinder, and they must have banned her, as recently I came across her on bumble, this time she was using her real name! I must admit, that felt good. I enjoy seeing justice served. 

Anyway, these feelings of loneliness and longing to be with someone seem to be intensifying. I constantly fantasise about falling in love with someone, and noticed I can't sleep without my arms wrapped around a second pillow, and find it difficult to get up in the morning. At some point I stumbled across the movie Before Sunrise. It's a bit embarrassing to admit this as a guy, but it really moved me, and the whole concept of it just burrowed into my brain. 

I also feel like I've wasted my teens/early 20s, by not trying to come out of my shell and experience as many different things as possible, as vague as that sounds. I remember being 18 and starting university, and reflecting back on it, I realise how socially immature I was, and I didn't realise it then. I treated uni as high school 2.0, just study and go back home, and I'm regretting it now. I knew I had problems, but couldn't be bothered dealing with them. I'm on ASD spectrum, and I guess I'm somewhat behind socially. I feel like with the little progress I've made since then, I'm at the point where most people were back then. I wasn't even on any social media until this year (except Linkedin haha). When I got fb, I saw what my HS cohort have been doing over the last few years, and it seems like most of them are living happy, fulfilling lives. Travelling, socialising, etc. It amazes me where people get the money to travel so much at this age.",lonely,Social problems - possible love shyness,2019-08-17 00:46:13

1096,reddituser1011123425,1565933881,8,"Hi everyone I think something is mentally wrong with me to start. Let me tell you what I believe is causing my depression. I have posted here before and here is what I said:

‚ÄúI feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.‚Äù

I feel as if I am ready to die now. I still hear about their relationship and just think that could have been me. Like yesterday she talked about how her boyfriend got her this beautiful earrings and all day I just cant stop thinking about how that could have been me who got those for her. Just every little thing that they have done together could have been me. I feel as if I am dreaming and something this awful couldn‚Äôt be happening. As if I live an alternative universe of what would happen if I never dated her. This feels like a nightmare and I just can‚Äôt move on. I look at other girls and feel nothing. I just understand what I missed out on and I don‚Äôt want to move forward in this world without her. It‚Äôs amazing that this thing I found to be minor last year at this time will now be the reason I end my life. Everyday I am either crying or yelling at God for making my life so hell.

No problem, right? The problem is that I found out that they hung out with each other multiple times and never mentioned it to me. So... that sucks.

Since I was 13, I was always in the ""never text first"" mindset for 2 reasons:
1. I believed it made me look ""desperate""
2. I believed that I was intruding on others' lives and they didn't want to be bothered. If they wanted me, they'll message me.

That, unsurprisingly, has left me feeling very isolated. The issue, however, is that every time I *did* message first, I got very short responses and they seemed uninterested.

I eventually stopped messaging them, and haven't spoken to a ""friend"" in over a month.

I read this article today (can link if asked) and it has given me mixed feelings. One the one hand, I *am* ""testing"" people by not making any contact. On the other hand, they don't seem to want me to make contact. I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.

I don't know what to do. I can't go on without any social contact, but I have too much pride to be rejected with short messages, if I even get a reply to begin with.

Any advice? If you have questions, please ask. :)

Thank you.

On the outside, life is great.  It appears that I have the perfect life.  Family, husband , a place to live, pets , the whole nine yards.  But on the inside is a different story.  I am so alone.  Always.  I wake up alone , and go to bed alone every night . He goes to work every morning , and to the bar every night.  We go days and days , without even talking to each other.  He doesn‚Äôt talk to his kids... He just comes in drunk , eats and goes to sleep.  Just to get up and do it all over again the next day.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he pays the bills and we have what we need . But I have no one.  No one there for me. No one to hug me when I am sad.  No one to congratulate me when something good happens. No one that understands what it is to truly be alone.  I cry myself to sleep every night, and wake up every morning just to do it all over again.  

 Why don‚Äôt I deserve to be happy ? Why don‚Äôt I deserve really ...anything?  I am here every day, yet he hates me.  I want love and respect and affection and compassion.... all I get is the feeling of being abandoned.  Feeling like I am a burden.Like I am nothing.  I try so hard to let my light shine through no matter what.  But damn... it‚Äôs hard.. I deserve so much more.  I shouldn‚Äôt have to be trapped here in an unloving relationship.  Why am I not good enough?  I just don‚Äôt get it.  I know I am not perfect.  I know I am not the smartest, or  most beautiful.... but to be completely ignored and have no human contact sucks ass.  Livinglife with out touch is the most cruel torture one can endure.  

Yet despite all of this I keep trying.  Trying to make myself happy without anything that comes with a loving relationship.  I keep trying to make myself better in hopes that one day it will pay off and I will finally be happy, finally meet someone you loves me for who I am , or thinks I am the most amazing person ever.  Childish.  Yea I know.  But a girl can dream right?  Dream of the day that the door opens and I can finally walk through and finally be happy.  Happy with me and happy with life.  It sounds so simple.  But it‚Äôs so damn hard.  I don‚Äôt smile today.  I don‚Äôt want to.  They say fake it till you make it.... well.  I am tired.  Tired of faking it .

1110,Retro-Link,1565922531,11,"Allow me to say that I am 27 years old, which by knowing this the more I go into detail on things the more sadder, and pathetic everything may seem.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always dealt with mental health issues my whole life, early years though it seemed like it was just me being overly emotional, and a spastic kid. As time went on I grew to be more introverted, in-closed from the world. Some unfortunate life events happened right as I was in my freshman year of college and I ended up dropping out. At one point in time before leaving I was sleeping in every class and ended up making incomplete's and 0's. I grew more and more detached from everything, mostly staying in my own corner of the world, held up in my bed room finding an escape through games. For years every friend I knew, and had, was either from when I was in school or people I would occasionally meet online. The people I met was never really something I dived in and attempt to make contact myself. Everyone I had found that could put up with me, was always through other friends.

&amp;#x200B;

As time continued to move forward, it felt like I was stuck, frozen in time. I constantly got bombarded by family, ""That you need a job, you need to go to college."" Which I tried, for years, and years, I did try. I got my GED, struggled to get my license, even though I barely drive even to this day. I went through a disability program to help get me experience in the workplace, to help me get use to being in that environment, and to have something to put on a resume. I ended up working in retail for a short time, and decided to try my hand at pursuing something through college.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to do a year of college, online courses, mixed with actual campus courses (which I absolutely hated) I ended up quitting during that summer, and decided to leave my job. At that time I had no idea what the future had in-store for me. The friends I had started drifting away, going down their own paths in life. From all the way back to the early 2000s I've always been on console, an xbox fanboy if you want to classify it as such. With my escape breaking beneath me, ontop of my life not having a direction I decided to use what was left from my grant to build a computer. While I made the transition I began to finally reopen my disability case from years ago. I had no hope in it actually passing the second time.

&amp;#x200B;

After several months and many tests, and talking with psychiatrists I finally got in the mail that I was approved. (Keep in mind, I had been going to a mental health facility for my entire young adult life. When I first got put into in-patient there, and continued to do out-patient, that was what originally started the case at setting up some kind of future whether or not I could piece together myself or stay broken.) For awhile I felt relieved that I didn't have to constantly worry about the what-ifs, and what laid before me. I had hope that finally I could be in peace with myself. Time passed, constantly ticking away, I was alone.. What little social interaction I had left was gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kept thinking to myself that one day I wouldn't have to be this lonely anymore. That things would get better. I had glimmers of hope, people from life times ago popped in and left just as quickly as they came. Entirely by my doing, my usual mentally unstable self, had developed into someone that feared abandonment. Because of years of taking antipsychotics, having dosages changed, pills removed and something else to replace it. I was no longer myself, I was paranoid, impulsive, and struggled with outbursts. Even my family couldn't deal with what the medicine was doing to me, at that point I had pushed what remained of my friends away that had wanted to reconnect again and my family that has only ever wanted the best for me.

&amp;#x200B;

After 9 years of going for mental health treatment I decided to stop. I quit taking (slowly at first dose by dose) all the medicine I was currently on. When one day I completely stopped entirely. The medicine helped in a way to slow and stagnate my mind, it numbed it to the point that I couldn't think correctly, but also could never dwell on the inner demons that laid inside. 4 months have passed since, I can think clearer now, but now that I can, it's a never ceasing battle to deal with the madness inside myself. Lately my only reprieve from the constant bombardment is to sleep, to lay and try to day dream about good memories, to attempt to replace the bad. With all that has taken place, and the words that gone unspoken, and every detail, and moment, that continues to repeat endlessly within me I feel as if it's a form of punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize now that it's too late to make up for everyone that I had pushed away. I was given chances, a dangling rope to pull myself up, and I threw it away. And as such I accept the fact that I will continue to fall for however long this road leads. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should be happy.. I know I should. I finally was able to fulfill my dream of having a pc. I finally was able to put together my dream set-up that I could have never expected having at all in my entire life. I have a loving family, and all the time in the world to spend time with them, and yet I continue to struggle to hang on. At the end of it all, I'm lonely, desperately wishing and grasping for air, struggling to make things right in my own mind.",lonely,An Outcry For Help,2019-08-16 12:28:51

1112,hamartiated,1565922238,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I‚Äôm also sorry that I posted this and then deleted it within minutes yesterday; it‚Äôs difficult for me to write about.

I realise that this is a complex subject to write about. In this post, I will describe my experiences as a victim of sexual assault, describe my pre-existing loneliness, and how the former has worsened the latter.

Ever since I could remember, I have always been what I would consider forever-alone and very prone to being abused. I don't know why. I have very few friends, most of them online, and new friends can be very difficult to come by. I only have one friend (henceforth called ""A"") who I can talk to about almost anything, we've been together for a very long time, she's been very supportive, but has her schedules too. I've only ever had one relationship, but it's over and we never got to meet each other. My loneliness has been getting a lot worse over the last couple of years. I have gradually lost some connections, and it seems very difficult for me to make new ones nowadays. I often feel depressed, cry over it, and so on. I would say I'm unattractive in general and very ugly.

For almost a year, I had been working for a former employer of mine who is abusive, manipulative, and selfish. At the time, I was 18, and she was about 37. Fortunately, I recently got out, but it still left me with a lot of trauma, a lot of which I won't cover in this post. One day, while I was at work, my former employer and I were sitting next to each other on highchairs behind the counter. We were talking. While my mind and I were listening to her and thinking about things, she sexually assaulted me. To me, it happened so fast, so I was just shocked. I will not go through the details, because every time I think about it, I can feel her crawling on me, and it's absolutely nauseating. The details surrounding the event that I've written is all I can clearly remember.

At first, I bottled it up, because I thought I could just let it go, she was my employer, I thought back then that I was getting paid well and fairly, she has a family, and her husband seemed well-off. She's also a lot older than me, and in this culture, people who are older generally earn more respect, and who am I -- a teenager -- to speak up? Blah, blah, blah. Then, I later realised how it really got to me. Because of all the work that was thrown at me and I had to concentrate on, and the mental blockades and defences I had set up in my mind, her actions were time-delayed and the effects got to me a lot later on. I tried speaking to my mum about it. She doesn't believe me and is rather ignorant about it, but she agreed that I was at the age that I have to be wary of others because my body was developing fast or something like that. Fortunately, A is really supportive to me, has helped me a lot, and I'm truly thankful for that.

The thing is, I'm upset that, nobody (especially people I like) has approached and tried to connect with me very well so as to get to know me on a deeper and more intellectual level. I'm lacking personal, intellectual connections that could mutually improve one another and we both enjoy. That's one of the reasons why I consider myself FA. On the other hand, I've been attracting too many unsolicited sexual approaches from people I barely know personally or I'm indifferent towards. The event described earlier in this post isn't the first time someone has approached me this way; the other times weren't as serious, it was obvious that those people were a little bit predatory, or I knew how to avoid them. It also happens to be that the first time someone ever sexually approached me in an invasive way is not expected (especially of the person), solicited, or consensual.

Still, after all of what has happened to me, it still haunts me, and it's made my loneliness a lot worse as if it wasn't already the worst it has ever been. I start to feel less confident in a way, to distance and isolate myself, not to trust people, and not to feel comfortable physically being near people. I start becoming wary of other people and sort of expecting the worst that could go wrong. I feel I'm not prepared enough if it should happen again. And I‚Äôm certainly not comfortable dating in real life. It's making me really stressed and lonely, and not helping me with anything. Despite that, I'm still trying to connect with others, though. How can I get through this?

My former employer is still out there, doing business as usual. I thought back to when I was there: she has security cameras, but the footage has probably already been automatically deleted since it was actually so long ago, and she would never provide it regardless. I literally have no evidence against her, and it seems like she's been getting away with a lot of horrible things.

Nobody notices me, people ignore me, and I have a feeling they talk about me behind my back as well. I have been whacked by the ugly stick and I am chubby, so I doubt anyone will ever want to be my partner let alone friend. I've just lost all hope in myself and have little confidence left. I've tried a couple dating sites but I was too afraid to step out and talk to people. I was afraid no one would like me or that I would mess up and cause a reoccurrence of the events in high school.

1145,fresh-prince-of-cali,1565889670,3,"If your bored or need something to read on the toilet oh boy do I have the story for you. I promise this belongs here and leads to where I am now

It all started last November when I was a senior in high school everything was amazing. All my life wishes were coming true. I had soo many wonderful friends, prom was coming, I was going to be in plays I thought senior year was going to be the best year yet... and then I was alone. It all had started in September when I started chatting with this girl I had math class with (let‚Äôs call her Jessica) and would occasionally hangout with between passing periods and regularly conversed about memes. My close friend (let‚Äôs call him Kyle) immediately took notice. At the time I never knew the full story but I guess Jessica and Kyle had dated for a year and Kyle broke up with Jessica shattering her heart (which eventually led her to start harming herself and an attempt at suicide). At the time I didn‚Äôt think Jessica was interested in me but the closer we got to thanksgiving  the closer me and Jessica grew together. Hanging out at padding period turned into hanging out after school and soon lead to me walking her home everyday. alot of the time even when we reached her house we would walk back to the school just to keep talking. One day we were walking and we saw Kyle walking home.  

Me and Jessica slowed down  until he was eventually a small dot in the distance and that‚Äôs when I heard her crying. I asked her ‚Äúhey are you okay Jessica?‚Äù She said she was fine and that ‚Äúshe missed him so much‚Äù. My heart broke seeing her that way. Fast forward to December and I knew I was in love and that Jessica was maybe flirting with me. So one awkward confession of feelings and a fake out at my expense later and we were a couple and I was happy for a moment but then....I remembered Kyle. At first anxiety struck me and Jessica and we had no idea what to do and after an argument with Kyle he said things were all good and that we should move past it. This is were things go down hill. When I asked Jessica and some of her friends to tell me about what Kyle did before I was astonished. She told me Kyle would constantly grope her in public, yell at her, and made her cry more than once, and on top of all of this he took her virginity and dumped her for someone else. After hearing this it felt like a bull ran me into a wall. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for nights in a row. 

In any other situation I could‚Äôve moved on and treated my girlfriend better but the man who hurt her was one of my closest friends. I almost consider him family. So I was hurting and had no idea what to do. After weeks on tension and one last fight me and Kyle exchanged middle fingers and parted ways. During those weeks of sleepless nights and my feelings tearing me limb by limb I started to change. I became much crueler, angry, short fused and this along with the fact I was babying Jessica holding back on jokes and actions that would allude to the past...I ended up driving her away. We had fights more often and even though I knew I loved her I‚Äôd get angry and lose sight. 

We had two breaks in the span of our two month relationship before she eventually told me she just wasn‚Äôt interested. Heartbroken a few days later I tried one last time and over a phone call I begged and  pleaded but...her cold stare and uninterested tone of voice is really what shattered me in the end. In the span of two months I lost a close friend, my girlfriend, and my sanity. It was over right? Wrong. I couldn‚Äôt be around my ex without sadness and anxiety crippling me so I kept my distance. Soon my friend heard what happened but none of them reached out. The mountain of friends I once had soon faded away and went to Jessica. She was the talk of the town being popular with all the people I introduced her to. Before our breakup she reconciled with Kyle and behind my back would hangout with him after school to ‚Äúvent‚Äù but that‚Äôs bullshit considering in the past she would run away from him in the halls mid conversation and demonized him to the fullest extent calling him a rapist even going on to say that she never wanted to be alone with him again let alone the same room.  

Jessica was a junior so you could expect the horror and surprise when I saw her at prom with her date and again everyone flocked around the once unspecial girl who was now the star. By the end of senior year I was glad to leave but also sad that my senior year had ended before it even started. June and July I had ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but not really. By the end of July they were gone and I found myself alone. Most nights I lie awake knowing if I died today the only one who‚Äôd miss me would be my mom . The saddest part is even though Jessica has a new boyfriend and is happier than I‚Äôve ever seen her... I still miss her tremendously. Even after everything at the end of the day I can‚Äôt bring myself to hate her or this situation because I feel it‚Äôs my fault. The elders passed down one rule. One sacred holy rule....bros before hoes.  I was so happy and now with one bad decision....I‚Äôm alone. If you read all of this thankyou

 A sadness that is ever present, that colors each and every day of your life  ?

 There are to many silent sufferers. 

Not because they don't yearn to reach out, but because they've tried and found no one who cares.

 Each and every day it begins again, upon awakening the trials begin anew. 

Each and every day you look first inward and then cast your gaze outward, only to see doubt and misery's head rise.

 My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes. 

 Spring is the toughest season, you stand alone watching those who pass by hand in hand, in love or maybe they have just found that someone who understand that sometimes you just need a hand to hold.

In many ways, I'm doing much better. In the past year, I've been through a lot. I used to cut, I used to smoke cigarettes, I used to not care about my wellbeing almost at all, I didn't know how to shut up about my issues, I always made suicide jokes out loud to cope (being half serious naturally), and much more. I had a lot of bad going for me in the early months of the year. Whereas I'm not saying I won't do any of that in the future, especially smoking or something, I'm not doing those things right now. And now I have some amount of level-headedness, I'm more aware of both myself and my situation rather than being blinded by naive and overwhelming pessimism and cynicism, and in a lot of ways, I've matured a lot as a person. That being said, things are still far from perfect, or even contentment. With old issues being resolved, new ones must always surface...


Things have been so, ao difficult lately for reasons that seem so fresh. My loneliness is through the roof, or at least I haven't been handling my loneliness well at all lately. I feel so isolated since I haven't many friends, and even when the few friends I have want to go out (which is rare), my depression and anxiety often make me decline their offers or cancel plans outright just before they happen. I've been obsessed with my want for companionship, so much so that even seeing a girl that I may have an interest in really fucks with me. I've always been sensitive to innocent and cute topics/pictures/media, etc, them depressing me greatly for a reason I myself can only speculate on. However lately this sensitivity has (hopefully) come to its peak, it being the most sensitive it's most likely ever been for me. I don't get if it's my loss of childhood, lack of a normal childhood, the fact of my innocence having been taken at an early age, or what else it may be, but the sensitivity to innocent and cute things has been within me for a decent while now. It fucks with me the most. The smallest thing can send me into the deepest depression. That sentence doesn't even just apply to the sensitivity to innocence and such, actually. It can apply to my depression, anxiety, and loneliness in general. The smallest inconvenience (though it has to be a bit specific) can take me from the best of moods to the darkest of thoughts and emotions.

To sum up, things have been very, very hard lately. The entire Summer they have. I'm sure there's more I forgot fo mention, but it's 2:21 AM for me, and I can't be fucked to think of more to type.

I feel like my issues that have prevented me from having friends and getting into relationships are at such a basic level that I wouldn't even be able to ask someone for help.

1181,stressyandagressy,1565836126,2,"Ever since the 5th grade I have been so focused on going to college and creating the best life that I want to live in. My junior year of high school I enrolled in a local community college and have gotten enough credits to graduate a year early from high school. I‚Äôm so proud of my achievements and I have been able to be very successful even though I suffer from depression. 

However, with all of that being said, I have not made any meaningful connections. I was bullied through grades 6-10 and had to leave my original high school because the racism was so bad. At my new high school, I immediately enrolled into community college (dual enrollment) and had primarily adults in my classes (ages early 20s -50s). Even the connections I made with my peers while I was in my high school I completely ended because I was so focused on getting into college and having the best scores on my tests. 

As I‚Äôm getting closer and closer to my goal of getting into college, I look back and see that I have no one. I have stacks of certificates and a shelf of trophies but not a single friend. This is my only social media app because I don‚Äôt have anyone to add on Instagram or Snapchat. Because I‚Äôm graduating early (which was unexpected), I‚Äôm not going to prom, I‚Äôm not going on senior trip, senior skip day, yearbook signing, or even graduation. I feel bad that I‚Äôm not participating in those activities because they sound great, in theory. Even if I did participate, I would be alone and feel like shit because I‚Äôll see other people around me with their friends having fun. I don‚Äôt even know what it feels like to have a friend to hang out with. Honestly, the thought of being social makes my anxiety even worse. I am so awkward and insecure that I rather stay this way in fear of being outcasted even more. I don‚Äôt even know what having a friend feels like so I don‚Äôt even want to change my situation. Being lonely feels familiar to me, I wouldn‚Äôt know how to even be a friend. I guess I‚Äôm just having another pity party but I just needed a place to admit my loneliness.

1184,hamartiated,1565834386,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

The house that I live has many others guys, but I don't talk more than a phrase with 'em. So I don't talk to anyone during all day.
My high school friends are gone after 1 year that I finished school, my friends from my last college also stopped to talk to me when I leave (before even I told thar i was moving) and well, that's every possible friendship contacts that I had in my life, people that study with me and now they gone, because the only thing that make me be friend with they was just my presence.
So basically the only person I talk during all day about stuffs is my mom. I send a message to her talking about random things during all day, but I have noticed that sometimes she's like ""Uhum, okay now why you're talking about every single breath you take during the day, it's enough right?"" and she's right.
I always was the guy with no friends that don't talk to anyone, but now when everyone really delete me from they social circle I feel that hiting me hard. I was listening to the BROCKHAMPTON song ""Lamb"" and I can say the same thing as they sing in they hook.
What I can do? I'm like different from everyone in my college, my color, social condition, tastes, everything is different and they don't even know my name. That's a method that I can make someone see me as I'm? I'm going crazy with that, I was invisible all my life but now I see that don't have any advantage in be invisible.

1191,Caramel64,1565827498,1,"I initially thought I would post this on a throwaway account, but I've kept it to myself for almost a year and I feel it's about time for me to speak out about it myself.

I realise that this is a complex subject to write about.  In this post, I will describe my experiences as a victim of sexual assault, describe my pre-existing loneliness, and the intersections of the two.

Ever since I could remember, I have always been what I would consider forever-alone and very prone to being abused.  I don't know why.  I have very few friends, most of them online, and new friends can be very difficult to come by.  I only have one friend who I can talk to about anything (henceforth called ""A""), we've been together for a very long time, she's been very supportive, but has her schedules too.  I've only ever had one relationship, but it's over and we never got to meet each other.  My loneliness has been getting a lot worse over the last couple of years.  I have gradually lost some connections, and it seems very difficult for me to make new ones nowadays.  I often feel depressed, cry over it, and so on.  I would say I'm unattractive in general and really ugly.

For almost a year, I had been working for a former employer of mine who is abusive, manipulative, and selfish.  At the time, I was 18, and she was about 37.  Fortunately, I recently got out, but it still left me with a lot of trauma, a lot of which I won't cover in this post.  One day, while I was at work, my former employer and I were sitting next to each other on high chairs behind the counter.  We were talking.  While my mind and I were listening to her and thinking about things, she sexually assaulted me.  To me, it happened so fast, so I was just shocked.  I will not go through the details, because every time I think about it, I can feel her crawling on me, and it's absolutely nauseating.  The details surrounding the event that I've written is all I can clearly remember.

At first, I bottled it up, because I thought I could just let it go, she was my employer, I thought back then that I was getting paid well and fairly, she has a family, and her husband seemed well-off.  She's also a lot older than me, and in this culture, people who are older generally earn more respect, and who am I -- a teenager -- to speak up?  Blah, blah, blah.  Then, I later realised how it really got to me.  Because of all the work that was thrown at me and I had to concentrate on, and the mental blockades and defences I set up in my mind, her actions were time-delayed and the effects got to me a lot later on.  I tried speaking to my mum about it.  She doesn't believe me and is rather ignorant about it, but she agreed that I was at the age that I have to be wary of others because my body was developing fast or something like that.  Fortunately, A is really supportive to me, has helped me a lot, and I'm truly thankful for that.

The thing is, I'm upset that, nobody (especially people I like) has approached and tried to connect with me very well so as to get to know me on a deeper and more intellectual level.  I'm lacking personal, intellectual connections that could mutually improve one another and we both enjoy.  That's one of the reasons why I consider myself FA.  On the other hand, I've been attracting too many unsolicited sexual approaches from people I barely know personally or I'm indifferent towards.  The event described earlier in this post isn't the first time someone has approached me this way; the other times weren't as serious, it was obvious that those people were a little bit predatory, or I knew how to avoid them.  It also happens to be that the first time someone ever sexually approached me in an invasive way is not expected (especially of the person), solicited, or consensual.

Still, after all of what has happened to me, I still feel hurt, and it's actually made my loneliness a lot worse as if it wasn't already the worst it has ever been.  I start to feel less confident in a way, to distance and isolate myself, not to trust people, and not to feel comfortable physically being near people.  I start becoming wary of other people and sort of expecting the worst that could go wrong.  I feel I'm not prepared enough if it should happen again.  It's making me stressed and not helping me with anything.  Despite that, I'm still trying to connect with others, though.

My former employer is still out there, doing business as usual.  I looked back: she has security cameras, but the footage has probably been deleted since it was actually so long ago, and she would never provide it regardless.  I literally have no evidence against her, and it seems like she's been getting away with a lot of horrible things.",lonely,My first ever sexual encounter was with an assailant,2019-08-15 10:04:58
1192,Malammore762,1565825698,4,"I know this bothers a lot of people. But honestly...I over analyze THE FUCK out of this one. It's like a knife being jammed into my throat. That whole not-knowing if you've been ignored or simply the other person was busy. Maybe you have offended them. Maybe you have been over bearing. Maybe you will never hear from them again. Maybe it was NOTHING.

I definitely don't think I'm overbearing or clingy but on the contrary. I often will actually hold back on something I'd like to say someone via text for example because I feel like I'm being a fucking buzzard. Being lonely has made me so hard on myself. 

I do have social anxiety but this feels different. It's almost like an acceptance/validation issue or something. It literally feels different than anything else and I have experienced quite a bit in my 30 years. The level of disappointment I would say to me personally could be compared to the come-down of drugs. I'm aware that texts affect Dopamine and Seratonin levels in the brain and I also unfortunately have a history with using drugs.

I really wish I could come up with ways to cope with this differently. I could have had an amazing day and that one unanswered text can make me just want to die. It's like being slashed open with a razor and that anxiety and disappointment you feel just gushes out of your soul like invisible blood. Then I sit there and just bleed. 

The disappointment is so overwhelming that I stare off into space and just think of ways I could die but not kill myself because I feel suicide is selfish. Ways I could die that would not only end my suffering but give me one finale of validation and love. Saving a child in a fire and burning. Charging a machine gun bunker and getting an exit wound through the spine. Crashing through plate glass window to help an unarmed pregnant woman from getting sexually assaulted. Attempting to disarm a bomb and detonating myself as the shockwave just turns my body into a soft jelly. Falling to my death helping evacuate survivors on a high rise.

These thoughts are so intense and vivid that I create entire plots to them. It's like a movie being played inside of my head directing it in real-time.

And this all comes from one stupid text that probably means fuck all and I just put myself in hell through nothing. Does anyone else feel this level of intensity?

This past two months have been a torment. All I‚Äôve done is just think and think and think some more about how I ruined what little happiness I had found. How I ruined the one friendship that helped me overcome all the other shit in my life. Now that I have nothing, its just constant pain. Constant thoughts. Negative thoughts. They don‚Äôt go away. I don‚Äôt get a break. From dusk till dawn and all the other hours in between the two. Its an actual nightmare. Its overwhelming. All I want is peace. All I want is to have him back. But nothing ever happens. Nothing changes. Its just me and these awful thoughts and feelings. When he first left, I was so depressed all I could think about was suicide. All I wanted was to not live anymore. Granted I have managed to suppress those thoughts. I‚Äôve moved from Suicidal to severely depressed. A slight improvement but still not good enough. Suicide is still in my thoughts. Lurking. But its being held back by what little hope I have left. Hope that he‚Äôll change his mind. Hope that he misses me too. Misguided hope. I just miss him. No one did anything for me like he did. And what he did do might sound stupid or miniscule to other people but for me it was a life changer. He literally changed my life. Both for the best and the worst. I had spent such a long time acclimating to loneliness. I had not had an actual ‚Äúfriend‚Äù since I left high school. And after that long period of loneliness I had grown so accustomed to it, I honestly didn‚Äôt feel it anymore. And then he showed up. And that careful mask I had glued on started to unstick. And I began to want his company. I wanted a friend. Not just a friend but a best friend. He listened to me. Not just pretended but listened to what I said. He remembered things about me. It seemed like he cared. He opened my eyes to music I had never even thought off. He gave me the attention I craved so much. And slowly I began to depend on him. For laughter. For fun. For everything. He made me feel like I was a person worthwhile. Like I meant something. He was everything I wanted to be. Funny, extroverted, talented, likeable. But I‚Äôve learned that I don‚Äôt deserve a friend. I deserve nothing. I end up infecting everything good in my life with my toxicity. I realized that being lonely isn‚Äôt really my choice but a circumstance I deal with because of what kind of person I am. I am a terrible human, with the worst personality that anyone could have. I didn‚Äôt deserve him. He tried his best. He gave me two chances before he said he couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I incorrectly assumed that the length of our friendship would stop him from disappearing. How could anyone throw away two years of talking to someone basically daily? But I was wrong. I‚Äôve reached out twice in the past two months. Once to wish him a happy birthday. The other just to let him know that I miss him. Both have gone unanswered. And both have hurt me beyond words. I want to hope he will come back, but his lack of a response is a reality check. He will never speak to me again. I will never hear his contagious laughter. His funny stories. I will never have someone to discuss music with. No one will tease me about not knowing who Queen is ever again. And I feel so empty. So alone. Only this time the loneliness is not welcome.

1250,hamartiated,1565749040,6,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I even got drunk in the afternoon sometimes, and that is even worse because the drunkenness wears off before you go to sleep.

I would also just drive around town because I had nothing else to do. I pretty much took a drive everyday. My day would be completely alone and uneventful except for my drive for a long time. And so I had a lot of very sad drives around town.

I was very wrong.

I tried making friends. Every school trip we went to I tried talking to my classmates, but they just didn‚Äôt seem to like me. 

It‚Äôs always been the same. Before high school, I had no friends, I didn‚Äôt have friends in kindergarten and I don‚Äôt have friends in high school. 

I‚Äôm also really shy and quiet, but I want to have friends so bad. One of my teachers even said ‚Äòyou are very unnoticeable. You‚Äôre always so quiet, but you‚Äôre really hard working.‚Äô I felt really sad when she said that, because she wasn‚Äôt the first teacher to say that.

I hated going to school everyday, because I knew I won‚Äôt have anyone to hang out with, apart from my one friend. But I want to have more friends. 

This year, I absolutely DREAD going back to school. I‚Äôve cried so many times this summer, because I just don‚Äôt want to go back. I never cry, but I just hate myself so much for being the way I am. My heart breaks when I think about all the good times I could have with friends, if I had them. 

I‚Äôve had 3 friends in my life. They were all girls as well. I would love to have guy friends too. I feel invisible and like no one would actually want to be friends with me, even if they knew me.

I haven‚Äôt texted anyone in 2 months. I‚Äôm in my bed on my phone all day and I haven‚Äôt gone out with friends for 2 months.

Hi everyone

The reason I want to write this post is because I have noticed that whenever someone tries to talk to me or gives me any attention it can get me angry without me even noticing it. I used to have a few close friends but when one of my friends conned me out of a few pounds, it was then I had developed trust issues.  Ever since that insurant I have always felt that I cannot trust anyone including my own family. This horrible experience has left me feeling very lonely and upset. I want to be able to trust people but after my friend just used me, I am not sure what I should do or even if I will ever get better.

1292,IamFalconCeasar,1565689369,4,"First would like to say it is just what i feel  and it may or may not match with you people.


This feeling comes suddenly it is like sudden mood change when you feel kind of sad and alone. This does not have any specific place or time, at this moment you might be surrounded with people still you will feel leftout though you are not.

There might be times when your friends would like or love to involve you in things and you feel like not joining them but then again you will feel like ""Oh! I am alone"".

It very difficult to explain to people that though I want to be alone but this loneliness also kills me. Yes, we might be much self dependent, our charecters grow and dependency and expectations from others reduce but there is another person inside us who wants to be dependent, who wants to be surrounded.

At times I feel I am like an alien here my thoughts dont match with people but I know there are people like me somewhere (may be far) but somewhere....

Living in Cincinnati now, I miss going to ball games and the Bengals just aren't doing it for me. My cousin-in-law enjoys football games of all types and my wife said that he was feeling a bit out of sorts with his life at the moment. But he said no. So oh well. 

For whatever reason, I got this sinking feeling in the pit my stomach when he said ""no"". Its the same area I felt activity whenever I'd ask a girl on a date and she said no, or for the entirety of the 6 months between my first wife asking for a divorce and finally being granted said divorce. You know, the first time around when I let my entire identity get wrapped up in who I was married to, the kid I was raising, the job I had, the car I drove and the money I was making.

I tried to read books, gave up in the first few pages, tried to take a walk, felt so sleepy and came back home, even riding my bike doesn't feel as fun as usually.
On Instagram I went to the search page, went to a post, and scrolled all the way down to the last suggested post, I didn't even know that page has an end. I close each YouTube video after few minutes for that it's not filling me with whatever I feel I want.

(saying yes before thinking seems to be quite a good method, at least to some extent...). Yesterday me and 3 of my high school friends went clubbing. I didn't know how it would go but I wanted to try and not think much about it. Before we got there I was fine. After we got there I was fine. But I don't know. I immediately started feeling like it's not for me. Exhaustingly loud music. People everywhere. I can't dance, didn't want to, couldn't get myself to try, I couldn't imagine it being fun. Even while being drunk I couldn't do it. Ended up sitting for the whole time. Alone, sourrounded by everyone having fun. I don't remember ever feeling as alone as there. It was some of the worst hours recently. We finally decided to move on. There are pubs everywhere on the street. As we go by one of them there's 2 employees standing next to the entrance. One of them says to us ""wanna get in for a beer"" and the second one goes ""don't you see his friend isn't even 17"" like wtf. Do I need to be constantly reminded that I look like an ugly kid? When I got back home I jumped into my bed, hugged a fucking curled up blanket and cried myself to sleep harder than anytime recently. Nothing makes me happy. I don't know what to do. The more I try the worse it is. Nothing good ever happens. I still can barely make a hair appointment. I'm failing uni. I can't even begin to look for a job even though I have more than enough qualifications to find a good one. Everything scares me. I just dream about a true, peaceful, close friendship. One in which we could be honest about our thoughts and feelings. I want to have someone I can hug. It's all I really want. But I can't imagine opening up more to a man. I've never had a female friend. Never been close to having one. A year ago I was so down I actually tried to talk to one I've known like 9 years ago. She was the closest to me. We never even talked before. And she was the closest. That's how pathetic I am. I don't know. Am I fated to be sad? Maybe I don't know how it's like not to be? Maybe I want to be sad?

Doing this made me have extremely depressive episodes but they calmed down  a bit after I moved yet again to another state over where I didn‚Äôt care what people thought of me at all because I was sick of wanting people to like me but I did find a group of people who I clicked really well with individually and we ended up all clicking well after a little while when we were in high school and were able to drive and do what we wanted more freely and we hung out about 4/7 days of the week but talking daily and I always wanted to move back to my hometown until about five months before I did due to the amazing people I met.

You know.. finding friends, or even someone you may love can be extremely hard and maybe just telling someone a simple good luck and a bit of thoughtful words might just make their day and keep them going.
 (This is what I do on my main reddit acount, this is a disposable account due to having a stalker still probably stalking my main account...) But when you give up that's when you lose the opportunity to make yourself better as a whole and I don't want anyone else feeling like that around me, it's sad and I know how it feels, I want everyone to be successful and live a happy life, and though I am rather alone myself I don't really care what other possible bad things happen to me, just as long as others are happy then that definitely puts a smile on my face as it is, tonight I am here sitting alone in my room just wondering how I can make new friends myself or even learn how to love someone, I never felt that emotion in my life before and it just feels very sad from time to time, but I trudge on, friends make me quite happy most times.
Being slightly tipsy doesn't help at all as my emotions get amplified but it fills in the loneliness, i'm not normally like this either, but I just wish I had someone to talk to, maybe even practice loving someone and maybe even make it real someday, I just never get the chances that I am willing to take, it's hard for me to make new friends with all this anxiety and awakwardness and it causes me to get ghosted, which is completely fair, I probably sound like i'm ranting but this is just what is going on in my mind, but I alsol feel like I wouldn't be able to be with a girl like how I dreamed of when I was younger, I act too soft, too feminine, too kind.. No girl wants that.. At least that's how they are where I live... They just want nothing but toughness, they want you to be strong, they want you to be the pack leader of the family... I sadly cannot do any of those things, and sometimes I wish I was born a girl, but alas I was born a guy who just so happens to like a lot of feminine things. Though I don't mind being with a guy, I always leaned a bit more towards a girl because I just always felt more comfortable around them. Guys in my past have treated me so poorly that other guys intimidate me easily..
I try to show care best I can to others but they almost always never seem satisfied with it, and I have my past to blame for making me seem so cold sometimes, I was abused by so many people from school throughout my whole life that I had to drop out during sophomore year of highschool or else I would have just ended my own life, it was too much for me.
This is the run down of my life, though I have had a ton more unfortunate things happen to me I don't really care to put it here as it would probably be as long as a Harry Potter novel, but here I am laying in my bed, slightly drunk and just almost giving up on life itself, I almost feeling like cutting again like last year..

I actually noticed him before I knew who he was. I thought he was adorable looking and ""guessed"" that it COULD be who I thought it was. I had that confirmed quickly after. 


Since then its been weird hallway glances, weird/silent/non-acknowledging interactions and even things that make me feel like I'm not exactly good enough in any aspect, let alone to be talking to him. He even went out of his way to run into me yesterday, without saying a word, and then purposefully *went to get MINE and MINE ALONE'S item after we were done*

I tried to make a joke with him a few weeks ago. I died laughing to myself, I'm guessing he took it a different way. It is so painfully awkward to me, and I would never overstep any sort of bounds but fuck, I'd really just like a friend and for some reason I feel like hes hiding his intelligence and humor with me. I see him act completely differently with everyone else.

I'll keep subtly trying for as long as I can though. I guess I just want to be acknowledged that I exist in multiple locations and that I really just would like a friend/mentor for the game. I feel bad for existing in his life as he clearly doesn't want me around, but I deserve to be where I'm at. I've earned it all and I work hard to fix the things I'm bad at (or am on my way to doing so). Can't we just go grab a friendly coffee one day and laugh it off? I guess I don't get it at all.

To me, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it to be chasing the love of those around me. But at the same time, it‚Äôs so lonely to not be sure if I even have the love of my own family members.

I‚Äôm barely 48 hours into a visit with my family and I just wanna go home. 48 hours in and I remembered that I‚Äôm barely apart of my family and they only tolerate me because I‚Äôm blood.",lonely,Isolating Family Visits,2019-08-12 12:49:58
1380,Xoroshego,1565576988,2,"This is supposed to be a rant about being lonely however it may evolve into various other things though oh well.  


I'm so bloody lonely.  I'm a ghost. I cling onto teddy bears when I lay down. I sometimes hold my own hand when sleeping. I yearn for someone to sit next to or even lay next to and simply EXIST with them, regardless of whether they are a friend or more. I wish I had people to share jokes with or to talk about things with such as history or geography. I do have a few internet friends however they have their own lives to deal with plus they can't be here next to me as they're thousands of miles away.

Whenever I interact with someone I feel so meaningless and ghostly. When I was 10 we moved countries and even though we speak the same language I don't fit in and people don't seem to understand me. Many years ago when I was still at secondary school someone once told me that they couldn't work me out. Whilst I want people to interact with it feels like it's pointless even trying now because of how many times I have been ghosted over the last few years by people from all backgrounds and personality types and it fucking hurts. Furthermore the country where I live now has a low population and a quick look at herr google says it's roughly the same population as los angeles or kolkata. This means that there are scarce options for things like support groups and meetups. 

Seriously I have no idea what to do I'm trying to find a job and I go to the gym and play in a social sports team though I am such a ghost and I am so distant from anyone. All this stuff makes me suicidal and I've felt like that for years and no therapies or medications have helped with that. 

Probably missed some stuff out though whatever. It really hurts.",lonely,I'm so bloody lonely,2019-08-12 12:29:48

Its gotten hard to go to sleep and wake up alone again. It's like, why am I alone? Sure I don't get out much, but I dont enjoy myself very much when I do. I wonder if somethings wrong with me. Hunter wants to go to quarter beer night this week. I'm hoping I'll get enough alcohol in me to numb the anxiety that comes with going out like that.

1409,NicBird,1565552514,1,"My mother has been humiliating me my whole childhood and I couldn‚Äôt do the things I‚Äôd want to. Recently I finished school (what was absolutely useless to me) and moved to a town. I‚Äôm planning on going to a college for the next 5 years. God, it feels good without my annoying parents and my annoying brother (no offense).
The thing is, everyone I talk to never wants talk to me again. I live in Russia, but were exposed to American culture quite well enough to make an impression of a real foreigner to everyone out here. Our values really differ. For example while I still believe in success on your own, every possible relative thinks that I‚Äôm a fool and a child, because ‚Äúyou only can get a job if you have an uncle who can get you there‚Äù, ‚Äúyou will never be able to get success on your own‚Äù, ‚Äúfinish a college, than you‚Äôll count as a human‚Äù, ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôll get older you‚Äôll understand that nobody gives a damn about you‚Äù (this one looks like true, but damn, what they try to achieve by saying this? great support, I‚Äôd say). Not to mention that I really struggle to share my emotions because they considered childish and girly (f-word, I‚Äôm so angry about it, I feel angry through my whole life because of it).
Once I visited a Skillet concert. A band that I grew up with (thanks for coming to Russia!) I met a girl there, and couldn‚Äôt find any common themes to talk. So I was just asking her about her town, in which I happened to move. She said that I was just using her. I guess people here don‚Äôt like chit chatting, that‚Äôs why on the concert I felt like I was talking to a wall. A guy nearby wasn‚Äôt responding to my casual questions and shoutouts.
I do like English, I‚Äôm obsessed with it. I like Stranger Things, I‚Äôm hyped about Cyberpunk 2077, really liked not that popular netflix‚Äôs 3%, but none of that matters here. Nobody speaks English, nobody heard what Stranger Things and 3% are (but, like, every first teen girl watches Riverdale) and only people I can discuss Cyberpunk 2077 with are a couple of youtube bloggers. It got to the point that sometimes I can‚Äôt recognize my native language. I speak too little to people out here and spend too many time watching shows and reading in English, that I started hear people speaking rubbish.
It feels really weird and lonely. Like I‚Äôm an orphan, or even worse. I can‚Äôt understand people, they can‚Äôt understand me, we both get mad at each other. What should I do? I can‚Äôt stop blaming myself, but I don‚Äôt know what my mistakes are. I‚Äôm too obsessed with an idea of escaping from here that I get paralyzed whole day by anxiety. As I turned 18 I tried alcohol. Though it really helped me with insomnia, I never bought another bottle again. I didn‚Äôt get addicted to it as my mom thought I could. After all there‚Äôs one feeling that‚Äôs I don‚Äôt want to drink away and that‚Äôs hope (disenchanted, also the show I have no freaking one to discuss with). But that hope annoys me. I wish there could be a way to disappear from this world, vanish. My mind tells me I‚Äôll never ever will feel any happy.

1411,Soul_Mining,1565550031,3,"I spent all my teenage years being afraid of people after being bullied as a kid. My only occupation were listening to music, playing guitar and translating song lyrics. After high school, I went to university and lost the pleasure of playing an instrument, also lost my creativity and stopped drawing as I used to do since I was a child. The only hobbies I had left were: discovering as many rock bands as I could and listening to them while smoking pot in my tiny student room. Alone, of course, because unable to trust people and make friends. 

All these years I was so unaware of the ""social codes"" that could've helped me having a social life or looking less awkward during social interactions. I was unaware of how to behave in social situations because I grew up aside from the others, I was a witness of other people's evolution. I witnessed them partying during weekends, having their first relationships, having their first sexual experiences (didn't literally witness it though, you know what I mean...), going on vacations with their friends... All the things that a healthy and happy teenager is supposed to do. All the things I didn't have the opportunity to do.

So as I was completely outside of this real social world, I entend up being totally disinterested of any information related with humanity. Let me explain my point. During high school, I couldn't care less about history and geography classes. I was somehow interested in philosophy but didn't keep any information in mind because I have some memory issues, or some sort of ADHD issue that hasn't been diagnosed yet (and maybe never will, it's just to give some context). Thing is, I hated school because of the social anxiety it made me experience, so I wasn't making any effort to be a good student. I finished my high school program on a literature specialty, but barely read the books I had to read because couldn't concentrate and wasn't interested in them. It's also maybe important to note that I've always had this strange behavior of not wanting to do what I was expected to, or not wanting to follow the movement. Anyway, today I regret that I didn't read all these books because they would've brought me some knowledge and would've helped me building my own beliefs and values. 

It's maybe important to add that my family is not strongly attached to political or spiritual values, neither attached to their mixed culture. I never had the chance to have conversations with my grandparents about what was life like when they were younger, because I don't know them. I miss the cultural background it could've brought to my life. 

Result of all this mess is now I see myself as an uncultured piece of shit. I don't know what I believe in and when I know something for a fact, I keep on feeling unsure about it. I'm interested in a lot of different things but can't really commit to them because it's harder to learn fast and efficiently when you're not a student anymore and have other shit to think about. I've been confronted several times to situations where I was really interested in a discussion subject but was afraid to participate because of my lack of knowledge. And in such situation you end up looking like a weirdo or if you happen to try participating, like someone who's not confident about was they say.

For a long time I've been wondering why it was so hard for me to make friends, or more exactly why I didn't appear as an interesting person to people. I still have strong views in music and arts, I'm defending animal and environmental causes, I'm open minded on a lot of subjects... But I eventually understood that I didn't come accross as confident in my own personal opinions and that it was the reason of my current social situation. I am always hesitating, never strongly affirmative even on the topics that I know.
I try to be more confident though, I am documenting on history, politics, philosophy, especially existentialism and nihilism. But I feel like I never know enough and especially like I don't share my knowledge in a way people would think ""okay she knows what she's talking about"". Being afraid of what other people think doesn't help of course, and even though you try to hide it, it always shines though in the end.

So here's the thing, today I am a 27 years old woman that doesn't feel like she belongs anywhere, that doesn't know what she believes in. The good point is I understand that it's mainly the cause of my loneliness and I'm trying to change it by reading, making research, watching documentaries. But I feel like as long as I don't build some knowledge and true opinions for myself, I will not be able to be a part of this society, socially (but not only) speaking.",lonely,"Believing in nothing, not being confident about anything : so is the reason why people don't find me interesting and don't want to become my friend.

1416,carrieesson,1565539784,7,"Just need to vent out. Ive just had my heart broken and I physically and mentally can‚Äôt handle it. 

I‚Äôve had three failed relationships that were toxic and unhealthy so I managed to heal from them pretty quickly, mostly because they didn‚Äôt treat me correctly so my sadness turned in to anger and it helped my healing process. I‚Äôve always wanted out of the relationships because I haven‚Äôt been happy, so it‚Äôs been easier for me to heal. 

After coming out a bad relationship I actually started to feel so much happier and more confident within myself. I was going to the gym, eating healthy, spending time with friends, doing things on my own and enjoying my own company. I felt so confident within myself because there was no one in my life bringing me down. No drama or arguments. 

I decided to go on a few dates but never saw them again cause there was no connection. Then I met a guy and I just clicked instantly with him. We started to spent time together, going for long walks on the beach, going to the cinema, we spoke every day, the sex was so intimate and emotional, I genuinely thought he was amazing.

He was the sweetest any man had ever been towards me. Kind, caring, cute. He told me he was falling in love with me, that he was excited about our future, that I was amazing, perfect, that he was lucky to be dating me. We agreed not to see anyone else and he told me he wanted a relationship with me in the future but we agreed to take it slowly. We booked tickets for events that are in October. We told our family and friends about each other. For the first time in years, a man actually made me have butterflies, was giving me hope, and I just really enjoyed being with him and talking to him. I felt so happy.

Then last week things started to change through messenger and he was acting distant. He told me he was depressed because his gran is dying, even though he hasn‚Äôt spoken to her in over 10 years his dad was upset so it was an unhappy household. He was due to start working for a company but they were messing him around and taking ages getting documents etc all set up for him to start working, so he was broke and depressed because he had no money and wasn‚Äôt in a proper daily routine. He was being open about his emotions which I thought was a positive thing. I‚Äôm also going through some physical health problems at the moment so it seemed like we were both helping each other through a tough time. 

But he just kept acting more and more withdrawn. We agreed to see each other on Tuesday and I would try my best to cheer him up, and I‚Äôve really been looking forward to it. But this morning I received a message from him saying he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs in the mental state to progress with anyone in a romantic relationship, I am absolutely heartbroken and devastated and can‚Äôt stop crying.

This hurts more than the ending of previous relationships, because he‚Äôs not actually treated me badly and now I‚Äôm mourning the fantasy of what could have been.

I don‚Äôt understand it, how can someone say they‚Äôre falling in love with me and be excited about our future, and the next minute say he‚Äôs not in the right place for a relationship? 

I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôm willing to take it slowly, to help him through whatever he‚Äôs going through, and asked him not to push a good thing away just because he‚Äôs having a few tough weeks mental health wise.

I just feel so confused, hurt, devastated and rejected. I opened up my heart to him, showed him my vulnerability and he‚Äôs crushed me. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs making up excuses about his mental health or if he actually was just lying and doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me at all.

If we both have feelings for each other I don‚Äôt get why it has to be complicated. All I want to do is see him and hold him and beg him to give us a chance, but I have to keep my self respect. 

I can‚Äôt eat and all I want to do is lay in my bed and cry. Why does no one want me or appreciate me? Why cant someone just love me? I have so much to offer, and no one appreciates it. I feel so empty and lonely ‚òπÔ∏è and like an absolute fool for falling for someone. I wish my heart wasn‚Äôt so fragile and sensitive ü•∫",lonely,Heartbroken,2019-08-12 02:09:44

You have know idea who they are, or how they got there, bit they are trying their best in a losing battle. You are not alone. So I beg of you, get up. Help others so that they can help you.

As the title says, the worst part about feeling this way is being surrounded by ""friends"" but having no real things in common. I experience that all the time and it sucks. I don't expect everyone to be exactly like me, but nobody ever asks how I'm doing even though I have a lot of stressful shit coming up in my life. I recently went on a trip for a MONTH and came back and just as a test wanted to see what happened when I went back to work. Not a single person even said hello to me, I had to start the conversation by saying hello, even after being gone for a month. and you could tell they didn't even want to talk to me. And nobody asked me how it went or anything. I have no real friends and it sucks. I also am an only child and have no real family whatsoever besides my parents which kinda blows because I have nobody to bounce ideas off of. The millennial generation is very hard to socialize with especially if you choose to not have a Facebook or Instagram account. It's just a personal choice of mine I prefer real life engagements but it seems like I'm the only one who feels this way. Not gonna lie, every once in a while I have fleeting thoughts of driving off a fucking bridge even though I never would, I'm sure every once in a while everyone feels this way. I have talked to many girls even who prefer to text instead of talk and eventually I just get frustrated and block them. What is wrong with young people these days?

I also don't have unreasonable expectations, and also not trying to get in any woman's pants I can get or any other bullshit. I'm pretty modest. I've seriously talked to maybe 2 dozen woman and first what they do is try to find common ground with you, then they find one thing that differs between the two of you, and they stop talking to you, ghost you completely and reject you.

Im very much a minimalist with most things, especially digital clutter and have slowly cut out social media from my life for a lot of the obvious reasons. Completely deleted Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr, Ive never really used anything else. Of course I use Reddit but I dont really view Reddit as being in the same boat as the others and I have a Twitter account but I only use it for news and to keep up with whats going on in the world, I dont post or interact. The thing thats bothering me is, well, I feel so disconnected and alone more than ever now! I dont have any friends left IRL (literally zero), no one to shoot a text to, no family other than my parents, I dont really get out much, the usual lonely life you may encounter on this sub I suppose. And now, even though I never used the platforms much to begin with before deleting them, not having access to them at all has me feeling weird, Idk what the deal is. Its not an addiction thing though, nor is it FOMO. I just crave the need to interact with people and share my interests with others who share similar interests. I dont even want to watch the shows I like because I dont have anyone to share my love for them with. But at the same time, its like, okay, what would I post on Instagram if created a new one? Id end up posting random shit from movies or something, I dont have enough of a life to post anything personal or any friends. Same goes for Facebook but adding the fact I dont know anyone to add on Facebook Id just be lurking the groups like I did before. And Twitter? Sure, people tweet about a lot of stuff I have an interest in but no one really discusses anything, its mostly a lot of yelling into the void or brief interactions. 

It just all feels so fleeting and meaningless I suppose and thats why I left them to begin with. But never the less, it seems everyday I struggle with wanting to jump into Twitter and fuck around but what will that ultimately do for me? Then on the flip side to all of this, its like I KNOW what I should do and what I NEED to do to be happy, I just dont have the energy to. Like I know what I really need is to get out and make some friends, real life connections with real people I can reach out and touch and not worry so much about social media. Or that if I want to share my interests on a mass scale, maybe get back into making art and music and create an account for sharing that and branch out from there instead of mindless chatter about movies or TV or something, ya know, share MY work with the world. I just dont feel motivated enough to do that at the moment though. I feel like if I just had SOMETHING to keep me slightly distracted or amused socially that I would feel better about doing those things.

1458,Mantha065,1565494309,1,"20 year old college drop-out, stuck living with my toxic family, jobless (sort of. working part time at my dad's factory helping out in the office six hours a week), suffering from severe depression and social anxiety disorder. I have a sparse handful of friends, several of them very close, but only two do I regularly talk to and occasionally hang out with. Obviously, given my major anxiety I'm a definite introvert, but I can survive conversations with strangers for the most part, despite being extremely uncomfortable with doing so irl.

The main problem is that I don't have any opportunities to meet people my age and make friends, or find a potential romantic partner. I'm not attending any school, I never leave the house except to go to work at the office (my dad and I are the only people \*in\* the office, and everyone else are 30-40 year old factory employees, not the kinds of people I'd like to talk to), so I have zero physical, irl opportunities to talk to people. As for the internet...I've tried Bumble and Tinder. I must have seen hundreds upon hundreds of profiles and only ever matched with one person, but a week of texting them made me realize they weren't my type. I'm in several Discord servers, and that's where I've made another tiny handful of friends, but never anything more. Obviously it's Discord, 95% of people there are there for videogames and Youtube (including me), so it's quite limited in terms of ""meeting people."" And that's it for the internet, those are the only places I know where I could meet someone I want to date or make friends (respectively).

So. I'm kinda fuck-outta-luck. I have nowhere to go in real life and hate going anywhere in my town anyway, and I guess I just don't know enough reputable places to meet/befriend people on the internet.

1474,DannyDefeatAHoe,1565482302,16,"Ok so this is my first post here. I'll try to just cut the bs and keep it as short as I can.

Is anyone else single, craving an actual relationship with someone, but holding themselves back because they're afraid they're not ready or not good enough?

That's basically the story of my life right now. I'm a 22 year old female and I have never had an actual relationship. I was in an online situationship when I was a teenager. It lasted a couple years and that's the closest I've ever come to love.

I struggle socially, I can't even make friends. I try to make friends online but either don't connect well with others or just eventually lose contact because the other person grows apart and falls into their own life. Which is completely understandable, it just leaves me feeling sad and alone. Its hard to really connect with people and keep that connection. It just falters over time and it's so sad to feel it crumbling.

Anyways, I'm at that point where a part of feels ready for something serious. I want it. But a big part of me screams no. My mind convinces me that I'll never be ""normal"" enough or good enough for that. I see so many people my age who are in love and it makes me feel so sad. I get depressed over it sometimes and will cry myself to sleep.

I can't even look people in the eyes. I can't start conversations, can't ever really partake in them. I just don't feel comfortable socially. Its holding me back from work as well. I've been putting in applications but the ones I actually want don't come through. I've gotten one call back - McDonald's - but didn't bother responding because the time I put down for work clashes with my transportation. Which is another issue, I don't drive yet.

I go to school and will thankfully be starting the fall semester soon. That's literally all I've got. I know, I need to work on becoming independent and going to school is the first step for me. I waited years to be able to go and now that I am, it's great. But it's not exactly what I thought it would be. I've been sheltered my whole life and now that I'm an adult, I feel like I'm drowning. I know I need to just jump in but damn, it's hard and it's scary.

I hear different things when it comes to love. ""Just put yourself out there, they'll love you exactly as you are."" ""Build yourself up first, put the best version of you out there."" ""If you wait until you're ready, you'll always be waiting."" ""Just wait, the right guy will chase you and show you he really cares."" Blah. Blah. Blah.

I'm lonely. Extremely lonely. But I also just don't feel good enough to try. Its gotten to the point I don't even want to try to just make friends anymore. I'm always left out and left behind. I'd rather just be lost in that loneliness at times than to risk getting hurt again and again. Same old song and dance.

Anyone else relate? Anyone got any tips to cope or any advice? Its obviously something I'd have to work on myself but I feel so overwhelmed with life and don't even know where to begin. Its not that I don't want to - I just don't know how. There's times I stop and think about it and literally feel this heaviness and it's hard to breath. I wouldn't call it a panic attack, just this overwhelming rush of uncertantity. Nothing I can't handle or get through, thankfully. I just wish sometimes there was someone who genuinely cared and was there for me, not to hurt or use me. Which unfortunately, has happened several times over.

I was a seriously sad baby (Id think it was because I could feel the bad vibe from my parents) and my dad didn‚Äôt know what to do about me crying, so he would spank me for crying so much.

It's not that their friendships are bad by any means; it's just I generally find viewing their posts unproductive. Un-following is also great because it doesn't make me look like a dick to people I'm connected with (they don't know that I un-followed them).

1495,LonelyIndian472,1565458508,1,"I've just created this account to type my feelings out because I have no one to share them with. 

I have lived my whole in the country mentioned in my username. Now I am a lower middle class guy in a college full of rich folks in the same country. 

Upto 10th grade, I was in one school, I had a lot of friends, and while I was introverted, I was really close with a big tight nit circle of friends (both girls and guys). I changed my school after 10th grade and made the biggest mistake of my life: became a recluse. I don't know why I did it, but I started deserting my decade old friends. I was moving to a more affluent school and I guess my 14 year old self thought that I would start a new and better life and leave the introverted self behind. That failed. I had a new group of close friends now, although much smaller. Still, life was good. 

After that I joined a good college, and the worst chapter of my life began. I stay in a men only dorm. I don't go to classes because I prefer learning from the internet. I have never been an outgoing person. So I don't have any friends outside my dorm. All men. These ""friends"" only care about getting girls, which I don't really care about. I honestly wouldn't have any problem with being a recluse, but the ""friends"" that I know ridicule and look down upon me for having ""no life"", especially for having no female friends. I am fed up of this shit. Of course I'd like to have a few close friends and a girlfriend to share my feelings with. But I am too introverted to chase after girls like these other guys in college do. This constant ridicule for having no life is taking a toll on me. A part of me wants to just study good and have a great career ahead of me, but I know that I am not special. I start every day happily, but I am brought down by these fucks. 

I know that this post is not coherent at all. But I just wanted to let my feelings out.

TLDR: I made the biggest mistake of my life by deserting my old friends. These new ""friends"" ridicule me for having no life and no girl friends.",lonely,"My sad little life upto college, will it ever be better?",2019-08-11 03:35:08

They didn't really care about me or how I felt; they just saw me as a free therapist to vent to, or a scapegoat for their problems. For example, one friend blamed me for her depression because I didn't try hard enough to fix it for her.

In hindsight, I can see how screwed up my friendships, but at the time, I felt like I deserved to be treated like crap (a decade of abuse will do that to you lololol). Eventually, as I pursued therapy and my state of mind improved, I realised that I deserved better than the way my friends were treating me. I cut them out of my life, and I don't regret it.

From time to time, though, I get hit with waves of loneliness. I do have friends, but they all live pretty far away (I had to move for work and I haven't really made friends in my new city yet). I still have a couple of the less toxic people from the group on Facebook, and sometimes, I see photos of all of my old friends hanging out. My rational brain tells me that I'm not missing out because they all treated me like crap anyway. But, my emotional lizard brain still makes me feel lonely because of it from time to time.

I'm not going to go into it again with the backstory suffice it to say everything leading up until the day I told her how I felt made me believe she felt the same. She didn't.

And it‚Äôs funny, because a part of me feels like I‚Äôm not really in a position to be turning girls down. After all, rejection is a huge fear of mine. It feels like the other part of me doesn‚Äôt want me to love other people when I can hardly even learn to love myself. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve subconsciously always known that there are things that I need to work on, but I just never had the sense to act on fixing them.

I wouldn‚Äôt say that my life is void of people who care about me, or that it‚Äôs even void of people who offer me shoulders to cry on. But I do think it‚Äôs void of people who can completely empathize with me, or people who just generally understand exactly where I‚Äôm coming from. I have friends, but sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm not entirely myself when I‚Äôm around them. I‚Äôm the kind of guy who isn‚Äôt entirely comfortable at a get-together unless I‚Äôm drunk as hell and laughing at everything around me. And many times in my life, I‚Äôd show up to places early merely to accomplish that. Just getting so fucked up that I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about stumbling over my words or looking like an idiot. My friends aren‚Äôt bad friends. I just don‚Äôt like myself, and I don‚Äôt like being myself. I‚Äôm not comfortable in my own skin. 

I‚Äôm about to start my sixth year of college (I know, I‚Äôm taking a pretty freakin‚Äô long time), with a planned seventh year to wrap up my degree. I‚Äôm studying music education; I‚Äôm a trombonist. There was a time in which I absolutely loved playing the trombone, and it was within my first three years of college, when I was attending community college. Now I‚Äôm at university, and when I first got here, I was assigned to a student teacher who completely tore me apart. The story could get pretty long if I were to type it out, but that first year at university killed any love I had for what I‚Äôm doing. Since then, I‚Äôve been studying under a different teacher and he‚Äôs been teaching me to love and appreciate myself, but that initial damage is still done. I no longer feel the same spark that I once felt. I‚Äôve been trying very hard to love it again, but it‚Äôs easier said than done, and only time will dictate how I will end up feeling. I have absolutely no plans to change my career, because I know that this is what I‚Äôm meant to do. But my mind is in a rut, and I need to keep trying to get out of it.

At this point, I feel like I‚Äôm just spouting a bunch of stupid crap, so I‚Äôll wrap it up with this last point. I‚Äôm a God-fearing man, and occasionally I find myself on my knees begging and praying for help with figuring this shit out. If there‚Äôs a God and if he‚Äôs listening to me, I‚Äôm sure he knows that I‚Äôm a stupid piece of crap, and anything I ever ask for is entirely selfish. I like to imagine that he‚Äôs got his hand on my shoulder right now, watching me type this and he‚Äôs trying to say something like, ‚ÄúHey, you big doof. I‚Äôve got this figured out.

Hiya! I'm from Tunisia, but I speak English, French and Arabic fluently and am learning German = ) (I can also speak some Spanish but I forgot a lot of it). let's talk about ourselves, meaningful things, seriously get to know each other, understand our different points of view (even though we don't agree on a lot of stuff). let's share our problems, make each other feel like we're really friends, not strangers who feel compelled to text each other because they don't want to suddenly ghost. also please try to find topics to talk about, It sucks feeling like the other party doesn't want to talk as much, so let's not let each other feel that way.

Maybe we share some things in common, maybe not. It doesn't matter, as long as you're open-minded, and willing to share your thoughts with me, I'll share mine too, and it'll be a nice bonding.

To be a little specific, I like to think I have good taste in music, I like seeing art, writing poetry occasionally. I like to be eclectic until I find the one thing that makes me passion-driven, yet I haven't yet, which is why I'm trying to experience and try out all the opportunities I can get to. I'm always open to trying out something new. I'm learning web development, languages, occasionally gaming, and overall talking about interesting topics. I'm open to anime and series recommendations too!

Be kind, nice, open and respectful. Don't make me feel judged, and I'll try to do that as much as I can, too. I can help you with whatever I can (I guess I can call myself an extrovert and a sociable person. At least that's what people see me as), so if you want to know stuff about things I have experience with (extra-curricular, a little bit of entrepreneurship, event organizing, journalism, etc.)

Part of becoming close friends is trust and mutual support. Open up to me, and I'll do the same for you, even if it'll be very hard. Maybe someday we can add each other on our more private social media, such as facebook. For now, let's stick to discord, if you have one, or the less compelling option, Reddit chat.

Pm me and we'll see if we can become good friends = ) Looking forward to hearing from everyone, don't hesitate &lt;3

1535,reddituser1011123425,1565398944,2,"Hi everyone I think something is mentally wrong with me to start. Let me tell you what I believe is causing my depression. I have posted here before and here is what I said:

‚ÄúI feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.‚Äù

I realized that my depression doesn‚Äôt have much to do with her. It was the dream I had that I can now never fulfill. I can never take a girl I like to a dance with my friends and have a great time. I can‚Äôt go to those games with a girl I care about. In fact I can‚Äôt do anything now because it‚Äôs over. I feel as if I never had the time I wanted to in high school and I feel as if I failed. I can‚Äôt move on because I have this need to finish what I started and the fact that this dream is dead I feel as if I have died with it. It‚Äôs all that mattered to me and now I have nothing besides 4 years of regret. To anyone who comments I know this may sound pointless to you but this was the dream I created and the dream I spent countless hours trying to achieve. All my struggles and successes are in that dream. Hopefully you can understand that if you worked as hard as I did and when you reached the moment when all your hard work was about to pay off you missed your chance and all you had to do was just was just say tell someone you like them and the dream would have been complete. I understand that yes she could have broken my heart but at least I would have got some kind of reward but instead I leave empty handed. The money that I earned means nothing without the dream. My chance to have a high school relationship is over and I am just done. Maybe I am crazy for being so depressed and suicidal for not completing what I wanted but please give your honest opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid she's completely forgotten me and that she's just gonna ignore me all night. The reason I wanted to talk to her two months back was because I wanted to make it clear how much I'm grateful for everything she's done for me and that I'm sorry I'm this way (we broke up because I didn't want to do anything all day since I feel pretty shitty about myself).

I didn't say anything and went into my dark room, staring out into the night city. Thinking about suicide. About ending this miserable existence. About slitting my wrist or maybe building an exit bag to suffocate peacefully. And now I decided to make a rant about my life on reddit.
My last year has been hell. I finished high school and was kind of happy for a while. Then things started going downhill, I started isolating myself because of my acne and I started smoking weed to distract myself, which made the isolation and social anxiety worse. (If you are struggling or feeling down, don't do drugs, it will not make anything better and probably just make things worse, only do drugs if you are happy and mentally healthy)
I had to start doing a mandatory job for my country (civil service) and things were going a bit better but I ended up getting fired after a few months over a stupid thing. Things went even further downhill from there, I completely isolated myself and rarely went outside my house anymore for half a year up till now. But I was completely in denial about my situation, I pretended everything was okay and that I was happy and I just did nothing and smoked weed and sat infront of my PC all day. My parents obviously think I'm a loser/failure, they are annoyed of me and I understand them. I can count the friends I have left on one hand and never even meet them. On top of that I have dealt with ADHD and bullying all throughout school. I am traumatised from the start. I suffer from several mental health issues: ADHD, social anxiety, depression (sometimes manic), paranoia, mild derealization and depersonalization and a generally distraught psyche, I feel like I'm going more insane each day. I can't sleep well and often have nightmares that show me my subconscious suffering and self loathing and fears. (I became more and more self aware and self analytical, which just made things even worse)
I am always tired and exhausted, my head always hurts and feels groggy to the point I want to smash it into concrete. Also I am extremely insecure about looking like im 14 or 15 when I'm almost 19, about my pale skin from staying inside all day, about my eye circles from never sleeping well, about my acne leftovers and about my hair and I am so insecure that I don't even want to go to the barber. And in 1-2 months I should start going to college, which I absolutely can't imagine happening at the moment. I really just want to get out of this weird existence, it would be so much easier, I hate that I have friends and family that would miss me, it's like you are trapped in this suffering through your loved ones. Also I have lost my faith in god over this past year, which has made everything so much worse. I became completely nihilistic. Why am I here? I'm just an intelligent monkey that randomly appeared in this universe, just to suffer. Why? Anyways, I just wanted to rant my heart out and am feeling better already. Maybe somebody can talk to me or leave me a comment, idk. Oh just a cherry on top: I had a crush in high school and she kinda liked me and we even got close one time when we were drunk, but nothing more happened. She now has a boyfriend and is happy while I am just thinking about that evening all the time in my isolated suffering. I am obviously still a virgin, didn't even have my first kiss, I am almost 19, WTF is wrong with me. Inside me I feel like I have this potential for love and sexuality, I feel like if I just had a girl and was normal/confident, we would be so happy together and I would give her all of my love and try to make her happy.

1552,Camermon,1565372312,1,"I've noticed that a lot of the posts on here are about being lonely romantically. And I totally understand that, I'm feeling that too.

But I'm also very lonely just in general. I have 0 friends &amp; life is feeling pretty empty at the moment. I miss having someone just to say hello to every day. I miss asking how someone's doing and finding out about their day. I just miss having someone.

So I just thought I'd post this in case anyone out there is in the same boat &amp; would like someone to talk to. I know it would help me so I'd love to help someone in return who is feeling the same! 

I guess I'll tell you a little bit about myself in case you want to see if we'd have anything in common:

My name is Cameron. I am 24. I'm from the UK. I'm a gamer geek &amp; love Pokemon! I'm also really into YouTube. I have a Minecraft channel that is growing really fast &amp; currently has 5000 subscribers! Hoping to start a Pokemon channel soon too. I'm also into Music &amp; play the guitar. I've traveled a lot, love the outdoors &amp; love animals. I also like sports &amp; going to the gym. I'm sure there's a lot more things I'm forgetting haha.

But yeah, I think it'd be cool to have a friend. If you also have no friends, maybe we can help each other out!

Either way, have a nice day everyone. Keep your heads up!",lonely,Would anyone here like to be friends?,2019-08-10 03:38:32

1565,Throwaway_66687,1565349217,2,"TLDR and Disclaimer: This post has a lot of strong language and alludes to suicidal tendencies, you have been warned. This is just me trying to prove a lot of you have good lives and I want to see you all succeed and be happy. If not for anyone else but yourself, the most important person in your life. Marked as NSFW for the last sentence of this and some of the imagery.  


Listen the point of the post isn't to pity party myself. Nor is it to put anyone down. I am merely just trying to add some perspective to some posts I have seen. Some examples:  


‚Ä¢I often avoid my friends who invite me out.  
‚Ä¢I feel like I don't have any friends, then proceeds to explain things that friends have said to them.   
‚Ä¢I feel like I will never find anyone.  
‚Ä¢Mundane and often destructive advice ""Go volunteer""; ""Go to a bar""; ""Get out of the house"".   


First off, I empathize with you and I feel for you. Trust me on this if there is one cliche thing I will say, you probably have it way, way better I did then a few years ago. So let me backtrack to 19 years old me.  I recently got dumped by my 18 yo GF. Why? Well, to be fair, the other guy was way better looking and had infinitely more of his shit together than me, albeit at 40 years old, but hey, love is love right? However, it devalued me immensely, especially when I found out that my boss at the fast food place I was working at also tried flirting with her. It felt like my time, space and existence was just straight not respected. I was also too young to know what I know now too. But after being catfished in one of the worst ways possible (sending me to a house they didn't even live at) and just months of literally no one talking to me. I decided that I was just going to straight stop caring. About everything, I mean literally everything. I overate, I barely bathed, I ignored literally everyone.  


Sounds like heaven right? Sounds like the normal problems everyone has, right? Let me just say this is what a lot of people don't tell you. Eventually, the text messages stop, eventually people stop trying to initiate with you, eventually, people do in fact give up and don't want you around. I completely isolated myself after awhile. I had a few really close friends that I would go to their house and whatnot, but outside of that my weekends were primarily spent in my parents house in my room on my computer either jacking off to some chick on a website that would be completely unrealistic of me to even be with or playing video games taking from a dude built like an elephant trunk. I even felt that it wouldn't matter if I had died. No one would ever suspect it be suicide. It would almost be a by-product of my lifestyle and no one would even care. I was so far in denial and depression.   


A lot of you think ""Man I haven't talked to anyone in months, what's wrong with me"", yeah? Well, try years my friend? Try living with a roommate that just didn't even notice you or care about you with only their hand out. Try having parents that literally stopped asking about grandchildren and friends in general. If you never have actually experienced people literally giving up in you, this is that path. There are a few things I have learned during this period in my life. 1) No one cares about your problems and everyone has their own. 2) No one is going to even if I fixed my problems.   


At this point in my story, you might think this is where I met my beautiful SO and that it was all sunshine and rainbows and that I am here to tell you never to give up on what you want out of life. Well, no, you came to the wrong thread. This person doesn't exist and get them out of your head, it isn't going to happen. It will never happen if it hasn't happened yet. Self-improvement isn't about someone coming into your life and fixing it. It's you, realize that there are problems and you picking yourself up and you setting things right. It's you all you. Don't feel bad about this, ever. You need the strength to carry yourself and others. I know to some of you this has happened but you are part of an extremely low percent and are incredibly lucky and I am genuinely happy for you. But for the rest of us, magic girlfriend or boyfriend isn't going to come and save you from your depression. Its a horrifically unrealistic and unfair expectation you set for other people. What I did do was literally wake up one morning and just said ""my life sucks"". It did, the only time I ever got texts were about my bills. Emails? You mean coupons that were feeding my suicidal overeating tendencies? I did have work but even there people kept their distance from me.   


I am still in the process of trying to find my own happiness and yeah it would be nice if I had a GF. But now is not the time for that as it wouldn't be fair. I am just trying to take baby steps and learn how to be social again. Which sucks in your 30's. But I identified my issues, lost weight, looking for new work. When I play video games I make sure to play multiplayer games with a strong community. I have a clan in Destiny where we all communicate with one another. It's not impossible to dig yourself out of this grave. What I will tell you is that you can save yourself. What I will tell you is that you are not as abnormal as you may feel or broken as you may feel. You might just have to work for it harder than others. You might not even be aware of how lucky you are to have people in your life. You truly are, but I am not going to take those bad feelings away from you. If you are feeling them, then just acknowledge why and assess yourself a little. Find out why and most importantly seek help. If it wasn't for a psychologist and me opening my mouth to some of those I called friends I guarantee you I would be somewhere unknown either treating myself like a Christmas ornament or with a 9mm in my head. Don't underestimate the lives you actually have and really don't take your loved ones for granted! I made this mistake and I don't want to see anyone else travel down this road. Please don't take this as me attempting to further devalue you, take this as, damn, I really have it better than this guy. If this dip\*\*\* can do better so can I.",lonely,Some of you don't know true lonlieness....(31 M),2019-08-09 21:13:37

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat),2019-08-09 12:06:09
1593,DrRubberduck,1565316366,5,"I‚Äôve been struggling with depression since I was 12. This feeling has never gone away or faded even a little since then. I‚Äôm now 26 and I thought that I had learned to live with it. I guess I was wrong because it‚Äôs been getting progressively worse over the last six months.
 
I recently went through some major life changes that have left me feeling lonely. Which is a feeling that I have very little experience with. Not because I have many friends or anything like that, quite the opposite in fact. I used to be a person who enjoyed locking myself in my room and being alone. For me, this was much more interesting and fun than leaving my house. I still feel that way for the most part.

I‚Äôm not sure what changed but I can‚Äôt shake this lonely feeling. I‚Äôve been reaching out to people on subreddits dedicated to making friends. However, I haven‚Äôt been having any luck and I‚Äôm beginning to feel like I‚Äôve forgotten how to keep the other person interested. I find myself getting ghosted even though I put in my best effort to give an appropriately lengthy response to the other person. Most conversations don‚Äôt make it past the ‚Äúsmall talk‚Äù phase.
 
The reason I‚Äôm beginning to think this way is because my six-year relationship ended back in October. My mind has convinced me that the length of this relationship made me forget how to make friends. This concern has made my depression even worse than it already was. Further amplified by the fact that I‚Äôm now single and available to begin dating again. 

About three years ago, I moved from my home city to a different city in another province with my now ex. Last week, I moved back to my home city and randomly ran into a former crush at a local department store. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt get to say hello to each other, even though we both recognized one another. So, I reached out to her online and we held a decent conversation for a couple days but eventually my message didn‚Äôt get a response. All of this has me feeling like I‚Äôm in High School again and it‚Äôs really stressing me out. Questions like ‚ÄúShould I send another message?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs it weird to do that?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat if she‚Äôs not interested?‚Äù keep popping up into my head.

I‚Äôm not sure what I want from making this post. I think this is more to put my feelings out there in the hopes that I can figure out how to proceed from here, but please feel free to offer up some advice or share your thoughts on the situation. Perhaps you‚Äôll be able to give me some insight.

  However, a couple of days ago I was invited to a friend's birthday party. I knew most people who were gonna be there were the same people I always feel left out being around. I was heavily considering staying at home and watching Netflix. In the end though I decided I should go.

  To save a lot of boring details, I didn't feel left out or uneasy. We danced, ate, drank, drove around and laughed. I felt happy and content with the people around me, which was never easy for me to feel that. The night that I thought would end in an hour max I spent almost 6 hours in.

  I guess what I'm trying to say is that even if your life is nothing but bad days, that will make you appreciate that one good day when it comes.

1617,ThrowawayMan229,1565290974,20,"A month ago I got into a political argument with my ex (we've been broken up over a year). Safe to say, it pretty much ruined any chance of friendship we had left, and it caused another wayward friend to abandon me completely.

Safe to say I was in the wrong for instigating, I should've just left it alone. At the end of it, after gleefully spilling out why she dumped me and calling me a f*g, she called me a ""lonely loser"". 

It didn't hurt much at first, it was politically motivated, despite her being a bitch in the end. But that last comment really did me in. It was the only thing she said that was true. I have hobbies, I exercise, I can hold a job, but its pretty much all I have. And through most of it, I'm by myself.

I have a couple friends, but I rarely see them in real life, and they're the kind that don't really like talking everyday. And I don't want to be clingy, so there will always come the moment where I'm in my room working and I immediately stop. This sadness just comes over me. I'll think I'm a failure at my passions, or that I'm romantically repulsive, etc, but the source will always come back to the realization that I just want someone to talk to. About anything.

My social life pretty much collapsed a few months after our breakup, and it hasn't gotten much better since. I've made one friend, and just barely kept hold of the other one I had remaining. That whole time I tried to re-teach myself how to meet people, but no great opportunities were coming my way. There was only one I could think of, and it was so far off.

Well now its a week away. I'm moving into a dorm at a university. I don't know what to expect, but I know its going to be the biggest opportunity I'll have for a long time. I've already sent emails to like 15 different clubs; its such a luxury to have all these chances at interaction before me to choose from. If one club isn't doing it for me, I can try another; there's no reason to be desperate anymore. 

But yet, I can't shake what she said, and it pisses me off because a new era is just around the corner, and I can't feel excited for it. I'm sure that'll change once I get there. But there's nothing taking this badge of shame off right now. 

I dreamed of somehow sticking it to her, displaying that she was wrong by simply being too preoccupied to care, whether it be through a social life, my hobbies, both. It's not possible, I'll likely never see her again. But then the thought occurred to me that maybe its not so much about proving something to her, but proving something to myself. This past year and a half has been my worst so far, but I feel I've done a good job rising above most of the bad. This loneliness is the last shred of it, and I'm confident I can make it go away.

1625,streetsmarts856,1565282558,0,"Months ago my ""best friend"" asked me to go to Disney with her, her mom and her sister, and I was honestly shocked bc she always seems to want nothing to do with me so I said yes and thought we'd have a good time and we get here and I just feel like I'm intruding on someones family vacation. The way they act sometimes it's like I'm unwanted, they want to do absolutely nothing, my friend (who is 25 years old) acts like if she leaves her mom's side she'll die. We were in epcot and it was late but we only saw the front part and before we even get to the world showcase her mom lets her sister decide that they aren't going to go around bc her feet hurt and I was like well I'm going and looked at my friend and she was like I'm going to go sit up at the front too. Okay. So walked around Epcot by myself one day, we get to another park the next day and I asked if they were planning on going on rides (history shows the answer is no) and I was like I don't want to just wait for y'all to wait in line to take pictures with people if that's all you're doing I can go ride myself, and didn't answer me and I go in a store to get coffee and they just walked away without me and when I walked to where they were planning on going and told them I was there they said they were all the way across the park on a ride and let me do the whole park alone. And I'm an independent person who is not afraid to do shit alone but Disney is just something you don't do alone. 

I was in line for a ride and this couple was playing heads up in line and I was like this is what I thought this whole trip would be like but it's just been my friend and her mom only wanting to do one thing and not giving af what anyone else wants. I know when I take friends on vacation my mom nor the rest of my family would let our guest walk around alone. Not to mention the fact that if we're sitting somewhere they're all on their phones talking in their family group chat, and my friend is constantly on the phone with her gf or her other friends. 

I feel like the end of our friendship has been written on the wall for a while and I've been ignoring it because I have no one else I talk to like her, Ill have a thought and pick up my phone to tell her and I feel like I've been hesitating to do that for months and this week has been a demonstration of how little she values our friendship.

1629,foosn2s,1565276247,4,"That's where I'm at now. I'll start by saying I'm not suicidal at all, but I really just don't want to wake up tomorrow. On paper I should be a really happy person. I mean, I'm loved and supported by my family, I frequently get to do/visit things I'm passionate about, and I'm pretty well off financially. 

And that's about where the good stuff ends. It's been about two and a half years since I've been in a relationship. I mean, yeah, I've missed it, but it didn't really bother me until earlier this year when I caught feelings for someone for the first time since then. Everything went so well at first, then I got chewed up and spit out like it was some kind of joke. It stung for a while, but I then realized how much I valued and missed that physical touch and connection. At this point that's what my heart needs. It's partially my fault since I'm extremely selective on who I allow in my life.

This frustrates me more than anything because I've never desired validation or anything like this before. When it came I surely welcomed it, but I never needed. And I'm not even sure if that's the right word to use. I've never needed anyone to share my life with - but it's all I want now. I felt like I was so close twice after that, but leave it to me [probably] to ruin it. 

About two months ago I slipped and really hurt my knee, which got much better after a day or so. I thought it had taken care of itself, but a few weeks ago it started to flare up again, and it's taken a lot of drive out of my life. I've made some major lifestyle changes this year which have made me happier, but I can't do it now. Hiking and nature walks have been my biggest stress relief, but now they're a stress inducer. I haven't been able to do either of them in nearly a month and I just feel gross again. This weekend I get to do one of my favorite things (that involves standing for a long time), and I'm honestly so nervous that I won't make it, or won't enjoy it. My job requires me to be on my feet the entire shift and I come home daily just wanting to cry from the pain. I know I would feel infinitely better if I had someone to comfort me. I then recognize that, and usually end up shedding a tear or two.

I've always been a believer in soulmates, and that there's someone for everyone out there, but I'm having my doubts now. I wish I could find that one special person who not only makes me feel happy, but lets me complete them too. 

I've basically given up now, and just hope that after so long my mind will revert back to where it was not needing someone. But we know how well that works. For now though, I want to be loved.

1635,CherubiniZucchini,1565263354,1,"I can't go to sleep before at least 4am every day and then I have to leave the house at around 8 or so every morning to commute. I spend around 6 hours travelling every day. I know that's not an awful amount of time but in my case it just feels pointless because I could just stay home and do what I'm doing in the city. I can't stay home though because my father is an abusive piece of shit and now he's there literally 24/7. I can't wait to get my own place and finally stop having to be around him but right now I can't do that because I'm trying to finish my degree and I don't drive (I'm 26, yeah I know, I should work on that. I'm just too anxious and even if I got the license I wouldn't have the money for a car at the moment). I don't know what I'm saying. I'm just staring at the screen like a moron feeling hopelessly alone and just hopeless in general. I've always been a loner, ever since I was a kid. I felt scared of people and I didn't want to hang with the other kids. All the friends I've ever had were people who approached me first. I never walk up to people to chat because I worry I'll be bothering them and my presence will upset them. The friends I have irl are currently all too far to meet up so basically I'm completely alone most of the time. Even when I'm home with my brother or just outside or something with other people around, I feel completely alone and isolated. I don't go out to party because 1) I grew up in a restrictive and oppressive household so I didn't get to party in my teens at all and 2) I don't have anyone to go with now that I technically could try it out. I don't feel comfortable hanging out with people I don't know too well. I have some serious trust issues and I'm well-aware of that but there's not much I can do about it. Even over the internet, I may talk a lot but when you squeeze what I'm saying, you'll get nothing at all from it. It's like when you have to write an essay and you have information for maybe 100 words when you need 1000 and you write: 'The ball of hydrogen and helium burning at around 10,000 degrees that shines in the sky every day and many forget is a star as much as Polaris, the star generally known as the North Star. The closest star to the Earth and the only star in the Solar System, which is part of the Milky Way, the spiral galaxy where our planet dwells.' when you could just write 'the sun' and it'd be enough. There's a lot of information in what I say but no point in it being there. I don't know if that makes sense. This is what I mean. What am I even saying? There's a lot in this post already but is anyone following? I'm constantly digressing and that's a problem. I don't know why I do it. I have ADHD and that's most likely one of the reasons. The point is that I'm alone, everything I do feels pointless, I'm terrified of the future, and being alone for so long and not truly trusting anyone enough to willingly be vulnerable in front of them has fucked me up so badly I feel like I'm a scattered person with scattered thoughts. I have zero motivation to the things I used to like to do and I'm struggling so much to finish my dissertation, I fear I won't be able to get it done on time. I feel like I've never ever been completely honest with anyone about what I truly feel and who I really am. I look at people and I see them form meaningful connections with others while I'm forever the friend who walks behind on the sidewalk. Nobody believes me when I tell them that I've known these ladies from the commute for years and they actively engage me in conversation but only recently did they realize they didn't know my name. I was just 'sugar' the whole time. The friends I have irl tell me that they miss me when we talk but I just feel like a nuisance and a bore. I never have anything to share because I never do anything interesting. It doesn't help that I'm queer in the forgotten west where the sun always shines but you can't see shit except your own damn shadow ahead of you when it's hitting you from the back and scorching your nape. I don't know, I feel less miserable at night when the sun's out. I really hate the sun and I can't stand the brightness. I guess it's because people can see me in it. They can see my stupid face and how disgusting it looks.

When I was 16, I had this older guy take advantage of me at a party with his friends. They were both 18. Afterward, they ignored me and bragged to their friends, calling me gross.
His younger brother was in my grade, and his friends bullied me too before that happened. I had no social media, and they would make posts about how I looked old and that I'm a fat slut



They would pick apart my features every day. My lips are too thin, eyes too close together, man jaw, prominent chin, and that I was the ugliest girl in school. I moved away at 18 to a new state; it's been four years since all this happened.


The guys in my grade would ask me for sex but tell me not to tell anyone because I was so ugly. They would say no man will ever want me. They said I'm attractive enough to sleep with but not to be seen with me.


They would say I'm the grossest girl in school, and any guy who sleeps with me is desperate. They would greet me by telling me I have wrinkles all over my face that I had peeling skin. I was so disgusting I burned and deleted all the photos from school.

I'm in Vegas for the week, and was having such bad anxiety over having to be alone at night. So I went to a cuddle companions site, and looked at all of the girls they had. I was so nervous because a lot of them looked a little... too fun. I found a really cute one with glasses and sent her a message. 
I explained that I was really nervous and have never done this before and she was so reassuring. She said she would come an hour early so we can get some coffee and get to know each other. I was half expecting her to cancel, but she showed up. This cute girl actually showed up.
I'm not a handsome guy. Im tall and skinny with an unfortunate face.  Most girls have always given me that uncomfortable half hug like they are embarrassed, but she immediately hugged me like we knew each other. It was nice. 
We had a nice easy chat. You know the normal small talk get to know you stuff. Then we went up to the room. I wasn't sure what to expect. I was scared that I would do or say something to scare her away so I asked her if she would take the lead. 
The rest of our time was great. 
She set an alarm for two hours and We both got changed into Pajamas. I got in the bed first then she finished changing and crawled into bed with me. She didn't waste any time and snuggled up to me with her head on my chest and gently rubbed my sides. At one point she put her leg over mine and placed her hand on my cheek.

1654,hamartiated,1565230060,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

It's definitely embarrassing, and I don't even know what reaction I'm looking for. Because when I get too ""cryptic"" I tend to scare my friends and it makes the whole situation worse and extremely awkward.

1663,throwthisoneaway424,1565220403,6,"Even people who you think wouldn't hurt you, or promise that they'd never try to hurt you still hurt you. I've found that in life you can trust absolutely no one. I'm a weak person for lending out my heart so easily and quickly. I've had to leave or be left by my family, my friends, and anyone who I've ever felt like I truly loved.

I have no family left. They wanted to be something I wasn't. I have no friends left. They wanted to hang out with me only when I was in a good mood, but left me dry when I was in pain. I have no partner. I only had one and that's over now. He made me finally happy, after so much pain. And now I'm back to a life of suffering. 

There is no hope in life for me. I put all my time and energy into people who treat me like I'm just something that can be toyed with. I will never be able to make a connection with someone ever again after this. It's over for me. I don't want to live my whole life alone, but there really isn't a way for that to happen. So I guess I'll rot. 

I made a post here weeks ago saying I was hopeless. I'm beyond hopelessness now. I've given up on everything. There's not much to live for if this is how it'll be for me. For the record, I don't think I'll ever be able to bring myself to commit or anything. I wish I could though because living a life of pain is so much harder. I'm too much of a coward, though.

To the people who go not fully understanding their own emotions: please never get someone to give their heart to you if you don't know for sure that you can take care for it. And don't make claims and promises that can't be met. And for people like me: I guess we live in a world where we need to learn how to stop loving. I wish I had no heart so I could just live my life without so much hurting, but this type of thing has followed me for as long as I've lived. I don't understand how people can do it. I have so much love for people that it's going to be the death of me one day. Why is everyone stronger than me at this?

I wanna have someone in my life. And I can't ""date"" to find that person. I'm not strong enough to fall in love with dozens of people and get my heart broken every time just to find someone who will love me back. I'm just not strong enough.

I wish life wasn't like this. I don't know how to navigate the world I was put in. That's all, I guess.",lonely,Why do I have to always get hurt in this life? I will never be happy again.,2019-08-08 09:26:43
1664,GlassRivers,1565219856,3,"So I think its fair to say that I'm lonely by choice most of the time. I get tired really quickly being around other people and find that I'm able to achieve more by being on my own. And I am comfortable with that. I see my friends infrequently and I think that's good for everyone because I have a personality that's best experienced in small doses.

I'm turning 23 in 4 months though and thought I'd reflect a bit on some thoughts I've been having. I've never been an attractive person. In the last few years I became average in that area, got rated as a 6 on the /truerateme and /rateme subreddits which I'm ok with. Due to my lifestyle I don't meet many women and don't interest many of the few I do meet. I have some issues regarding these kind of connections.

When I was in year 8 at school I saw all my friends around me starting to experiment with relationships and I remember being really scared by that, by the thought that everyone around me would have all these experiences that I wouldn't. To act quickly I did something I hate my former self for, I asked out a girl I knew liked me but I didn't like. I quickly realized my mistake though and as per many middle school relationships it ended after a week. I could shrug this off as one of the silly things kids do, but my best friend (who still is my best friend to this day) never let me forget that mistake. Every so often he would make me feel so much shame and embarrassment over asking this girl out (one reason was because he and my other friends thought she was very unattractive and so were cruel about that, and also because of the way I handled that). I think the consistent reminders of that experience kind of stunted my growth when it came to those sort of things. I didn't ask out anyone else in school out of the shame I still felt from that experience. 

I also remember when we got to highschool what started to happen to people I would say were in my level of the social hierarchy. A lot of the unattractive boys started to become creepy, I think over their own lack of success with girls. These were the sort of people who started sending dick pics to girls as well as other unwanted behaviour. I remember telling myself I couldn't become like them ever. So I cut myself off from any thoughts about dating or any of those feelings.

I finished school exactly as my year 8 self thought I would. All my friends around me had dated many different people and were experienced and comfortable with that part of their life while I held mine at a very far distance from myself. I hated myself for that. For a few years after that I tried doing what I was expected to do. I tried studying at uni which didn't work for me (I was sick of studying after I took my last few years of school very seriously). I dropped out and got a job in a little retail shop for 10 months, just to save money. This was a bad year for me. I worked 6 days a week and on that one day off I drank all day. Was miserable for most of it.

Then something happened I didn't expect. I was working one busy day and these 3 people came into the shop. Two girls and a tall guy. I didn't notice them at all as I was busy with other customers at the counter but eventually they got to me. I remember saying some joke or funny comment to one of the girls (For some reason I found it so easy to flirt, be funny when I was putting on my customer service persona) and she laughed but I didn't think anything of it. She left and I continued on with my day. 

That night I was drinking again because the following day was my day off. I was kind of tipsy when I got a facebook friend request from someone I didn't know. No mutual friends or anything. This happens sometimes out of the blue and most of the time I reject these just because I don't like adding people I don't know (I only have like 40 friends on FB). But because I was drinking, I thought I'd see who this person was. Turned out it was the girl from earlier that day. She had found me through some A-Level FB stalking, after the receipt she got from the store had my name printed as the person who put her order through. We spoke for a few hours and she decided to come see me again at work. This was awkward as hell but pretty cute, and we arranged to hang out one afternoon.

I didn't really know what to do about this. I didn't know what people did on dates as I had never been on one (I was 19 at this point). I decided to get a rose because I'm a total fuckwit. When it came time to leave I was embarrassed about this and cut the rose down to just the flower so I could conceal it in my hand and get rid of it easily in case I thought it was stupid. We met up and went for a walk around a nearby lake. Eventually she saw the rose in my hand and there was this beat where we both looked at each other and then both burst out laughing. After that it was pretty perfect. We spoke easily, make jokes, and enjoyed each others company, all while walking around this lake that was shining with the afternoon sun. We eventually found a place to sit as the sun went down and I absentmindedly picked the petals off the rose and let the wind scatter them across the water. It was very picturesque.

Anyway, I dated this girl for a month and a bit, had a couple of more dates and is still the only girl I've ever kissed. Also the only girl I can ever say I've ever felt anything for. It didn't work out for us due to some complicated circumstances. I realized that due to my lack of experience with dating, I had some issues. First of all, that guy she was with when she entered the shop the first time was her ex-boyfriend. She still hung around him which I told myself was fine even though it made me uncomfortable. These feelings only got worse when she told me some stuff about how he really missed her, came around to her house and cried, how she let him into her house and some of the suggestive stuff he asked her to do. Eventually I asked her if this was likely to stop. She said that it probably wouldn't and that was that. I never spoke to her after that.

I left that job after 10 months to go and travel Europe for 5 months in 2017. That was fun but I didn't meet anyone like all my friends said I would. The friend I went with hooked up with a couple of people but I just never manage to do that and honestly don't like the idea of hooking up with people. I feel like if its not a relationship, I can't do it. After I got back I got a job in hospitality and started studying at uni again, which is where I am now. Studying teaching. I've always loved being around kids. They make me remember the fun in life. In that hospitality job I had a few people who took an interest in me but I didn't like any of them back. I've started using some dating apps to see what they're like but nothing ever happens on them for me. I get a few matches and like from girls but I can't converse with them. I don't know how to flirt and be playful through text. 

Two days ago I matched with a girl who I would consider pretty far out of my league. We spoke for a few hours (I didn't really feel much chemistry through those texts though). One of the things she told me was that she was sick of immature guys on these dating apps and that kind of got to me because I don't consider myself anywhere near as mature as I should be. I'm a 22 year old uni student still living at home looking for a job. Don't have a car and don't do much with my life. So I told her why I thought I wouldn't be a good match for her, and unmatched her. 

Sorry if that's a lot to read, I just felt the need to reflect on my experiences with loneliness. I am comfortable being alone, truthfully. Its just that I get these days where I feel empty because of it. I've got a difficult personality for people to get used to, as I'm very cold to people I meet for the first time and very distant for a long time after that.",lonely,Reflecting on Myself,2019-08-08 09:17:36

Nobody ever followed a book/music album suggestion I gave them. If I try to speak about my personal problems, they cut me short to give me platitudes or crack a joke to make me feel better.

My family never cared about my interests, not even as a child, and the few exchanges have these days over the phone are just how is it going with work and if I found a gf.

I went to therapy a few times, and the psychologists just let me vent, ignored everything I said and asked unrelated questions afterwards. 

Some girls expressed their romantic interest in me throughout the years. Still they couldn't bother trying to understand me even a little and the few times I accepted their advances ended up with me crying for days because I felt both lonely and heavily alienated. How can you crush on someone and care so little about them. I'm not even good looking.

I don't even have special reasons to feel bad, people don't care about anything more than at a shallow level, but it's killing me. I've tried medication but it just made everything feel mellow and fucked up other aspects of my life.

I made notes about who they are and what they like, so that I don't mix up anything.  

I researched the topics they talked about or mentioned.  

I had a follow-up question every single time.  

I switched Topics when I noticed that they were getting bored and only sending single words back.  

I was always very polite, I joked around with some people.  

I exchanged Discord, Steam IDs, PSN, Switch IDs and whatnot with them.  

I played some games with many of them, I specifically planned my day out to play with them, even if it was at 2am or whatever, and I bought games that I didn't have.  

I sent them Pictures of interesting or cute stuff I found online or IRL, when I couldn't think of anything to say. So that we could talk about that.

1692,936_,1565160507,9,"I have zero friends. Zero. The last time I went out with a friend was 7 months ago and that only happened because it was preplanned, at that time, months ago. Before that I was schooling and had 1 friend in class but she was much closer to another person so I was pretty alone for another year. Plus I was extremely depressed (the most depressed I have ever been) so I stayed indoors most of the time for almost a year, worsening my social anxiety.


New school started and I actually managed to have acquaintances on orientation day, one of them even referred me to being energetic. However this barely lasted as we were all in different classes. 


When I walked into my classroom most people already formed their cliques and within a few days (now) everyone has at least a friend and I have absolutely zero.


I had the urge to cry so many times during these few days because I just don't know what and why I'm like that. The grace period was only 1-2 days and I missed my opportunity to make friends. Worse, I feel that my classmates actually really dislike me. And I accidentally messed up someone's stuff üò≠ she was not happy.


I don't know and I don't understand.... I became so quiet in class and I can't speak AT ALL. I couldn't ask a classmate a question, my voice was literally shaking during our self introduction (everyone could hear it......I was the only one. Everyone else was so bubbly and confident) and I really really wanted to start over a new leaf in this new school but within this short period I blew it up and I guess I can never fix this. 


A few people tried to talk to me but at that point my social anxiety was rapidly getting hold off me that I just could not hold a proper conversation. I either chuckled or smiled or replied one word while I was beating myself up in my head.


I'm sure those people I met during orientation already have new friends, I'm sure almost everyone in fact already have friends. I just sit alone and eat alone because my social anxiety is so fucking bad. Maybe my social anxiety is causing me to think everyone hates me but it's a sure fact nobody WANTS to talk to me.

1703,hamartiated,1565141465,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

1706,nobatmanhere,1565139249,1,"I guess I should preface this by saying I'm an only child. I've been lonely my entire life. I was never allowed a furry pet. I didn't grow up with a dog, a cat, or any mammal. A fish or a lizard does not bring companionship, and I was always desperate to spend time with friends.

It's something I've never been able to shake, that aching loneliness. My last relationship, my ex was part of a large, loving family and she was one of several siblings. I was elated to feel welcomed and be part of something I had only seen in movies. In contrast, my family is small, petty and dysfunctional. I had never seen so much love before, and I didn't think anyone would be able to love me as much as my last girlfriend. Things ended for a multitude of reasons, and I learned a lot about myself, and what I want in a partner. 

Queue now - I somehow got myself in a relationship a couple months ago with someone in their early twenties, after a two year hiatus. We are very different, but care about each other a lot. Lately I've been finding excuses to leave. Some of which are probably a culmination of my own insecurities and self destructive tendencies, but others which my intuition and deduction can't really ignore. Something feels off, and without going into too much detail, I don't think this is going to last. Her communication skills are deteriorating and I can't keep giving in to apologies and ""I love you's"".

I'm doing well for myself, I have a career, I'm not in debt outside of a minor student loan and I don't really worry about money. I game a lot in my free time, I like nerdy stuff, fashion, sneakers and lately I've been putting in a lot of extra effort into my health - Short and long term.

I'm not expecting you to like everything I like, or have the same experiences in life as me. I just wouldn't mind the company of another person who I click with - Male or female. Preferably people with their shit (mostly) together. An insightful potential friend who can pull me out of the void I tend to get sucked into more and more frequently.

Welp, this probably came across far edgier than I planned. I feel like I poured my heart out, though. This is how I currently feel. I'm not always like this. Enough people laugh with me to know I have a good sense of humor... At least most of the time.

When they became more popular and more busy I always made the effort, being the one to initiate conversations and plans, even spending money to visit them when we all went away to university and stuff. I think eventually the burden just got too much and I started just trying to match the energy people had for me, and people dropped off FAST. I'd been burned too many times (forgotten birthdays, being cancelled on for better offers etc.) and I started to just let people have the distance they wanted, supplementing the lack of social interactions I was getting with online friends. Now, though, I'm struggling even with that. I feel like people care more about THEIR real life friends or other online friends they're closer to. 

I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with me that should stop me having friends but at this point it seems like more than just bad luck. It seems like people find others they like more and leave me behind. I feel completely worthless, noting the only close friends I've had have been people I've supported/loved unconditionally and have never felt it was reciprocated, and when I stopped being okay with that I had to start adjusting to life without friends. Even my family put their friends first often.

I've been recovering from depression and things have been better but now I just wonder what it was all for. I have no one to share my life with, no one to tell what I'm thinking or feeling... I'm entrenched in my own solitude and I don't know what the fuck happened or where it all went wrong.

1717,gab5e,1565127636,4,"Hi!


So i used to be bubbly as a kid, but I didn‚Äôt had a good upbringing and my childhood was not the best, to say it kindly...
I started to become shy, then withdrawn, i closed myself off emotionally, bit by bit joy left me and ever since (childhood) it has been a sinking into a deeper pit day by day up until now to my 28 years of age. 
Most of the relationships i had with people so far have not been positive, usually i would be antagonised. Never had what i would consider true friends, forget about a girlfriend or any experience with the opposite sex.
Since i was 8 i also started developing some narcissistic tendencies, as a coping mechanism I suppose. I have a lot of internal fights day by day of awaken time. Even my dreams are conflicted. I feel like my self is poisoned. 
Somewhere under thick layers there is the real me that never got to develop and experience life as the world was to hard to handle and to painful. So a facade took over pushing me day by day through but not living. 
I‚Äôm pretty angry at life and bitter, i don‚Äôt know how to change it. I‚Äôm very quiet, not because i don‚Äôt have things to say but because i don‚Äôt want to bring all the anger i feel to the surface, as in society is not acceptable.
I wish i could bring my true self out but it feels like i need this layers to protect me and there is nothing to come out for anyway. From certain points of view the real me feels like is just a kid or a young boy at best, yet in fact i‚Äôm 28 years of age.

I long  deeply to have a real connection with another being because i feel like i‚Äôm lacking affection and feeling loved. People these days just seem to chit chat about superficial stuff and that‚Äôs it.
I read a lot of advice, self help books, you name it but i think it‚Äôs crap, in the end you go crazy if you‚Äôre alone forever. At least that‚Äôs how i feel. 
Not like i need someone to solve my issues or give me value, but isolation can screw you up.

It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, even when girls try to say hi or speak to me, i‚Äôm just to bitter to open up to them because i‚Äôm afraid they will see my true self, how fragile, lonely, sad and devoid of love i‚Äôm. I‚Äôm pretty sure others can see through, tough. My eyes look really sad. 

Sometimes there would be some older men giving me a pat on the shoulder as trying to comfort me, or older women winking at me as trying to make me feel better about myself. 
Is not helping much honestly, i want to feel like a man, not a child.  Yet i go through every day with sadness and a dead expression on my face wishing there would be someone for me there to comfort me and lay in their arms.

The lack of intimacy sucks. Never kissed a girl, i want sex, even more i want companionship and love.  I‚Äôm pretty confused about these topics and don‚Äôt know much about the opposites gender, just what i hear on here from other guys that dating is horrendous for a male.

I feel like i can‚Äôt move forward with my life in the natural direction. 
Talking about a partner, even girls that are way younger then me i see them a bit as authoritative or as if i feel submissive towards them, i don‚Äôt know... As if i‚Äôm a child or something and they are the parent.
Maybe it‚Äôs the fact of feeling unloved for which to happen you need vulnerability? Or i was not loved in my childhood? I just feel messed up... 

Can‚Äôt make guy friends either and I don‚Äôt relate to them. They speak and interact in boy-ish/manly ways and i just don‚Äôt feel like i developed that, as i‚Äôm lacking experience. 

I don‚Äôt relate to kids either, as they have more natural confidence then i do.

I have goals and dreams but i feel to conflicted and can barely function to do the minimum.

However i‚Äôve still yet to receive any wishes from my friends. I get that family is what matters and summer is a busy time for everyone but i mean i was really looking forward to having it acknowledged by my friends especially given that for their birthdays i went above and beyond to make them feel special. this summer we haven‚Äôt talked much either. they barely text me unless i start the conversation first.

so anyways, today i woke up to nothing on my phone but i thought ‚Äúhey, maybe they just don‚Äôt know the date‚Äù which is fair i wouldn‚Äôt blame them for that. but after posting 2 things about my birthday and still, several hours later, having nobody reach out to me kinda stings. i know they‚Äôve seen the posts too, so i‚Äôm hurt by it. i‚Äôm afraid that by tonight i still won‚Äôt have any messages from them. again i was wished by my parents but they have work today so i‚Äôm home alone. i just feel really alone because i literally have nobody to even talk to. i mean to be honest it‚Äôs nice that i‚Äôm spending time with myself but i‚Äôm still hurt. i don‚Äôt know how to continue from here. it feels like i have nobody.

school is starting soon too and i‚Äôm probably overreacting when i say this but i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll have the energy to talk to them and act all happy with them when i‚Äôm not. i just can‚Äôt keep acting like i‚Äôm friends with people who don‚Äôt care as much as i do. i‚Äôm not asking for birthday pity, i just need some advice as to what i should do because i think this might be the straw that breaks the camels back.

However, it seems like I just consistently lose this coin toss.

Anything: friends, love, intimacy, physical contact, to get invited somewhere, to have a good future, to have success‚Ä¶even if I had a few of these things I would be a lot happier. But no, of course, those things are not for me. I am ugly, I am dumb, I have no charisma, I am self-absorbed, I am obsessive, I have no social skills, I am boring, I am unfunny‚Ä¶how will I ever not be alone when this is the case? Why would anyone ever be attracted to me? I wouldn‚Äôt like me, that‚Äôs for sure. I just have nothing that people would be attracted to, and it shows in my general life experience. Nobody has EVER been attracted to me, nobody has EVER liked me, none of my friends want to hang out with me, none of them value me or think I am funny or cool or interesting. I just want a hug, I want to be held, loved, kissed, I want someone to hold my face and tell me I am good, that I am ok, that they love me with all their heart. But of course, no, that is not for me. 

And why is that? Well, I know I am NOT entitled to love or romance or friendship or dating, I KNOW it is my responsibility to be good enough, but I DO NOT KNOW HOW. I try to work on my appearance-groom my eyebrows, style my hair, go to the gym; I got medication and therapy but it didn‚Äôt work; I work really hard in school and at work but I have nothing to show for it‚Ä¶why am I not good enough? What am I doing wrong? I don‚Äôt get it, why must I be cursed to be alone for my whole life? I am, the evidence suggests, completely and utterly without value. If I had value then people would love me, they would want to hang out with me, then THEY would see value in myself. How can I have self-worth when nobody else sees me as having any worth either? Of course I seek validation and acceptance from my peers, I am human, and I cannot be happy if I am just completely bloody isolated my whole life for the sole reason that I‚Äôm NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO GET PEOPLE TO LIKE ME!

There is someone, who ostensibly is one of my best friends, that I am utterly in love with, honestly to an unhealthy and obsessive amount at this point. We used to talk daily and have good banter and crap for about 8 years, but now they barely even talk to me, they leave me on ‚Äúread‚Äù for days at a time, and when they do reply it‚Äôs only one or two words. What did I do wrong? Why don‚Äôt they even want to be friends with me anymore? I asked them out many months ago and even though they said no (again, I have no attractive features and am not good enough for her. It‚Äôs all my fault for not being good enough and I don‚Äôt know how I can be happy with this true) but we still remained fine friends and nothing seemed to have changed until recently. They are just perfect, how can I get over them? They are kind, beautiful, funny, thoughtful, caring, and so on, they have been my best(ish) friends for so long but I am still not good enough to be attractive to them. Not good enough to be attractive to anyone in fact, hell now I‚Äôm apparently not even good enough to be their friend anymore! I don‚Äôt know how to get over them, they are just perfect in almost every way, I love them so much I just want to hold her and say I love you I love you I love you and I want to be good enough for her. I think of her every time I close my eyes, the few times she bothers messaging me back these days are the only good parts of my day, just seeing a picture of her is like a shot of pure electricity, everything and everyone else pales in comparison, everything just seems grey and flat and empty except for her. I know I‚Äôm not ‚Äúentitled‚Äù to her, I respect her feelings on the matter (though I wish she‚Äôd at least tell me why she doesn‚Äôt talk to me that much anymore tbh), but that doesn‚Äôt make it suck any less when the person you love, more than you‚Äôve ever loved anyone before, does not think you are even worthy of friendship let alone love. Talking to her is the only time I feel alive these days, the only time I feel like I have purpose and reason to be alive, but I fucked it up by firstly not being good enough for her to love me back and secondly to not be good enough for her to want to be friends with me anymore, since apparently after 8 years of friendship I‚Äôm not even worth an explanation as to what I‚Äôm doing so wrong that she doesn‚Äôt want to PLATONICALLY talk with me anymore like we were doing fine for months after I asked her out back in‚Ä¶around early May?

I want to be good enough, I want to apologise to everyone (especially *her*) for not being enough, for being worthless and shit and miserable and bitter and clingy and boring.

I really don't know am I fine or not. I feel like I am, because I'm not crying in my room all day and I can actually do things I enjoy doing (like play the flute and listen to music). 

But I have a bad habit to cut or scratch myself everytime I do or say something wrong. It's kind of a punishment. I also do it to make me feel better and if I'm sad, it helps. I don't cut deep. The cuts fade away in two days and aren't even bleeding. I have also hit my head to the wall a few times on a purpose. Also my mind is so messed up that last night I wrote ""help"" on my arm with a blade.

I do it because my self esteem is really low. I don't think I'm talented at anything and I hate how I look. I also say lots of things I shouldn't and then I have to scratch or cut myself. I feel like I'm just a burden and that's why I don't like to talk about these things. It doesn't mean I'm not comfortable talking about this but I don't wanna bother anyone with my ""problems"" when they have their own, more serious ones.

And I don't really have any problems or issues. I was bullied in elementary school and I think it has affected my self esteem. Also my friends talked a lot behind my back and told me how annoying and negative I was. But other than that, my life is good. I have nothing to complain about.

I'm trying to stop self harm (the cutting and scratching) but it's hard. I just don't see why should I stop it. I don't see self harm as a problem. I think it's my way to cope with low self esteem and a way to punish myself. But people keep telling me I shouldn't do that so I guess I'm trying to stop just for them.

I have never been good at expressing my feelings in front of others. For example, my parents haven't seen me cry since I was 6. People often say things that really hurt me but I have learned how to hide it. But at nights, I remember all those things and cry myself to sleep.

I'm pretty sure people are gonna tell me to get help and talk to someone but I can't. It's my biggest fear to talk about this irl. It's not a problem online, but irl it's a lot worse. To be honest, I rather suffer my whole life than talk to anyone.

I'm not depressed (at least I think i'm not) but I know there must be something wrong with my brain and mental health. That's why I'm a little scared for myself. I'm scared that I have really serious problems I can't cope with and this is gonna go too far.

1743,Yoinkinama,1565072762,2,"The soul is composed of two key inescapable characteristics, there is the Animal; this is your passions, your desire for survival, it's what makes food taste good, it compels you to eat, drink, and procreate, then there is the ""Godly"" or ""Transcendent"" which is your deeper thought of your soul, it's your rationalization. Now these are the two major inescapable aspects of every soul, the animal produces the intense passion that fuels every soul to act and the Transcendent is the aspect that charts the course. Let the feelings of your animal nature guide your transcendent, but keep the animal in check through the transcendent, this would be called morality. Explore your emotions and think about why you are feeling them, felling lonely is a natural mechanic of human survival, for obvious reasons, understand why you fell this why and do something to rectify the problem. Keep in mind though this is no easy task, escaping near total isolation is difficult and scary but having friends and relationships is so blissfully heaven compared to the hell of complete isolation, so allow yourself this heaven and go out in the world and make a change in your own soul, this is a hard journey, and you will fail over and over again but with each risk and fail you gain a new experience to learn from, understand why you failed and learn to avoid past mistakes. With each step you will slowly become a better human being and when you are falling through the pitch black ocean of despire dream of a greener tomorrow and remember the cold of yesterday, you can not go back to that cold, you must move forward, tomorrow must dawn.

1748,lavamagma12,1565065893,2,"I‚Äôm sure many of you here can relate to this. My entire life has been and endless cycle of getting my hopes up, being rejected, and falling into loneliness. People seem to enjoy my company for the most part, but I‚Äôm never anyone‚Äôs first priority. I don‚Äôt get invited to anything by anyone or have many interactions outside of school. From the fourth grade to the tenth grade, I‚Äôd always try to hang around groups of people at lunch period, futilely attempting to force myself into the group. While I may have spent my time with these people, I was never really part of the group or considered to be by the people of it. I always had one friend who was one of the ‚Äúpopular kids‚Äù who has since changed schools and really shown a lack of interest in me. He was the one person I could always rely on to be around with at lunch time, and now that he left, I really have nothing. This was the final nail in the coffin. I‚Äôve tried to force my way into too many groups, and I‚Äôve since quit trying. Every new school year I would tell myself, ‚ÄúThis year people will like you and you‚Äôll have lots of friends‚Äù. However, when I went into the eleventh grade, I already had accepted that no group would include me. So, I spent my entire eleventh grade hanging around my new best friend: my locker. I‚Äôm honestly a person people enjoy being around and I can make people laugh but no one seems to really care about that or about anything that has to do with me. As for the romantic side of my loneliness, there have been four women who I have had a particular fondness for. As you can probably guess, they all rejected me. All of these women showed at some point an interest in me, but ended up rejecting me in the end. I‚Äôm not the type of person to like many women, I really only develop a fondness for a select few. Of course I‚Äôm attracted to many women, but not in ways where I‚Äôd want to really be in serious relationships with them. However, every time I attempt to have a relationship with a woman, I get rejected. I‚Äôve been told that I have to learn to love myself before I love others but that is not the issue. I am by no means depressed; I‚Äôm not the type of person to get depressed. In fact, I really do love myself and I‚Äôm the best friend I‚Äôll ever have. The issue is that no one seems to love me. I honestly despise the human need for relationship. If I could not have to worry about creating relationships, my life would be a lot easier. But, this loneliness I‚Äôve experienced my entire life eats away at my core. I‚Äôve just experienced my fourth rejection from a woman I grew very fond of, and it feels like she‚Äôs ripped out the last piece of my heart I had to give out to someone. I‚Äôve given out my heart, but received none back. This has left me empty inside, like a hole developed in my stomach. Before this most recent rejection, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had cried from emotional or physical pain. It‚Äôs not that I was holding it in, I just really am not the person who cries a lot. Recently, I‚Äôve been crying a lot more, and have accepted that I will likely not find many people, or anyone, who I will have a meaningful relationship with. As I enter my last year of high school, I am immensely excited to leave for University and meet a fresh new set of people. I can only pray that someone there has a connection with me and we can grow a relationship.

1759,LostHeartNJ,1565059687,1,"This is a hard thing to write.  The last 8 years of my life have been a lie.  I can not say that I do now or have ever loved my wife romantically.  I mean from our wedding night until today sex has felt more like a job I am supposd to do rather  than something I want to do.  Sometimes its hard to even think of myself as capable of love.  I know that I am but that ability is trapped under a thin vernier of who I am supposed to be and years of mistrust and anger.  Somehow last week I managed to dig deep down inside and find that old me, only he does not recognize the world he is in right now.  I think my marriage and the relationship leading up to it were just like me on autopilot and now that I am waking up I dont know what to do.

Its not like I don‚Äôt try.  The problems are many.  She constantly takes her family‚Äôs side against me in any dispute at least privately.  She always argues the other positon if someone is mad at me.  She always makes my bad days or bad things happening into how my reaction makes her feel hurt.  I feel like I have no one on my side and no one to ever lean on as it all gets turned back onto me.  This drives me away even more.  I honestly don‚Äôt feel loved, not in the deeper sense of the word.  She really has zero interested in peeling through my layers because there is a lot of ugly.  She does not like ugly.  

But I want to live, the real me, the one buried for so long but after moving away from friends and my old life I have no one with any connection to who i used to be and no way to get back there.  I just live with the daily frustration of knowing there is the me inside yearning to be free and yet having no way of getting there and having no one to help.  

I used to be driven, brilliant, passionate, loving, selfless, and a pure romantic wanting to see the possibility rather than the reality.  These days I am stuck in existing in cold hard reality.  

I am in my 40s living in NJ and I have no idea how I got here.  At least not the real me.  I don‚Äôt know what I seek other than help clawing my way through the dark layers and bringing this amazing person back to the forefront and actually living my life.   What that help can be, who can get inside me and truly get to know me, or what that help will look like I have no idea but I am putting it out there in case someone does.  

You see what needs to go is this vernier and then the darkness.  The darkness was snowballed by repeated betrayal and hurt and built on a core of childhood sexual abuse I don‚Äôt even remember and only know by my knowledge of abusive sex from my very early childhood.  No I am not now or have ever been abusive but the thoughts of what abuse is lingers in my mind.  Back when it was manageable and just a safety mechanism to keep me from getting hurt I was good.  That is until I was betrayed and it became the driving force of my life.  I made sure I could never be manipulated again and over the years it killed my ability to even feel.  Recently I began to feel again and that old me isn‚Äôt dead but waking from a coma.  But that old me, as I said, is lost in a world it doesn‚Äôt belong in and without help I‚Äôm afraid it will sleep again and I will never become who I once was.",lonely,Even when you‚Äôre not you can feel really alone,2019-08-06 12:48:07

1764,hamartiated,1565054731,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Hiya. I'm not into ""how's your day""/""how are you doing"" kind of chats. let's talk about ourselves, meaningful things. let's seriously get to know each other, understand our different points of view (even though we don't agree on a lot of stuff). let's share our problems, make each other feel like we're really friends, not strangers who feel compelled to text each other because they don't want to suddenly ghost.

Maybe we share some things in common, maybe not. It doesn't matter, as long as you're open-minded, and willing to share your thoughts with me, I'll share mine too, and it'll be a nice bonding.

To be a little specific, I like to think I have good taste in music, I like seeing art, writing poetry occasionally. I like to be eclectic until I find the one thing that makes me passion-driven, yet I haven't yet, which is why I'm trying to experience and try out all the opportunities I can get to. I'm always open to trying out something new. I'm learning web development, learning languages, occasionally gaming, and overall talking about interesting topics.

Be kind, nice, open and respectful. Don't make me feel judged, and I'll try to do that as much as I can, too. I can help you with whatever I can (I guess I can call myself an extrovert and a sociable person. At least that's what people see me as), so if you want to know stuff about things I have experience with (extra-curricular, a little bit of entrepreneurship, event organizing, journalism, etc.)

Maybe someday we can add each other on our more private social media, such as facebook. For now, let's stick to discord, if you have one, or the less compelling option, reddit chat.

Pm me and we'll see if we can become good friends = ) Looking forward to hear from everyone, don't hesitate &lt;3

However since one of the two now has a girl I don't see him very often. And the other is depressed and is either drunk, high or both. But he understands me the most. Because he too had his heart broken so many times. To the point were weed gives us a little boost. Yes I drink and smoke cigarettes and weed or hasj. But I don't do it as often as him. And one of my closest friends is going abroad for 6 months. However I do find myself every night at 2 am. Watching the stars while listening to songs , wondering if there is anybody there to save me. Save me form my tormented life, save me from my lonely brain slowly going more insane day by day. I just wished my parents were more kind to me. They are always yelling at me and looking down on me. I got bullied a lot when  I was younger. Having ptsd and thrust issues (kind of social  
 anxiety) doesn't make finding her easier. I am not the most attractive person in the world but I am certainly not the ugliest. I do get a great laugh from almost everything and I can cook like a chef. And I work hard as a pizza guy. I work from 12 pm till 10 pm some days just get some money. Its now 2:25 am. I'm afraid of nothing but time. The fear of my time running out. The fear I wasted a life time of choices. The fear of living my time alone. I just wished i could spend one day with her, the one. Not that we break up or something because the one wouldn't do that. No I mean one day would be enough. I wouldn't take any other day with her for granted. One day and maybe that day will never come.

I used to have many friends. There was always someone to hang with. Over the years exes have driven them away (I always somehow pick the possessive type). The ones that were single when I was married are now settled and in their own world, as I was. I don't see anyone, I just go to work and come home. I've tried those friend groups. I've tried hanging with people from work, but they're all settled down. I didn't want to admit I was lonely, but I am. I don't mind being single, I'm not a person that has to be with someone, but with no family or friends to be around, weeks pass like nothing. My summer has flown by and I've done nothing. I'm just existing at this point. I can't say im suicidal, but I sure wouldn't mind not existing anymore. If this is my life now, what's the point? It's crazy because if I really needed help they'd come and I love them for that, but just casual interaction I'm shit out of luck. My job stresses me out too. Today I ended up in the hospital with chest pains, hence the opening statement. Vitals all good, so obviously it's my mind. I keep bursting into tears randomly, nothing triggering it. It's been a rough year, my wife met someone and left me, my divorce was finalized a few months. Then she moved states away and took my step daughter with her. She would hang with me on the weekends, she's still my kid. Next month is my 35th bday and im going to Universal Studios in FL, alone. I didn't want to spend the time doing nothing at home. But now I'm not looking forward to it. I'm just so sad. The messed up thing is, most people would never know. And anyone I've vented to, usually just kinda brushes it off, yet they'll vent all day long to me with their problems. That's why I'm on here, getting my thoughts out. My only joy in life and what keeps me going is my two cats. I've become a damn cat lady, but I'd be truly lost without them.",lonely,Loneliness is...,2019-08-06 10:24:24

That's nice because I see I'm not alone, a lot of people have my same issues

Since I was little, I kinda Always felt lonely

In this period, I'm struggling a lot, I dont talk to people, only like 2 friends
But you know, sometimes I dont really enjoy talking to them, we end up doing the same things and I kinda get bored

Every time I meet a girl, there's Always this pattern of me getting like ghosted

I usually just escape myself and play videogames

Everything Is collapsing also, problems in my family, my mom attempted suicide and I basically saved her Life, if I wasnt there, she would have been dead, she took meds and was vomiting everywhere
I was scared but brave enough to do something and I managed to save her

Then my dad overwhelmed by all the things happening wanted to kill himself too, jumping from the third floor, he was about to do that in front of me, I screamed so loud that day, I was shocked

In these months everything went completely south, shit hit the fan

Sometimes I really feel very suicidal, sometimes it's not really about talking with someone but someone who's actually physically here with you, validating your pain

I also dont receive text from anyone, it's pretty rare getting a text from someone

Every day I woke up like ""I hope someone cares about me today and gives me a goodmorning or how are you"" but that never happens

Thanks for giving your time to this post
Now I think I'm gonna get some sleep

I had to take two weeks off, and it's not likely I'll get back to where I was physically.

I don't want to give up the money and benefits, but my parents will supposedly help me go back to college. What I'm more worried about is losing a social outlet. I never really had friends before I started working there. If I quit, I'm back to the only way to meet anyone being going to meetups an hour away in the city, and that's never worked for me as a way to make friends. The only people I'll see every day are my parents, and occasionally the other suburban boomers in the neighborhood. Nobody wants to hang out with someone with no job/lives with his parents either, at least not at my age (29). At least my work friends can relate to that, since they make the same kind of money.

I feel lonelier than ever. 

I miss having someone to text to see how they are. 
I miss nights on the sofa watching crappy TV or movies with someone just sitting next to you experiencing the same thing.
I miss waking up in the morning with a giddy grin because you get to see that someone that day, or just a phone call... 

I miss being in a relationship.

And I am finding it more and more difficult to get the will power to put myself out there. 

I have said many times before I am no looker. But I think this is the reason why I am finding it so hard. Everyone seems to be too focused on what someone looks like they they don‚Äôt realise that kind of thing changes. 

The problem is, I think I am now changing in to a bitter old man because of the constant ignorance that is who I am over what I look like. 

Ok, so I am only 30, so old may not be the right term, but the feeing still stands...

I have just spent another day at work, listening to those younger around me talk about their plans with their other halves, or discuss their conquests over the weekend in such vigorous detail. 
And here I sit, at home alone, the sun setting outside and I am about to switch on another re-run of a show that I watched years ago. 

I have spent the last hour flicking through dating apps, simply saying yes to anything so I can have a conversation with someone who is looking for something like I am. 

I know almost everyone of those apps is an embellishment of the user, but having being on some for well over 5 years, the conclusion that it is all based on looks rather that what is written cuts like a knife and right down to the bone.

 I haven‚Äôt had an exciting life, I have spent most of it in my home town working, or studying, or... Well, that was a short list... 
I don‚Äôt go out as I don‚Äôt like doing things like that alone, and I have no true friends else I wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to write this. 

I am proud of one thing though, I am still here... the pain and the sadness and the sorrow still coursing through my veins like a slow poison, killing me as each day passes... 

I think what I miss most of all is my mum. If she were still here, she would offer me words of comfort, a loving embrace, anything to remind me that no matter how lonely I feel in a sea of others, somewhere, someone still loves me no matter what I look like. 

And if any of you out there still reading this fancy having someone to talk to about your day from time to time, drop me a message. I may rarely use this account, but if you fancy a chat or an email exchange, I will be more than willing... let us open up our worlds a little just for a chat.",lonely,When did we become so concerned with looks?,2019-08-06 06:09:58

Please don't tell me that ""It'll happen"". You can't gurantee that. It's a fact that not everybody ends up with someone.

Here's what happened with every girl I had a crush on:

1. First girl I told I liked her was in 7th grade. I thought she liked me, and she did not. I was sad for a while, sure, but I wasn't depressed, and I was able to be classmates with her in 8th grade with no problems. After all, it was just 1 girl, and one would definitely like me eventually. .... right?
2. Second girl. Also a classmate. I asked her to hang out outside of school, and she agreed. We did. A week later I asked again, but she was busy. Ok, fair enough. About half a week passes and I ask again, she leaves me on read. A month later I hear at school that she now has a boyfriend.
3. Girl I'm friend with (X) (or girl I'm *maybe* friends with. I'll get to that) told me that a girl she knows (Y) that goes to my school asked her if she knows any guys that go to that school, and she told her about me. The girl comes to me at school and asks me if I know X. I say yes. We talk for a bit and I got her Facebook. Then she wouldn't even say hi whenever I'd say hi to her on the hallways, so eventually I just stopped saying hi as well.
4. Went to a friend's birthday. I knew one person besides him that was there, that being X, but everyone else, I didn't know. There was this girl there who talked with me, and said that she thinks we're the only normal ones at that birthday party. At one point I was sitting on the couch, and she was standing next to it, and she puts her hand on my shoulder. Later, she starts filming some guys from the party (they asked her to), and I was right behind her when she did that. She turned around and filmed me for a few seconds before continuing to film what she was supposed to be filming. I wouldn't have had the courage to ask for her number normally, but X asked her to give it to her, which made me ask her as well, as it wasn't out of nowhere anymore. I texted her 2 days later, but I could tell from the way she was replying that she didn't want to talk to me and most likely found it weird that I had even texted her in the first place.
5. This girl keeps coming in our classroom, as she's friends with a classmate of mine. I was watching an anime in between classes, and she came to talk to her friend, and saw I was watching anime. She asked what anime it was. I told her, but then she left. Another day, I was playing a game based on an anime, and she came to ask me what game it was, and asked me a bit about the mechanics of it and stuff. She told me she watches anime as well and we talked for a bit about it. I see her on the hallway one day, and I ask her what her Facebook is (we only talked about anime that one time, and neither of us actually introduced ourselves. I couldn't have searched her on Facebook even if I wanted to, because I didn't know her name). I didn't plan on asking her to hang out or anything. I just wanted to get her Facebook so we can talk about anime some more, at least for now. She replied with ""I have a boyfriend."" And this made me really confused as to why she talked to me in the first place. She was the one who initiated both times. And it's not that she just wanted to be friends since we both watch anime either, because if that were the case, why wouldn't she give me her Facebook and become friends, instead of directly jumping to ""I have a boyfriend"" and leaving.
6. This girl there wasn't really anything to indicate that she liked me. It was more of a shot in the dark, and sure enough, she didn't like me.
7. This other girl I liked from my class left me on read when all I did was say ""Hi"". I didn't bother trying with her anymore, as it was obvious.
8. And this last one (also a classmate) is the one that really solidified my belief of girls never liking me. Because she acted like she did. It's not even me misinterpreting things because I like her either, because a classmate as well as a guy I know, who's not even in our class, both asked me if her and I were going to date. It was obvious to them as well. She would hug me, always tease me, talk to me a lot, saying things that kind of implied us dating, and I could carry on listing things she did that made me believe she liked me all day. I asked her to hang out twice. Both times she said she was busy. I told her to let me know when she'll be free, and she didn't even open the message. She didn't leave me on read, she just straight up didn't open the conversation. She changed her profile pictures after I sent her that message, so she was, indeed, online. I let some months pass and I asked her again. She said yes this time. We were meant to meet on Tuesday, but she said we'll talk about it (like the time, and location) at school on Monday. Monday comes and she doesn't say a word to me. Nothing about that or about anything else. I text her later that day to ask her about the next day, and she says she can't because her grandma is in the hospital. Whetever that's true or not, I don't know at this point, but even if it is true, why didn't she tell me anything at school? Heck, had I not texted her, Tuesday would've came without me knowing if we were even meeting anymore or not. Last month I just wanted to get it over with and I just straight up asked her if she liked me. She doesn't.

How would I even be able to realize that a girl likes me? The last girl did everything you could tell me to look out for, and she didn't like me either. A girl could act in the most obvious way in the world and I wouldn't be able to believe that she likes me, because of what happened with the last girl. I've heard lots of stories about guys being oblivious that girls like them. But can you blame them, if there are girls out there being obvious about it not because they like them, but because they want attention?

And even if the stars aligned and somehow I would get a girlfriend, it wouldn't last. I have OCD, dandruff (regardless of what I wash my hair with, it doesn't go away) and also, back when I finished sixth grade, I had some personal issues regarding anxiety, and I didn't go to school for 2 years. I do go now, but I'm two grades lower than I was meant to be. The moment this hypothetical girlfriend found out about these things, she'd leave. I mean why would she want to date a guy with all these problems when, within a week at most, she could get someone else? It wouldn't even make sense to keep dating me when there are so many other guys around that don't have these issues.

Everyone tries to convince me that I'm wrong, and it honestly pisses me off. It really just seems that unless someone is in my position, they can't understand. My psychiatrist's son is at the same school as I am (but not the same class), and she's telling me about his classmates and how I should try talking to them. What she doesn't understand is that it's not that simple for a guy. Unless you're really attractive (though to be honest, I don't consider myself ugly, but clearly girls do and it's their opinion about my looks that matter when it comes to whetever or not they'll date me or not, not my own opinion), it's not that simple. I can't randomly walk up to someone I don't know and start talking to them. They'd think I'm creepy. And since I wouldn't know anything about that person, the conversation would end after ""Hi"" ""Hi"", since I would have no idea what to say next. If they'd even reply to the ""Hi"" in the first place, that is. Most likely they'd get creeped out that a stranger is talking to them and they'd just walk away to laugh with her friends about the weird guy that talked to her out of nowhere.

One of my friends, after \*he\* broke up with his girlfriend, claimed to understand how I feel, because he too thinks girls won't like him. You know... despite the fact that he had a girlfriend that \*he\* ended things with, \*and\* not even two months later he's dating someone else. Yeah dude, we're absolutely in the same boat /s.

And speaking of friends, it doesn't seem like I have those anymore either. I have 3 friends. Two of which are also friends with each other. The guy I mentioned in the previous paragraph keeps making excuses not to hang out with me. Probabily doesn't have time for the lonely guy now that he has a girlfriend again. I thought this summer break we'd meet more often since we don't have school. Yeah... no. Since summer break started, we met a grand total of two times.

As for the two that are also friends with each other, earlier this year they made another friend, and since then it was always just the three of them hanging out, never inviting me, despite the fact that all 4 of us watch anime, so it's not like I wouldn't be able to relate or contribute to the topics they'd be talking about. Recently they had an argument with the new friend, so they called me to hang out. We met just once this entire summer break, right after they got angry at the new friend. I'm just the backup friend, the one they keep just close enough that I don't cut ties with them, but just far away enough that they only invite me to hang out if there's no better option to invite.

Why would a girl like me if not even my ""friends"" want to hang out with me anymore?",lonely,I will never have a girlfriend,2019-08-05 23:42:02

1808,StrangeApeCreature,1565001159,1,"I'm a girl, he's a guy. Both currently 22. We were always [functionally] platonic. We've known each other for a decade.

I reached out, he reciprocated, happily I should add. I hadn't spoken to this guy for 4 painful years and boy, I've missed him like hell. I loved him since high school, never told him because I didn't want to compromise our friendship. I don't make friends. I don't know where he even cane from. But he was one of 2 friends that I had all through highschool. I wasn't going to risk it. Tempting fate and teetering on the edge of the unknown.

There's another reason I never told him too. As long as I've know him, he only expressed interest in and pursued white girls. Me? I'm a long ways off from being a white girl. I just respected that boundary the whole 4 years of high school. 

Before we graduated, I strongly considered telling him how I felt. But in the end I decided against it. He was unsuccessfully pursuing another girl at that time anyway 

We went to the same college. A community college in our area. We even chose the same major: science. We talk every week. He mentions a girlfriend. I avoid him for months. I had reached my breaking point.  After I'm done being a coward and ignoring my best friend, I hunt him down and hang with him. This would be the last time I would see him until yesterday. The last time in 4 painful years.

I had a dream he died the day before yesterday. As a result of that dream, and a few other factors, I hunted him down through the internet. The only way I could find him was through YouTube of all places, but I got him nonetheless. We talked for 6 1/2 hours straight. We talked like we never stopped. He talked about some white girl he says he loves. Fuck it. I told him everything. No reciprocation. What a shock /s. But he... commended me for telling him. Said he already knew. I wasn't shocked about that either. I'm obvious. 

I told him everything. I told him that he was the only person I've ever liked. He really is too. So many guys have tried me. I've never felt anything towards anyone else. Never, not once. I told him that he can do whatever he likes (of course, I would never impose). And I told him that I would be happy alone, and I would chose it before I chose anyone but him in a heartbeat. And that's exactly what I feel. Always have.

Then we continued our conversation, which was great btw. So, yeah, I'm going to die alone.

TL;DR

After years of suppression, I told my best friend, the only person I've ever loved, that I love him. That I will happily [as I can in that situation] chose to be alone than to be with anyone else other than him. He didn't reciprocate. I'm going to die alone.

1814,_Dogfood__,1564989156,4,"I want to tell my story I just never had anyone to tell it too and I know it tends to get buried beneath various other post but I just want to know if there is someone else who understands how I feel. 

I grew up in a car and anythimg before that I cannot recall, I have dreams at times of what my life was like before but they are far too hazy for me to make any sense of what they are about but most other nights I have nightmares of what happened during my time living in the car. Since I was a kid at the time everybody assumes it never affected me because I simply didn't understand what was going on but I understood it all. 

I grew sensitive to sounds and became paranoid because my parents would fight or my brother would come by once in a while and start yelling at my dad but as soon as it came down to me and him he would occasionally hit me and yell at me. 
During my time living like this, this was the only human interaction I ever had. I would never speak to people in school because I was far too afraid of people at the time but whenever I did or I had to I would always lie... That is something that still bothers me to this day because I cannot stop lying. 

My brother never stopped putting me down and after we found a place and I had began going to therapy I was diagnosed with PTSD and all I learned was how to cope with it through tactics like Grounding or Taking deep breaths... But no one had wanted to help me... I asked for medicine but my parents refused because they didn't want that for me. I am always left alone and I dislike it because I feel like I am suffocating and I am the one choking myself because of how badly my mind is scrambled... 

I can't tell whats real or not... If I truly am sick or if I became a manipulative cruel person just so I can survive another day ... My brother tells me I am insane and do not have anything wrong with me and I have to stop thinking about it. I sometimes want to mentally tear myself apart to see if I have anything good inside of me or if that child I once was died in that car long ago and something worse reemerged from the wreck. 

Time feels like it is slipping from my hands and I cannot grasp onto it any longer, everything feels like it is repeating. I returned to the same storage place I grew up in and I felt my chest tighten and the sensation of a heatwave blow over me. We're losing our apartment now and the worse part is I am turning 18 soon ... My chance for help is getting off my grasp because I will no longer be child... I will be on my own, abandoned and forgotten how I once was as a kid long ago... No one was ever willing to help me and I grew up in a place where I never stood a chance. 

The closer I get to my birthday the quicker I feel my dreams and ambitions die... Like that little kid I swore I would protect deep down is dying all over again and there is nothing I can do... The nightmares are worse now and the night time is growing darker... I just want to yell and shout but I just don't have the energy to do it anymore. 

I don't get why I am writing this now I just want to know if someone out there understands... I don't know how to talk to people because I never learned... There isn't much youtube videos out there that can help me with that.

This is the 7th post of me writing about how I feel and most just get buried beneath various other posts... I won't delete this one this time. 

I sit here alone and with my thoughts isn't as comforting as it sounds... I can't tell what hurts more... If I kill myself no one would really care/ they'd just blame me for being weak or the fact that I don't have anybody to live for because not even my own parents acknowledge my existence.",lonely,One Last Shot,2019-08-05 17:12:36

One of my female acquaintances recently lost her older sister to suicide. Yesterday she was talking about it and it turns out her sister was incredibly lonely.

This is why it also makes me angry when people say ''Relationships are not as great as you think''. It is abundantly clear that people need deep, meaningful connections with other humans.

Missing the feeling of wanting someone to motivate you to do better or having things to look forward to. My disability I got while I was in service made it hard to get a job, so my interactions with people are limited. I have a rough time starting conversation, but tend to have a lot of things on my mind if someone else initiates. Didn't help when my ex did not want me doing anything with anyone, waiting for something that never came for years. 

Fell into a heavy gambling problem that has been much better after moving out of parents house last year. Feels good to live on my own once again, but still have that feeling of wanting to be needed for anything.

1830,hamartiated,1564971420,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Here it goes.

So, every night, I have this habit. I put on one of these Japanese ASMR roleplay clips. I speak Japanese so I have a ton of them. Ever since I found out that one of my core issues for my detachment and emotional dryness is childhood emotional neglect, I tried to look for particular clips that involved ""mothers"". I found a few that I now listen to repeatedly. I'm the kind of person that can really live inside a fantasy, so when I put on these clips and feel like I'm being cuddled and taken care of, I can't help but smile and feel pleasant. It made me realize how little I experienced this feeling, no I actually never experienced it. My mother never gave hugs or kisses or compliments to us as children, nor even said things like ""I love you"", so this is a novel feeling I discovered thanks to these clips. How nice it feels to be taken care of. Even though there's no real person there, but it's real enough for me to believe it and live in it. There are certain ""ASMRtists"" who really know how to make quality binaural audio and believable scripts, so it's not just sounds and empty sweet talk, it's an immersive experience. Anyway...

Last night I had one of the most pleasant dreams of my life, derived directly from the clips I was listening to before bed. It's like the character inside the audio file came to life inside my dream. Hugging me, telling me it's alright, stroking my hair and cheeks, letting me sleep to the sound of her heartbeat while resting on her chest. There's nothing sexual about this fantasy btw, which is what felt even stranger to me, considering my addiction to porn (and other sexual ASMR clips I sometimes listen to). But this is just pure and simple relaxation, gentleness, and peace. I went to sleep smiling, had a pleasant dream, and woke up smiling. Then I got up, went for a run, came back and had a shower and breakfast, and felt like... life had a purpose. I know it's temporary. I've had dreams were I ""fell in love"" or some faceless girl fell in love with me, and it feels nice for a while. This is probably just like one of those dreams except more intense and personal (and non-romantic), but it still feels great. Plus I rarely had any sleepless nights ever since I started listening to the right ones that tapped right into... the core of the child in me... or something lol. It's like this child takes possession of me every night now, and allows me to take the back seat while he teaches me not to care about anything and let go.

When I see people here always posting about feeling lonely at night, I try my best to resist suggesting this kind of thing to them, because it's not for everyone that's for sure, and maybe they tried and didn't work for them, but the return I'm getting from these is just way too good not to share with those who may not have tried it.

So, if you constantly feel lonely and need some kind of temporary company, consider this solution. It's not perfect, but it *could* works wonders for your current mood and short term mental health, speaking from firsthand experience. 

And if you are an ASMR listener too, how well does it work for you?

Pointless post? Maybe, I don't know. I hope not.

I'm really sorry about the length, I try my best to be brief but the lack of character limit on reddit allows me to indulge in myself.

1865,Sernock,1564919521,1,"2 years and a bit ago, at 15, I was in a mental hospital on the advice of my GP for depression. I had life which by then had become more consciously grim, though from childhood, I never had many friends and was mocked quite often. My school life was particularly grey, only every enjoying myself in jokes. The place the GP had sent me too was a tad excessive for what was actually wrong, but it was a modern and nice looking facility and he probably thought it was the best thing he could arrange. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if many people have been in similar mental hospital youth units, but my own perception (coloured by the fact I did not probably have a real discernible illness to hang over me), was like that of a summer camp with a side-function, and with similarly marginal people. We had our own rooms with our own bathrooms, a central lobby with a TV, DVD player and Wii. 2 couches and maybe six chairs? That was the social area anyway. God knows how long we spent there. Then there was a kitchen (we did OT activities every week like cooking and baking), an arts and crafts room which effectively doubled as a back-up social place. We went on trips out every now and again, to the cinema and the zoo and that. We were supervised by a bunch of nurses, in my mind divided between the young ones who were social and friendly to us, and the slightly older ones who were bossy and cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was very awkward with people when I first went in. I mostly remember my life so far in general in different embarrassing events that have happened thus far. The first person who met me was a 13 year old girl with borderline disorder (which I found out much later). Immediately started being very friendly with me, insisted on painting my face every day for nearly a week straight. Was very happy initially. No one had ever had so much concern for me. However, as I later found out, borderline often results in random and fleeting obsessions. There was a guy who was a bit more contrivedly macho, though I was friendly with due common lad culture which I wasn't completely out of where I grew up. Depression and anger, I can only sum his problems being. After a few days another person was admitted, a guy who was as weedy as me but lankier. I wish we could have been greater friends, but I always struggled to have something to say to him. There was a posh-ish girl, who loved stock phrases, and didn't really mix with the others. I only figure she felt above the whole alt/marginal social bubble the social was. A guy who was 15, looked 8. A sporty girl who didn't say much, or didn't have much to say. A wealthy girl from the country, who was more mildly mad. That was  the first period. All nice people, who were good friends to me until they went. Was the first time I really felt like I had a community of friends, like I had a discernible social life. Part of that is because of the fact that it's a live-in unit, and people are practically forced to become acquainted to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a second distinct period of my stay, which I define by being more confident at that period. People told me I was funny a lot at this time. I don't know if it was just in the general spirit of 'wholesome support' to be complimentary or genuine, but from the moodiness of school, I always did want to make any situation a laugh. I had the same ratio of gaffes and embarrassments I've always had, but I had a bit of an ego. People were discharged and new people came in, which meant I could give a more tailored impression to them. Part of this period was a then-male friend who said they were trans (and later proved it to my surprise), a pair of socialites (in my perception) which comprised a FtM boy and a chubby guy who called himself autistic (I'm not so sure of). There was a girl with a squeaky voice who told a very disturbing, but seemingly unlikely story. There was a country girl with a bad family history. A kind of a cringey guy who wore Star Wars helmets and talked all the time about his 14 year old girlfriend (he was 17, slightly weird).

&amp;#x200B;

Then came in a thin girl, very pale. I remember she sat down with her feet on the seat, sipping one of those fattening milk drinks you give to people with eating disorders. I wanted to talk to her, but after a while she was scooped up into the group of the ED girls. Gradually started to have a bit of an infatuation with her. This largely involved me catching long glances at her from the opposite couch before anyone would notice. We didn't talk that much, really. When it was her birthday and her family came in to visit I remember making her laugh by dancing outside her room. Then we'd interact when part of the group when making prank calls and that. I remember being asked if I had a crush in the unit, which I didn't want to answer as I knew my chances were low and if it were not mutual it would only lead to awkwardness. In the faux-jewellery making class, I made her a bracelet with her initials and astrological sign (she was into that sort of thing), and she gave it back not understanding it to be a gift which I took to mean something worse. I flirted with her one day, attempting to pass it off as a joke (which would've been easy given how I acted), and I didn't get any resistance.

I was told the next day on weekend leave after probing accidental clues left by one of the friends that she did like me. That was the best single experience of my life so far. I had never felt that given who I was physically and mentally, that a girl would like me. I just felt like everything was going to work out fine. We were 'coupled' immediately the next day. We were being supervised, so we couldn't do much apart from sit next to each other or hold hands under a coat the few times we went to the cinema. But I was in a trance. She was such a soft and warm person, who would play along with every attempt I had to make a joke. I always sat next to her. When she picked out songs for the 'music appreciation activity I resonated with her. We watched Moulin Rouge 5 times. 

I laughed more with her than anyone else. Though I was still anxious about things and made mistakes, I got toy slime in her one day hair accidentally, which I knew was really bad, but she was entirely sweet to me even though I knew I made her upset. I tried to kiss her at the cinema. With people next to us...and while she was obviously not feeling it right to be the time, she was still kind about it. I was for the first time in my life really feeling something amazing. I wanted us to just get closer and closer, despite the fact that she lived a bit away from me and I'd be leaving the unit soon. She was anorexic, and I found out through her mainly how terrible the experience was. We ate together every day, and I began to properly notice how they struggled picking the food off the cutlery. She was managing though, and with generally being brought out of her own shell, I knew she was going to be fine

I was always vague in my 'treatment' at the hospital, and that meant that I was there for 3 months, although I was content with that. Having friends made me feel much better than any of the support options they had there. When I finally ran out of time, I still was in the bubble via a groupchat.  I texted my new girlfriend every day. Though my life was very dull afterwards, the mindless optimism of the unit made me ignore it. Texting her was everything to me then. The others did not really try to contact me on their own initiative. I should have done it myself, but I just felt like not having them in person would not work out. We met up as groups on 2 or 3 occasions, which was as fun as I imagined. I got to kiss her in my friend's bathroom on of these times, which was stiffer than I had imagined. 

I wanted to go deeper. I asked her everything I could imagine, about what she wanted in the future. We managed one date to a film. The distance was more of a problem then I thought as I struggled to pay for and arrange buses as the right time. Then she became more distant to me. Only giving shallow replies and that. I had to be accomodatable given the problems she had, so I did give her space for a few weeks. I talked to her one time about how maybe it would be a good idea to talk via phone or video chat. She responded about how she was 'proud' of the fact that she could say no, even though I had only suggested it to fix the distance I thought was mutually problematic. I wasn't pushy at this time, but when she said this I got a little perturbed and just mentioned it. She apologised, and I thought about how to approach this, if we could try to figure something mutually beneficial out. The next day she replied about how I was talking to her wasn't 'acceptable'. I thought maybe she had talked to her friends, exaggerated the problem a bit as one naturally does when looking for empathy, and they advised to her be more assertive or something, despite the lack of a real issue. 

And at this point, I started behaving the worse. I snapped at her and insulted her with something really terrible, which I didn't really mean, but was directed at the lack of concern I thought she had for me at this point. We roughly patched things up after I talked to her friend, but she went a bit cold. Because she had a more serious illness than me, I felt I couldn't act as a wedge between her and the general closeness of the friend group when it offered it support. I left the group chat and that. One person contacted me after. I had lost all my friends just like that. I don't know why I didn't say anything after this. I really don't. More than anything I don't understand my motive or reason. I didn't talk to her for a few months after this. I had some feeling that I had to wait. I felt like things could work out in time, but I felt like I couldn't talk to her \*right now\*. There was one person from the unit I had intermittent contact with, who was similarly as low as I am, but they gradually got exhausted with me and they're now gone.

I did send her some jokes after that. This led to a conversation where she told me she didn't want to be my girlfriend anymore. At that point I knew that all of the good I thought the hospital that left me with, and the social life I thought I could get back was completely gone. I told her I was suicidal.  I wanted her to be sympathetic. I broke down, and she blocked me after I suggested I was doing harm to her now. I tried a few weeks later with a really pathetic attempt that just put me in A&amp;E for a dozen hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

She never came back around after that. I watched her online presence. I made new accounts to talk to her which she blocked. I had no friends.

I moved school due to failing performance. I thought I'd make friends, but I wasn't able to, and I had a worse sense of social isolation. It went by like that, I was eighteen. 

I'm now going into college in September, trying to get through summer. 

Every few months there was a new profile picture for her. Her account with go intermittantly public than private. 

A few weeks ago I got a response from her finally, filled with just courtesies and telling me she wanted to avoid me because she wanted to 'close that chapter of my life'.

Then yesterday I saw for the first time another guy in the pictures, with his own profile picture featuring her, and captions featuring both of them from her friends. I can't look at the pictures any more. I've shut down all my accounts because I don't want to have to see that again. I can't fantasise of having her back because that ugly interferrance would come into it. 

I felt that even if my social life was gone, even if I can't ever be with her ever again. She would always be mine, just in a detached, virtual way. 

The image of her with someone else is too much. It's disgusting and repulsive. It shows that she's now gone entirely from the scene of my mind. I thought we were in the same place, separate. She is happy with someone else, and with her friends. She thinks of me as a gross, ugly villain from her past, and she's right. I have always been possessive. 

I am not actually attractive or personably appealing at all. She had been alone for 6 months in a bedsit, in hospitals, as those caring for her did not understand what was wrong

for some reason. She was isolated, and when she went into the unit, she found friends, and with the cabin fever she had, imagined me in her head to be

funnier, more good looking than I was. When I went back to school, and people had found out, they did not believe I had a girlfriend. 

When she blossomed, she knew how little value I actually was to her. I fucked up, lost her and allowed any connection which I could have maintained to fall away. I was never going to get her back after that few months. And now, I am not even a romantic thing lost. I am just an ugly component of regret and anecdotes.

For the last two years she was still my girl in my head. The one thing I had always wanted was to hold her in my arms in bed as we'd both drift off to sleep. It actually kept me awake, but every night I still thought of it. 

I wish I never had the unit because it gave me expectations that I never should have had. If I had just continued living as I did, maybe I'd find a better groove alone to live by. I wouldn't be deluded into thinking that people would love me as much I love them. But here I am. I will never do better than her. 

Now, I am alone. I know I am not going to get a life in college, as I did not one in the new school. I have no friends who care about me. I tried to get some help through stupid appeals on my social media but people are just not involved with me anymore.

Yes, I'm lonely, but that's not an excuse to wait around and feel miserable until someone shows up. If you're lucky, it works out and someone does find you. But chances are, you're not. I'm not.

The problem we're facing folks is something a lot more personal, not external. I suspect we need direction. We need something to do -- by ourselves; while at the same time we need to get out more. Find ways to interact with more people. Sometimes due to circumstance we end up in lonely places. And it's painful, but dammit we should try to snap out of it! 

But how?! 

I don't know. But perhaps I should start by finding something productive to do. Such as writing. Painting. Learning an instrument.

Throughout my high school years, I started to get heavily with some depression, but I can say that I did have some very good friends to hang out with that I loved very much. I had a good home, a great family, but feeling down all the time slowly became an increasingly normal issue to the point that I began isolating myself from everyone and becoming very antisocial. Graduating was awkward for me because while I felt like I was very glad to be rid of high school and what I felt back then were very toxic people, I also realize now that I was pushing away my friends at the same time as the rest of the people I knew back then. A majority of the time over the past years for me has consisted of being isolated and self deprecating. I moved out of my parents house about a year after graduation to a place about an hour away from them feeling like I couldn‚Äôt stand having my parents stare at me behind my back all the time wondering why I don‚Äôt go out with my friends anymore.

I‚Äôve never had that many friends, I wasn‚Äôt a complete loner but never got invited to the events that everyone else did because I was always focused on school as I am now. When I got to college I made a group of friends and felt like I was in the ‚Äúin crowd‚Äù, it was fun for a while but made some bad decisions because of it. I‚Äôve never actually had a bf, idk what‚Äôs wrong with me?! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm completely ugly, I mean I‚Äôm not perfect by any means but I‚Äôm okay looking, I‚Äôm smart, know what I want, but just don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still alone and why no one ever tried or tries having an actual relationship with me. I‚Äôve always allowed myself to be the behind the scenes girl and I was okay with that for a while because I at least felt wanted and needed but I‚Äôm fed up of feeling empty and worthless because of that. I‚Äôm 22 (almost 23 this month) and have yet to experience that fierce love that everyone desires, of course I picked a major in college that is completely time consuming and demanding and I‚Äôm not complaining because I know I‚Äôll be successful.

1906,tnert10,1564875548,1,"I start school again soon and I really am not looking forward to it. Last year I was excited about being better friends with a lot of the people at my school (my friend group was mostly the popular kids there), and that started coming true. I started fitting more into the group and it was a really nice feeling. 

1/2 way into last year, I became very distrustful of my best friend in that group because of something personal (which has been mutually resolved). That‚Äôs when things started to crack. We weren‚Äôt best friends afterwards, she and 3 other girls became the head popular girls of their group.  However, they somehow booted one out and made her change schools. That‚Äôs when I really started to distance myself from them. 

After that, I didn‚Äôt really feel like I had a best friend at school. I didn‚Äôt really feel like I had any close friends at school. I just felt uncomfortable, I felt this weird vibe around them.  Everything changed again on our school trip.

Our school took a class trip on spring break to St Augustine (I live in FL) I was in a room with the guys in our little friend group. They played a prank on me that really pissed me off and pretended like they never did it. Some of them were nice afterwards but I haven‚Äôt even seen some of them since. 

Over summer, I was only contacted by one of the people in our group. We hung out for a very brief time, before he left with other friends. That same day, someone in our group canceled on me in favor of someone else, coincidentally in the same friend group.

Now, I go back to school with all of them in a couple weeks.  It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna get the silent treatment or be completely ignored, but I‚Äôm kind of pissed off. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that I (not to brag, but) was one of the smarter kids in the group. I always helped people out with answers or ideas for assignments, I always gave people food if they wanted it, and for the most part, was pretty nice and funny.  Nobody ever had a problem with me and brought it up to me, but knowing them, talking about me behind my back isn‚Äôt out of the question. I tried my best to make some friends, and instead, I got a prank pulled on me, I lost one of my best friends, and I went all the way back to square one. 

Since school is coming up again, it just feels like the only loser was me. All of my energy spent over last school year, towards making friends with these people who are all nice and pleasant and fun with each other?  Wasted.  Now that I‚Äôve spent all summer talking with maybe 3 friends that don‚Äôt even know a lot of my school friends, I feel kind of bitter. I feel cast aside from my friends at school.

1909,noideatbh33,1564872547,4,"Hi reddit, 
before you read this I want to tell you that I will share this comment in similar subs. 


I am a 21 year old engineering student, live in a first world country and my family, although not rich, is wealthy enough for me to not have financial problems. 

After graduating highschool i spent almost a whole year being unemployed and not in any form of education.

I was never a socializing person. It probably started in 6th or 7th grade. Throughout all of highschool I had an ""IDC and I hate everybody attitude"" which caused my social status to be even lower than it used to be. 

However, all of this really didnt bother me until after I graduated.


In my wasted year after school, I finally realized how lonely and unexperienced I was in comparison to my peers. I have no friends, no social circle, no social status, no girlfriend or anything that would come close to even that.

I am sexually inexperienced and dont feel like that will change at all in the future.

I know that I am ugly. I have been called ugly in public, on the internet, by strangers and by aquaintances of friends that Ive met on rare special occasions.
I took a few pictures of myself that I thought would be nice and uploaded them on photofeeler 
to see how others think of me.
Unsurprisingly the results were indifferent to what Id experienced in real life.

People voted me dumb, unauthentic, unattractive, uncharismatic and what else there was to be voted. I averaged a 2 in all of the fields.

Some of you will say that the website is only applicable for pictures and not a ranking for the human on it. However, thats not my only experience with this.

Whenever i dragged myself out of the house to get under people, wherever it was (clubs, bars, restaurants, and open air parties, or even shopping in malls and whatnot) I got the typical disgusted look from all girls I saw. 

All of these encounters, the memories, the sexual inexperience and the lack of business in my overall life caused me to fall into a rabbithole.

I found things like The Red Pill, The Black Pill, Incels and whatever else there is. It was a terrible place to encounter. I went to the wrong place at the wrong time, and im my moments of sadness I felt as if I could identify with those people. Finally someone was there that understood me. I was no longer alone. But I knew that it was wrong. There enough cases of counterevidence to debunk the slightes bit of ""logic"" those communities provide as evidence for being the stupid fallacies that they are.

And now I feel even lonelier than I did before.

I am objectively ugly, I know that there are always  people that will find you attractive, but that doesnt seem to help me.

I am socially outcast, I dont have anything in common with the people of my age.

I am sexually inexperienced which causes me to be even less confident.

Seeing people fall in love is painful. I dont want to  be jealous but I cant help myself falling into a pit of selfloathing.

I missed out on my youth and everything else that society deems normal for people my age.

I am unloved, unwanted, depressed, ugly, stupid and lonely.

I just want love but I know that it wont happen.

People told me that I should find love in college or else Id be alone forever.

After few of my observations in my high school, It was pretty obvious that confidence plays a huge role in the social life, you can find people who were unattractive but still getting much more friends than you, only because they are much more confident. As for myself, I am pretty anti-social.

1924,snappyhappypants,1564861971,18,"Hey reddit. My life has come to the point where I‚Äôm reaching out to the internet for help, which is pretty new and weird to me. 

I‚Äôm a 15 year old girl, and I‚Äôm having problems. I‚Äôm not joking when I say the only people I have in my life are my parents, and although they love me they can‚Äôt be there for me. I‚Äôm really hesitant to ranting about my life online, but I‚Äôve been trying to deal with the hurt for so long I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôm deadass cringing right now writing this.

I keep reading everywhere that every teenager goes through a phase where they‚Äôre constantly upset and moody, so I just assumed that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been feeling down this past year. But at this point I‚Äôm suffocating. I constantly feel so lonely and hurt that I can‚Äôt breathe, there‚Äôs no where for me to go, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been truly happy at one point this year. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm so lost. I lost my only friend last month because she grew out of me, and today is her birthday. I feel like I‚Äôm in a cage. There‚Äôs literally no way to escape how I‚Äôm feeling.

I‚Äôm also a super studious person and I‚Äôve always put heavy emphasis on school but lately I‚Äôve been skipping summer classes and dodging other responsibilities so I can stay home and watch tik tok all day. Yeah, pretty sad lmao. I‚Äôm dead serious when I say that the only time I‚Äôm laughing is when I‚Äôm on my phone. I‚Äôm using it to fill my time at this point, because unless I‚Äôm keeping myself busy the hurt gets to me. It‚Äôs hard to describe my feelings, but in a nutshell I feel lonely, suffocated, depressed, and taunted.

I‚Äôm also a very ugly, self conscious person. And I don‚Äôt mean below average looks, I‚Äôm actually the ugly girl at school with crooked teeth, uneven bumpy skin, a big nose+forehead, ugly chin, frizzy hair, and a extremely skinny figure. If someone I know reads this, they‚Äôll probably know who I am. And I don‚Äôt really get bullied as much as I receive judging looks and pity. I‚Äôve gotten comments to my face talking about how unattractive I am and I‚Äôve had people talk about me in disgust, too. The people I know and surround me also nonchalantly poke at my looks and talk about how I won‚Äôt get married in the future, and it really stings. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm too disgusting to make friends, and it really takes a toll on me.

I feel like this is more of a brain dump than a rant because I‚Äôm wrapped in so much self hate that I tear up when I see myself in the mirror. I‚Äôve been rude to my parents lately and I yell back for even minor inconveniences, which is unlike me. I‚Äôve also been seeking comfort in my younger sister, but she‚Äôs too embarrassed to be around me. 

I thought it would just be a phase, but it‚Äôs lasting too long. I‚Äôve finished puberty and I‚Äôve pretty much grown into my face and there‚Äôs nothing to do about it because I look crusty and makeup and I don‚Äôt believe in plastic surgery.

I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt find happiness in life because when I wake up every morning, the first emotion I feel is self disgust. Whenever I find myself smiling at the thought of someone good looking I mentally beat myself up for even imagining the thought of finding love, so I‚Äôve abandoned the idea.

I just want a friend, but it‚Äôs hard to find someone to talk to without being cringed at. Even the nicest girls feel pity for me, and I can see it in their eyes. Whenever I get excited people look st me weirdly and I immediately feel horrible.

It‚Äôs not even like I‚Äôm a diamond in the rough or whatever because my personality is pretty shit too. I‚Äôm high key stressed, controlling, clingy, self conscious, and annoying.

It seems really unfair that someone like me exists. I have big dreams, and my priority right now is getting into my dream school. But it‚Äôs hard to focus on my dreams when I hate and doubt myself so much. I can‚Äôt find a way to relieve myself of the pain.

I can‚Äôt love myself. Even though I‚Äôll always be unattractive, which I‚Äôm okay with, I just want to learn to live with it. But it‚Äôs hard to love yourself when the only love you received is from either pity or obligation. I don‚Äôt know how to live with myself. I just wish I could get rid of these feelings, and care less about other opinions.

Self care posts on Instagram are total bullshit tbh. Like there‚Äôs no way in hell that putting cucumbers in my water and organizing my pencil case is going to help me. 

So, Reddit. I‚Äôm near rock bottom. The only thing I have going for me is my grades bc im pretty smart and I like to learn, but that‚Äôs slipping away  lol. If I fall any lower I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll survive.

1933,Sparklelyy,1564849867,0,"If you are feeling lonely and rejected, perhaps it's the toxic community around you, or that people have brushed by you without giving a second look. Sometimes it may even be your own close friends among your minute social circle that is giving you the cold shoulder(or at least you feel that way but don't want to say it to them because u have a lot to lose)

I felt the same way before, and I've taken some steps in an attempt to save myself, perhaps it'll help you too.

1. Be honest with yourself
    
If you don't like how it is being done, say it.
If  you don't like how he/she is behaving, be civil about it.
If you know something, don't feign ignorance.
If you don't know something, don't pretend to do so.
The list goes on, but essentially make sure you understand how YOU are feeling about things, without taking into consideration of how other people view you first. Then move onto thinking of how you should behave. 
I feel this is very important to me especially because I've sometimes shaped my reactions, behaviour and eventually my thoughts to how other people react, and in that sense I've lost my individuality and hence charisma to attract others.

2. Confidence should be moulded, not masked.

Do things that will make you feel better about yourself, that makes you feel on top of this world. Advice telling you to pretend to be confident is short term planning. If you are honest with yourself and self aware to know that you need confidence, then do something you are good at to gain that.

3. Learn to love yourself

If you don't love yourself don't expect others to do so. They don't think of why they should love you for you, you gotta do it for them. It's alright if some people don't see it of course, because u have the self confidence to know that you have self-worth.

4. Express yourself as who you are, after you have done the 3 steps before.

This comes naturally after I managed to do the above 3(to some extent). I'm still in the middle of trying to follow these guidelines I've created for myself and I feel I've made progress so far. In fact making this post itself is a form of expression to gain self confidence (step 2).

Long post and thanks for reading if you have come down to the bottom here. If you feel some things I've said is flawed or can be improved please tell me. And if you want someone to talk to, drop me a message.

I'm just looking mates...that's all. And again...UK ONLY. Let me know.

The reason why I say uk only...is becuase I make online friends and I still feel alone. Doesn't help with my anxiety...still feel like I have this dark cloud hanging about my head. I feel like meeting people and having real life interactions and experience will help me better myself and deal with this frustration.

1938,Dankulousvankermit,1564841907,2,"Im  and have been through a lot over the past few years. When i was 12 one of my only friends died from a heart attack and i was left to cope with it on my own. As you can guess at age 12 i was not ready to deal with that level of grief. It brought me to the point of suicide a few months later and to this day i dont know how im still here.

A few years later i was diagnosed with pectus caranatum wich is a chest deformity. I was given a chest brace i had to wear 23 hours a day. I could no longer sleep and my anxiety went insane as i feared that my chest will return to its original shape forcing me to start again at square one. I ended up wearing it for only 18 months but to this day i have anxiety attacks when i forget i dont need it.

During this time i was diagnosed with a sensory disorder than impacted on my ability to think and write. Essentially i need rhythm to function and i struggle in crowded spaces where my movement is restricted. This is when i really fell in love with music as it allowed me to concentrate and work effectively.

When i was 16 i lost one of my best friends to suicide. This broke me in a way i had never felt before. I would have never made it through those painful months without my friend pheobe. Even with her support however i changed from the grief in a way that wasn't positive.

Two months later i witnessed another person i cared about attempt suicide. It felt like i was watching my best friend die infront of me, which brought the pain flooding back. Once again i made it through because of pheobe. By this point i was falling in love with her and it wasnt long before we became a couple. 

At the end of the year pheobe left on a trip on an overseas trip. She was away for about seven weeks, but everyday felt like hell. I wasnt coping well with my grief and trauma and to top it off my anxiety was at an all time high. I barely got to communicate with pheobe for the time she was away, but when she returned home we finnaly saw each again. 

She had no interest in me and turned her nose up at the poem i had written for her. Two weeks later she left me after saying i was unnatractive and awkward. Just when i thought i had hit rock bottome i fell even further. I would spend hours just staring off into the distance tok numb to move. Pheobe was insistant that we should remain best friends, yet she avoided my every attempt to talk to her.

In the end i cut communication with her and went my own way. She has hated for it ever since and to this day wont look me in the eye. As i looked at myself in the mirror tonight i realised i loathe myself. I attempted suicide four times a few weeks back and still battle the urges. Im on a path of healing but cant help feel i dont derserve to heal.

1949,RoughEnvironment,1564823768,3,"Most my life, I‚Äôve always had very limited number of friends, who again didn‚Äôt feel that close in the moment. As I headed to college, most of my good friends moved out all across the country for different colleges. While unfortunately I found nobody among my peers at college. 

I‚Äôve just graduated college a few months. I am not particularly fond of the country that I‚Äôm born and have lived in. Fortunately enough, I managed to find an opportunity to leave this place. I‚Äôll be leaving next month. Being so detached, not having any good ‚Äòlifelong‚Äô friends in the college I went to, I was always looking forward to leave. 

One of my old friends, from 6th grade, has always been ‚Äòpresent‚Äô. Despite our vastly different walks of life after 8th grade, we‚Äôve managed to keep touch. Not as frequently, but with the occasional long ‚Äòcatching up‚Äô phone calls. She‚Äôs definitely one of the few people I‚Äôd consider a lifelong friend. 

So, being free and jobless for a few months, I figured I‚Äôd visit her at where she‚Äôs studying for a couple of days. Especially because I might not meet her for a very long time when I leave. She was a great host, she put a lot of effort to show me around, also I hung out with 8-9 friends of her‚Äôs one night with an awful amount of booze (last night, lol). Given me, it wasn‚Äôt particularly the best experience. They were all mostly great people, sure. Although, it was very overwhelming. 

While all this, I got to see how my friend has indeed changed a little. Which is granted how it‚Äôs been about 11-12 years. Changed not in a way that I despise her now or anything, but I definitely felt a little out of place. Like it felt like I knew nobody around me, not even her. It‚Äôs also become difficult to be vulnerable with her, but to no degree to blame her about it. It‚Äôs just very subtle and passive. I‚Äôm trying to paint a picture of how this trip objectively might not be the greatest. Despite that...

I‚Äôm currently in a long cab ride to head to the nearest major city to fly back home. I don‚Äôt know why, but I just started to tear up. It‚Äôs becoming difficult to hold myself in control. So much so, the driver might actually even notice.

I always felt like there is nothing here for me (in this country). That I could just start a new life there, which is still true. But-... It‚Äôs just so overwhelming now. Maybe I will sob on September 20th. (Not heading to Area 51, but moving out of this place on the same day, hehe..)

1965,dutch_guard,1564808156,1,"I just completed my first year of university and now I am really anxious for what the future has for me.

It is summer of 2019 and I just completed my first year at university. And man was it terrible. Please allow me to explain why. At it starts like this:

Every semester the teachers give us a big project for us to work on that lasts for the whole semester (4 months). We are generally supposed to work in groups of 4-5 (which I absolutely hate). The first semester was very rough for me because I did not know anyone nor how their work ethics are. Almost everyone came from the same high school so they worked with the people they are used to working with. I came from a different school so again, I did not know how others worked. I really did not want to do this first group project at all but one group member invited me to join their group so I did despite me hating it. This turned out to be the first and biggest mistake I have ever made at this school. Throughout the entire semester the group kept procrastinating to start on the project until the month before the due date. I decided to just play along because I did not feel like working in this group, especially after I have seen their behavior I in class (more on this some other time). We finally began working on the project and obviously everyone was really stressed and got angry at each other because there was only one month left and this project was big. We couldn‚Äôt make up our minds on what to do but we finally found something to do. After we finished the entire project and presented it, I was really pissed off with my group members at the time and I told myself that I am never going to work with these people ever again. 

Second semester comes by and guess what ‚Äì I AM WORKING WITH THE SAME PEOPLE AGAIN!!! However this time the universe made me work with them because I just happened to be sitting next to them on day the of making the groups. Now, being the absolute beta yes-man cucklord that I am, I said yes and I didn‚Äôt think of telling the teacher later on that I want to work in a different group. Guess what happens next. The whole group procrastinates once again the entire semester and now a couple of weeks before the due date everyone is rushing. We decided to split up the tasks and for some reason I took too much on my plate. The total weight percentage of the parts I had to do was 60% of the whole project. The reason for this is because no one wanted to do the difficult parts so I decided to do them. When I sat and took a look at what I was supposed to do, I had no idea what I was supposed to do with my parts and didn‚Äôt even know how to start. I was beginning to stress out so much. I have never been this stressed in my entire life and I am still stressed to this day because of it. I was so stressed that it started to affect my life. I got major panic attacks, anxiety etc. I started to get really violent in my household and I lost a lot of old friends because of this. At this time I felt broken, hopeless, worthless and I could not function properly. I just gave up on everything. School, life, etc. I just gave up on classes and failed everything later on. Even English. I decided to give up on the project when it was already too late. Two days before the due date I told my group members that I am no longer working with them and I am no longer working on the project and I just ditched school. They sent me text messages telling me to go fuck myself because I ditched them and I didn‚Äôt do nothing with the project the entire time because I didn‚Äôt have anything to offer them. I didn‚Äôt say anything back because I thought that they had all the right to be angry at me for ditching them at the time they needed me the most. This made me feel very sad and anxious for what they are going to do or say to me when they see my face again. I felt like I became what I hate the most. A fake person.

Before the final exam week came, we had a ‚Äúbuffer week‚Äù where there are no classes. During that week, I tried everything I could to get these thoughts out of my head, but I couldn‚Äôt. They kept haunting me day and night to the point I was afraid to even leave my house because I was afraid of seeing them outside. The exam week came and when I arrived at school I saw one of the group members. This person looked the most intimidating to me because when he saw me he just looked at me with an angry face and just shook his head. I understood immediately what he meant because I just betrayed him. I understood that after all he has done for me I ditched them at the time he needed me the most. Throughout the exam week I just did my exams as quick as I possibly could so I could leave campus before they did so I could avoid confrontation. Which explains why I failed every single class. 

Summer finally came and I got a little bit relieved that I wouldn‚Äôt have to see them for a few weeks. But this didn‚Äôt mean my thoughts wouldn‚Äôt haunt me anymore. When it comes to thoughts, they are with you all day everyday. They don‚Äôt take a summer vacation. My thoughts kept haunting me still every single day of summer. I couldn‚Äôt relax properly because I was so stressed and anxious for the next first day of school. Every single morning I would wake up and look at my calendar and count the days before I have to see them again. It was truly the worst summer I have ever had. And now here we are. Stressed, anxious, depressed, lonely, I don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore. School starts again in a week and I am nervous as fuck. I really do not know what to do. I do no want to apologize to them because they are too intimidating. I just want to leave this school and never have to deal with these people ever again.  
 

This is only half of what I wanted to say. There is more to tell about these people from my thoughts but this was already too long. Thanks for reading. :(",lonely,Anxious for what the future has for me (sorry for text barf),2019-08-03 14:55:56
1966,hamartiated,1564806781,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I'm going into my sophomore year of college and I have a group of friends that I am rooming in an apartment with. They all really like me but I don't view them anymore than being superficial. My highschool friends are the greatest people I've ever known. Nobody really compares to them both as friends and intellectuals. Everyone around me feels lesser than them. I know that saying that is placing them on a pedestal and that I'm not allowing myself to really become good friends with other people. It's just so hard to be open when you've already gotten a taste of something that is important to you. 

To try and become more accepting I joined a running club because I ran back in highschool and it was amazing. It was the last time that I felt others truly accepted and appreciated me. As a captain I also had people look up to me, it's a feeling I'd like to reciprocate. In addition to running I started a sand volleyball team with some incoming freshman and people I met over the summer.

I know I'm capable of not being lonely I just need to figure out to accept other people. I'm going to apply to some schools for a possible transfer, but that's only if stuff doesn't work out. My gpa and test scores are high enough that I could go to a better school (already at a decent state school), the only thing limiting that is money. My logic is that I may find people who are more oriented the way I think. And after a year of being unhappy I'm beginning to debate whether being lonely and sad is worth a cheap education.

In the past I‚Äôve always tried to help people where I can, because to be honest I‚Äôm grateful for the bit of interaction it gets me. But recently someone remembered me because they broke up with their boyfriend and have burnt bridge with all her other friends. After a short conversation she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre no help, you don‚Äôt get what loneliness feels like. We can‚Äôt all be robots like you.‚Äù.

What I want to know is how you guys don‚Äôt just flip at them. All I want to do is turn round and say yeah I do. The fact that you flick in and out of my life as I‚Äôm a last resort only makes it worse because it reminds me that I am essentially just a processing robot for peoples hiccups. After she tried to arrange something after she broke up with her last boyfriend two years ago people started to drop out mysteriously. (I have a feeling it‚Äôs because I wasn‚Äôt one of their crowd, just the backup designated driver or whatever is needed but whatever). I said we can still do something if you want to get out and her literal response was ‚Äúew no, I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to think it was a date‚Äù. 

How do you not just tear people down. I may be lonely because I never really got my social life off the ground. The only positive thing I can say about that is people just didn‚Äôt really like me that much. She‚Äôs managed to burn every bridge from being one of the most popular and social people I know to talking to me. That means she should know I know what it feels like, and means that she‚Äôs lonely not because everyone else in the world is an arse and turned on her, but because she‚Äôs bled all her relationships dry and caused people to push her away as relationships have turned parasitic and dictatorial. 

How do you not flip at people who say you don‚Äôt get it, when in fact they‚Äôre not lonely at all. Like they still have a social life I‚Äôd kill to have. Then you offer friendship and help and even then they prefer there version of nothing to you. 

I hate being lonely, and I would wish it on my worst enemy.

I'm a fairly social person, a lot of the time I'm surrounded by people but I can't help feeling that I'm still cut off. 

No one ever messages me first. Almost every day I message someone and the conversation just ceases to be if I don't ask questions in every text. I've had four episodes for self harm in the last few years, once by starving, once by binging/purging and twice by cutting. No one knows because no one ever asked me how I was doing.

I'm better now. I go to the gym almost daily, I eat well, I go outside lots and I try to talk to someone every day. But I'm still angry all the time,  about the months I'd spend barely speaking to a soul and the times I felt like it would be better if I died because I know for a fact that I'm not better because the people around me changed I'm better because they changed me. Strength is the only thing that got me through I sometimes wonder if it's sustainable. 

They probably wouldn't notice if I started to deteriorate, if I stopped talking to them again, lost weight again, if I had inexplicable cuts again. I'm having to keep my head above water knowing full well that if my mental health lapsed no one would be there to help me and that I could die because of it. Every day I exist worrying that even a tiny thing could send me spiralling and the part of me that wants me dead could just eat me alive. Sometimes I get close to that point and I know there's only so many walls I can punch holes in and stress balls I can ruin before those things stop helping.

I've never had a relationship. I sent nudes to some girl I met online before I'd even kissed someone so I just fucking flew through the steps on that one. It's probably because I had the 'audacity', to 'choose' to be a fucking lesbo in what feels like a 1000km radius. I know it seems shallow but being able to tell myself I had someone might help. Unfortunately I'm the only gay I know so I don't even have a shot at making friends who might understand a bit better.

It sounds ridiculous because a lot of the time I'm surrounded by people but I could die of loneliness and that's really not how I want to go out.

I have always been a bit of a loner so having some good friends, I don't reach out beyond that. It didn't bother me that I could count the number of people I have as friends from all my life combined on my two hands. 

But this loneliness is beyond anything I have known. I feel like I'm breaking apart from the inside because I'm so lonely yet the only one I want to talk to is someone I shouldn't even be reaching out to for my own safety. 

I have done everything that I think normally we would all do while getting over a break up. I even had a date which ended into a one night stand because I accidentally farted at him.  

Despite all the shits I have gone through in life, my ex or rather his absence is killing me. 

I function pretty normal throughout the day, even when he's on my mind, i can forget it. But when im home alone its like the mask falls and the unbearable pain starts to ngaw. I want to cry. I have had so many meltdowns. I miss him so much just the thought brings tears to my eyes and I end up sobbing in my bed instead.

1991,Anon4276,1564775132,7,"I suffered an abusive childhood where I was forced to endure long periods of social isolation. When combined with persistent peer rejection it was a formula that guaranteed dysfunction. I'm 37, and I've never had a real job or a real relationship.

I've spent over 20 years disconnected from human society. In this time I've never known what it's like to be touched or what it's like to be loved. I live on disability due to my intense anxiety. Every morning I wake up alone, wipe the tears from my eyes, fulfill my obligations, and wait for the day to end.

I've made attempts to improve my situation. I've tried a number of treatment options, all of which ended in failure. I've tried support groups and volunteering, though I've never made any connections. I'm tired of it all, and it's time to bring this life to an end. I think I've finally been able to accept my own insignificance.

I wanted my suffering to mean something, but we live in a world awash in it. My struggles, my victories and defeats, my need to love and to be loved, none of it matters. My only memories are of misery; I should have never been born. I'll leave this world soon, and it will be as though I never existed.

1999,schmatzkiwe,1564762818,3,"I just wrote this. Most likely it is bs. But well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Perception is a funny thing. 

My perception is: I am lonely. Incredibly, exhaustingly, awfully and mentally killing me lonely. WHO would want me. 40 years, overweight, boring ass guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I have waaay too much time to think about this. 

&amp;#x200B;

The perception of at least 50% reading this is.....""oh my god...what is his problem? I WISHED I would have time. I work my ass off 60+ hours a week"" or ""I have not time at all since I have kids"" or ""just go out there and find someone"" or ""reeeeally? that is his issue...ffs I work several jobs and have no money"" or ""dude...there are people who live in war and/or have no food"".

&amp;#x200B;

And I get it. They are right. 100% right. I am pathetic. 

&amp;#x200B;

You see...I tried. I really did. With the effort I should have put into? Maybe not. But you see it is hard to live in a world where PERCEPTION is everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I live in a world in which 830 million people live in hunger. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I tell myself every day: ""your life is good. you have a job. you have a little bit of money. hell, you even have a house. So SHUT THE FUCK UP and stop complaining"".

&amp;#x200B;

And that is what the world around you tells you too. Basically two things are thrown into your face at every moment: ""stop complaining your live is great"" ""get your shit together it could be much worse"".

&amp;#x200B;

And they are right...it could be much worse. MUCH MUCH worse.  As I said: PERCEPTION. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Still I am sitting here and feeling ashamed, that I feel sorry for myself. That I basically drown in my loneliness. Even though I do not face any ""real"" struggle I suppose. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am clinging to every single straw of hope there is. I write to several of my ex girlfriends. I have started to use an insane expensive online dating site.

I try to distract myself of thinking about how DESPERATELY I want someone to love and BE LOVED.

&amp;#x200B;

But what is the outcome of this? I get even more punched into this dark whole of loneliness and rejection. My Ex are Ex for a reason. Hell I even write with a woman that is married, because the first time I saw her again it struck me like lightning into my heart. She was, maybe is, the symbol of all that went wrong. 

She is stunningly beautiful, the undescribably beautiful as she was 20 years ago. Of course she has a husband and 2 kids, as EVERYONE around me does. You remember? The guys that said ""I wish I would have time"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Well everyone around me is actually not true. Because one woman does not and here we are at my other Ex. When we talk/write for a while I know every time that we are FAR FAR away from each other in what we think or want. How we feel things and how we want things to be. And yet I still write her nearly every day. Why? PERCEPTION. I hope, deep in my heart, it will change. But will it?  Of course not. And I know that...but I use every straw. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just today I set up a message on the dating website saying, that I do not know what really to do on a dating website and a woman liked it. 

So, I took ALL my willpower and wrote to her. 

A funny little text, at least I thought, with quotes from her profile so she should know that I really cared. I made so many little jokes, that before I sent it I was concerned, she thinks I take all of this a s a joke. But the answer I got was: "" I am not very fond of you knowing nothing about dating websites and you could have come up with something funny!"". BAAAM there it is.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, for a confident person, that is not an issue. But I personally have the perception that I am at an all time low emotionally to even sign for a dating website. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I feel like someone laying on the ground and being kicked in the balls. 

&amp;#x200B;

And of course it shows. So now, not being know for being the funny guy, I get told all the time, that I am so pessimistic. Again...no understanding. No help.

Help...yeah maybe I should get help. But do I want to talk about it? NO! I want a partner. Someone to get old with. I want to stop crying while I write this. THAT is what I want.

&amp;#x200B;

But hey..WHO AM I KIDDING?? right?  My life is great. I have ""enough"" money. I have soo much food that I am overweight. So I tell myself: SHUT THE FUCK UP! It could me much worse....",lonely,It could be much worse,2019-08-03 02:20:18

     I'm incredibly lonely (I know big shocker) iv never been in a relationship but I have fallen madly in love with a girl before. I wont say her real name but her nickname was maggie. She was cute energetic and I truly feel like she will become famous. I asked her out durring the end of the school year because even though I knew she was out of my league and too good for me I knew it might have been my only chance. 
     I went a little overboard for just asking her out. I gave her a gold rose and told her all my feelings with a note because I'm too shy to talk. She said no and kind of awkwardly walked to her house. I cant stop thinking about her. My heart breaks to know she will move on and I'll end up not even being a memory. 
     Btw if you're curious she kept the rose. Probably thew it in the trash or something

     I also met this girl online named manou, she was absolutely perfect. And even though I liked her mostly because we had the same sexual fantasies I liked her nontheless. But she had a bf and I kind of ended things because she had been sending me nudes and she told her bf. I ended things because we couldn't flirt or exchange naughty texts like we had been. I miss having her company so much. She always understood and gave me the optimistic talks that I needed she is a great person and I'm about to cry just by talking about how much of a great person she is. 
     Yeah she basically cheated on her bf but at least she was able to came clean. I loved her even more for that even though ultimately she didnt chose me. Fuck I miss her and want to talk to her but she blocked me to prevent her from ""cheating"" again. She doesn't hate me but it was more of a preventative measure for her



I am now flirting with this one girl who loves me but I don't love her. I tell her that I love her but I dont. She is nothing but a chance to loose my virginity to me. Iv told her that I only like her sexually twice but I think she thinks she can make me truly love her. It wont happen. I should probably break things off but the way I see it is that I told her multiple times that I only see her in a sexual light. It's not my fault if she ends up heartbroken. Yeah I'm an asshole and probably at the end of the day didnt deserve those two girls and deserve to be alone forever.

I try to be nice and funny and friendly, but it is never good enough. I got Crohn's when I was a kid, but the past couple years have been extremely difficult health wise. I never have had anyone check how I'm doing. 

All I've done for the past couple years since graduating is work, come home, and play videogames or watch tv alone and in physical pain. I work for a large medical corporation, but have no goals with regards to pursuing a specific type of career. 

Last night, my dad screamed in my face that I'm a lazy motherfucker and he pushed me. Today he told me how sorry he is and to forget everything. But I just can't. It's like, my parents were really the only close bond I had. Now I feel like shit around here, too. 

I am on antidepressants, but I just don't see how pills can help fix my social issues. Sometimes, I just really don't see the point.

2040,hamartiated,1564711381,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

A lot of the kids were toxic, mean, borderline dangerous not the best crowd. I was in some relationships but they were all abusive. My friendships included a lot of manipulation and toxicity. 

My only option was to cut everyone off. After being tired of sitting in my room playing Destiny for hours on end, I decided to hop on tinder. My first matches were covered in red flags so I was super close to giving up. Eventually, I matched with my current bf. 

Socially, he's polar opposite of me. Used to be a partier and still has so so so many friends. I know most of them, when we hang out with them is the only time I really get out of my shell and have fun.

 I moved in with him a few months back. He lives with his mom (expensive area, takes a while to get financially stable enough to move) and it's very noticeable how isolated I am. I don't know why I feel so embarrassed. It's a bit irrational, but that's how my thought process is. Maybe because in the past I've been questioned by one of my ex's mom ""why do you have no friends?"" and the anxiety of it being asked again never went away. Maybe because I don't want to feel like a huger loser. I don't know.

It's just so hard to accept that. If I were writing those words to just one girl in particular, it'd be okay. But it feels like those words, poured out from a deep wound in my heart, are meant for every girl in the world. I wish I could have a special, intimate connection with a girl. That's my only wish. If even just for a moment, just for a second. I just want that solitary spark when our eyes meet.

It never happens. I can't keep going on like this. Two nights ago I went for dinner with a friend and he asked me if I'd ever come back to this country after I move away, and I told him probably not. He asked me why, and I said something about how I'd want to visit other countries if I got the chance to travel.

I couldn't bear to tell him the truth. I couldn't tell him that he'd never see me again because I'm going to kill myself at the end of the year. I don't even know how he'd react. Life is just too awful. It doesn't matter what I do. Friends can't make me feel better. Hobbies can't make me feel better. Passions can't make me feel better.

I just want someone to love me. I feel very ugly when nobody gives me a chance. When nobody swipes right or sends me a message. When nobody notices how hard I'm trying. I am so scared to die. I'm terrified by it. But I can't keep going on like this.

I have tried so, so hard. I go to the gym, I try to get my friends to introduce me to girls, I try to go out and find activities where I can meet people, I try dating apps and keep going with them no matter how many times I'm rejected. A careless swipe to the left that crushes another hope.

I did my best, okay? I did my best. It just wasn't enough. I can't keep doing it. I can't keep swiping every day, or trying to type heartfelt posts on r4r looking for someone, or going out and trying to meet girls in person. I can't do it. I am not strong enough.

Everyone says to work on yourself and the good friends will come to you but they won't. I think there's just something wrong with me because I haven't had a single friendship last.

This year we had a small party on her actual day, and then a surprise party with all of her friends the next.

When my day came around... nothing. I worked, we went grocery shopping, a quick birthday lunch (but only because I had a free coupon), and then I went to bed because she and her boyfriend were playing video games in the living room. I‚Äôve gone back to alienating myself for the past few weeks and have been depressed because my friends only seem to want to be around me when we‚Äôre doing things for them.

I went through a rough breakup a few months ago, have been dealing with cutting off an extremely abusive parent, and am working a new job that I hate. I know it‚Äôs silly but I really needed a day that was for me. Just one day.

I don‚Äôt do things to receive recognition or because I expect the same in return.

2075,thefloorsoftokyo,1564630646,30,"I (F 24) have been single my whole life. For the most part, it didn't used to bother me; I've always been shy and introverted. I was homeschooled until middle school, and I'm pretty used to being independent. I've always felt second-hand embarrassment for girls who just HAD to be in a relationship all the time. But with each passing year, I get lonelier and sadder at not even having had a boyfriend.

If I ever even find someone I'd like to be in a relationship with, they tend to be unavailable, emotionally or otherwise. Last year, I fell in love with my best friend, but he has so many issues of his own, he'll probably never be ready for another relationship. When I was younger, I never wanted to get married or have kids, but now, it's almost all I think about. Considering I don't think I'll ever find someone to spend my life with, I've been considering getting a sperm donor or even just having a one night stand so that I can at least have a child (in the future--not quite financially ready for it). Though I don't even know if I could sleep with some random person when I'm this shy.

I really don't know. I just got my graduate degree in May. I'm trying to find a full-time job. I want to establish myself, but I also want a have a child within the next two or three years. Lately, I've even considered online dating, something that I never considered before. I've always hoped/wanted to just meet someone somewhere, but that hasn't happened, so I thought it might be easier to try a dating app since the people are specifically looking for a relationship.

2081,hamartiated,1564625663,4,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

2082,lgbt-jb95,1564625110,19,"So, here‚Äôs an idea. I was speaking to a friend the other night about how he desperately wanted a partner because he feels so lonely. It made me realise that while it may be lovely to be in love, finding someone through loneliness is unhealthy. Let me explain. 
As he was talking, I noticed how he sounded how he didn‚Äôt really know what he wanted, so long as it was something. Anything, anyone. The next problem, he really saw himself in a very bad way. I mean, he thought he was damn ugly and I think he‚Äôs decent looking, but his personality and life is so much more interesting. It is like he is blinded. 

So, my point is that he wanted someone so then he would feel less lonely. And it might work as a temporary fix. But to really find connection is about something deep.

During the last two years of my school life, the people I hung around with began to change, drastically, I might add. Smoking, fighting and drinking all became common ground for them. And whilst I was tempted to join I did not. Anyway, after a while, I began to distance myself from said people. 

Time passes, and school is coming to an end. I have no good relationships or friends, and I‚Äôm considerably lonely. I have spent the past six months or so, following people around trying to make friends but failing. These were the probably the most challenging moments of my life. I spent my dinner times ‚Äúrevising‚Äù or so I said, in order to hide the fact I had no one to sit with and was just feeling sad and lonely. 

I‚Äôd like to add, I tried many times to be friends with them and would have done anything for them, but the feelings were not mutual. I felt like a tag along for the longest time. 

High school prom comes. June 14th. 

My gorgeous girlfriend was my only company and I could say my only friend at prom. I followed her around like a lost puppy, and said my greetings to everyone dressed in their best. I also spent the time with my old friends and it was a great night. 

After prom however, I have lost contact with ALL people from school other than my girlfriend, and recently I‚Äôve began to truly notice how lonely my life is.  No one messages me, speaks to me, visits me or plays Xbox with me.

No one would ever genuinely have feelings for me. I bet if I deleted all of my social media and just completely isolated myself no one would notice.,lonely,just venting a little,2019-08-01 10:30:49

I had a girlfriend at one point that made me feel otherwise, but it‚Äôs been a year since we broke it off and everyday since I think about her and what I could‚Äôve done to keep it going because she was the only thing that made me feel not... lonely. Most nights I stay up thinking about her and knowing she most likely doesn‚Äôt think about me at all, and when she does I doubt she‚Äôs longing for me the way I do for her. Often I just want to hug somebody. I have never had any good friends besides one that I still keep in contact with even though I met him in elementary. We moved away shortly after meeting and since then I was a complete loner in school up until the day I graduated. Now I have no friends besides the one I periodically talk to over the phone.

It wasn't a very thoughtful post, more of something you could find on cringetopia, but it made me think. I wouldn't say I'm very close to my friends but I have friends in which I trust and who would be there for me, yet still I feel lonely most of the time. Are my friends 'worse' friends than others, those you hear about who talk to you all night and tell you every secret and stuff? Maybe some expectations are just unrealistic or don't work with everybody. Maybe a friend is just as good as you make him. I don't know.
Maybe that guy should have been the friend he wanted to have.

I remember that day we went to tha river with our dog daisey we sat on the shore of the river i tried to draw the city. Than we skipped some rocks. Than went for a pizza. I want you to know that.

I hardly ever applied myself at school , barely passed high school, went to community college for half a year and dropped out, have also barely held onto a job. At some point in the past couple of years I‚Äôve become pretty unsatisfied with my life and have made some changes, my weight loss, which started as me just being too depressed to eat as much as I used to and losing a surprising amount of weight, I‚Äôve started to take more seriously, incorporating actual meal planning and intermittent fasting into my routine. I‚Äôm getting a job, one that I will actually stay at and not leave because I feel lazy and I‚Äôve started to exercise, mostly walking and swimming. I‚Äôve been trying to get out more and experience more of life. I should be happy but all I can think about is how much I want someone in my life, someone that cares about me, wants to talk to me everyday, asks me how I‚Äôm doing, wants to do things and go out and experience life with me and someone that I can provide all that to as well, a partner, and not having that makes me feel not as complete and rather lonely. I‚Äôm wondering if I should just shut those feelings out, focus on my self improvement for now, I say that I don‚Äôt feel like I can get into a relationship until I get to my goal weight, people all around me tell me that being fat doesn‚Äôt matter and I know that all too well, but I lack everything else as well, I‚Äôm not confident at all, I‚Äôm rather shy and pretty repressed, so I feel until I work out these issues, there is not even a point to look, can‚Äôt love someone else till you love yourself, right?",lonely,Should I give up finding love for my own sake?,2019-08-01 06:31:27

The loneliness I ,and most likely you, have experienced is choosing to be used by ‚Äúfriends‚Äù for money and free taxi just to have some resemblance of a social life. People say to drop toxic ‚Äúfriends‚Äù as if it‚Äôs a choice some of us really have.
I can‚Äôt cure my loneliness just by facing the hard truth and open to someone when there‚Äôs no one to open to. 
So many of us have been taught to be so self sacrificial and so humble that merely explaining our problems feels wrong and attention calling. As a result we almost push other people away by trying to be ‚Äútoo considerate‚Äù for their feelings. A sickening irony of our lives.
