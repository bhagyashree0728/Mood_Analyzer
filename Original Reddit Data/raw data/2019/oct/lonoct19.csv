It's the only holiday I care about, so even though we didn't have anything that special planned, it was important to me.  It meant a lot to me, really.  Her dad got sick and she cancelled so she could take care if him.

Its not like he had cancer, it's nothing serious. I know I'm making too much of it.  I'm not angry at her.  It hurt my feelings.  I've been depressed lately anyway, barely keeping myself together some nights,  so this was too much I guess.  It made me feel like I'm not important to anyone. When I was a kid my father used to tell me how worthless I am, usually right after beating the shit out of me. Maybe he was right.   I can't help thinking it when I get lonely or sad...maybe he hated me so much for a reason.   Maybe that's why I'm not important to anyone.

I am also quite shy, low self esteem? I don't think I'm ugly, it's just that I am too lazy to take much care of myself, bit in a depression right now and also not confident enough to dress the way I would want to. 
I am slowly trying to get a higher self esteem but it is really hard. I don't except someone to magically come into my life and just cure the state of my heart but I sort of wish for it.
I sometimes lose all hope that it's ever gonna change, since it's hard to change.
I often subconsciously think of myself as an outcast, a freak (although I'm not, I'm not racist, I'm very accepting of people, my job is literally to just speak with people, and it's not like I'm the most judgy person) but I feel very judged.
I don't really have a hobby anymore, and I just cannot motivate myself to do something. Tried alot of things like learning guitar, shooting arrows with a bow, reading again etc (but I'm never consistent) I am also very empathetic but I sort of lost hope that this is gonna help me in any way. 
In my job, the atmosphere is overall negative, people are bitter and judgy. 

I dont even know why I felt the need to write this down? Guess because I can't stand my situation but don't really have someone to listen to. Don't trust many people (oh yeah, I forgot about that fact about myself - I am a bit paranoid and don't trust easily xD)

Ive been talking to this girl for almost 5 months, we met on tinder and we snapchat almost everyday and have called but never met up or done video. Im stupid and get too attached to people too easily so I have had feelings for her for a while. I have no idea if she likes me but im leaning towards not. Ive been dealing with depression and I finally think I have it under control after like almost 2 years. She has bipolar. I did not know this before I met her or before I started liking her, but I dont care at all. From what shes told me it seems like she hasnt really told many people in her life and im not sure if anybody outside her family knows so I feel like we are at least that close and we help eachother.   
So, I was talking to her and asked why she didnt do this thing and she responded saying ""tbh i was having sex"". and i wasnt sure at first but i asked and she wasnt joking, i dont know why she told me. More than this, I dont know why it makes me feel so bad. We have no relationship, we just talk. I have no reason to assume she wouldnt be talking to other guys, but for some reason it makes me feel so bad. Im trying to tell myself that its not actually bad. Were adults and not in a relationship and not even really close to one tbh and for all i know she doesnt like that person she slept with but... idk it hurts. i still think i like her too. also i saw that she was still active on tinder which makes sense but idk i guess it confirms to me that she is talking to other people.

tl;dr: girl i have feelings for but have not met fucked some other guy and now im sad

15,Redfauwa,1572505388,1,"I've went through alot of my life with friends and family by my side, and I never really took it for granted, always knowing that someone out there didn't have these kind of things, and in doing so, I treated them with what I would consider adequate attention and respect. It's how I was raised, and how I'm continued to be taught by those around me. I won't say that it's wrong, nor do I want it to feel like I'm bragging either. I guess you could say that my entire being is average.

But that's not why I'm here, not that necessarily. I apologize for the lengthy intro. 

My last, fully committed relationship was back in 2016, a long distance one at that. At the time I was happy, I had dreams, I was healthy, needless to say I was going places. However, one thing lead to another and I feel into a pit of anxiety and depression, all the while my Gf at the time was there for me. 

Going onto my Senior year of highschool, I was having trouble studying, or even trying to keep the facade of 'I'm always happy no matter what.' But while I was tha way around everyone close to me, those not within distance slowly crumbled away. One evening, I broke up with my Gf of 2 years. I was cowardly and did it through a text on KiK, muted her, then deleted the app. Even to this day I never saw what final words she sent to me, but for some odd reason, a small fraction of me keeps on telling me that I did the right thing. 

Which brings me to now. 3 years later, and I believe myself to have fully recovered. Hopdfully going to start my dream job of sailing the world by early next year. I survived almost dying due to various health issues, and here I am, healthier than ever, and possibly the happiest person around me, but there lies one issue, how do I fill that hole that has been empty for almost 3 years. 

I'm happy, not lonely by society's terms, but even though I have friends and family, the thing i miss the most and makes me completely isolated, is the feeling that I have someone who loves me for the kind of terrible person that I keep on the inside.

In the end, I don't know what to do. Do I Look for a romantic partner? which I could care less for bodily things, I'm living my life, not looking for carnal pleasures. Do I keep on going the way I currently am? I might have a yellow brick road that I laid out myself, but why does it feel that I'm more lost than ever?

Any help would be appreciated Reddit users.

21,Aberrant262,1572499045,2,"At some point, I guess that I just have to accept that I'm not really part of this world.

I operate pretty much mechanically every single day, having to not only maintain a certain appearance, but also having to stop my emotions from swinging too far one way or the other. I can't feel anything too strongly, I can't enjoy anything too deeply - I can't let go of myself because I will always snap back to the opposite and end up in a whirling spiral of destruction that is my rapid cycling bipolar.

I can't even shovel garbage into the hole masquerading as my personality. No drugs, no alcohol - my mind rages against anything like that, causing even more sever depressions - and I most certainly can't do what seems to be the common bipolar activity of just filling my bed with strangers, as I don't really exist.

People deal with this robot and realise it really is just that. Appraise, attempt to get use out of it and then walk away. It's an awfully empty existence, and there is no escape that I can see. My inability to be a person and the fact that I am just wrong is pretty much the end of me.

But, apologies for the wasteful rant. And thank you to anyone reading this. I can do little more than hope that things will get a little bit better for you other lonely people.

22,Oberon0891,1572498303,2,"I (39M) am completely lost.  Where to begin...born with a stroke I had a quiet childhood.  There were children/teenagers who made fun of me and  I never could make friends.  I always felt out of place with others, while they could dance, swim, skateboard..etc I could not do any of those things.  Really I thought I was or would be a 5th wheel so I just stayed out of the way.  Looking back I see that it is just an excuse because being around people made me nerves and trying things out scared me.

(14-18)High school felt empty to me.  While for the most part I was not made fun of, I also still did not make any friends.  Yes, I really was that guy that sat at the table in the corner all by himself.  I did ok in school C-B avg. and even went to a Homecoming because I girl asked me to it.  However, because I had very little interaction with others that I felt like I gave her a bad time and passed at going to Prom with her.  Funny (not really) thing is I did marry her years down the road.

(27-31)The marriage did not turn out so great.  I should have been more engaged in it (Guessing lack of a social up bring hurt the marriage) and so she found lovers elsewhere.  I did catch her cheating and I did get a divorce....

(34-Present)I did work before and during the marriage but as I have gotten older the affects from the stroke at birth was catching up and I had to stop working.  I live with my parents (disability income does not pay enough for me to live on my own) and we had lived in one state but moved across the country (United States) into another state.  We live in a community for 55+ (I can live with them because of my disability) but being so young here, there is no one of my age to talk to or hang out with.

During the day I am normally fine.  I go to the gym and have lost 50+ pounds (from 229 down to 175ish) and I play so video games.  However at night time I start to lose it.  It becomes so much quieter and my mind start to wander.  Questions start to appear in my mind and I do not know how to answer them.  I start to cry silently so I do not wake anyone up because all anyone says is ""You need to fix it.""  If I know how to fix it I would not be in this position.

I am getting older and as I get older I get more and more scared.  I dont want to be alone.  I want the pain I feel to go away.  I am scared that when my parents are gone I will truly be alone and cannot decide if...

Deep down I know I will never get remarried and most likely never date (I have tried dating apps but when you do not lie and tell them of my handicap I never get replies)  I hate going on facebook, twitter, and other media's because I see everyone so happy and in love and all I feel is hurt and emptiness.

Dear Outcasts,

This is for the boy in the back, with no one sitting by him because they think that under his coat may be a gun. but in reality, it’s just some poetry he’s written about how beautiful the world is. 

This is for the girl who doesn’t care about being skinny because she loves herself, even if she isn’t built like the supermodels that most women dream to be. 

This is for the girl who looks too butch for her mother who’d rather have her is a skirt or dress instead of a button up and tie. 

This is for the the guy who’d rather do theater and deals with coming home to his father who calls him a queer for not playing football.

This is for the socialites who are a part of too many cliques - so they don’t know who they are and they cast *themselves* out of society - feeling alone because they have nothing on topic to say. 

This is to the students like me who stay at home and study because they have a dream of success and stability, and the “popular kids” call them dreadful, vile names that make the students wish they were never born, but they keep pushing through. 

This is to those who are ostracized. 

This is for them.

**This is for you.**

Don’t let the world get you down. You may feel sad, lonely, and oppressed, but there are many others just like you who need someone too, someone just like you. You of all people know that every person is their own beautiful blend and mix of memories and experiences, and it doesn’t matter what someone looks like or enjoys doing because inside many people is a heart that once felt alone just like you do now. Except they all seem to have someone now and you don’t. It just...  doesn’t feel like the world feels the same way about you, does it?

But, that’s where life is tricky, because in that group of people that put others down, there is at least one person who is just trying to fit in, and they feel bad for what they do so don’t give up hope my friend! One day, they’ll emerge from the crowd and protect you, and if they don’t, another outcast will, and before you know it you and all the other outcasts will find each other and make your own group. A group that knows loneliness, pain, and is accepting of everyone no matter what because true loneliness can spark true love. Trust me, I would know. If it happened to me, it can happen to you too.

So… 

Write your poetry, dress how you want, do what you love, work your goal, and most importantly, love yourself. Do that, and you’ll make it through, I believe in you.

Sincerely,

A Former Outcast.",lonely,An Open Letter to the Outcasts,2019-10-31 11:57:02

1. Be absolutely obnoxious and irritating. The more shitty you are the more people gravitate towards you for some reason

2. Spend lots of time with people you like, but not too often or else they’ll get annoyed. If that happens then give them space, but not too much space or else they’ll forget about you.

3. Get blackout drunk every weekend. If you aren’t vomiting in an Arby’s parking lot at 3am you’re not worth anyone’s time.

4. Be happy, but not too happy or else they’ll think you’re fake. If you aren’t happy enough then you are too depressing to be around.

5. Be funny, but not too funny or else they’ll think you’re compensating for depression. If you’re not funny enough then you’re considered too serious.

6. Talk, but don’t talk too much or else they’ll get annoyed. Talk too little and they’ll forget about you.

7. Dress nice, but not too nice or else they’ll feel inadequate. Don’t dress nice enough and they’ll ditch you because you’re a slob.

8. Be absolutely 100% perfect in appearance, behavior, and intelligence. If not you’re too big of a loser for anyone to hang out with.

9. Never ever be yourself. Be a replica of a person you’re trying to befriend, but not too similar because you’ll creep them out. In a friend group? Be an amalgamation of every personality in that group. Soon enough you’ll forget who you are and people love that because they’re all leeches that feed off of insecurity.

66,SomberDingus,1572452020,2," 

It is a generally accepted truth that we must struggle today to reach a better tomorrow. But when life drags you through a meandering route of repeated anguish and hellfire; can one be faulted for questioning the universal? 

At the time of writing, I (M21) have been experiencing a form of soulful turmoil that has plagued me for weeks now. This inner pain only seems to amplify with each fleeting sunrise. It’s disorientating. Very unpleasant, I wish for this period of my life to be over. 

I’m sure I will be able to look back with bittersweet eyes once fate has whisked me to a better place. However, there is a part of me that worries upon reflection. I worry that even the so-called “good times” were never truly as good as I want to remember them as. If those so-called “good times” were acted out in a movie for all to bear witness, all would see ever so clearly the ignorant bliss, as the seeds of folly are sewn before me. I fear that the better place will just continue this pattern.

Why it is so much easier to offer redemption to others than it is to ourselves? Maybe that old trope of plausible deniability really has credence. We must always doubt the actions of others but we can never escape our own truth. If I tally my crimes against this world, there is not much to be said other than faux pas and juvenile mischief. Yet each tally is burned into my psyche - to each their own pain. Every inconsequential poor decision has been locked in my prison for the rest of my eternity, murderers even get less than that. 

To punish myself over misdeeds so small might appear silly, but when taken into the grander scheme of my life, those misdeeds have compounded into the shitty situation I now find myself. Consistent employment rejections, waning friendships, and a love still burning for a relationship that could only be maintained by a version of myself that died many moons ago.

I have that one a lot too. 

The one I had last night is less frequent, but longer lasting. The scenario changes, the cast is always me and the only girl I’ve ever asked out. Sometimes I relive the only date we had, sometimes with a “better” ending, sometimes not. Only once did I dream of having sex with her, and it wasn’t exactly consensual. Boy did that one sting.

Most of them, though, are about me seeing her again and apologizing. In the real world, before I asked her out, we were best friends. I have had “mood problems” since third grade. I was bullied a lot for being fat and I’m very timid, so I never fought back, verbally or otherwise. So I dealt with it by crying. It seemed like any school staff were wracking their brains to figure out how to deal with me, nevermind the bullies, so I guess I’m the problem. Anyway, mood problems turned into depression. In and out of therapy and medicated, my depression was at its worst during freshman year in high school. 

One day She says that she likes my shirt. I was wearing a Monty Python killer rabbit shirt that my dad got me, so thanks dad, and that got us talking. She was really into Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings, like, she could write elvish and had the longest blond hair. I’m more of a Star Trek type, but we nerded out a lot throughout the year. 

I was getting a handle on my Depression and gaining some confidence, so I asked her out. We went on a date and at the end she said she didn’t want to change our relationship. Hindsight is 20/20, I was a nervous wreck on that date and not charming at all, but at the time I had less empathy. I didn’t blow up or cry, I just wrapped things up, did a few more friendly activities and that was that.

That was really that. I didn’t let her know that I was molten inside. I simply started pushing her away. Because I was hurt. Because I didn’t know how to handle this precision rejection. I talked to her less and less throughout high school and then we went our separate ways (worlds apart)

I feel pathetic still dreaming about her. I think my brain is using her as a default romance partner, the best screen to project my loneliness on to. After that dream, I went on Facebook for the first time in years, still friends. She’s married and has short hair now. 

I sure like girls with short hair, but she looks nothing like she does in my dreams. I’m not dreaming about her anymore. I’m dreaming about redemption from an angel.",lonely,I had that dream again,2019-10-31 00:56:42

Backing up a little I had gone through a mental break down via drug overdose on cough medicine. The breakdown changed my thinking process so drastically for a period of time it seemed as if I could do anything if I wanted to for the better. After the blow of people losing trust in me and sensationalizing my writing I got back into drug addiction after being 3 months sober cold turkey. Every time I tried to make new friends there was definitely the former circle discouraging people to befriend me or at the very least trust me. The thoughts in my journal fucked my best friends mind up so bad he quit his job at the time, he told me he cried reading my journal. I wish I could say sorry and I wish he would accept it. Noah and Tom popped back in my life as I finally got a new job as a janitor. They said sorry for reading it but they ""couldn't put it down"" which I suppose is flattering but they seemed to only pop into my life so we could buy DVDs(our slang for coke) I tried to talk to Noah one day he stopped talking to me again and there was only Tom left. Tom and I were good friends we helped and hurt each other plenty of times. He seemed to be over the whole thing but Tom and I despite being good friends only seemed to drink together. I missed the creative side of the circle James injected, Tom was more of the partier. I'd make videos for him to remind him of the old days and having a creative drive but he never really seemed motivated to help me most of the time although he had good intentions for the most part I knew we would just continue drinking together. Making friends as an adult is hard and all my friends are attached to James more than me so I was cast out.

99,hamartiated,1572402453,4,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-10-30 13:27:33

My barren castle where the darkness consumed my world, collapsed into a black hole; smaller than a penny but powerful enough to consume my whole world. Gone.

So, I'm a 20yo Female and I've recently cut off a toxic, co-dependant friendship. With my best friend. My only friend. I don't know how to make friends, when I've tried and met up with them and did somehing fun and gone to parties we just kind of fade away from each other. This has happened like 5 times this year.

He's opened up to me and I'm the only person he's told that he's gay. So we trust each other, Hes like a little brother, but it leads me to question is there something wrong with me? That I'm getting along better with a 14 year old than my own peers? 
Tldr; I roughly remember a psych asking me if i get along better with people younger/older and that correlated to something.. if I'm remembering correctly, What is wrong with me?

145,IndecentExposuree,1572337734,2,"
Along the way of life, I've felt I lost something. 2017 spring break for colleges sucked because I lived in a tourist town. I worked and saw college students like myself come in and buy stuff for spring break. People from UGA, Michigan, and other universities flocked down to the beach. I just dont have a friend group. One of my high school classmates talked about all the friends he made at his university. 

I just got jealous. It sucks seeing people come to party and I have no friends. The few friends I do have are all online in different cities. I've been at this university for almost a year, about to graduate in 2020, and still have no friends. I did join a political club since I am a political scince major, but felt like an outcast and couldn't connect with anyone. I got drunk and tried talking to everyone which helped me lower my guard and mellow out, but I dont know. Maybe I need alcohol to make friends??

I just want someone to say ""hey man wanna go hit the club? Or go party or whatever"" 

I've gotten better at putting myself out there and saying hi. My approach is to pick the loner guy like myself in the room and talk to him. However, I still havent made any connections or friends where we go out and do stuff. 

The hard part for me is not meeting people. I feel like I'm just not a great personality to be around, but the political group was weird anyways so I dont know. 

At the end. I just want to be out somewhere with a crew doing something rather than at home. But I have no crew at my university. I dont want a girlfriend, I'd like to just be platonic and have some friends that are girls. And have a group of bros to chill with.

146,qbxs,1572332858,1,"As of rn my doctors have me diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  

The catch: To the outside world (everyone besides my immediate family), I’m a brilliant, talented, good looking kid wasting his youth and throwing his life away because I’ve kept my struggles a secret. In public, when I do leave my house, I’m like the worlds greatest actor. My walls are completely up and I’m able to calculate the perfect response to any situation and execute it in order to not only seem “normal” but rather “top of the dominance hierarchy type shit.” Both guys and girls my age complement me often and genuinely like being around me. It’s me who blows them off or ignores them.

That’s my main obsession really. Maintaining this perfect image. And I’m fucking amazing at doing so. I’ve essentially spent the last 8ish years researching, studying and mastering my craft. 

I started out with a good foundation to build off of though. Beginning of middle school, when I was an innocent kid and the world was yet to get to me, I was popular, had my middle school “girlfriend,” played sports, naturally good social skills and most importantly I was happy, myself, and didn’t let anybody or anything stop me. 

From there on, my mental health has essentially deteriorated. From happy to a little bit of anxiety to depressed to obsessive to often feeling numb and only feeling how I know I “should” feel in a given circumstance but they’re forced feelings. 

I’ve kept up the facade so far but nobody knows the actual details. I graduated high school but only because our wonderful school systems slid me through because of doctors notes even though I was absent for more than half of it. To kids my age, I’m this mysterious boy with swagger, confidence, and charisma. They complement me often and say they wish they could do x like me etc. However, it’s all learned skills which I’m able to apply flawlessly because of my inability to show that I’m anything less than perfect. You see, when in public, it’s impossible for me to look anxious. Or show signs of depression. Or lead anybody to believe anything remotely close to something implying I have a flaw. It would go against that main obsession of mine which you could essentially look at like the religion I did not choose, don’t want, but live my life following despite all efforts not to. 

Even though I’m the kid everybody is envious of: I’m yet to go to a party. I’m yet to have my first kiss. I’ve lost interest in everything. It’s sad really.

I’m disgusted with myself and my life. I threw it all away and am continuing to throw it all away on a daily basis. Also, the negative impact my actions have on my family is repulsive. My drs say I can’t be so hard on myself bc so much of it is “our of my control since I don’t do it consciously” but I feel selfish, narcissistic, egotistical and manipulative. Yet, I can’t seem to change. 

I’ve been trying to turn my life around for 8 years yet things have only gotten exponentially worse as time has gone on.

I go to a relatively large University, and I'm also the first one of my family to go to college. My parents fled a socialist nation so that I could grow up in America. Because of this, I've always had a lot of pressure on me, from being a young child to where I currently am. I was never good socially, and was always the strange one in any sort of environment. I love to read, and I love making others feel warm and special. 
When I was 14 I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. My parents blamed no one but me, and this was a big reason I ended up not having an friends, as I was never confident or happy- it was usually just a facade. 
Once I got to college, it was mostly the same except for one guy. He loves to socialize, is super fit and is everything I'm not; maybe that's how we became friends, like the old saying 'opposites attract.' He only really hangs out with me, but I constantly felt as if he was better then me in everything, always feeling terrible at the end of the day. 
One day he said he would like to try out for a sport, and jokingly said he could be a cheerleader for our universities football team. I told him to go for it, and to pursue it and get there. Well, he succeeded. He made the team, and now I don't know how to feel. A part of me is happy for him, but another part hurts like hell. He was my one and only friend, and now I'll bascially have no time to see him since he has practices multiple times everyday. I'm back to being alone, and I feel terrible for even having these thoughts.

153,Bartheda,1572327740,1,"I went to my local convention over the weekend in my cosplay which I really enjoy wearing. There was a panel there that was called ""Level up your cosplay"" that turned out to be about what competitions are like but that's fine. Not really my thing but it is put on by the fans and I sure don't want to do any public speaking. Big props to them is what I'm trying to say, they are clearly very passionate about what they are doing and the video they showed us was actually pretty cool and funny. Introducing stage theatrics is a genius idea.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway I'm sitting in this panel after arriving before it started and about halfway through I see that the whole row I'm in is empty and the rest of the place is jammed pack. In my experience the cosplay community tends to be a little cliquey but sweet biscuits. I could understand not wanting to sit point blank next to a stranger but usually rows fill like a few seats down then so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really knocked the wind out of me at the time I remember sitting there and wondering if I could just sneak out of the room and go cry somewhere. To be fair to the two putting on the talk it was full of interesting stuff if being on stage is your thing but personally I'm a hard pass on that one. I skip the parade as well which the event organisers are happy with as they don't want to have someone spew from nerves on the stage I'm picking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would go hang out with other people in cosplay from the same franchise but I was in my Luke Skywalker robes which generally means hanging out with the 501st and they are kind of elitist jerks. I just want to shake the whole packing lot of them and yell ""movie accuracy isn't the gold standard of cosplay and fandom, having fun is"". I don't know anyone in the same boat but I can't even go into the Star Wars subs and forums anymore for all the agro constantly being spewed in there. Don't want to have to enjoy Star Wars alone anymore but I guess this is the world we live in.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Also just to preempt the reply I think I will get, to all 501st and Rebel Legion people in there, your right I'm wrong, lots of great people in the community fine fine fine. I've just never met any of them. I did have about 3 different Rey's come up to me and get a picture which was awesome and the lightsaber I bought online is a big hit with the kids. When they get to hold it their little eyes just light up (bright green literally but you know what I mean) that is my favourite part of cosplaying.  Just on the topic though when you let a kid hold you saber if you are using like a Saberforge or Ultrasabers or Force FX or whatever.

The “friend” that I trusted with everything until tonight. He told me when I got their that some people he has “problems” with might come to the party. I asked him why did he come if he knew that and he said if he didn’t it would make him look like a bitch, which is understandable. But I’m with him so his “problems” are mine. But it made me think did he only tell me to come to the party so he could have some backup?! I didn’t think deeply into that but I just wish he would of told me that before because I still would of came. So after he tells me that I’m sitting near the door anxious as fuck, I can’t even enjoy myself. I already suffer enough being around that many people, I don’t even know what the people look like I just know shits gonna hit the fan as soon as they see my friend. But eventually they turn up.

First of all they already look older than me, like early 20s, so idk wtf my friend was doing to get problems with them. 30 mins went by nothing happened, I don’t even think they noticed him. I’m constantly watching them so I already look suspicious as fuck, eventually I see them looking and talking, in my head I said “fuck sake here we go”. They come over and my friend looks like the biggest bitch ever, he’s shaking and just looks froze. So they ask me “are you with him” which I reply “yeah I am” BOOM split tf out of me, was weak as fuck but still shocked me a bit. By the time I look back up they already have my friend against the wall. Just chipping at him. I get back into it just swinging connecting a few, but we are outnumbered so I’m just getting fucked tbh. I have one on the floor with me and two on top, I’m gouging whoever’s eyes below me are while getting the shit kicked out of me. Some old friends from before started helping. By helping I mean just splitting shit up, they’re outside and I’ve ended up upstairs. Idk who’s house it is i don’t even remember the fight, I still don’t now, that’s all I remember, is just me getting fucked up.

I got offered to stay the night which I declined. Now I’m sitting at a fking bus stop, whole left side of my body is fucked. It’s 5 am but this post won’t go up until I get home because my data is shit. But that was my attempt at being social I guess.

Don’t get me wrong everyone took some damage I’m just nearly in pieces. I guess that’s what I get for thinking this was a good idea.

Our relationship was toxic, and unhealthy, and it needed to end. But I miss her so much. I texted her about two hours ago asking how she was doing and if there was anything on her mind, even though she doesn't want to talk to me.

She has another boyfriend now, and they seem relatively happy. Deep down, I hope that they are not, and she breaks up with him and comes back to me. Maybe I can redeem myself for all the stupid things I did, or all the times I hurt her, or all the things I said that shouldn't have been said.

Funny thing is, I had a chance to redeem myself. We met up about a month ago just to talk a little bit and have some closure. She asked me if I thought that we could repair the relationship and start anew. And I said no, hell no, definitely not. And we never spoke again after that, except once when we were passing each other in the halls. I shouldn't have said no. I just wanted to seem strong, to seem like I could get over her, that I was better than I was in July before we broke up.

But I'm not. I'm hurting so much. I want to hold her in my arms again. I want to feel her touch and her arms on my waist. I want to see her smile and stroke her hair and hear the words ""I love you.""

But I'm never going to get that. I'm never going to get love again. I'm such a fuck up. That's all I do. Who would want to date me anyways?",lonely,I caved and texted my ex,2019-10-29 15:35:38

We both sucked.  And I didn’t blow him so he let it all die.  I hyped him up by saying things like I would blow you and he just had to ask and told him it was my dream to blow a guy.

161,ry_lock73,1572317345,4,"Self Esteem plummeted and is virtually non-existent. I need help.

TLDR: 
- a lot of things have happened in my life and my self esteem has become almost non existent. Primarily because I felt so ugly. Any advice is appreciated.

Whole Story: 

- So, basically as a kid I was always trying to do new things. And I’ve always preferred to do things how I want to and not follow the norm just because everyone else is doing it. I used to play football outside as a kid and at a certain time I found a fun game (League of Legends) and rather than force myself to go outside and have fun with my friends I’d just stay inside. This was where I got distant from my friends and was kinda lonely but I was okay with it because I was young and could easily find pleasure in other things as there was a lot to know. 

People have always called me ugly starting in middle school and somewhere between sophomore year and junior year of high school. I’m the type of person that would try to shrug it off and to play it cool or something to hide the fact that it always annoyed me when people would go out of their way to call me ugly. Sometimes I would look in the mirror and examine myself to see if they were right. And I’m pretty funny irl so whenever someone would call me ugly or something of that nature I would flip it around and turn it into a joke that would make people laugh, but more times than not I what the butt of the joke. Eventually I got used to it and whenever someone would call me ugly It wouldn’t even phase me because I expected it. 

I also am an analytical person so I’m good at problem solving but I tend to overthink things. Whenever something that would seem to be natural, I might’ve spent so much time thinking of different alternatives and better ways to do things or just judging if situations will have a beneficial outcome for me. 

I was on the football team and I was really good. I played defensive end despite the fact that I’m 6’ ft and 180 pounds. It made me feel good because I was pretty ripped and it made me slightly more confident in myself. More like a wide receiver than a defensive end (sorry for this random football talk). It felt good performing well because it felt like I had a mask on and even though I might be “ugly” no one could tell, and they only could judge me from my football ability. 

I also used to post on Vine when it was relevant and I had a fan base in a small community. it gave me some type of validation when I was younger. Like people can actually like the things that I make or the fact that it’s even possible. But the time consuming nature of it took its toll too because rather than do stuff with my friends I’d rather make 6 second videos. It got to the point where it was a burden rather then me showing my creative ability. And it always felt like no one really cared about me and they really just wanted the content I created. 

Nearing the end of my high school life, I gradually distanced myself from people. I almost never took any chances. My friends were wondering why I wouldn’t talk anymore. In most of my classes I would just think about things rather than socialize and do class work like everyone else. And it was never to the point where I got bad grades because I set a very high standard for myself at a young age when it came to school. Even when someone needed help with a problem they’d sometimes come to me and I’d help them and stuff. But it was never because they wanted to be my friend or whatever, or even know me but solely would want a good grade. The only reason why this was relevant is because people would make it seem as if they were just being friendly but I could always read between the lines as to why they would talk to me. 

Also it’s not as if I had no friends. I just never had a “real” friend and one that I was truly comfortable around. Usually just people that I would associate with. I gradually started getting lonelier and lonelier. I don’t even think I’ve ever even been out with someone just to hang out or whatever. 

Currently in my first year of college everything has gotten worse. Overthinking even more, feeling sadder everyday and the whole 9 yard. 

What makes everything even worse is that I’ve never really been intimate with a girl. It feels weird saying it as to why I feel even worse but it has really effected me because I felt like to the average girl I’m unattractive and I shouldn’t even try to get to know them. Back in high school, there was this one girl that I would always make laugh. Like crying laughing every day we would have class together. I thought that since  I didn’t have much going for me i definitely needed to be funny. And I naturally was. It was hard to even look at people because I felt like if I did they would judge me or subconsciously Judge me and they would perceive me in a different way or not want to talk to me anymore. But when I kinda opened up, I could kinda tell she was feeling me. But I had no idea because I didn’t even know that was even possible and I never took it further. 

I’m also a virgin and you know the societal stigma against virgins so it made matters worse too. But not In a way where I feel pressured to lose my virginity because of others, but because of myself. Because I feel the need to be comfortable, shown that I’m actually accepted, or that I’m not too ugly or bad of a person that a girl can actually like me to the point where we would have sex. I’ve recently realized this and it made me feel weird and stupid for feeling this way, but truly it is because i just want to know if it’s possible that a girl can actually like me.

I usually try to find things to do and master them, so lately I’ve been trying to learn how to produce music. Also I’ve spent so much time on the daily listening to music. Like I’d just pace back and forth for an 1+ just listening to music, half appreciating the musicality of it and half thinking for imaginary scenarios and brainstorming. I’ve recently realized that it was a way for me to cope. 

Usually after classes are done. I would just go back home and do the usual, like every other day trying to improve my talents. But the feeling of loneliness keeps gnawing at me. I feel like no one understands me. Like I’m always by myself, doing things by myself, and just everything by myself. I’ve thought about my current friends and realized that most of them really see me as expendable and don’t see me a friend but more like a person they happen to know. 

I strongly dislike being a burden on people because I feel like if I just handled it myself like I’ve always done both parties would be okay. But not asking for help has just made things worse for me personally. That’s why I’ve come to this sub Reddit. I really want to stop feeling this way.

Sorry if this was a long read, but I really needed to get this off of my chest because I hate living like this.

Whenever I am with a boy, I would think stupid thoughts like 'Will he be my future Bf?' So cringe. I don't know what am I thinking. 

Every time there is this void space in my heart. I longed for someone and still can't find it. I wanna to focus on myself as I know that most relationships started from young did not end well due to misunderstanding, not the right pair, insecurity, etc.

Regardless I always wonder how it feels like to have that special someone.

When I see other introverts or people who are suffering from a mental illness, I begin to hope that maybe one day it would happen. However I have my doubts. Those people might have something appealing that I don't have.

I feel so alone in school. There is no one who I can share a common interest with. My friends left me. My old friends are busy and I don't wanna to bother them. My problems are mine. They have other stuff to worry. 

I wanna drop out and transfer to another school. To try out a different course rather than staying in this isolated space.

I had a girlfriend and she was my first one, right before school started she broke up with me, blocked me, and gave no reason why. Since then i've isolated myself from everyone, dont have any friends or people i talk to in college and at most i speak a couple sentences everyday. I mostly play videogames, browse reddit. I used to be a very outgoing happy person before the breakup, we loved eachother and did incredible things for each other. Now i spend every day thinking about her and why she hasant even tried sending a text. I barley talk to my friends from high school. They think we are still dating because I havent said anything to them. I dont know what else to do, my therapist here says all i can do is wait till the day she might text me, but I feel hopeless and not talking to anyone makes me extremely, I get high now almost everyday as being high makes me feel slightly okay, Ive done acid to try and burn her out of my memory but that just made me miss her even more. I've been depressed and suicidal before when my mom died when I was 11 but now i feel hopeless, my family mentally abuses me because of how I dress and that im emo, the only thing keeping me going now is reddit which im really happy exists and maybe hopefully one day I might wake up to a text from her telling me why she just blocked me and cut off contact.

171,hamartiated,1572315890,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

She won’t leave him or try to make amends with me, and she talks about me behind my back despite claiming that she supports me 100%. My dad got remarried literally 2 months after meeting up with a girl he “had a crush on in high school”, even though he and I were supposed to have some actual fucking bonding after leaving a toxic relationship. He also had a kid not much later (like literally his wife was pregnant when they got married-not that there’s anything wrong with that, but only after TWO MONTHS and without even mentioning it to me, then there’s a fucking problem) and now that mistake is ruining my life. My dad and step mom are so busy with my asshole brother and their work and videos and whatnot that they have no time for me, and are so inconsistent in their moods that I once got yelled at for feeling suicidal, but as soon as I do something actually bad like watching a tv show I never should have, I just get a light scolding. They don’t have the time to deal with me because I guess I’m hard to deal with, and if they actually do deal with me they never take the time or care to do it right. And since I’m still a minor, a lot of shit that I legally cannot do, they have to do, but they fucking don’t! They have tried to send me to places and make me do things that I can’t legally do because I’m not an adult and then get mad at me because I couldn’t do it. Not just that, but they have plenty of money, but they’re not helping me out with college at all and instead they’re spending it all on stupid shit for themselves and my little brother, all stuff they don’t need and probably will never use. I get it’s a bit selfish to expect help from my own fucking parents, but for fuck’s sake they’re my PARENTS they made a COMMITMENT when they had me. And not to be the resident edge lord, but I never asked to be born. 
This is why I confide in my friends so much; they ARE my family. But lately, I feel like they don’t care about me either. I’m the youngest, but out of ALL of them I’m the most responsible. I do pretty much everything I think a good friend should do, and in return I get almost none of it back. Not to mention there’s one girl I’ve had a crush on for ages, and I was always nice to her (I didn’t over step my bounds, I knew when to lay off) but she just pushed me away from her and would never hang out with me. Hell, nobody hangs out with me. Nobody wants to. I know some of it is because of my parents and my little brother, but am I that much of an embarrassment?

189,LocusApp,1572297125,6," Hey everyone,

I'm working on a social group platform, designed to help users discover people who have similar interests and experiences, and to see what's going on around you. This way they can meet up in real life and coordinate social interactions. You can think of it as similar Meetup but free, more secure, wide demographic, and many other features. It will be free to use, unlike Meetup.

Features a live map with events and people, a securely encrypted chat, and a discovery feed to meet new people.

For instance, let's say you moved to a new city for work, you don't know anyone there, and are looking to meet people and find fun things to do. You fire up the app and connect with people who have interests in common, and events curated to you.

Or, let's say you want to find something to do tonight, you open the app and see what events are happening -- curated to your specific interests. You can also post your own events and have people join you.

This is perfect for a sub like this, where the whole point is to be more social. The purpose of the app is **to create a great social environment through meaningful real-life interactions**.

Here's a look:

I just finished the design stage, next is the development phase (app needs to be programmed). Wanted to see if this is something people would be interested in using before I build it.

If this is a project you're interested in, definitely sign up to the mailing list on the website to stay updated. I'm not here to shill or to ask for money, however any type help would be appreciated; donations, feedback, suggestions, or if you have a skill that might come in handy.

**I'll read the replies, so let me know your thoughts and if this is something that you would use. Thanks!**

Frequently Asked Questions:

*What is this?*  
Locus is an affinity group platform centered around the idea of building a community through the connection of users that share similar interests/experiences. It allows users to form groups, and create/discover events that they are interested in.

*What makes it better than apps like Meetup?*  
In terms of cost, the platform will be **free** to use. Locus will reach a broad audience with free user-event creation and an engaging interface, unlike Meetup.com. We intend to maintain user-friendly privacy practices and promote a policy of not selling user data and be a platform that users can rely on. Messaging uses strong end-to-end encryption, and the company will follow user-friendly privacy protection policy. It does not sell your data as a monetization method.

*What about meeting up with people from online? How do you ensure safety?*  
Great question. Based on our research we know that a lot of people might feel anxious or worried about meeting people online. We are implementing Identity Verification to increase the overall safety of users. Several methods will be used, such as: e-mail/phone confirmation, social media connection, integration of identity verification API, and more. This will ensure that users have a verified profile, so that the platform is safe to use. This is something that we are placing a focus on. That way you know that someone is who they say they are.",lonely,Working on an app to discover new people/events through similar interests,2019-10-29 08:12:05

I have lived in this city for almost a decade now but have no friends.  I spend almost all of my time alone.  My husband works a highly demanding job 6-7 days a week, sometimes 16 hours a day.  I wake up alone and go to sleep alone many days of the week.  My kids are growing up and in school and have activities.  They simply need me less and the time I spend with them is mostly just getting them ready for school, feeding them, or driving them somewhere.  So my days are spent by myself.  I feel totally defective.  I got a gym membership just to have a place to go.  I've tried doing classes, but I just feel more lonely because I feel like I'm almost intruding by being there.  I live for little interactions like going to the grocery store and having a cashier be a little chatty.  I talk to the other parents at school, but just kind of feel like an alien and can't seem to break into the groups there.  I used to work.  I liked my job but had to quit for my family.

201,DoubleOhQuantum,1572285276,1,"And it's been making me feel so alone. She's been going out with my other best friend for a year as well. Ive had these feelings since about the time they started going out, only they kept their relationship hidden for about a month.

During that month I was working up the courage to ask her out, I decided I would do it on New Year's Eve. Except they told our friend group about their relationship that night. So I kept quiet and hoped my feelings would disappear.

Yet those feelings didn't disappear, in fact they became stronger. It got to the point where I felt suffocated sometimes by my feelings for her. I began feeling depressed, anxious and lonelier than ever. I started getting panic attacks when I thought about her, or hanging out with her. 

I've been beating myself up a lot over having feelings for her, for feeling envious of her boyfriend, feeling guilty over having these feelings. I've never felt so low.

I didn't tell anyone for a while. I wanted nothing more than to confess my feelings to her, but I was so scared it would alienate her and my other friend. I was terrified that telling her would make me lose all of my friends.

I knew she never had feelings for me like that, I knew she probably wouldn't ever have feelings. So why was I still so enraptured by her? This question kept me awake many nights. Could it be the fact I have very few female friends? My overbearing and bewildering loneliness? My need for physical affection? A combination of all that? Maybe the answer doesn't matter.

I told her about my feelings two weeks ago and it was the scariest thing I've ever done. After trying everything else and nothing working I figured I've nothing else to lose. I was so depressed and sad all the time. And you know what? It went way better than my fears and insecurities had promised me. Nothing has changed We are still best friends, her BF and I are still close friends. But my loneliness hasn't changed. I am still depressed when I think about how I feel about her. 
The only thing that has changed is that I feel better about myself, I don't feel guilty or like a piece of shit as much. I can only hope that I am able to move on.

So I'm 25 and I am completely out of friends. Lost quite a few of them after I finished high school and I started my studies in another town, made some friendships there but they weren't really deep or meaningful. They were just about hanging out together rather than spending our free time alone in our apartments. I had a very good friend for like a year, that was when I was 22. We hang out almost every day, but his ""gang"" was interested in smoking weed all day and I wasn't. There were times that they would decide to leave me alone in the bar that we were for 30 minutes or more just to go somewhere and smoke or do drugs or I dunno, I never found out. So out of nowhere one day I find out that they all went on a trip without me even though they invited me at first. I called him one day and he told me that they were already at some beach and that for some reason the original plan went south. I got mad and decided to not talk to them, and they never really texted or called back. I met him randomly a couple of times, we said ""we should grab a cup of coffee"" but we never did. After that until now my life has been empty. I've had a couple of people in my life but ended up leaving me or perhaps I pushed them away from my life I dunno. Basically now all I have is a friend that any time I wanna go out I have to call him and another one who is like 200km away from me and is now too much of an Instagram diva to have time to talk. All I want is to feel wanted. Someone to text me and ask if I am ok. I ve called people before to go out and they said they have plans. Nobody has ever invited me to those ""plans"", if there ever were any. I would like to think I am a pleasant person when I m surrounded by others. Now all I do is wear my pyjamas after work and spend all my free time in front of my pc. My father told me once, "" you're gonna get married one day and you won't have someone to be your best man"" and it hurts so much because it's true. I don't have anyone to talk about my problems. Can anyone out there help me? I hate that I am being so selfish, knowing that there are actual problems out there like wars, starvation etc. On the other hand, all these years have been a struggle to just find someone to get out of my house for a couple of hours.

These are the questions I keep asking myself, If i could remove my heart and stop feeling anything i would do that in a heartbeat, i wanna stop feeling sad and depressed all the damn time. Having an empty soul every moment I breathe, always feeling like I'm on autopilot, just doing what I think I need to do until i die.
                I've tried doing the ""right"" thing but never succeed, no matter what I do or say I'm always wrong, feeling like the fool that I am, my self esteem is crushed and I'm just trying to hold on to the pieces, and of course I do this alone, I'm not allowed to complain or lament because I'm wrong, I'm stupid, and I'll probably die alone
               At this point you're probably wondering what's bothering me, what could make me feel so negative, tbh sometimes even I'm not sure, there's one reason that pains me a lot till now and hurts so much to talk or even type about it but I guess I'll quickly say it
                 A girl I met online and was very attached to for 3+ years got a bf and of course spends less time talking to me, most reading this at this point will probably think I'm such a loser for letting this hurt me, and yes I probably am a loser...this was the closest this loser had to love and be close or intimate with a lady and that was taken away, irl I'm not attractive, or really smart, maybe funny if I'm in an ok mood but the only thing I got going for me is my drawing, there's nothing else that's special or unique that'll make me eye candy or anything to a girl, I'm devastatingly shy to talk to a girl I meet for the first time, most times I don't even try and when I do I just either throw in a few compliments or say something stupid...so yeah I'm no good, and to top it off my ""friends"" tease me about it regularly which sometimes pushes me to suicide.
                     I'm also a handicap, with a broken right arm from birth due to some mishaps with me coming out, this almost resulted in my death and that of my mom's but thankfully she made it and so did I (sometimes regretting it) the event made my mom unable to bear another child because of the high risks, so as I guessed it I'm an only child, living with a deformed arm has dampened my confidence and self esteem even further over the years, I'm so used to feeling bad about myself, sometimes when I'm too happy I try to think of something tragic to lessen my joy since I innately believe that's how its supposed to be. People stare at me a lot when I walk the streets, this has grown on me and made me unable to approach people, I've been recently trying to recover but only in baby steps
Explaining even further would totally waste your time..the point is I feel like shit everytime, even when I'm not 
I've had so many suicidal thoughts that i haven't ever shared with anyone, so far I haven't acted on any of them but who knows if I will in the future.

I can deal with strangers and acquaintances really easily but friends freak me the fuck out. Same with women I like. The anxiety gets so overwhelming sometimes I believe I should be alone forever to stop it. That my position is a fixed one and I should instead just recognise it and subsist. If you ever feel this way, realise that it is absolute bullshit and you were born for more than subsistence. Just don't try to match up your life with some idealised Betty Crocker narrative, where a partner will come and take away your hurt. Because one of the hard truths is hurt remains regardless of relationships, relationships just give you more reasons to have more emotions. Anyhow, I didn't mean to sermonise, just lay out some pain that's lying In my chest. This long missing strip of shared intimacy. In its stead, just a phrase, no one else will never know. 
Sometimes it just feels like the totality of my existence though.",lonely,Anyone feeling lonely from anxiety?,2019-10-28 23:45:55

idk if I'm just young and full of hormones or if I'm just an incel, but I feel completely shut out from everything.



I've moved in high school 3 times, and I feel completely shut out. The term school spirit means nothing to me. The term community means nothing to me. I have no friends group, no clique. The popular kids reject me, and the nerds reject me. I have nowhere to go. I feel like an alien, like a person with no identity. No one to talk to at school, and no one to talk to at home. My home life should be considered good, but my interactions with my parents... are less than good. They expect a lot, understandably so (we're asian and the expectations are always high). So far, I've been a disappointment. Life hasn't panned out the way I thought it would. I've fought with them ( a lot more recently ) and it's gotten to the point where I start screaming and nearly blacking out in fury over trivial things. I've tried to control myself, but that just leaves me to lock myself in my room, where my parents leave me be for the day. At home my life sucks, and at school...


At school I should be considered a good student, but honestly I've given up. I can't even focus on anything anymore. I have no hope for the future and I'm at wits end. I have 300,000 things to do, but I can never being myself to do anything. I never do anything I like to keep myself happy, either. I just sit in my room, and stare at the wall, daydreaming. I wished I could be happy. That is all I ask for. I want to experience love and friendships and intimacy and warmth and I want to feel like I have a place in this world.

A girl at school called me a sociopath, because I don't show much emotion. I know she won't be reading this, but as soon as I got home, I wept like a baby. Its just difficult for me to express myself. Who am I going to talk to? Everyone just uses me, and I feel like the only way to protect myself is by locking myself up and never talking or expressing myself to people.


I can't sleep. I don't sleep. People at school know this, but they only refer to it in a joking matter. ""Haha, that's funny"" they say. They think I choose not to sleep. The reality is I can't sleep. I get nightmares when I sleep. I start sweating profusely when I sleep. I don't feel good when i sleep. Sometimes i just genuinely can't sleep. 


I'm completely isolated from my culture.
I'm indian. Today was diwali. Not a single relative wanted to talk to me. Not one. No one cared. I haven't even learned hindi. My own tongue is foreign to me. I'm ashamed of myself, but I don't show it. I can't show it, because itll prove my parents right.


I used to read. A lot. I loved lord of the rings and dune and Harry Potter. I fucking loved Harry Potter. I used to read it during rti (free period) during my middle school days, and whenever I was sick at home, I would either play video games or pick up a Harry Potter game. I loved it. I loved the movies even more. I loved video games as well. Playing destiny taken king with my friends, and completing the kings fall hard mode raid was the best day of my life. I would watch documentaries (astronomy and archeology) and I would actually talk with my relatives. I laughed. I had the most vivid imagination when I was young. I would draw, dance, watch broadway, I even played the trumpet. My old band teacher said one day I could be section leader, but we moved so that never happened. These things I loved feel so distant, and I feel so lost.


I'm so cynical now. I honestly feel severe envy when I see kids in their groups being happy and having someone to support them when things get rough. I don't have that, and it hurts like hell. I don't have that network everyone else has, either at school, at home, or both. No one to talk to, I'm freefalling into a pit of despair, with no way out. No one wants me here. No one wants me anywhere.


I'm a complete waste of space. What am I even doing here? Why am I wasting my time breathing? I feel like it would be better if I weren't wasting my time, but I see no way out.



I don't hate anyone. I don't resent anyone other than myself. I am disgusted with myself, but I just can't seem to do anything right. 

I'm just sad. I'm tired, and I give up. It's not worth it anymore. There is just so much I want to say to someone, but I can't. I just want someone to call a friend, and honestly not even having that gives me pain.  I want to experience some sort of happiness before I die, but idk, I guess itll never happen. It's late, and I need to do my homework. I don't sleep before 3 am anyways, so I'll just be here. 

Here, by myself.


I don't really want to talk to people online, I just needed to let it out and here seemed to be the only place to do it. To be able to cast it out into the void.

Realizing your family just tolerates you, they see you as nothing more than a burden they’re forced to deal with. They gossip and mock you behind your back, every once in a while some way some how it gets back to you. You pretend it doesn’t hurt, but deep down it burns you to know all the smiles and niceness is fake, they find every reason to not like you. You begin to ask yourself, what is it about me? Whats wrong with me? Why me? 

One of the worst things is feeling like it’s you against the world. Theres nobody on your side. I never asked to be like this. I never asked for any of the abuse that fucked me up and made me depressed, detached, anxious, scared, quiet... 

I’ve been an outcast my whole life, no matter who I tried to be, quiet, social, introverted, outgoing whatever. No matter who I tried to fit in with, I was always eventually rejected. 

I feel like everyone in this world is connected to something I’m not. I feel so far away, and alienated from everybody around me, so uncomfortable around anyone.

263,novalins,1572222729,2,"throwaway account because my friend frequents reddit. this is going to just be a mess of my emotions so i apologize

things have basically blown up in the last 24 hours. my “best” friend (i’ll call her T) has recently gotten really close with a friend we went to high school with. it seems they hang out almost every day. i’m used to staying home and don’t go out all that often. i know it’s up to me to ask as well, but i feel like i’m never asked to do anything. well, cue last night at work when i see her new friend had posted on her instagram story that she was at this pumpkin patch i had talked to them about going to. me being me, i jump to conclusions. we had all originally talked about going there, but decided against it because you had to pay for the individual activities on top of admission. so, when i saw she was there i automatically assumed T was there too... i asked a mutually friend if T had posted on her snapchat story. i had assumed she had maybe blocked me from watching it. lo and behold, mutual friend said T had posted. of course i have to go act like a fucking bratty teenager and call her out on it. after texting her i blocked her number because i didn’t want to deal with a response that night. i woke up the next morning and i guess the texts came through on my computer anyways. T was angry i had assumed she was there and that she no longer trusts me or wants to be friends, and that me ignoring her was unfair. i still don’t know if she was actually there or not. i’ve been so tired of feeling like her second choice that all my emotions came up and i blew up on her. she’s legit one of the only two people that texts me on a regular basis. i’m so tired of feeling alone. everyday i feel like i just repeat the motions but i never look forward to anything. i’m still too scared to read the full message she sent me. i’m scared of intimacy and telling her how i feel. i felt i just needed to rant. i thought this would make me feel better but it really just cemented what a shitty person i am lol. thanks for reading if you do. i hope it all works out",lonely,i’m an asshole,2019-10-28 11:32:09

So, I'm lonely. Now one might be angry, resentful, envious, etc, because I do have family. I have a damn good friend that is basically a brother to me. I've got good things, I've no right to be sad and lonely.

Yet, I am.

You know what I'm talking about. You're 'here', but not *really* here, y'know? I've always felt separate. Different from everyone else. Doesn't make me special, just makes me frustrated and lonely. I don't think I'm really from around here, but ayy, that's just my dissociation and depersonalization and other stuff. Felt this for years.

Worst bit is I know I'm clever enough to know that I will probably be lonely for the rest of my life. Never considered myself attractive. Even if I did meet some nice girl or someone or whatever, they'd run soon after really getting to know me. I've got way too many problems. *Seriously, heaps of problems.* Luckily, no substance or alcohol abuse. But I get why people turn to drink and the needle with the kind of issues I got.

Think what might annoy people about me, for those that are lonely, is that their loneliness may not be their choice. It is for me. I choose to be as closed off as possible. I honestly think of myself as a freak and a monster. I know I am a burden, and nothing anyone tells me can shake that feeling. I had dreams, ambitions and goals. Before things, y'know, ***really*** *didn't work out.* I've been doing nothing for years now, due to circumstances beyond my control. My problems can't be fixed with a pill, powder or alcoholic beverage. Even if I manage my problems, they aren't gonna go away. I can't fix me. No one can.

But maybe, just maybe, I can help other people. That's my new dream now. I want to help my family. I want to give my best friend good things. I want to make people laugh, smile. I could try to be a therapist, but geez, that really isn't a good idea for me. I get too stressed, way too easily and I'll get sick again. I'll try and help people if I can anyways.

Regardless of the loneliness, I'm gonna try and do something. May cure the loneliness, might not. I hope it can go away a bit, so I can help others. I can't stress this enough, I just wanna help but I know I'm a wreck myself. Kinda sucks, mang.

Anyway, if you read this? Thanks. Mean that. Here's to all of us finding someone, or something.

270,throwaway459324981,1572216766,1,"I don't know how much more I can take. I've never had many friends in middlehigh school and it's never bothered me. I've always known I was lonely but it never bothered me until a few months ago. I was homeschooled for the first time because we moved and I thought I would like it better. The entire school year I had no friends because I never left the house to meet new people anywhere. 

This year is my final year of school and I decided to go back to a public school. So far I like it better because I'm surrounded by kids my age but I still don't have any friends. I don't talk to anyone unless they talk to me first. I've never in my life hung out with someone after school or did anything fun with them. I've never been to a party or even invited to one. 

The only person I talk to is this girl I added on snapchat lives close to me, but I know we can never actually meet. She is the only thing that makes me happy throughout the day. She's my only friend I have and the only person I talk to. It sucks because I am so dependent on her for my happiness. We've gotten closer to eachother over the few months we've been talking to eachother. We both care about eachother but I feel like I am super attached to her. Anyone who gives me any attention at all I immediately become attached to them, and that's exactly what happened with her. I hate myself because I know if she just stopped talking to me all of a sudden I would be a mess. I cry myself to sleep almost every night just at the thought of me having no friends and how I ruined my life and wasted my teenage years. I feel like such a failure to everyone close to me. 

The part I really hate about myself is that I feel like I have to control every situation. I think I've gotten better at it, but I still get the feeling every single time. Whenever she leaves me on delivered and I see her snapscore going up for hours I feel like she just doesn't care for me anymore. I get jealous at every little thing and I hate myself for it. It could be just her going out with her friends or something. I know that it is a super toxic thing to have in a relationship so I try to not let it get to me. I tell her to just have fun, but deep inside I would rather her just stay home and talk to me all day. I try not to show her I am jealous and feel controlling, but sometimes it gets the best of me. I need constant reassurance that she still cares about me and wouldn't leave me for some reason or else I feel not cared for anymore. 

Yesterday was one of my worst days emotionally. The whole day I felt alone and I felt she didn't want to talk to me. Near the end of the day she told me she just got back from a party and didn't have service there. Of course I got mad for no logical reason at all and I told her I hope she finds someone who she likes and actually wants to talk to, and I removed her from snapchat. I know I fucked up instantly and I regretted it. I had her numnber so I asked her why she doesn't talk to me. She said she was just tired some days and slept or just wanted to watch tv. I told her I needed her in my life (ironic since I removed her on snap). She told me I am always mad at her. I try so hard to not get mad but I just feel like I need to for some reason I hate it. She told me she was worried about me and I should get help, but she's the only one I trust talking to.

All that will be left of you will be pictures, files, maybe someone will remember you. But in time, those things fade. Eventually, you will be forgotten. It's inevitable. So why do anything, when you know it'll amount to nothing. Why bother to eat, work, slave away at an unfulfilling existence? Why not just die and get it over with, it's the same result in the end.

I'm a recent graduate, unemployed currently. I have a 8 month king Charles puppy and video games/TV binging have been my life recently.

I feel like it's so hard to make friends as you get older. Especially when you're trying to make friends with the same interests. All my childhood friends only wanna party and get drunk and that's just not me. To fix this I've started streaming. Twitch.tv/pingrrrplaysgames and I've had a few people stop in and talk to me about their days and mine. It's been great for me and for them (I hope) to feel a little less alone. I struggle with sleep so I'm always on all day and night. And I'll be on tonight around 11/12 GMT tonight.Feel free to stop by and I hope to talk to a few of you soon x

297,tiredoflife1312,1572199823,11,"So I was talking to this girl on instagram in the DMs. Sure, she's attractive, but has a boyfriend. Anyway she's one of these art ho types that is sensitive and has her own plethora of issues. She's actually quite nice and insightful, anyway I asked her how she was doing and she said not too good. We went on to have a little chat about loneliness that ended up pretty much blowing my mind, giving me an a-ha moment and making me feel as if I had put another puzzle piece in place.

Anyway she said something like everyone is fundamentally lonely. We're brought into the world alone, and we pretty much die alone. Unless we're gonna find a way to merge our consciousness with that of another like some sort of weird spiritual surgery, then we're in this vessel for the foreseeable future. It sucks. I want to just jump into the void and be one with god again, but i guess that's not why I'm here.

I realised that even though human beings are basically doomed to loneliness, this isn't actually all bad. Think about it. You're in this body, you have this soul. That means that this is the only soul you can ever truly know 100%, the person who's thoughts and feelings you know inside out, every disgusting crevice and charming cranny. Sure, you can get to know other souls, but even if you're in a forever relationship with your soul mate, there are still things you don't know about him/her, intricacies that they can't even articulate to you. Some things are lost inevitably, which is why people often get lonely inside of relationships, which was something that blew my mind before but makes more sense and seems more realistic now.

I am the only soul I will ever know fully. And from that lens, if you are lonely, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe it's a signal. A signal that says, hey, you're out of touch with yourself, you feel like a stranger inside of your own soul and body, let's fix this. So you get hit with loneliness, because inside of that solitude is the only way that you can begin to find yourself and reclaim your fragmented soul. And once the pieces start to come together, you begin to feel at home in the world, within yourself, like you really like yourself and like spending time within your vessel, and maybe you don't want to leave anymore. And maybe because of your own newfound connection to self, you can appreciate and connect that much more to beauty, to the world, maybe even to others. 

In that sense loneliness is therefore, a gift. It is packaged disgustingly and looks like this vile and unwanted thing that never wants to leave you, but if you decide to open it, you might be incredibly surprised at what you might find.",lonely,a slightly different perspective on being lonely,2019-10-28 05:10:23

I am also completely inexperienced in the dating world, mostly because of my fear of rejection. 

So back to the title, there are times when I feel like I could live my whole life without a partner. I work on weekdays, come home relax a bit, hit the gym, make dinner and catch up on some more work before I sleep. I hike on the weekends and watch movies when I can. I feel like I could stick to this routine for my whole life, sure I'd love to add some friends to mix but I'm fine without them too. 

Now this is what eats me away, I feel really alone for sometime, I feel like I could use an affectionate touch, and a cuddle while I'm watching a movie. When I'm on a hike, I always see these couples doing stuff together and then I feel really alone. Most the times these are fleeting thoughts that just pop in my head. Although, they come back to haunt me when I'm falling asleep. I try to tell myself that dating someone would just mean that I would become a burden on someone and vice versa. I'd lose my independence and freedom to do anything. However, as I am typing this out I am realizing that the only actual reason that I can come up with is that my companion would get bored of me, despise me and eventually leave me.

However, before reaching 16 I was slowly starting to feel lonely and depressed since I was frustrated with my shyness that arose from puberty. 

My best friend at school was really great at that time. However everyone else hated him which meant everyone hated me too.

Now entering college (ages 16-18). Me and my best friend went to the same college which was nice. But I was wrong. He slowly started drifting apart, made new friends and left me alone. (I stood by him through years of school when no one wanted to be his friend- and he just left me).

It took me awhile to get some friends but I think the loneliness and depression started affecting me and I developed OCD which was unknown at that time. Made my life hell.

Going to university I still had OCD and loneliness. I really wanted to move out for uni but couldn't. I made 0 friends in uni. Was so lonely and I have no idea how I graduated.

321,adventuresofzarek,1572167693,16,"These past couple months have been extremely rough for me, like it feels as if every day between august and now has dragged on, and I've lived through at least a year's worth of time in those 3-4 months.

At the end of July, my ex-girlfriend of eight months broke up with me. Things just were not working out; we had different goals in life, wanted to move in different directions, and the situation was becoming increasingly toxic to the point where it felt like every night ended in an argument.

The first couple days were honestly pretty good; I felt very free. I truly did love her, but now I could do whatever I wanted. I could go out and party and theoretically have sex with anyone who said yes. I could flirt with anyone. I didn't feel confined to this toxic relationship that was failing despite how much effort I put in (that was never reciprocated.) I thought of her often, since this was my first serious relationship and I missed talking to her, but other than that feeling I'd say I was genuinely happy. I went out and bought a bunch of clothes for myself, because I wanted to look good. I held my head up high, and had a smile on my face.

As August began and went on things started to get a bit rougher. Despite being free from the chains that were holding me back, I was lonely now. I never realized how much of an impact being with her had on me; I always had someone to talk to, I had someone to cuddle with, and someone to hold me when I was alone and had nobody else. I spent so much time with her that I didn't even need friends, and distanced myself from everyone that I was close with. August, I didn't have that person. I got hugs and comforting from some of the friends who decided to take me in again, but it wasn't the same. It's never the same, even though I appreciated it.

I started drinking a little bit \[for clarification, I am under the legal drinking limit, so it makes all this a bit worse\] and unfortunately decided to try a few other things for my privacy I won't mention here, because it was better than this daunting feeling of loneliness that haunted me and just wouldn't leave me alone. It helped, even though at the time I realized that it was bad and I shouldn't be doing it. I even self harmed a couple times, mostly in late August, because the pain that I'd been going through before my breakup and the loneliness just got too intense.

September passes...October ensues...I've never been more lonely. I, once again, have begun distancing myself from everyone thinking that it was because I just didn't fit into my friend group, yet here I am realizing that it only made me more lonely. My relationship between my closest friends have become destroyed, my self confidence is at an all time low, and despite having that freedom of a single male, I don't use it. Ever. I haven't had sex or any intimacy other than a bit of grinding at my high school's homecoming dance, which only made me feel more lonely after the lights dimmed down and the crowd began to dissolve. Sex was never important to me, but being intimate (i.e cuddling, holding each other close to keep the cold out, kisses, etc.) always was, and very little made me happier than going on adventures with the love of my life hand in hand and seeing the world.

I have all these dreams of being able to travel the world, seeing everything from the endless fields of Montana, to the snowy forests of Alaska, to the bustling cities of London and Moscow and even the rural Ukrainian farms abandoned since the nuclear disaster. The hardest part is that every time I envision my future, full of travels and adventures, I envision a girl next to me seeing it all with me. I can't shake that wish, to be able to roam with someone, and go on the most spontaneous and fun adventures. I want someone who's always willing to have a cup of hot cocoa in the rain and go on long walks in the snow, or watch the stars begin to show after the sun puts on its' pajamas and tuckers into bed, or to lay in a huge empty field as the sun creeps back up over the mountains to the east. Even just staying inside all day, or eventually starting a family- things I never imagined myself doing four years ago- seem so amazing. Just to be with someone. Anyone. Even my ex-girlfriend, who wants nothing to do with me and is happily in another relationship.

I don't know what to do any more, to be honest. I've been sober/off the stimulants and drugs for at least two weeks now and haven't even come close to them. No alcohol since August. I haven't self harmed in at least a month, which is good. Though, every time the loneliness gets real bad, I start to think about how much easier it would feel if I had some kind of physical pain to reduce the mental pain I go through every day. I go to bed lonely, wake up and one of the first thoughts is of how lonely I am. Some nights I go to bed truly believing that I am better off dead, and wake up the same way. In the past, I lost someone to suicide, so I know how much pain it transfers onto others and that it's never the right path to take, but other nights I get so lonely that I seriously consider ending it all. I've texted my ex a couple times, and she responded out of kindness some of them. I just want to talk to her again. I just want to hold her again. I want to be so madly in love that I forget that lonely is a word in the first place. 

I'm just so worried that will never happen. Aside from my terrible acne, I'm a moderately good looking person, who has a bit of confidence, and a great personality, decent body, and loves adventuring. Unfortunately, that's not good enough I guess. Or maybe asking for someone who wants to grow with me, who's in it for the long run, is too much to ask for this day in age. Everyone says that eventually I'll find the person, but I just don't know any more. I don't know if there is a right person for me. Or anyone. Maybe some people are destined to die alone.

Im glad she’s having fun but I also feel like a loser. And I feel like everyone gets a car handed to them at like age 15. Literally everyone has a car, and I sit at home and do nothing while my niece is partying and living it up every night. I don’t mean to sound jealous or bitter, it’s more of, what did I do in my life to mess up? Why does everyone else have a car and friends besides me?",lonely,I feel sad,2019-10-27 18:46:29

327,playb0yg,1572161361,3,"I don’t really like to talk about this because I feel as if it sounds cringe and maybe even childish but I’m gonna go ahead and do it anyways. So in high school I was what most people would  consider “popular”, I didn’t really care much but I loved high school. The one thing that bothered me was when it was my senior year, I realized I never had a solid friend group. Like during lunch, I never had an exact group to go to, I’d literally go from group to group (after a while you feel like you have no position in the group so you go to the next one). Not that I had trouble making friends, I was very social but my situation was always I’d meet someone new or a group of people and I’d become super close to them but the friendship would usually last about less than year (no friendships ever ended on bad terms we just went different paths). I kid you not this literally happened to me every year of high school and now I’m in college and I feel so lonely, like I don’t have a group of friends. I’ve always envied those with friend groups where everyone gets along. I do have “friends” from high school but if I’m being honest I feel as if I only get hit with plans when it’s beneficial for them. And if I do hang out with them, I always feel like the tag along and like I don’t belong. So yeah that situation of having temporary friends has been repetitive through out my high school life and I’m not gonna lie I don’t really like making new friends now because I fear of the same situation happening again, like why am I going to open up if I know it’s not going to last. And so far in college, no one besides my professors have tried talking to me and I TRY talking to others but them seem so uninterested in even talking so it’s like what’s the point of even trying. College is already stressful enough and I have no one to vent to so I’ve come to Reddit. I’m hoping someone can relate to this and share their thoughts, if not what am I doing wrong lmao.

334,MyGiftingTrouble,1572156627,6,"Late last night, I was in a bad car crash. A drunk driver hit my car and totaled it and then the guy ran away. Thankfully, I wasn’t injured.


I wanted to tell me friends individually. I wasn’t driving my own car, it was my moms car. I was just starting to learn how to drive and this is probably gonna scare me for a bit out of driving.



Anyways, the next morning, I wanted to tell some friends since it’s pretty damn important. The first person I tell, just holy shit. For a bit of context, I’m 18 and we are internet friends for 5 years now. Although we never officially dated, we would always talk about what would happen if we lived closer. We even did the stupid contract of, “if you’re 30 and I’m 30, let’s get married”. I seriously sacrificed so much for this girl. I rejected other women and would convince myself to not have a crush so she could be my first girlfriend despite her being in tons of other relationships. It was mostly manipulation on her side, as in anytime I would tell her about a girl I found attractive, she would tell me how she would feel sad if we stopped talking or just point out tiny flaws for me to not like the person, just generally terrible things.

We told each other off earlier this summer but I reignited it (it was for a stupid reason. Her birthday came up and I had a gift ready which was a website about her and she wants to be friends again). I thought things would be different but apparently not...

I texted her about what happened and she seemed to be worried, saying the usual stuff like “are you okay?” and what not. But I swear to you, just out of nowhere, she brings up how her and this boy had sex...for no reason whatsoever. I wasn’t even done talking, she just interrupted me and told me that for no reason. She was the girl I used to love and someone I sacrificed 5 years I could’ve been dating other people for, all down the drain, I didn’t wanna hear about her having sex, especially not after this car crash. I just told her I didn’t want to hear it and she seemed really ticked off I said that.


The second person is someone I recently met, so of course I kinda didn’t expect this person to care as much as the first person. But just...they changed the subject to this party they wanted to attend before they asked if I was hurt. It’s so damn frustrating, I felt like I could’ve at least opened up a little bit more to this person instead of the other girl I mentioned, but I guess they didn’t wanna hear much.


The third person I told is also pretty similar to the first person. While I didn’t get hurt, I felt a little bit of pain from the whiplash of the seatbelt hitting my stomach. As soon as I was finished explaining that, she just went on about this boy she met and how much she wants him sexually. It was just so damn jarring, I didn’t know how to respond and said some awkward words and walked away.



I’ve had this problem for so long. I don’t know how to have people that care about me. I know I’m not hurt from the crash which is really important, but I could’ve been and I would’ve had no one to depend on or talk to. I don’t think I’ll talk to these people for a long time, this has already made a stressful situation just so much worse.",lonely,Had a bad car accident and no one seems to car,2019-10-27 17:10:27

Even my boyfriend, who is my best friend, is introverted and happy to spend a lot of time alone or at home while I crave company. I feel like I need to socialize and talk to people to be truly mentally well, and I just don't feel like any of my friends want to do that.

I run a D&amp;D campaign with this group. It's been going a couple of years, but recently I decided to go back to school and D&amp;D was put on hold for a while. My friends wished me the best and assured me that they'd still hang out on voice chat sometimes.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-10-27 12:54:27

The kid is taking their anger out on me and is often disrespectful, short, and curt with me and it gets worse when no one else is around. People only know what happens when we have a fight and they see me explode. Then when I explode, the kid plays the victim and acts like my anger was unprovoked. This past week, it got so bad, the kid called the cops on me and tried to play the victim. Thankfully, no one was arrested or charges filed, but they did do a report. 

I've tried extraordinarily hard to never have a run in with the law knowing that everyone else in my family has. I worked hard to put myself through university to better myself and to do better for my kid. I was already lonely, but now I'm completely ashamed and embarrassed to the point I no longer want to be seen in public in my tiny town. Tonight, my daughter has a club banquet, but I know the officer who came the other day will be there, so out of shame and embarrassment, I didn't go. I just dropped my kid off and told her to call when she's ready. I know this isn't the worst thing that could happen, but it's definitely up there.

Every situation I encountered, I would imagine what my friends would do in that given scenario, how they would react, what they would say, etc.

It only get kept getting worse as I kept meeting new people and making new friends, because moving past them was never easier.
I reached a point when I simply stopped making friends and became a complete shut in. Even then I remember there was this friend I used to play with in an MMO everyday but one day he didn't login and I spent the whole day just waiting for him. Then the next day came and the next, and so 2 months passed and eventually I figured he had quit for good. This cycle repeated as well. I would find new cool people to play with and then they would stop playing one day.

I somehow made it out of my shut-in phase and got a job and I'm trying to make friends online but people here ghost so easily. Everything seems to be going well until the person just completely stops answering. And I guess it's fine because there are times when I don't want to continue talking to the other person either.

This shouldn’t come as a shock to anyone reading this but I am very lonely. I just recently turned 21 and I have never been in a relationship before. I never went on a single date in high school and didn’t have my first kiss until college, which I’ll be graduating in May. 

I’ve got pretty low self esteem and self confidence because I got bullied in middle school and high school. I’ll give you all en example: freshman year of high school I was playing GTA5 with some friends on Xbox. I went to go eat dinner and left my mic on mute, when I came back I forgot it was on mute and I heard them talking about me. They were talking about a picture someone had taken of me earlier that day and they said I looked “ugly and inhuman.” To this day I really don’t like having my picture taken. 

Now I look better than I did in middle school / high school for sure but I still struggle with my appearance a lot. I’ve tried using dating apps because it’s hard for me to approach girls in person but they’ve really only made things worse. I’ve used a combination of 4 dating apps over the past 4 years and I’ve averaged 1-2 matches a month. That’s with swiping right on over 200 people/day until I ran out of people in my area and eventually made new accounts to try again. Meanwhile my friends with the same dating apps will have 70+ matches and have 99+ people liking them. All of my friends and family say that I am smart, funny, witty, and have a good personality so it doesn’t take a genius to figure out why nobody is liking me. 

As I mentioned before, I recently turned 21. I’m a senior in college so obviously I’ve been drinking before but I don’t enjoy it so turning 21 wasn’t a huge milestone for me. I did however want to do something with my friends though. I mentioned my birthday coming up for months and when it came down to it nobody hit me up to do anything. Even my own roommates ended up leaving me alone in the apartment to go watch a basketball game. I ended up eating dinner at the university cafeteria after my last class and bought myself a pie on the way home. It was probably my least favorite birthday. 

The combination of my birthday on Tuesday and what happened with my last match on bumble has really started to bum me out again. We matched on birthday funny enough and ended up talking for the next three days. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever connected with someone so well and I was genuinely excited every time I would get a notification from her. Everything ended abruptly when she found out I had some conservative views and she doesn’t associate with people like that. I was really taken back by it and I still find it hard to believe people take politics so seriously. I’m not even a die-hard far right conservative, I’m more towards the middle. Anyway it was just the icing on the cake and I’ve deleted all my dating profile accounts now. 

This is turning into a long read but if you’ve made it this far then props to you buddy. Anyway I can feel myself starting to slip back into a pretty depressed state and it scares me. All my life I’ve gone through what I call periods of feeling good and feeling pretty depressed. I’m not the “I have self diagnosed depression please give me attention type.” I very rarely will talk with my friends or family about how I’m feeling because I genuinely don’t think they care and I feel it would be pointless which is why I found myself here to rant. But going back, when I’m feeling depressed all I can think about is how my life has gone so far. That ranges from things people have said about me over the years which keep me up at night to never having been in a relationship before. I’m 21 years old now, if I live to be 100 that’s a fifth of my life already over and I feel it was all meaningless. I’ve come pretty close to killing myself three times in the past and I’ll probably end up going through with it once I graduate college. 

The first time was in my junior year of college. My sister was taking pictures of me at home and I don’t remember why but it was genuinely upsetting me. I tried getting her phone so that I could delete them but she locked herself in her room. My mom came into the hallway to see what was going on and I ended up punching a hole in the wall. My mom screamed and the look of disappoint on her face really hit me because I love my mom. I ended up fixing the hole in the wall but I felt like such a disappointment to my mom and I didn’t have anything else going for me I just wanted to kill myself. I heavily thought it over so the following months but ended up not going through with it. I’m also not a very angry person, the outburst was really uncharacteristic of me and in the last 5.5-6 years nothing like that has ever happened again. 

The second time was after I graduated high school. I got accepted to a university out of state and I decided that’s where I wanted to go. I wanted to get away from all the negativity I associate home with (except my family) but I was afraid that everything would be the same. I was going to shoot myself at the end of the summer but a couple of friends of mine noticed I wasn’t really myself and had a mini intervention for me. I brushed it off but it did convince me to do to college. 

The third time I don’t have a story like the last two. I just happened to be going through a really bad period and it just didn’t seem worth it anymore. 

I am so lonely and just want someone to spend my life with. I want to hold hands, go on dates, or just do something simple like go grocery shopping together. It’s so hard watching my friends go in and out of being in relationships over the years. Two of my best friends are now even in long term relationships where they live with their girlfriends. I’m at a weird age in my life where I’ve got friends who are in long term relationships, friend who are still new to their relationships, friends who talk about just hooking up with girls, and then there is me who does none of that. I’m not even interested in one night stands but I’m sure it would be nice to have a connection for even that short period of time. 

I don’t have the motivation to care about anything anymore. I’ve got a 3.5 GPA and my grades mean nothing to me now. I have a nice car and with my degree I’ll be making close to 6 figures right out of college but the money doesn’t mean anything to me. I just want to be happy. I said before I’ll probably wait until after college to off myself and that’s because I at least want to get my degree to make my mom and dad proud. They both weren’t fortunate enough to go through college so I know it would mean a lot to them. 

I don’t think I covered this before but I’m not a super loner with no friends, in fact I don’t really have a problem making friends at all. I know my friends seem kinda shitty for leaving me alone in my birthday but they’re not bad people and I don’t hold it against them. My friends form back home wished me happy birthday and so did my ones here. And no, I’m not still friends with the two who bullied me in high school from my story before. 

I think this brings us to the end of my rant. Not sure if this helped me any but we made it to the end, thanks for reading I guess",lonely,losing my motivation again... m21,2019-10-27 04:50:30

When I go out with the people I met here, all we do is go to bars or clubs and drink. I'm drinking too much, but it's hard to find things to do here that don't heavily involved alcohol since none of the people I've met seem interested.

420,hamartiated,1572074639,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

429,petroldreams,1572070824,4,"everyone i’ve ever trusted and let into my life has abandoned me. all of my friends are moving on to lead better lives without me and i love them but they don’t talk to me or text me back or follow up on plans anymore. i’ve been so depressed lately i don’t really see a point in going on but i’m reaching for something. for the past few years it’s been staying alive for my friends because i managed to meet people who actually loved me and wanted me around, but as time has gone on we’ve become more distant and i know they wouldn’t care if i killed myself. 

i can already see in the future that they’ll be happy and successful and ill still be the same loser i was when they met me, and they’ll forget about me. i know they will. it’s how these things always work. it’s so hard for me to make friends, it’s like i fade into the background everywhere i go, sometimes i wonder if i exist to other people. 

i feel like they’ll never understand what it’s like to be alone and scared. they always have friends and they have great families and they don’t understand isolation and loneliness. they think i’m just bad with social situations. it doesn’t matter to them if they lose me because they can just replace me. it’s even more sad because i know i won’t be able to replace them. all those years of friendship, it’s so special to me and i love them both so much, they mean the world to me and i would do anything for them. i love them more than anything. and i know nobody will replace hem ever, and i’ll never connect with someone the way i connect with them and i know i won’t ever find a friendship as close to someone as i have with them.

it’s pathetic really. the people i love so much and admire and care about probably wouldn’t even notice if i killed my self until someone told them. i just wish i knew they’d never leave. it hurts a lot to look at them and just know they will eventually and i can’t do anything to convince them to stay because they have such better futures than i ever will, and that means leaving behind the past and moving onto better things. i miss them so much already. 

i recite all the time in my head what i would write to them in a letter if i leave one or two for them. i don’t know if i should or not, i don’t know if they’d want to be responsible for something like that. i just don’t want to hurt them but i think they’re better off without me.",lonely,everyone leaves eventually. no matter what.,2019-10-26 17:20:24

&amp;#x200B;

I am twenty years old and I'm in my second year of college and I never made any college friends. I am very sad to see all the people I went to high school with moving on with their lives and making new friends and having a good time when I feel so stuck. My best friend from high school, who was just as awkward as me in high school, goes to a different college from me and seems to have really come out of her shell and didn't have nearly the struggle I've had. We are still good friends and talk quite often, but I am so afraid that she is moving on from me and will one day abandon me. But anyway, I have been doing a lot of soul searching in the last year and I've been seeing a therapist. I dug up some old memories of past friendships from my life that I think impacted my ability to make friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I became friends with my high school friend mentioned above when we were in tenth grade and my mom told me that she was the first friend of mine that she has actually liked because all of my other friends have been very bossy people with strong personalities. At the time, I noticed that she was right, but I had no idea why all my past friends were so terrible. I should mention that my best friend was also my only friend when she said this, so she wasn't talking trash about people I was still friends with. All the toxic friends I've had have been out of my life since tenth grade. I won't go into every single friend who treated me like garbage, because I honestly don't feel like typing it all out and you probably don't feel like reading it, so I'll summarize some of the ones that weren't as bad as the ones I'll go into detail for. A lot of them talked to me at school when it was convenient for them and accepted me into their friend group, but I always felt like the last kid picked for the team whenever everyone was in a group. And they almost always forgot to invite me when our whole friend group hung out together outside of school. Nobody ever texted me or asked about my life. And when I realized how left out that made me feel, I ditched them as friends and none of them noticed. Or if they did, they didn't care enough to do anything about it. But here are some of the most damaging people I have been friends with.

&amp;#x200B;

This girl, I'll call her B, was friends with me from kindergarten to fourth grade and was the most toxic person I have ever met. And for those of you who think it's impossible for an elementary schooler to be toxic because they are so young, you are wrong and your belief is part of the problem. Young people can be cruel and the victims of that cruelty deserve to be taken seriously. But that's an entirely different rant that I won't elaborate on. So B had a very strange family situation. Her mom had two kids, both with different dads, and for most of the time I was friends with B, her mom was married to a man that B believed was her biological father. She called him dad and had his last name. But the summer before we started fourth grade, her mom and this man had a very messy divorce. I don't know all the details, but the man apparently broke into their house after he had stopped living there and they had to install security cameras. B changed her last name to her mother's original last name and I assume (I don't keep in touch with her, so I have no idea) that she hasn't seen him since. Her mom also didn't seem to understand moderation. Their house was really big and had a tv in every room, including the garage, and they had six dogs. Sorry if you think that has nothing to do with this story, I just wonder if her family situation has anything to do with how she was as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

B and I went to a small Catholic school and neither of us had any friends in kindergarten for the first few weeks of school until we met each other. And for most of our time being friends, we didn't have anyone else because there were so few options. Every year of our friendship, we would get in fights about the most stupid, petty things. For example, there was this girl, I'll call her H, who didn't have a lot of friends and I eventually became decent friends with her and sometimes sat next to her at lunch instead of sitting by B. If I didn't sit next to H, she would sit alone. One day, I promised H that I would sit next to her tomorrow. The next morning, B told me she had cake in her lunch and she was going to share it with me. I was excited to have cake at lunch for the whole day. When lunchtime came around, I sat next to H like I promised, not thinking it was a problem. I walked over to where B was sitting and asked her for cake and she told me I couldn't have any because I was sitting next to H. I thought this was stupid and got mad and she got mad at me for getting mad and we didn't speak to each other for at least a few days. We got in fights like these about once every week or two, but none of them ever ended our friendship because I felt like I didn't have the power to do it. I remember writing in my diary at the time that we got in one of our biggest fights to date and I was optimistic that this could end things, but it never did. We were still friends at the end of fourth grade and she switched schools for the next year and we never saw each other again. But here's a list of other things she did to me:

She told me that one day she was going to bring duct tape to school to cover my mouth because I was so annoying and I don't think she was joking, because every day, she would give me updates about how she couldn't find any in her house and she was asking her mom to buy more.

She tried her best to seem more grown up than everyone else because she was the first person to get an iPod and a cell phone (this was in the mid 2000s) and was always in competition with me for who knew more lyrics to the pop songs on the radio. Her mom owned a day care that she helped out at and she got paid for it, so I guess you could say it was a job, but every time she started a story with, ""yesterday, at WORK,"" I knew she wanted to say ""at work"" as much as possible because that's what the adults said. And these things worked because I always felt like a baby around her.

She told me I was a bad friend for telling my mom about our fights because I was ""talking behind her back,"" so I kept our fights a secret. She also convinced me that if I talked to our teacher, then I was going to get in trouble, so no adult ever knew about our problems.

Once when I was really mad at her and didn't want to talk, I sat down on the bus and opened a book, but she sat next to me and said, ""I want to talk to you."" I ignored her and she said, ""Whatever. I'll just make you talk like I always do. I can make you do anything.""

I failed a test that she got a perfect score on and when I expressed that I was upset, she said, ""boo hoo for you.""

I don't know how she managed to do this, but she convinced me that I held about 50% of the blame for our problems and I believed this until less than a year ago. Admittedly, I could have handled the fights much better, but I don't think that means it was my fault, because I was so young and I didn't feel like I could get any guidance from adults. I don't think about this era of my life that often, and I don't get emotional over it, but last winter, I was doing a memoir project for one of my classes, and while I was thinking about my life to get ideas, suddenly the fog cleared and everything made sense. I suddenly learned so much about myself just by making the realization that for some of the most important developmental years socially, I was the victim of a toxic friendship. And all the other people who followed B who also treated me terribly probably picked up on the fact that I am submissive and therefore an easy target. I never learned what friendship is supposed to be until high school, and I realize that all these years, I have built a barrier around myself because I would rather never let anyone in than risk getting hurt again. I don't trust anyone and I can't open up because I am so afraid that I will get hurt. And I don't know how to choose my friends because it's not like toxic people are blatant b\*tches. I can deal with b\*tches, but it's so much harder to deal with manipulative people who who change your perception of yourself and make you believe you are worthless. I believe this is why I have no friends at college. I think I need to overcome B and all the other people in my past who made me feel worthless and ruined my childhood and gave me crippling social anxiety. I need to learn how to be vulnerable, but I'm so afraid.

&amp;#x200B;

450,osculatrix,1572049462,2,"Hi friends.

I’m very new here, so I hope this is acceptable.

A bit of background: I’ve recently moved cities, after ending a beautiful relationship. It was my choice to end it, in that I was really the instigator. I won’t get into all the details right here, but suffice it to say it has probably been one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but I think it was the fair thing.
Anyway, after still being close since our break up, things really “got real” last night, with it being clear that being in touch is not a healthy or happy thing right now, as much as there’s still love there. 


I have never felt so alone. I got into that stage of relationship where no one else feels like they can fulfil anything. But I know that’s just because I’m feeling overwhelmed in life right now, and I kind of want an easy connection with all the nice things about being comfortable with a person. I want to be able to go out to restaurants with someone and enjoy delicious new food, without forced conversation — just whatever feels relaxed and fun and good. 

I REALLY want cuddles, and comforting touch. Intimacy. But I feel overwhelmed with that too, especially because I do not feel comfortable in my body right now, and I don’t want to be exposed to ridicule.


I just never thought I could feel this lonely. I’ve always been one to feel supported by the universe, as it were. And I guess I still do, but I’m wallowing I’m not having immediate, tangible, physical companionship right now. From having someone I could tell almost anything to, to just feeling like I have no one safe to talk to. There are friends, but I don’t want to burden them; I feel like they’ve all got their own crap going on... 

I’m just really struggling. Even saying all this. It feels like I should be able to just support other people better; like I feel my issues are superficial because they are (to some degree) self-imposed. But I feel like I did the responsible and right thing, even if it was hard.

I know I’ll make friends in this new city. But right now... I just want it right now. 
I tried looking for cuddle-puddles around, but couldn’t find any.
Posting a personal ad feels too complicated, cos I can’t host (staying with family).


I just feel overwhelmed, sad, and alone.

Sorry if that’s really pity-party. I needed to be able to get it out. &lt;3


Thank you for giving me this space, and I hope you each receive a sweet smile today (or over the coming day); be it from a person, or even just a sweet sky or pretty heart-shaped leaf from a tree. (Maybe that sounds weird, but these are natural things that bring me some hope and calm.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good amount of conversations with people throughout the day. However, I do not have any close connections. I don't have friends, I'm not in a relationship, and am not close with my family. This often makes me feel unattached to the world and I suspect is contributing to my feelings. I typically don't see eye to eye with my family so there's not much I can do there. I'm not emotionally available for a relationship but I am working on making close friends. This is difficult because I am a complex person with a lot of baggage. So it's going to take a while to open up in that way to a friend and build a solid connection.

In between these shifts we're all too tired to do anything together and we often use the time to rest and recover for the next day. I'm pointing this out because even with family near me, I still feel lonely because we never really have time to communicate. I only have a handful of friends and believe me I'm grateful for them, but they also have different schedules, some even attending university in different provinces.

That and also my friends always just complain about their girlfriends, so why would I want in on that? I used to think that I could just go at life solo and on my own, because I didn’t really want anyone else to be there with me, I like being by myself.

But I soon realized that the reason I’m sad all the time is because I’ve never had that connection with a SO. 19 years I’ve gone without even a kiss, or holding hands, or anything.

Recently I’ve been trying to go out of my comfort zone more in an attempt to start the relationship part of my life, even if it is really late. And I’ve actually managed to hangout with this great girl a couple times now. Too bad she’s 4 hours away at university and I can only see her every couple months.

I’ve started writing down my thoughts, I guess it’s a diary but I don’t really want to call it that because it’s embarrassing. And all I can write is cute things I want to do with her. Painting in the park, a cozy movie day, star gazing because she loves the stars and so do I! 

Even if I don’t do these things with her, I’m pretty sure I need to do them with someone very soon.

471,Jingerblush,1572038415,3,"I'm 34/f and separated from my ex of 18 years in June 2018. We were teen parents and had a great relationship but not much in common and ended up realizing it was better to be apart.  

This is the first time in my life I've lived alone. It's the first time I've had to do so many things myself. It's been a huge learning curve, gaining independence, navigating simple things, starting my own business and working for myself. 

At first I thought I was going to die from being alone, I couldn't comprehend it. My depression and anxiety were so bad that I would walk to the hospital almost daily just to feel safe from myself. But slowly I adjusted and learned to love living alone, I made my home mine, and I'm happy with my living situation. I live in a really cute and safe neighborhood.

The issue with my job is I work in people's homes, and they usually aren't there. So I spend about 95% of my life without in person human contact.

The loneliness is starting to suffocate me. I'm so scared of being vulnerable to people that I'm not able to put myself out there. When we moved from Vancouver to Montreal in 2011, I had to leave my incredible friends and I haven't been able to find new ones that feel the same. If it wasn't for our daughter I would be completely alone, but even then she's in college now and is busy with her own life. 

Winter is coming and the thought of being trapped inside and alone for another season is so depressing I can't bear it. Every couple months I attempt to date but it never seems to work out and I'm beginning to get a bit of a complex about it.

I'm a good person, I'm honest and great at communicating and I love to be silly and laugh. I'm very open and loving, and I feel like I have a lot to offer. Aside from the weight I've gained from being a hermit, I think I'm pretty date-able. 

I try to stay connected with people by texting, but it's become clear I text too much and people get a bit annoyed by me. So I joined discord but don't know enough about it to be able to find friends. I don't have many hobbies and often get halfway through projects and lose interest. 

I miss love. I miss touch. I miss connection. I miss sex. I miss laughing until I cry. I miss adventures. I miss being around somebody but doing my own thing. 

So if you're in Montreal or nearby and need a friend, PM me. If you don't, but you love hip hop, rap, watching YouTube (vlog squad, Shane, Jenna &amp; Julien, etc), or 420, go ahead and PM me.

I cry when I think of past memories: good and bad, former friends and partners who decided to part ways, and loved ones who have passed. The distant past seems much brighter and my future looks so hopeless and barren.

It's not because it's the fall season nor is my life particularly bad. However, I don't have anyone besides my parents and they're too old and involved in their own life issues to really notice or care about what's going on in my life.

My existential crisis is due to the fact that I'm leading a very lonely, aimless and unfulfilling life. Essentially, I'm not who I want to be and my life isn't what I want it to be. I understand that some of the choices I've made have caused my life to be this way but I also think it's because I've never really had anyone in my life to genuinely be supportive and proud of me and my goals.

a little bit about me, i'm f 18 and i've always been a very shy person, i've even speculated that i might have social anxiety but i don't want to self-diagnose, however i do struggle with irrational, overwhelming fears when exposed to social situations. my parents are quite reserved too, which is why i never had much contact with other children other than my siblings during my childhood (outside of school &amp; kindergarten). as a child i didn't put much thought into it, my best friends were my siblings and we hung out all the time, and i wasn't fully aware that other kids would form proper friendships. i guess when i was around 10 i first started caring about the fact that i might appear as a ""loner"" due to the fact that i never had genuine friends. i went to a small primary school, so i did have ""friends"" per se (although they all disliked and mistreated me for no apparent reason, which now looking back might be the root of my issues), but i rarely got invited over to their house or to hang out in general.

needless to say when i left primary school i was hopeful that in middle school i'd blossom into this social butterfly and have real friends i could hang out with. didn't end up happening though, of course. i was the outsider of the class. some people tried to welcome me into their group but always ended up ""giving up"" after a while, so i was always left on my own. another girl then started targeting me and would make fun of me daily. she'd often talk shit about me while i was right next to her; she made it obvious because she knew it would hurt even more. she was cruel, but she wasn't ""brutal"" so to speak, but i was very weak mentally and became depressed and started skipping school. the last month or so of 7th grade i didn't go to school at all. when school started again in 8th grade i tried to go back to school, i really did, but the first day i broke down before even going to class and my classmates saw me and tried to ""cheer"" me up, but they got annoyed and left. i then got homeschooled for the rest of 8th grade, barely went outside, only around once a week to go talk with a social assistant. we'd go for walks or to a place where you could make art with clay. honestly, i didn't enjoy it at all. i felt like a worthless reject of society, who was so broken that she'd have to do all these ""crazy people activities"" (i'd like to say that these thoughts were very ignorant, but as a 12/13 year old person there's nothing you want to be more than to be what is considered normal, and sadly in our society these kinds of programs are looked down upon most of the time). in comparison to my other school years, high school has been pretty good. i became friends with a girl after around 1 month and we're still relatively close today, though we never hang out outside of school anymore. nevertheless, the first 2/3 years were hard (side note: where i'm from we have 5 years of high school) at times, as my little group was always left out of the class community. i'd like to think that i've grown a lot and have made immense improvements these last 1.5 years, but i often realize that although i can now talk to anyone in my class freely and not be completely awkward, i'm still so so so lonely. my sister is my only real friend, i text with her everyday and we can talk about everything and laugh for hours, but other than that i don't really have true friends. i've noticed that although i really try, people never seem to give me a chance. i'm always ""the quiet one"" and i can never free myself of that label, people always see me as boring or weird, they never even consider being my friend and i genuinely don't understand why. i might be a bit different than most people where i live, simply because everyone is more or less the same in a way, but i'm not THAT different. i just.. don't understand. sometimes i kind of forget about this aching pain that being lonely causes, then i get reminded of how other people have LOTS of friends, close friends, best friends. they seem to have a friend for every occasion. it baffles me. i don't need 100 friends, i just wish i had a tiny friend group that truly understood &amp; cared about me the same way i'd care about them. i can come off as cold, but i have soo much love to give, it's just hard to express it :( and honestly, i wouldn't even need super close friends to be people i know irl, i'd be more than happy if it was a person living across the world, just as long as we truly understood and accepted each other as we are. in my darkest times i had lots of online friends, but nowadays i'm too anxious to even form friendships online. of course, ideally speaking, i would love to meet a true best friend irl, but the way things seem to be going for me irl that won't happen anytime soon.. sigh. i don't know how to end this, i feel like i could continue ranting on forever, but i'm just getting more depressed right now.

495,numbtothecore,1572019849,16,"I'm 33 years old and have been single for nearly three years.

 Last year I tried online dating for the umpteenth time cause I figured it was a good time to get back out there. I used Tinder, POF, and Facebook Dating all at once, thinking something would work. I met a few women, and we talked for a couple days, and then soon we made plans to meet. But nearly all of them cancelled on me for one reason or another (I've thought about making a list), and I didn't bother following up cause I knew better. Out of the seven dates I set up in a year, only three of them actually happened (the ones that did weren't that great either). After a year of that crap, I called it quits and now I'm back to where I was, no better off.

And then last week I realized something: I've forgotten how it feels to be in love. I've been single for so long that I can't remember what it's like to have someone. And I'm not sure if I'll ever know that feeling again. Theres a hollowness in me that I don't think will ever be filled again. It's like I'm cursed. I can't bring myself to ask out any women because I'm just too afraid they'll cancel on me. Meanwhile the whole goddamned world seems to be finding their love just fine. Everywhere I go I see it, so I try and isolate myself as much as I can. 

I feel like my time for love has come and gone, and I'm just meant to be alone forever.",lonely,(32M) I've been single for so long that I've forgotten how it feels to be in love,2019-10-26 03:10:49

506,SoCalSoLost,1572012044,2,"One of the few positive things I have going for me is my physical health. I walk/light jog 5-7 miles per day. Sunday - Wednesday I go on my walk anytime; same route every day. The route is through and downtown area and runs along the Pacific Ocean— so it’s a nice view. 

Thursday-Saturday, I only go early morning. I know that by going in the afternoon, evening or night, I’ll encounter crowds. The crowds themselves aren’t the problem, but the smiling, joyful people within the crowds are. Prior to altering my walking schedule, there had been times when I literally would cry after seeing all of the friends and couples having such a good time. Thousands of people; not a single one notices me. I’ve managed to get somewhat of a hold on this by avoiding it. 

Once per week I go against my avoidance rule. I get dressed, do my hair and actually get the confidence to go to one of these popular places. I go hungry because I want to be sure I have a reason to be there, just in case I see someone I used to work with or a neighbor— I can say “hey just grabbing a bite to eat” and not seem like a lonely lurker— which is exactly what I am doing. 

Like the walks prior to me changing my schedule, I just end up in tears. I’ve perfected how I hide this. The feeling of sadness takes over the moment I pay my check and realize, “Again. No one.” The pressure in my chest builds, as it is now as I type this. As many of you may know, that pressure slowly (but quickly) pushes up through your lungs, into your throat and eventually into the back of your eyes. Once there, the pressure exits in the form of tears. This is when I’ll look down at my pants and pretend to be digging for something in my pocket, while fighting the tears. Is it just me, or do you feel like crying more when you’re fighting back your tears?

So last night, before I head out, I tell myself this has to be it. This has to be the last time I do this and I have to make it work. I can’t keep getting dressed up and spending money just to end up home alone. For all that, I can just stay home and order in and save time and money. Sure, I’ll still be in tears and upset, but in the privacy of my own place; I didn’t have to get dressed up, and it’s not costing me as much. 

I went to a popular bar/restaurant called “Tequila Jacks.” I walked by a table of two women, my age. One looked at me, but I think it was more of just a natural reaction to someone walking by. I thought to myself, “Just smile and say hi.” I did neither. I continued to the bar where I ordered a drink and a meal. Nearby, three gorgeous women are having drinks at a table for four. An open seat. An easy in. My food arrived fairly quickly. I ate and noticed that a fourth lady showed up and sat with the rest of the ladies. I still thought that this is fine; just introduce yourself to them all. Tell a stupid joke. Do anything. I recall thinking, “Either leave here crying because you did nothing. Or leave her crying because you were rejected. Either way, you’re crying, so you may as well just talk to them.” 

Okay. No problem. I’m finally ready to do it. The bartender asks if I’ll be having anything else. I tell him know and I get my check. I knew I wasn’t leaving. I keep looking in the ladies’ direction and one of them seems to be looking in mine. They are maybe 15 feet from me at their high-top table. I knew I could be funny so I had that on my side. I knew that even in the worst scenario, I can make a few jokes and leave then cry alone after. So what’s to lose? 

I add a tip to the bill. Sign it. Drop the pen on the bar, sip my drink one last time and look in their direction. Here it goes. I stand up. Look in their direction. Take a deep breath and sigh. Next, I turn away and exit the bar. The pressure in my chest mounts and as I walked away from doing nothing, I just looked down and fiddled with my pockets until the tears stopped. 

I called a Lyft and got home about ten mins later. I cried myself to sleep and woke up several times throughout the night. Each time, facing the empty side of the bed. A reminder that I’m here alone. I reminder that I once had love and ruined it. A reminder that I’m destined to have no one. Not a friend. Not a lover. And nothing in between. Just a lonely man who has perfected hiding his tears from the public.

507,bwise0713,1572011271,2,"Yesterday, I was on duty at the FD. I love my job. I work with great people and I never remember how truly lonely I am when I’m up there. We’re all just the guys hanging out. We work 24 hours on and 48 off. Fast forward to now....

I got home at 0715. I don’t live far from work. I unlocked my door and took a deep breath of the somewhat stale air. It’s normal for me to shut off my heating and air when I’m gone. It just doesn’t make any sense to leave it running for 24 hrs while I’m gone. 

It’s quiet in here except for the hum of the Keurig making my morning coffee. While I wait, I take the opportunity to look at my phone and check on any notifications I may have. I’ve been on Bumble and Tinder for about a week now. Still no matches....

The Keurig is done and I throw a little creamer into my coffee. It’s started to get chilly outside. I’m thankful that the weather is changing. The warm cup feels nice on my hands. I’ve always despised the heat and humidity that comes with an Arkansas summer even though I don’t know any different. I’ve always lived in Arkansas but I was born and raised in a small town about an hour southeast of here. I moved up here to save money and time rather than commute almost every day for work. I thought that it would also be a change to expand my horizons and diversify my life a little bit. After all, I was moving from a small town of 10,000 to a bustling and growing city of around 300,000. 

As I settle in on the couch with my coffee, I’m starting to get a little unsettled by how quiet it is in here. The TV starts up the movie I had been watching the other night before I went to bed: Passengers. A flood of emotions comes running in. 

“I’m lonely too, Jim”. I thought to myself. 

I can’t help but wonder why things have turned out this way. Anyone that I meet or talk to, I believe, genuinely enjoys my company. I’ve never met a stranger and I’ve never had any problem talking to someone about anything. 

“I need an Arthur to talk to just like Jim has on the Avalon”. I joked. 

I do have an Arthur.....

I grabbed my phone and opened up Reddit where thousands upon thousands of people post every day about everything. 

The whole reason I was driven to write and post was because I felt lonely and I wanted to vent. I start to wonder what subreddit would it be most acceptable to write and share how I’m feeling. On a whim, I typed lonely into the search bar and, of course, the first result that popped up was r/lonely. In here, there’s thousands of people who feel exactly how I do. Maybe they need an Arthur as well. I don’t want anyone to feel like they’re completely alone. Sometimes people just need to vent. 

I’m going to tell them a story about how I feel....so I began to tyoe....

I really should leave as soon as possible, but it's not that easy. I'm kinda just expect to go to school until I magically become a doctor and dig myself into crippling debt.

Am i such a hassle to be friends with that the moment you get a gf you have will stop talking to me? Why must i be this way? Why am i so paranoid ill end up alone? Why do people not keep in touch with me? I realize that some might want me to initiate, but i can't. I get nervous, and freeze. Right now i just need someone to say they won't leave me.

Someone save me from myself. Get me out of the prison i have created. All it takes to open the lock is a hello and a smile.

542,NitrousWolf0123,1571974909,1,"Allow me to give some background. I had the same little trio of friends from kindergarten until freshman year of high school. One of them was my best friend for a while. In third grade, we pseudo added a fourth guy the group. That guy and I are still good friends to this day but he moved 7 hours away. My other two friends, let’s call them Bob and Bill, still live here. Once we got high school, I noticed they Bill became an asshole. He and I were never close to begin with, but he stared to like be a dick in particular to me. I eventually picked up on the fact that he didn’t want to talk to me anymore, which I was fine with. Someone in their new friend group actually told me “Yeah man don’t say anything but Bill is tryna like not talk to you.” That was junior year. I’m in my senior year now. The two of them started hanging out with other people and just acting in a way I didn’t connect with. Bob and I started to get closer again and are still friends but Bill can go to hell. 

Here’s what happened. I would make “plans” with them for a weekend(we’d talk about doing something), so I would reject plans from other people. The other people stopped asking me after a while and these “plans” with Bob and Bill never came to fruition. They’d do stuff without me a lot of the time anyway. So basically I locked myself in with only a group of friends who didn’t want to hang out. I basically devolved all my friendships into people I’m simply friendly with, but wouldn’t hang out with. Therefore, I don’t even text these people. We don’t have conversations. I have nobody to talk to except for the guy 7 hours away and my Xbox friends. 

This is where the she comes in. Now I said I didn’t know how lonely I was in the first place until she left. “She” is my former girlfriend. Let’s say her name is Jane. TL:DR, we were in love. She graduated and went to Canada for school. It’s 5 hours away; while that’s not bad, it’s over a border. I don’t leave the house without her here! I don’t do anything anymore. It really made me realize I just don’t have friends. Okay so lately it’s been painful to be talking to her, so I told
Her I need a few days of space. Today was the first full day of not talking to her at all, and I’ve literally NEVER felt so alone in my entire life. Like this whole thing is so foreign to me. I feel like I have no one. I’m not like depressed or anything( I think), I’m just lonely.

I’m almost done w my senior year and I still don’t have anyone to hang out with and I don’t understand why. I think I’m a pretty chill dude, not awkward or tacky, cringy or weird in any way. I feel like I’m pretty down to earth and pretty smart. I listen to rap and like football  and I’m athletic, I  am into pretty much everything the “cool” kids are but just can’t seem to attract any friends. I’m definitely smarter than the popular kids, enough to understand the whole poser and wanna be thing so I try to be myself and just be cool w people, I’m good at conversation and I’m a pretty funny dude at times. But yet I find myself alone, watching people’s snapchats story of them w friends and I can’t seem to find a best friend or be someone’s favorite person. I want someone to talk to that actually cares and find someone that is like me in certain ways, like down to earth, clear thinking and not someone who follows the crowd w the generic rap music, drugs and the major ego all teens son to have out here :/  I want to help people change their destructive ways or give advice to people in need so I always post on my story that they can swipe up and anonymously ask for advice which I love to give but nobody even slides up anymore. I think a reason I may do that is because I subconsciously want someone to start conversation w me by asking for help and then start a friendship but idk. It may give off an arrogant intellectual superior vibe but I try not to do that. At times I want to post something about how I need someone to talk to but I know it will only hurt people’s opinion of me as being a loner and whiny but I can’t keep being lonely. I need friends but I can’t ask for friends because it will only in turn make people not want to be my friend....if that makes sense. I’ve been stuck in thought about this terrible cycle I’m in but there’s nothing I can do but hope for a person to come along that I really connect with and we become friends but I haven’t had that ever since I moved to this new state in 2016. I just need advice, I’m tired of acting like nothings wrong. I’m tired of not having  a friend group, I’m tired of not feeling good enough because I know I am.

548,liamr1998,1571968958,2,"Just to clarify  I'm writing this for myself, for a way to get it of my chest. I need to express my feeling in a way people to people who don't know me, therefore they hopefully wont judge me.

So for a bit of context I'm 21 man and I have been having an ongoing battle with depression and anxiety, mixed with my aspergers for over 10 years now due to difficult childhood and bad upbringing. Living with two mentally unwell parents did not help as they were constantly in their own battle. From this regard I was already alone. As they would go in and out of hospital, I went in and out of care and never had a consistent life. So for a long time now I have been alone, until my sister was eventually born.

My whole life I have been lonely and over the past few years my life has picked up a little bit. I am quite close with my younger sister and my mum has gotten better. I  now even had a group of friends finally after so many years struggling to fit in. I even had hookups and short encounters with women but neve had a proper girlfriend per say. All my friends back at home have girlfriends other then me, they all did things as couples leaving me out most the time. Even if I was with my friends I felt alone even though I wasnt.

Due to my already current issues, I really lack self esteem and confidence in myself. I am always other thinking everything. I always think of the worst. I do try not to think this way but it is so difficult not too. This really hinders my dream of meeting someone, building a relationship with someone and falling in love. I finally in life want to have a proper personal, intimate significance in someones life. I have never had this before and  it's something I really want to happen one day

Anyways due to my life getting stale after college I really had no idea what to pursue as a career. I took three years off just working and I hated it. So I made the decision to go to university to start to try and kickstart my life. To better myself and improve my self esteem and confidence. To meet new people and try to feel wanted. For sure I have made many many friends already and have had a brilliant time so far. But I am finding it so difficult being away from home, away from my friends at home and my family. I really like it here and all but I feel so alone even amongst my new friends. I often feel invisible and sometimes dont even feel alive. Some days I just stay in bed and do nothing cause depression and anxiety dictates my life. 

Today I feel so alone I want to cry and for my life to end. I have had enough of the feeling. These emotions have heightened because of what happened last night. I had a one night stand, for the first time in 15 months, which feels like forever. It was a uni social and I was very drunk so was she and we hit it off well and had sex which was great. For that moment I loved the company, I felt alive and wanted. It was fab, by all means I obviously caught some kind of feelings not necessarily for her but for the company and for the fact she made me feel not lonely. Of course one night stands come to an end the next day we wake up and lay in bed cuddling for a few hours chatting it was really nice, but the moment after she left it hit me. The loneliness. I havent felt more shit in a long time. I haven't had an intimate moment like that in a very long time, it was so refreshing and I am craving more. I haven't dated or really spoken to any girls for a long time due to my confidence, self esteem issues. To be honest I'm shocked she even got with me in the first place.

To conclude I'm a very confused person. I really dont understand my emotions or feelings that well at all. Life is an ongoing battle and I am sure one day things will improve and I wont feel lonely anymore. I have to keep strong, as that is all I can really do.",lonely,Never felt more alone,2019-10-25 13:02:38

556,hamartiated,1571965612,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

569,LonelierThanGreen,1571959410,1,"It’s weird right? That I can be surrounded by so many people and yet still feel lonely.

I’m three months into a new job, my probation is next week and I’m not worried cause it’s clear to me that everyone at work fucking loves me.

Yet here I am, lonely. 

I have friends that message me on a daily basis that ask me how I am, how I’m feeling and yet here I am, lonely. 

I dunno, I just feel like something is missing.

And then the guilt! I feel guilty that I feel so lonely despite deep down a part of me says, LonelierThanGreen just look! Look at your network, people care! People are there for you! 

Somehow though, I just feel lonely.

I wonder if it’s something to do with the fact I’m gay, and I’m in my 30s though I’ve never had a relationship. 

Sex sure, flirtations sure - but I’ve never had a guy I could say ‘that’s my boyfriend’. It’s not anyone’s fault but my own either - I’ve had advances, I’ve had offers but I’ve always turned them down.

‘I need to lose weight first’ ‘I’m not worth your time’ ‘you don’t know the real me’.

I’m my worst own enemy, except with a true enemy at least I’d have them to keep me company. 

It’s hard, not knowing what’s wrong with me but also simultaneously knowing that I’m what’s wrong with me. 

I bumped into an old friend from high school yesterday, and he’s been happily married to his partner for 10 years. He asked about me and my life and we parted ways with his words of ‘don’t became that lonely old man, who sits alone in the pub that wishes he did things differently’ and yet here I am.

My question for you fellow loners ( not making fun of you or anything, just felt like saying that :} ) is this : 

Can someone deal with their personal shit on their own ? Can someone who is sunk deep inside the abyss of his insecurities ""swim"" himself out on his own or is he/she destined to search for someone to save them ? 

I am lonely just like most on this sub and it pains me.
I have insecurities that were cultivated through all of my life ( 19 years old male btw ) and they pain me .
I lack confidence in myself and i feel miserable most hours of a day even though i have friends and a parents that can economically support me ( they lack the affection type of support though ) . 
I see people in my age asking for food and money on the subway because society and everyone has abandoned them, and i think to myself : are my ""problems"" really that serious ? I have so many chances in life and yet i spent of my time inside my head worrying about this or that . 

I just wondered tonight : will be able to overcome all this by myself , quietly in my room reading my books in order to improve my intellect and working my body in order to be healthy and good looking . Will i be able to make something of myself and stop wasting this gift that's called life which was bestowed upon me ?

572,Withered_Rose,1571954822,3,"I'm 17 years old and I'm currently at the hospital having some tests done. I'm here since wednesday morning, I'm alone in a room with 3 beds, so for me, a shy boy that likes to be alone it's great. 

Later at about 6-7pm to my room came a new patient, a girl, and I already get all nervous and tense(I don't think that putting male and female in our age in one room is a good thing), when the nurse said to get to know each other(name) I immediately froze, she was the first one to reach out hand to me(last year I spend in a school with mostly males, I've seen there only about 6 girls so my contacts with females are not existential, even despite changing school where now there are more females than males I still haven't talked to one more than few seconds). She chosed the bed next to the window, mine is next to the wall so there is one bed between us.

When she ended preparing everything around her she begun a conversation with me. We are actually the same age and go to the same school, we then talked about plans after school, hobbys and few other things. My responds are mostly short sentences and when I'm nervous I tend to slur a lot so few of my words were barely recognizable.

Before going to sleep she shared with me some stories about her previous hospitals visits, I only listened because it was my first time in the hospital so I couldn't share any story with her(that made me a little sad, though I don't think I would share a story with her because of mine shyness).

At the morning next day it was already certain she's going to leave at around 1pm and I had to do a few tests in the morning and noon so I couldn't spend much time with her. At 11am my mother visited me and I got even more nervous around both of them. After my mom left I had to do the next test, it was somewhere around 12:20pm. 

When I came back to the room she was already gone and that's when it hit me, loneliness, it was the first time in my life where I felt sad of being lonely, before that I always preffered to be left alone, but this time it was painful experience. Whenever I thought about her or looked at the bed she occupied just this morning the tears were coming to my eyes, but I always stopped them from falling down. 

Later my mother visited me again and it was very hard to be around her, it was hard to hide the tears forming in my eyes, but they kept coming as I was thinking about her all the time. Later when my mother left I couldn't keep it and I just cried.

After that I no longer felt that loneliness I felt before, tears were no longer coming, it was just like I came back to my old self. But I kept thinking about her, I even tried to find her on Facebook but to no avail, I have a hard time remembering what her face looked like which angers me because I may not recognize her in school, where I would really like to find her(when casually walking in the corridors). But somewhere deep inside me I think that she actually think about me as a weird person(she even has a reasons to think that, I really showed that during our conversations) and I'm pretty scared of meeting her. I have even started fantasizing about her visiting me tomorrow(that's bad, right?)

I would really like to know why I felt sad when I was thinking about her(and why I stopped after crying), why I want to see her face and hear her voice again and why do I keep thinking about her?

I think this informations may be important: I've never ever been in a relationship with anyone and never was interested in being in one(I don't think I could be in one, my social skills are nonexistent and I'm scared of being around other people), I think that I'm asexual and aromantic.",lonely,"Why do I keep thinking about her, and why does it hurt so much?",2019-10-25 09:07:02

I'm 21 and, as the title says - a gay dude. It even feels weird classifying myself as that, because being one is a stigma in my country (Lithuania, hi). For those reasons, I've had to distance myself from everyone - family, some friends, even myself. It's easier to pretend i'm straight and I've gotten so good at it - I became pretty detached from that part of me, i blur out my sexuality only when it's important, people are outing me or i just feel comfortable talking about it. Anyway. Last year something changed. It was subtle at first, a glance, a look, an awareness of a first-year. He did not stand out in any way, not to anyone else, but there i was, thinking of him sometimes. I'm active in my university community, so  people know me and i know them, so through people, in about 3-4 months I started gathering info about that first-year (freshman?) and from observing him theorized he's probably gay too. But whatever - we didn't talk, there was no point to try even. In my mind, I shouldn't even try dating, as long as i'm depressed (diagnosed, not by myself lol) because that's just needless baggage for another person to take into too - so i try to stray away from \*feelings\*  
Summer came, i went abroad to earn some cash, so not to be such a burden for my parents, as i lived in a bigger city and i left my family in a pretty small one.  I thought getting out would be a cool idea - changing the scenery, earning cash, networking, all the good stuff. Also, i tried to smother all my feelings for him, because he definitely was not the first I had to do that.   
So i come back. I see him sometimes - feel nothing. Good.  But as the month progressed, i bumped into him more and more, we played pokemon go a few times around the city. Shared some memes. All that happened in a span of two weeks. And i broke, broke, broke like i never broke before. Out of nowhere he is on my mind,  left and right, i can't stop thinking about him.... as my 3rd year goes, he's doing his 2nd year and i'm helping him as much as i can. We both text each other on the daily now. Memes, jokes, simple stuff. And we dance around the idea of us , as in US TOGETHER, not touching it directly, but letting know that none of us know how to behave in a relationship, what to expect and, quote : ""not wanting to burden the other person by our needs""  
Yeah, cool, whatever, i'm not searching for anyone, i'm not worth of being with but i have never cried myself to sleep before, that's how lonely i feel, how lonely i know he is and how this whole thing is going nowhere. We meet one or two times in a week, since we are in a dance group for a special dance ball. And i feel like trash if I don't create an interesting or funny conversation for him to giggle or smile to. Always a funny joke, something  SOMETHING to just see that damned smile, just to reassure myself that he even sees me, that he knows i care....  


Last sentences were written with tears in the eyes, I don't even know what i wanted to say. I guess something i could never tell him. He deserves someone who can understand him and himself, not a depressed dude. I hope he'll have a fulfilling life, smiles and reliable friends. I just wish i could help him, make him smile more.... This is my first post so i guess sorry for making it long...

We are in a car going to F1's house to study. Her parents, us and her sister were there.

F1 and F2 were talking and laughing
Me: was feeling left out and decided to ask ""hey what are you guys talking about?""
F1 and F2: oh we'll tell you later (they never did)
F1's sister: why are you guys not letting her join the convo?
F1 and F2 talks to me for a bit then proceeds talking to each other again

Felt so humiliated that her sister noticed that i was being left out. Also felt sad that i was being left out. I felt like a loser. I regretted ever joining that study group. Would have had a better night if decided to stay home.

610,aposekoko,1571910155,4,"There's this girl that used to be close with me. She was there when I was in my lowest point. She listened to all my shit. I was very closed person and don't trust people so I rarely talk to people. I was really insecure but yet I opened myself to her. We would always hangout and having lunch together. We would texting so long for days about stuff she likes or my struggle. I liked listened to all her rants and her talk about her favourite bands. There was time my insecurity really get into myself. Makes me wonder if it's okay to be this open to other people, have I been a good friend, did I talk too much, is she really consider me as a friend, am I boring. I kept having this thoughts which kinda destroying me. And then I developed feelings for her.

I was in denial that I had feelings for a long time and since I have this constant overthinking, it became toxic for me. I knew I could've just move on, but I valued our friendship so I decided to being honest with her. I thought that if she decides to leave, it's okay. I asked if we're okay after this (confession), she said, yeah, as long as you never hope for more. Tbh, there was time I imagined if I had chance, but I always knew that I never have. So, I was always mad to myself everytime my mind has a glimpse idea if we could together, that's why it was toxic for me. I trusted her and she said she won't see me at the time because it was a lot for her, and I understand. And then, for the rest of summer break this year, we never meet or talk again. 

New semester started around three months ago, we got to the same class even in same task group. I thought it'll be okay, but I was too naive. I don't blame her but I don't regret my decision to confessed. Everytime I try to talk to her, her respond always cold, just short answers or stickers that got me stuck. She only texts me to do the group's task. I know this would happened, but even with expectations, it's still hard to get through. Maybe she acts like that because she thinks that she would lift my hope. Like ""if with just being friend, she had crush on me, better to act cold"". Something like that.

The worst part is we have the same circle of friends and everyone know how close we were and no ones know about the confession. So, when our friends talk or ask about her, I couldn't help but act that we still close. And I still trust her that she will never talk about the confession.

Also, her birthday is coming, and I was planning to give her a gift because last year, I said I would gift her a present, but I don't know what to do. Her cold act starting to gets me and I started to overthink again. Should I just cut her off ? I'm bad at letting go. Is it best to just focus at myself and try fix it later ? Should I try to confront her ? I don't wanna annoy her. Could it be that she thinks that I lied to her so she despise me ? Idk man.

Growing up, I was a fairly bad looking kid,pretty asymmetrical face, was a little chubby and had low self-esteem which caused my social ability to suffer. As a result my quality of life was overall bad because when you're put in this situation you just don't have positive experiences throughout life and they shape who you become.

There was a period in my life between the ages of 18-19, straight after high school and in my first year of University where I changed dramatically, I'm not sure how it happened but it was only for this period of time. I was very healthy in every aspect for this short period of time (physically, mentally and spiritually); girls were giving me attention and people were generally treating me better despite be saying and doing the same things I had done prior to this change. Now I know this is not anecdotal because I've really thought about what the differences were in these situations, and it all came down to looks. 

All I can say for certain, is I had my braces (teeth) removed during this period and my asymmetrical face became a healthy square jaw, I was going to the gym regularly and had low body fat and was well rounded in all aspects.

This slowly changed and I'm not sure why... My sleep quality deteriorated from age 20-21 (3-4 hrs of sleep a night, heart palpations etc) and I couldn't go gym or take care of myself as much because I was very frail during this time. During this time, you can imagine how difficult it was to not get the support I needed from those around me, and I believe it is because I was not the healthy ideal person you would want to be around as I was during this brief period of time.

Currently I'm 22 years old and living life very safe, not drinking, eating clean and keeping exercise extremely moderate (if at all) because I'm afraid of going through the nightmare I went through in the past. 

I don't get treated as well as I did during that year, the best year of my life. And even that year was filled with self-doubt and asking my friends if I was ugly with my newfound courage to ask them that, all it did was push everyone away as I fell back into my depressive tendencies very quickly.

I don't know. I live life rationalizing it as my own shortcomings and being negative, but even the times I am positive I receive disgust in response, not outwardly but I can feel it.

I'm pretty religious at times. Don't want to talk about that AT ALL. But its relevant for the next part.

I started watching porn when I was younger. about 4 or 5 years ago I started talking to women online, sometimes sexually. I just feel so absurdly lonely that I don't know how to deal with it. I just want to feel a connection with someone.

I got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperienced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect. When seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I literally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty womans voice tell me im not a horrible disgusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself.

In an absolute perfect i would be looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embarrassment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word. Like she would be EXTREMELY kind and caring towards me without being condescending, but just truely wanting to help me get comfortable with sexuality.

A more realistic senario is that I just wish I could find a cute woman to voice chat with about sexual topics, and share porn we like with each other or masturbate while talking about stuff. I'm not likely to find that either.

Anyways, thanks for reading my rant",lonely,I have all this bottled up shame and frustration and I just want to scream!,2019-10-24 12:18:33
636,BurtBobain94,1571879493,1,"I can, it was the 7th grade young me had just started to gain an attraction towards girls. But one stood out amongst the rest. This blonde blue eyes goddess with the most infectious smile drove my middle school self insane. I became infatuated with her. I first started out just stating at her not knowing what to do as these feelings were new to me. But one day I had enough of my prepubescent balls to get up and talk to her. And before I knew it despite my tremendous anxiety I found myself talking to her and finding out we had a lot in common. From there we became friends. My first if only 4 females friends in my life. We shared many laughs and good times with each other. I distinctly remember talking to her on the bus when she playfully started drawing on my face with her pencil. I smiled saying ""does my face look like a piece of paper to you?!"" She in turn smiled with her pearly whites teeth and piercing blue eyes reflecting off the light of the day.Ice never felt such profound love for anyone then I did in that moment. it was as wholesome as it gets. It felt like as if me and her where on a crash course forwards each other. It seemed we were perfect for each other. She filled me with such joy and euphoria of which I still have not felt again to this day with any woman. Alas you know this has to end badly.this is an r/Lonely post after all. So the 7th grade Halloween dance comes along. It's 2013 and Batman Arkham origins just dropped and I was off to my first and even though I didn't know it at the time last school dance of my life.I went to the dance dressed as James bond. Complete with a bowtie and Rose in my right vest pocket with my hair all nice and gelled up of course. I looked great.I arrived and saw her in the crowd almost immediately. I was blown away by her beauty. She was a cat. Yes that's rather boring. But the prepubescent kid I was got blown away by something different this time. Her costume was a onesie that cut of at her torso and she had pantyhose on with high heels. I saw in her for the first time not just her beauty but her sexuality. I found myself even more enthralled with her. Not only was head over heels in love with her. Now I lusted for her.i don't know what happened but seeing her dressed like that in that moment surrounded by the whole grade I just couldn't make a move. I found myself at a load for words and completely socially stunted. Why all of a sudden I can't talk to this girl. When we've been good friends for over a year now. So I just sat in the bleachers completely mortified at the thought asking her to dance like my original intent was. But eventually a slow song came on and I painfully forced myself o approach her. Every step I took towards her filled me with an ever increasing sense of dread and overwhelming anxiety like I've never felt before. Then there I was standing before this goddess of mine. She looked at me gave me that trademark heart melting smile and greeted me. I exchanged greetings forcefully and proceeded to ask her to dance with me. (It should be noted that this was my first time ever asking a girl to do anything romantic with me)I started off saying.(l""hey Annabel you mind if I have this....."" Nothing. I said nothing. My mind and mouth just ceased to produce words and I froze in perpetual fear right in front of her and her friends. She inquired saying ""mind if you have what?"" Multiple times but all I could out was stuttering garbage.aftet a minute of this she simply walked away. I sat back down at the back of gym and felt the weight of the whole world crash on my shoulders. I felt sad,ashamed but for the first in my life I felt pathetic.just one week later Annabel would get her first boyfriend and I would never have her as my own. This devastated me as I would cry myself to sleep at night constantly at the thoughts of my profound failure. I would retract from speaking to girls almost entirely from fear of getting hurt again and this still persists to this day.Now I'm  18 years old and I'm in the army. Yet this event which happened so long ago was the first domino in my descent into a Lonely,bitter and sexually frustrated adolescence. And I don't see that changing anytime soon. Sometimes when im alone with my thoughts in bed at night. I still miss her. If only she knew how much she meant to me.",lonely,Can you travel your shortcomings to a single event in your life?,2019-10-24 12:11:33
637,quinn12044,1571879365,3,"So I have a couple decent friends even though  its really only about two who actively talk to me, and its those two friends whose new favorite joke is to  put me into the ground. They either interrupt me by telling me to shut the fuck up then when I try to talk again they do the same thing. Its not like I am intterupting them while talking, I wait my turn to speak. Or they wait until I finish and make fun of what I said or my stutter that happens sometimes. Another big thing is I have a bit of a bad temper and they seem to endlessly purposely annoy me and make me mad for their entertainment. I am am really stressed by school and I just want to have fun with my friends, but that rarely happens any more. Its only me they do this to and not anyone else in my friend group.

638,hamartiated,1571878720,4,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-10-24 11:58:40
639,DudeImHonestlySad,1571877607,12,"So I saw that post and I was actually thinking about something like that earlier.

Even though I go to a relatively small school, the lunch room is always crazy full so there really is not ""sitting alone"". Anyway, I've been sitting in this one area all 4 years and I know everyone at the table, their names at least. It kind of hurts when they're all talking and being bros and doing whatever and if I try to say anything nobody answers. Nobody responds. They just completely ignore me.

Sometimes, idk how it happens, but different people than normal start sitting there. Last week this kid that I thought was my friend was there and the tables kind of crowded so I was trying to sit down somewhere and just eat. Not even talk or anything. But this asshole thinks it's funny or cool or okay or whatever to just push my food whenever I try and put it down because apparently someone else was going to sit there?

Maybe this is warped looking from the outside. I have a hard time making friends in this context, because it's hard to become friendly with individuals when particular hyper-social people always have to dominate group conversations, whilst not really contributing everything anything of value.

Anyway, the pain has become too much. I'm actively working on building my life, and I've come a long way in the past few years, from starting a business and trying to make that successful to moving into my own place, it hasn't been easy and i've had a lot of problems with family (narcissists, etc.) but i've been holding steadfast and working really hard to not succumb to depression and loneliness and shut down, break down, or kill myself at worst.

What has been really hard to shake has been this indescribably difficult feeling of loneliness that i get that seemingly comes out of nowhere. It's to the point where it's a very visceral physical feeling in my chest area and it wells up inside me and actually makes my heart ache and tears fill my eyes whenever I feel it. Part of this is that i really feel like i want a girlfriend, someone to love, have sex with, to hold and to cuddle. I'm so touch deprived it's not even a joke, and sure it's kind pathetic but this is my life - this is where i'm at. I've considered going to a hooker to just cuddle, no joke, or maybe even to have sex as well, but i haven't gone that far down the rabbit hole thank fuck. Over the years i've actively tried to get a girlfriend, I've done almost everything - started lifting, hitting the gym, eating better, tried to have a positive outlook, looked up rsd and pickup videos and approached HUNDREDS of women and tried to be my best self in these interactions. it has only led me to more loneliness and basically no results. the most i've had is minor very short lived hook-ups, funnily enough never from approaching women on the street but through other means. the last extremely short lived hook up being over a year ago which is why i'm really feeling that lonely pang and that i want to cuddle with a girl or at least be with a woman again.

i feel worthless, dejected, unwanted, basically subhuman. when i think about the idea that maybe no one loves me and that perhaps i am unlovable and truly just unattractive it really hurts me and makes me well up with tears. its fucked. for the longest ive been saying, ok i need to sort my shit out, no more watching porn (i'm addicted). time to do nofap, stop focusing on women and just work on myself for a bit, but inevitably i find myself drawn to the first fucking cute girl that shows me the slightest bit of attention and i end up trying to talk to them, chase them and start a relationship or jsut to maybe get the basic human need of some fucking affection met, and it ALWAYS ends in disappointment and frustration and i feel even worse, even more pathetic, even more like a creep, even more feeling maybe i'm unlovable and just some beta incel or something. it frustrates me that that word gets thrown around to men who are opening up about their genuine needs and emotions, but thats another post for another day. im not really sure what to do. ive tried self improvement and have basicalyl recently just embraced letting the chips fall wehre they may. i'll probably start therapy soon and try to work on this deep sense of loneliness.

oh and a note on friends, i don't know if its just me but I have friends, and i do hang out with them from time to time, maybe not as much as before because ive been working so much, but i do, and i go to events and stuff and meet new people and be social and happy and shit, even talk to my friends on the phone and in person about my depression and how i've been feeling. it basically does not even dent the loneliness i feel. i don't think this is something that can be cured by just having a nice social life, but maybe by having a girlfriend, that i can be intimate with. even then, that might not work. but it would sure as shit help a lot.

i'm tired. i fear that this loneliness might be the death of me pretty soon.",lonely,"deep, inescapable loneliness",2019-10-24 07:26:20

I am also visiting sport clubs but nobody intressting there so far. 
My problem is that the more time passes, the more I realise that those ""friends"" I've made are not my kind of people: they hate studying and love partys/binge drinking (i dislike both, and also I'm don't drink any alcohol). To a certain level this isn't a problem, since I've developed my tactics to hide it and bled in (i know this isn't the best thing to do, but just because I'm rather introverted, that doesn't mean I don't want to take part at social life). Just today was a key event: after partying until 4 am, getting super wasted  &amp; cheating on her bf one of those ""friends"" managed to get up and come to university (at 11 am or something), at lunch she then complained about how unnecessary the classes are (we had english classes, her english is utterly shite, she needs those classes) she and everyone else also talked about how cool yesterday was and nobody of them cared about that girl cheating, like it was totally acceptable. I returned home crying. Why? I feel just so alone out here. This whole situation reminds me of the point I've been at a few years ago when everyone started going to partys, exept me.

That’s what I have gathered. The first person I can say for sure that I have have fallen in love with does not love me back. Even though that hurts, what matters to me is that they are happy. This being said I will do all in my power to assure they’re both happy and be a good wingman. Why? Because love. Not hate. I may have not gotten to experience mutual love, but if I can help someone else do that, then I think that’s a really beautiful thing.

Me and the person I fell for are close friends and I have decided I won’t let a good friendship go because I got my feelings hurt. So, what is love?

Love is knowing someone’s flaws and accepting them for who they are despite the ‘imperfections’. Love is accepting that the person you love won’t always love you back. Love is knowing something will hurt you and still going along with it because you know it’ll make them happy.

708,ry_lock73,1571800066,9,"Currently in college and I found myself extremely bored doing the same things over and over again. Life has gotten pretty mundane. I’m not the kind of person that drinks or whatever, so I’ve already lost some sort of potential link to potential friendships. I think a lot and lately I have been thinking about my current status of relationships in my life. I’ve realized that I don’t really have anyone I feel close to, or really appreciates me or anyone who’s company I can appreciate, like a real friend type of thing. And it’s not like I can’t have fun, but I’m usually never in the position to. Usually I’m relatively reserved, but the real me is someone who I think people can have fun with. Like, not a boring person. And it’s not like I don’t take care of myself either, I’m very in shape and make sure my appearance is clean. But I do have a hard time making that first step when it comes to friendships. I’ve realized that a lot of insecurities that I’ve had when I was young still affect me. For some reason, i can’t picture myself approaching someone to get to know them, and them having a positive response or being interested enough to build something. I found some type of “universal” rule that, in order to build relationships, you must go out of your way to find them and to develop them as much as you can. But one thing that really confuses me is that even though I’m trying to, why is no one trying to get to know me or build a relationship with me. I’m a very logical person and whenever I can’t understand the logic of things like this it effects my ability to actually do it. That’s kinda besides the point but, if I were to approach someone and try to talk to them would that come off as weird or am I just overthinking it. And it’s as if, due to my personality, if someone were to, express something trying to say I’m not interested or whatever, I would easily pick up on it because that’s what i expected. Then I would overthink the whole situation and examine what I did wrongs to the extreme. Then this itself would hinder my ability to try again. Idk, this is kinda disorganized but I need some advice.",lonely,"In college, bored, and lonely.",2019-10-23 14:07:46

This is a public service announcement that you don't come out of an eternity of intense loneliness and then instantly turn into a normal, well adjusted person with healthy relationships.

We're still friends but I've become fixated on her in a non-romantic way and I'm starting to a crippling sensation of jealousy that she has better and closer friends than me and that I'm not, like, instantly her best friend.

She's been super cool and so far I haven't ruined it but I need to constantly check myself in order to not smother her.

712,hamartiated,1571796645,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-10-23 13:10:45

I went away last weekend for an old friend's birthday and went for a night out. For some context I'm 21 and have never had a serious relationship although for the last couple of years I've become ""content"" with being solo. Anyway I was out with a big group of friends and most of us took mdma and went clubbing. It's something I've done before but I generally avoid it because my comedowns are really brutal. Anyway there was a girl there who I've been friends with for a few years but she's had a boyfriend for most of the time I've known her, and she recently got with another guy. So I didn't expect anything to come of it, nor did I want anything to. But as soon as we got to the club she wouldn't leave me alone, and kept holding my hands to dance with me and hug me. It was the closest I've been with anyone for years and it fucked me up.

I know it was just the effects of the drugs but it was so intense it's just ruined me. We danced together for hours just staring at each other and kissing each other, not ont he lips. I was blown away by how beautiful she was and she kept saying the same to me. I really wanted to kiss her but I couldn't do it and I'm almost glad I didn't. Anyway this continues for most of the night and everyone there thought something was happening between us. The next day hits and I felt awful. Awful for thinking that she'd actually be interested in me without the drugs and awful for feeling like I'd taken advantage of her. I spoke to my friends about it and they all basically told me to calm my shit and that I'd done nothing wrong but It's still ruining me. I've been talking to her on and off and she's brought up that she's having a party at hers in a few weeks but I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if her boyfriend will be there and if he is It'd kill me. I've never met the guy but I've heard he's a really decent dude and I think it'd fuck me up even more.

Then overtime we became flirty with each other and that's when I decided to try to confess to her just to give it a shot. So I did and...

She said she felt the same way and I was so happy about it. She's my first girlfriend and I'm very happy with her to this day and I've never felt this happy before.

At the moment I’m being a stay at home dad to my boys. I’m in a relationship and yet very alone when it comes to my social circle I guess. I’ve tried this in the past and either get nowhere or after a day or two I’m ghosted so thought I’d give it one last go. I love gaming and being a dad. Big dc and marvel nerd but dc tops marvel every time. I enjoy watching movies and shows and random videos at 2am on YouTube ( not by choice I’m just to lazy to reach my phone lol ) 

Due to a past relationship I’m told I have ptsd and social anxiety and a sprinkle of depression, I try and fight it but I think there right lol 

Not looking for anything romantic I’m happy and still very much in love with my partner. I’m just looking for people I would get on well with and send random memes and have random banter with. Or if anyone knows a discord like that? Miss having friends a night my partner streams games and I’m left on my own which gets you down after a while I guess. 

I have a dark sense of humour and always enjoy a good laugh. I’m good a listening and always up for a joke or to give a caring ear I guess. Maybe that falls under being a good listener lol

756,Ohfunzies,1571734970,5,"I like being alone, introverted, doing things solo. I don’t fear what I look like at the movies alone, or out to eat alone. But lonely is a whole different playing field. I tried to research it, how to get thru, but everything keeps coming up “love yourself first”. Ug! You can love yourself and still feel loneliness. Here’s my many questions/thoughts speeding thru my head. Please bear with me and if you have anything to offer please be my Yoda, Teach me. Thanks. 

So r/lonely world... how do you get thru it? The feeling? 
How do you deal when no one is available to talk? 
When you keep trying to date, but nothing comes of it and you start to wonder if it’s you? 
When you feel hopeful cuz life has been going well, friends have been available, and life is full then suddenly everyone disappears (because they have a life also and life happens)? 
How do you deal when you are losing your best friend? And they don’t wanna talk about it.
How do you deal when you realize you love being alone, but when you need a friend you’ve set it up so everyone things you’re happy solo and don’t need them, and they’ll call you when their life is falling apart cuz at least you listen. (which is generally true, except when you do need them.)
How do you deal when you’re logical and know you’ll make it thru, which is what you tell all your friends cuz it’s the logical truth and so they believe you... but for one moment you want to be that person who is crazy dramatic like the world is ending.  Like for one moment actually have your thoughts match your emotions. 

How does one get thru the lonely feeling? What do you do? 
Ideally long term and learning solutions, I don’t mind pressing thru the storm to learn. I don’t mind a challenge and dealing with cleaning my own crap to get it out of the way for a better future. But, I’ll accept temporary solutions as well, just to get by. 
I’m not easily distracted when loneliness hits. And for the first time my logical side is not helping me get past it. And it sucks. My feelings don’t give a crap what my head says, and I’m stuck, Help.  Thanks.",lonely,Alone is not the same as lonely. How do you get thru the feeling?,2019-10-22 20:02:50

765,VinegaDoppio,1571718701,5,"I wish I cared a lot less about what other people thought about me. Because, to be honest, I'm probably the only person out there who's happy with myself, and proud of myself. I try and act like I'm around very supportive friends and family, but in reality, they are the ones who push me down and tell me I'm not good enough. My self-love borders on narcissism at times, because it has to. Things have to balance out in nature.

I'm in high school and I'm so fucking lonely. My parents hate me having friends, because they think that it's a waste of time and will only detract from my studies. They don't like me chatting to literally my only friend, an online friend, because they think it's a waste of time too and all they do is insult him and call him a loser and an idiot and a weirdo when both he and I will be more successful than either of my parents ever will be.

My plan is to abandon my parents after they fund my education, at the age of 22, after I graduate from university (hopefully in just 3 years; I'm sure I'll hate college as well). They want me to regularly visit them while I'm in university, which I leave for in August 2020. My mom gets excited at the prospect of me regularly returning to the country I'm in currently, an Islamic theocracy. (I am actually American, but they don't like paying taxes, so they gave up their American citizenship and took citizenship of a country which taxes less, and now live in Dubai, which I absolutely despise as a place. It's funny though, because they also fucking hate Islam, but we still live here. Bienvenido a Dubai!!) 

The other day she was saying ""You'll be surprised at how long you'll be spending with us here while in university - like three months in school, two months here in Dubai, three months at school."" etc etc. No, I don't want to spend 4 months a year with you, during which I will lose my mind. I do not want to spend more than two weeks at a time with my family, honestly.

During the times I spend with them, they encourage me not to exercise and try and manipulate or control me if I take the initiative to, and feed me junk food because they can't be bothered to cook. They don't allow me to cook either because ""I'll ruin it"" (even for myself), and because ""men shouldn't cook."" They discourage me from participating in extracurricular activities, like playing the guitar.

I have a natural knack for history, and usually my highest grades are in history despite me never studying for those tests. In fact, they'd probably be even higher if I did study, but my parents get mad if I even study history at home. They don't want me to study it, let alone minor in it. Majoring in it is totally out of the question; I would never do that to myself, anyways.

It's well-known that computer science is one of the higher paying fields out there, especially if you plan to come straight out of college with a bachelor's degree, which I do (I hate learning, and I hate college). In fact, I was planning to study computer science because I'd had quite an interest in it ever since the eighth grade (I'm currently in my senior year of HS), but my parents didn't let me take computer science classes during my last two years of high school because they don't want me to study it in university. At first, I agreed, because I know CS - unlike physics - can easily be picked up in university. My parents instead want me to study engineering. I have slight enjoyment in physics, but not much in engineering. The only reason why they want me to study engineering is so that my mom can tell people that her son is an engineer, as ""computer scientist"" doesn't have much clout among her family. I'd rather study what both makes more money and is a more interesting field to me, however.",lonely,I'm so fucking lonely.,2019-10-22 15:31:41
766,bigpeepeeaura,1571717167,1,"As a middle schooler, it seemed like everything was going in the right direction for me. I had good friends, good grades, and I was extremely passionate about sports and art. Though, when I entered eighth grade, it felt like everything had changed for me. My friends had suddenly turned their backs on me, and being in such a small school, there was nobody for me to turn to. The worst thing about living in a small town was the fact that you are never given the opportunity to meet somebody new. So, instead of doing the sensible thing such as becoming their friend again, I decided to be a loner. This held up for quite a while actually, but I found myself being bullied and excluded because I didn't have friends.

 During that school year, I missed almost 60 days of school. Not because I was sick or straight up ditching, it was because I was depressed, and that is the worst excuse of them all. In March of that year, I moved to a new town that had SO many people compared to my last one. My grades should have dropped much more than they did, but I think that my teachers truly felt bad for me. Hell, I think that they still do. 

Freshman year went a little bit better for me, it was much easier for me to blend into the crowd, and nobody seemed to care for whether or not you're alone. There had been a group of kids I'd try eating lunch with every now and then, but I just never seemed to fit in. So, for the most part, I ate lunch in the restroom. Which yeah, it's kinda gross, but whatever. I think that I'm always going to be that girl that nobody particularly dislikes, but that nobody likes either.

 I've really tried making new friends in this ""new"" town, but even this place is starting to seem small to me. Everything that I do drains all my energy, and I'm so worried that because of that I'm going to miss even more school. I know that I'm only a sophomore in high school, and I know that means I have so much time to figure things out. But is it wrong to yearn for the typical high school cliche of getting into trouble, dating, and even just hanging out with friends?

I don't mean to post this to brag, or to seem like I'm ungrateful, or dismiss the pain if having no friends that I know a lot of people have on this sub, but thought I'd share my story. Long post to get this off my chest. 

I'm 28. Up until 25 I was a real loner, but I was happy. My dog died and I realized that I was lonely so I made an effort to revamp my social life. 

Now, there are 4 guys who I will be best man for if/when they get married. I've got many friend groups. I've got a ton if guys who I play sports with.  I do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and my teammates love me, at a belt promotion I got the longest speech about how great I am as a teammate when most people got a short speech. 

My mental health has always been poor, so if I'm not present for a few weeks, my phone blows up with people reaching out to check on me. 

I can go to a bar, the gym, or a cigar store or whatever and people approach me and talk. I can make new friends at the drop of a hat. I'm the kind of guy people are drawn to, I think I come across as approachable. Any night of the week I can find a way to socialize.

But I feel deeply, cripplingly lonely. There's no one in my life who needs me the way I need them. I miss the companionship that my dog provided, that unconditional, daily love. I've decided it's not right for me to get a dog because I'm too busy and I need to figure out my life, but I've yet to find a human that provides that level of love.

 I had a short relationship that I thought would last the rest of my life (or hers, anyways, she was much older). It crashed and burned, and it's probably for the best, butI miss that tender touch, the texts filled with hearts and kisses. I miss her looking at me with love, I miss her observing me so she could find out everything about me, my eye color (my eyes change color and she loved that), my hair color (I've got pretty crazy naturally multi-tonal hair. Most people see I'm a brunette with blond highlights, but she was fascinated by my hair), my movements, my strengths and my weaknesses. I miss having someone who wanted to explore all of my interests. Now I have sport friends, nerd friends, hiking buddies, drinking buddies, etc but no one who wants to do everything I do just to be with me. 

It's not just that I want a romantic relationship, I definitely do, but I've not been able to meet anyone so into me that they feel like they are living life with me. I don't have a best friend like in the movies to explore life with. I don't have a family who knows or has any interest in learning about me. I fell far from the tree, and I'm a 5th wheel in my own family. 

I hear so many people talk about being happy being single, being happy alone, etc. I don't know how. I've got a ton of hobbies I love, I'm a vibrant person. But every night I go home to a cold bed alone, and no amount of socializing or friends who care make it easier to wake up every morning and not feel empty.",lonely,Anyone else feel lonely in a crowd?,2019-10-22 13:34:59

Along with a ton of advice which all ultimately ends up being to change some fundamental part of you, such as your personality, emotions, clothes, hair, interests, hobbies, etc.

Some of those people probably gave up trying/waiting in person and turned to their strength, the internet. However, as we all know, Tinder and Bumble and any other dating app work terribly. Almost all my matches personally were bots or girls trying to sell their premium Snapchat. The other matches were quickly unmatched before I even got to check who it was. 

So then you turn to Reddit, where you think you'd find your peers, only to be met by either catfish, people trying to take advantage of lonely people and exploit them by pretending to be into them or listening to them, ghosters, or 0 messages from your post on r4r, foreveralonedating, or any other subreddit to find a significant other or relationship. 

You can pour your heart out into your post, or a message you make to someone that catches your eye, and chances are you'll be ignored because that same person got their inbox blown up. 
At this point everything feels futile.

When that doesn't work, people will start to tell you that you don't need anyone, that you should be alone, or my favorite, that there's more than 7 billion people out there and someone is bound to like you. These are usually the same people that are either in a relationship, in and out of relationships, or not in a relationship voluntarily. Then there's the huge net being cast which is basically a cop out, because just because there's that many people doesn't mean there's actually a person for everyone.

The worst thing is, you try to voice this in a nontoxic manner and you're instantly labeled bitte, incel, desperate, you name it. Some people just want to feel wanted.

Went on a few dates with a girl I work with. Unfortunately things just didn’t work out. I didn’t make a move really on the first two dates, because of work situation, and when we got to the 3rd I felt like she just invited me out to put me in the friend zone based on the hints in the conversation.

She turned me down when I tried to follow up on a 4th date by inviting her roommates, and then said she ignored my text and said she was tired when the time of the date came.

I’ve decided to just start ignoring her and our group chat. I really like her, but I have enough friends that I barely keep up with, and conversing with her hurts knowing that it’s not going to happen. I was just really hopeful that something would work. We have such similar interests and I just guess that in those moments  together I grew to attached.

I’ve been focusing on lifting, yoga, and running. Those are the things that make me feel at least a little happy, even if it’s only for a few hours. 

But at night when I have nothing to do but sit in my room. I feel absolutely terrible. I’ve had trouble sleeping as well over the past two weeks and lay awake sad.

Yeah I know I sound silly getting attached so quickly, but we did know each other for a while at work. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a girlfriend, and this whole summer when I was out doing stuff I just wished I had a partner by my side to share the moments with.

I’m not incapable of getting girls, or establishing a relationships that’s hard for me. I’ve been hurt two other times this year when girls Ive hooked up with didn’t want to go further than that one night.

Basically I’m just sad, and I’ve been really going through it the two weeks. Sucks I got so attached so quickly. No contact is going to be rough.

I want her to not just have sex with me, but to desire me. To feel craved. When we do make love, everything must be just so (lights, towels, mints, time of day, silence). I have to initiate everything and it leaves me feeling so... tolerated. Theres no room for spontaneousness.  I never get the feeling that she's crazy about me anymore. More than anything, I want her to want those things too. I get that we all have different ways of feeling and showing love. I tried figuring hers out. I've given little everyday gifts, spent good quality time with her, given her verbal praise, showed physical affection, and done acts of service around the house for her approval.

802,Colourneutrality,1571691717,6,"First I have to tell a little bit about myself. I have always been an introvert. I think I realised that already in the kindergartern. I got involved in sports when I was 12. I really liked doing sports and in couple of years I got really addicted to it. I trained like 5 times a week or more and wanted to become a professional athlete.

Now I'm 17 and I had a bit of a low point in sports so I took couple of months off to reconsider my goal of becoming a professional athlete. In this down time I realised that I haven't made any serious friendships or relationships. I had been always just studying for school or done training. I have changed schools two times to study subjects that I want and I realised that I don't talk to anybody from my old schools. No strong friendships were made. 

So after I had thought about it I decided to hang out more with my current classmates to make a stronger bond. It's been fine with the boys. We been going to parties on weekends and I get along really well with couple of them who I also talk to outside the school on almost daily bases.

Now here comes the problem. When I started talking to the girls then they got freaked out by me. I spoke to couple of girls from my class and after a while I got a message to my facebook from one of them saying that I should stop trying to talk to them because I'm freaking them out. I'm still really confused what I did wrong because in my mind I politely asked if they would be willing to go out with me. I even said that I want to go out as friends to chill and not on a serious date.

That's how I see it. In my mind I was really polite. I asked them out playfully because I was trying to be fun but it seems that they misunderstood me and now think that I'm a creep. I guess my attitude change was maybe bit to sudden for them. I have always been quite a dull guy and I tried to be more open. The girls say that I have changed when I stopped doing sports but not for the better.

Now I'm sad, disappointed and angry at the same time. I'm sad because I feel that my reputation has been ruined in school. Although I was quiet and introverted my opinions and words were respected. Now people don't listen to my opinions that much. I'm disappointed that I was misunderstood that badly and I'm also disappointed in myself that I didn't know how to explain myself better. I'm also angry at myself for that reason. I'm also angry at the fact that it's the one time when I try to talk to people and they turn me down.

I don't even know if there is any point in making an apology or trying to explain myself because I'm afraid that people will again misunderstand me and that I will only make it worse. I don't know if it even matters anymore because my reputation is ruined anyway.

I guess I just comes down to the fact that I haven't done much communicating and socializing in the past.

I wish could see this story from other angles but I guess I can't if people involved are not even willing to talk to me. I would like to at least understand what I did wrong.

Maybe I'm just overdramatizing this for myself and in couple of years looking back I would just laugh at this but at the moment I feel depressed as fuck and I it's good that I can write this of my chest.

Happiness is real when shared and I have no one to share this experience with. I’ve went from alone to isolated. I tried going out and had a few dates, but nothing feels right.

817,sabucoush,1571674966,5,"Dear beloved ex, 

I am writing this to you, in case you ever get hurt by your new partner, and you need to walk the path that I walked to find answers to the deadly pain that you caused me, this is for you. Please feel free to look into my account and see how much I have wrote telling strangers my story of you. 

You were much stronger than me. You ended this relationship and never looked back. Which is something I wouldn’t have done. You know, if it wasn’t for you to take action, we would still be in this loop and I will always find my way back to you somehow, as I always did. Well, I should be grateful that your tough heart didn’t have mercy on my poor soul begging and pleading to you. As it’s been 7 months and I still cling to you, I am doing much better than ever. I had the courage to do all the things that I never had the courage to do. I think the bliss of the breakup was inevitable. We both know that an homosexual interacial long distance relationship would have never worked, My heart had brought to my knees to you. I was tortured by your social media several times a day. I stalked and a stalked your friends. I googled the shit of all of you. I counted the likes and comments just to rest my brain. My brain.. that of which had been my number one enemy. Let me tell you about it, ever since you decided that I no longer part of your world, my brain started all the scenarios of you with someone else. I even imagined how would your child look like. I lived in the past day dreaming of you singing to me that perfect night telling me that you love me, and I have also travelled in time to the future where you have become a mother. The pain is indescribable. And to cure my rushing thoughts I tried every imaginable thing that I could pathetically think of. I have meditated to get you back. I prayed to God just to fix this issue. At the beginning, I wanted Karma and revenge so bad. I craved justice to be served and let the tables turn. Then, I just wanted relief of the pain at all cost. I just wanted peace with myself. I only had one wish, to go back to the person I was before I met you. I wanted to be the person who never cared. I have come to the conclusion that indeed, ignorance is a bliss. I would rather not know what you are doing and who are you with. I stopped hanging out around lovers, I stopped porn, I had to cure my depression with basics. I cut off all triggers. All social media. I deleted my apps. I was scared to look at you page. Because it always had something painful. I can literally say, I was more hurt after the breakup that while dating you. You have successfully hurt me so bad to the point of numbness. After 7 months of you completely acting like I have never existed, my brain and heart were at your feet beginning for closure. They were my enemies. They showed me all sorts of hell whenever I thought, maybe, just maybe you are missing me? No. The anxiety attacks, the emotional waves, my shattered pieces of self and confidence dropped bottom rock. I lost myself and soul gambling it to you. I never thought you were so cruel and savage to me? Did I deserve this from you? I never thought that cute face held so much harsh attitude towards someone who once loved. You know I fell for you ever since I met you. You knew my feelings. You used them against me. You were the stronger partner and I salute you for that. You had the upper hand and the control and power. I was madly in love to function. I was making decisions with my heart while you used your logic and you won. The after math was the disaster. I starter my research journey. I began to question my self worth, I joined support groups, I met people, discuss with spiritual guides, I started to compare our story to every experience I found. You were the main star. And the pain was getting greater. I tried rebound. I couldn’t. Even when I ran away from reality, I started to see you with him in my nightmares. I woke up crying from my 6 hours sleep that I could get. My fears and true self were revealing themselves to me in my sleep when I am  defenseless. I felt I am being tortured by this love that the only thing I wanted so bad. Your love destroyed my being. While I only wanted to build something beautiful with you my princess. I failed this relationship. I started to join sports clubs to get over you. I met many people only. I sext them. I told them all about the fantasy kisses that I dreamed of performing with you. I felt a bit better, but still..I am still not done. I knew that you would eventually leave and you are the “grass is greener” mentality kind of person and  I am sure you are the type of person who needs to show off to family and society. So my needy and clingy fears manifested my painful situation today. I couldnt believe you would ever be mine. Maybe it’s my karma for having a friends with benefits while we were in distance relationship and you couldnt care less about me? When you had you studying and business and clubs ahead of me? I am paying the price of that mistake. But I swear to the Almighty God I never intended to cheat. It was just a waste of time and I loved you above all. My heart was with you. But you weren’t here.  That person had given me the attention I wanted. I never liked him anyway. I cut off him too as he could have been the reason of this karma loop. I only cared about having you the most. I lost you.  And ever since, Everything else just became wortheless when I lost you. And finally, I just had the courage today to untag my self from the first and one picture of you and me when I visited you a year ago from your social media account. It was the last straw, that whenever I missed you, I would open my tagged photos and look at it. Well, no more. I used to know when you changed your privacy settings just by checking that picture as I am not following you and your profile is public, so I could tell. Anyhow, thats all for tonight.  :)",lonely,"After 7 months of tough ending, I finally had the courage to let go of the last straw of this painful relationship.. my hope",2019-10-22 03:22:46

828,bakingstones,1571656054,1,"First time posting.. I\`m a little drunk and kind of over the same scenarios constantly reoccur in my life. I thought of writing about it for a bunch of like minded strangers to read in the hopes that it would maybe help ease the load. I am a 26 year old with a stable career and a successful side career as a music producer. I had a very rough patch between 17-23 with heavy drug use, homelessness, toxic relationships and plenty of self hatred. I managed to get a hold of my life a few years ago and everything career related has been going great but it all feels like it means absolutely nothing without anyone to share it with. . My last relationship ended about 5 years ago now.. I let my old trust issues get in the way and became someone that I could not recognize. Controlling, manipulative, jealous and scared.. I haven\`t been able to connect with anyone ever since. There has been opportunities where I self sabotage because I thought I wasn\`t ready to expose myself again and there has been scenarios where I have misread the situation and gave myself false hope that led to some pretty brutal disappointments thus turning me in to a colder and more distant, hopeless version of myself. I misread yet another interaction last weekend that has made me realize how lonely and broken I feel again... I got a lift from a bunch of randoms going up to a party that I was playing at. Among these people, there was this girl I will call 'L'. She was wonderful, she lived a few hundred meters up the same street that I live on and we got on like a bloody house on fire. I spent most of the drive up talking to her about our aspirations and where we see our lives going. I noticed how much I had missed being so open with someone and how easily the conversation flowed. Once we got to the party I gave her some space to do her thing as I went about my own. We had a wonderful Saturday night and split ways. We got talking on social media a few hours later and talked for hours about things we wanted to do together and agreed we\`d soon have a drink together where I planned on explaining my intentions for the sake of clear &amp; direct communication. She was also very interested in my music and wanted to know whenever I had a local gig so she could come along. I thought it was finally happening, I could let my guard down again and maybe find some joy after a long time.. I was wrong :) I went to have a drink at my local as I usually do after a full on day at work. The outside space was full so as a smoker I decided I\`d go sit at the bench in front of my house and have a couple of drinks there before I got home. As I finished my first drink, I saw her in the car park with another guy. I wasn\`t sure at first, I thought my mind was playing tricks and looking for ways to self sabotage again. I then had a browse through her photos on social media which I am not proud of but which I am glad I did as it turns out she was in a relationship and it was with the guy I saw her with. As devastating as this was, it saved me a great deal of shock and awkwardness that I would experience in person once I communicated my intentions. Did I overthink it? Is my desperation clouding my judgment of character and interactions? Am I worth anything, anyone? Deep down inside I knew it was too good to be true, I always do and maybe that is a part of the problem I don\`t know. I found temporary comfort in alcohol again and here I am. I don\`t expect any advise, any empathy or sympathy.. All I wanted was to get if off my chest and I guess I have now.

That abandonment cuts so deep. Our friends were his friends. I'm a pariah. No longer welcome in the life I helped build, and I don't even have a reason why. 

At 29, my son and I are sharing a bedroom in my father's house. My stepmother has given the other spare bedroom to her son. He doesn't want to be here. But he also has no where else to turn. 

She doesn't want me here. The room I've been shunned to is still called ""the kids room"" for when her grandchildren come to visit. Children who will most likely only get supervised visits. She's showing his lawyer pictures of the house as requested, but my room, shes sharing pictures from before my son and I were here. She's pretending I will just be up and gone in a week, but that's not possible. 

All she talks about is her son and what he's going through. I feel so selfish because I just want to scream, what about me?! He leaves every day. Was gone all last night. With friends. With women. While I'm here, trapped in this room with no one to keep me company. I can text others, when they're not busy. But I crave contact. For the last three years, I've spent every night next to a man who no longer wants me. 

I feel worthless. Discarded. Unwanted. Trapped. I just want to feel loved. I just want to laugh with someone. Hold their hand. Lay my head on their chest. 

My biggest fear has always been being alone. I'm so scared right now. I don't want to sleep because I know Ill wake up tomorrow with no one beside me. I've never felt so alone.",lonely,A whole new low.,2019-10-21 16:02:56

864,hamartiated,1571626855,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Went on a few dates with a girl I work with. Unfortunately things just didn’t work out. I didn’t make a move really on the first two dates, because of work situation, and when we got to the 3rd I felt like she just asked me out to put me in the friend zone based on the hints in the conversation.

I tired for a 4th date, but she turned me down when I tried to follow up on a 4th date by inviting her roommates, and then said she ignored my text and said she was tired when the time of the date came.

I’ve decided to just start ignoring her and our group chat. I really like her, but I have enough friends that I barely keep up with, and conversing with her hurts knowing that it’s not going to happen. 

I’ve been focusing on lifting, yoga, and running. Those are the things that make me feel at least a little happy, even if it’s only for a few hours. 

But at night when I have nothing to do but sit in my room. I feel absolutely terrible. I’ve had trouble sleeping as well over the past two weeks and I just awake sad.

Yeah I know I sound silly getting attached so quickly, but we did know each other for a while at work. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a girlfriend, and this whole summer when I was out doing stuff I just wished I had a partner by my side to share the moments with. 

Basically I’m just sad, and I’ve been really going through it the two weeks. Sucks I got so attached so quickly. No contact is going to be rough.

886,edibdedic007,1571612773,2,"Plus a bit of a rant cause I haven’t talked to anyone in a long time.

I kind of always knew but, I would always have 1-2 “friends” by my side that would change from time to time. They would change every 1-2 years after they (at least how I understand it) get bored of me. I know a lot of people but I am someone who takes friendships seriously, if you treat me like a friend I’ll treat you like one too, same goes the other way.

I had a two year long relationship that failed because even though I had a gf I was so lonely that I started to be the bf who only goes out with his gf and only hangs out with her friend group. She broke up with me saying the bs that is “it’s not you it’s me” even though I knew the real reason. After the break up all of her friends that I actually tried to have a real friendship with (and thought that I did) chose to stop hanging out with me.

Over the last 3 months I have tried to invite anyone to hang out with, some politely declined, some went out but after I notice that they only went out with me to talk about themselves and not actually have a conversation with me I bail. 

Whenever I asked someone (like parents or step brother) for help they wouldn’t get it because they see nothing wrong with me. I was told to go to a psychologist... so I did, for 3 months and from the very beginning my psychologist loved me and the way I behave and after 3 months of tracking my progress (hobbies, Uni and how I try to get new friends) she told me that I don’t need to go again if I don’t want to. I chose to stop, seeing that I truly saw it more as a place to talk to someone than as a place to get help.

I don’t get it, I’m starting to lose hope of finding anyone who would actually treat me like a friend and not as a pity friend. I feel like I am just complaining and that these things will get better with time and that I will meet a real friend, but after you tell yourself these things every time, you start losing hope for it...

3 weeks ago a girl I was talking to sent me a message about how she doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore and it’s left me feeling empty and alone. To give some context on why she stopped talking to me, we had been talking as friends for about 11 months and just before the summer she me asked me to be her boyfriend but I didn’t give her a definitive answer and instead just kinda ignored it and said that I didn’t know what to say her and because of me ignoring it and giving such a shitty excuse she took the blame and kept apologizing and saying that she was in the wrong for asking which made me feel horrible and I never got say sorry to her because after it happened we both just pretended like it never happened. After that we kept talking and at the time I was contemplating suicide because I had lost my reason to live and I felt like it just wasn’t worth living but she made me happy and she was the first person to ever go out there way to talk to me at school and call me a friend, I felt as if there was someone who needed me. To me it feels pathetic that I’m so desperate for friendship but I guess everyone has to have friends or just someone to talk to but anyway we would only really properly talk to each other through message and this is because we where both too awkward to be able to say anything to other and we both would just laugh about it and blame ourselves for being awkward. I had already told her how much our friendship means to me and she said the same and thanked me for talking to her as well. September 26th is when she messaged me saying that she didn’t want to talk to me anymore because she feels like she has wasted her time on me and that she feels like a clown for asking me out. I just don’t know what to do this is the first I’ve ever been in this situation and I don’t if I should try and apologize or just try and get over it but in these past few weeks of not talking to her I’ve realized how much she meant to me as a friend, I’ve spent most of my days just thinking about what I did wrong and what I should do to make things better but I feel like there’s nothing I can do to make her talk to me again.",lonely,I need some advice.

Is it because I immediately text back? Is it because I agree with everything the girl says because I want her to like me? Is it because my interests are too weird? I can’t tell if I’m too open or not enough. I lay in bed at night wondering whether or not I will find someone to share it with one day. 

I just feel with all the mental problems I have from my social anxiety to my debilitating ADHD, none of them want anything to do with me. I feel as if that would be a burden on them and that’s the last thing I want. Should I just focus on myself and hope someone notices me quietly working hard, or should I try harder.

This is my first post on reddit. 

Idk where to start but I'll give you a brief background.   
I'm from a big family with lots of siblings, nieces and nephews but I am the only one from the family who lives in the US. I moved to the USA 7 years ago and am grateful for that. At the time of moving here I never thought I'll be single when I'll turn 33 but here I'm. 

I'm a decent looking guy, I workout regularly and play sports. I'm educated and have a very nice job but I'm kinda shy. Recently I met a woman (31, white) and I liked her a lot, things were going good until she suddenly ended things because of lack of time on her side. 

I'm devastated not only because I really liked her but more because I'm very lonely, I feel like I'll never find someone and since I'm shy, it's very hard for me to start conversations. I don't have anyone I can talk to about these feelings or get a hug. I've friends but most of them all married and those who aren't don't live in the same state.

907,crazyshy1987,1571594925,1,"About a year ago, my social life fell apart. It's not like i've been lonely all my life; i've had very large groups of friends in elementary and the first two years of middle school. But after 7th grade, my family and i moved. Something just triggered me to... put myself in a bubble, and i suddenly wouldn't let anybody in. Even my own family. This ""something"" is when i told them i was suicidal due to my parents fighting all the time, and instead of giving me the love and attention i was trying to ask for, they did the opposite and even beat me up. My parents also almost divorced 3 times in a single summer. So that's one part of this.
What happened next is what brought me here. 8th grade started, and i just moved so i know nobody. Usually, within the first few weeks, i get someone to be interested in me and we become friends. This has happened every single time i move to a new school, which has happened a lot. However, because of this bubble, i guess people could tell that i wasn't a good person? Every night i'd ask myself, looking in the mirror, ""why don't people like me?"" Every morning i'd wake up thinking someone would try to be my friend. But it never happened. Every day, this 13 y/o smart girl who definitely was an interesting and beautiful person would sit by herself at lunch, do all her work on her own, stand in the corner all the time, and always be alone.
Then, we moved again, which was about 6 months ago. I recently started high school, just turned 14, and i hoped, like how everyone always says, that everyone is new so everyone is looking for a friend. Bull. Its been about 3 months since school started, and guess what. I'm still alone. I'm still being ignored, and i still have confidence problems so even if i wanted to ""put myself out there"" i'd fail miserably.
Is it because i'm not incredibly skinny like all the other girls at school? Is it because i know nothing about makeup? Is it because i exist? I just want to be acknowledged. I've been alone for too long now. I just wish i had somebody. My parents will either call me weak or beat me up again. My old friends don't like me anymore because i'm ""too depressing."" My counselors or teachers will just get my parents involved. I just want at least one person to say hi to me in the hallways during break, or hug me when i look like i'm about to cry (all the time), or talk about our favorite tv shows. I want someone to tell me i AM beautiful and i am NOT fat and i AM interesting. I want a genuine caring human being that won't try to ruin my life and fill this hole in my heart. When i cry, i don't even feel anything anymore. The only thing that keeps me from ending it all are my video games.

Then sometimes they will ask ""Whats the matter"" (which is actually very nice of them) but I will just say ""Oh nothing just a bit tired"" and go back to the fake smile.


I do this because I don't want to be treated differently. If I told them how I'm actually feeling I feel like a burden to them. Suddenly they dont know how to react. They might feel obliged to ask me to hang out instead of actually wanting to hang out. I'm feeling very lonely but I dont want people to give me attention because they feel like they need to. I want attetion because they like me as a person and are interested in me. Otherwise I would just still feel lonely.

I'm trying to find meaningfull connection and interaction. I take all the opportunitys I get to go out and I also initiate contact with other people. But especially when it comes to meeting girls and relationships so far it's often been pretty superficial interactions and when it comes down to it no one actually seem to be interested in me. Contact always fades out fast. When there are conversations between multiple men and women I quite quickly become an observer instead of an actual participant in the conversation. Even though I ask questions and actively try to participate I never get questions in return and after some time I have no other option left than to just sit and listen.

932,myinternetjournal,1571557808,3,"Hi reddit,
After years of reading reddit threads online, this is my first post ever! Woohoo
Anyways, I’m having kind of a rough time right now. I’m a junior in college at a large out of state university, and I have no real friends. I would probably consider my freshman year roommate to be my closest “friend” here, but I still feel like we’re not really that close. 95% of the time I am the one who initiates us hanging out. I feel like I can’t really talk to her about anything in my personal life. A family member just died last week and I went back home for the funeral and missed three days of classes, and she didn’t even realize that I was gone. 
At the beginning of the year I texted five friends/ acquaintances to ask them if they wanted to hang out or study. Two of them left me on read. One of them and I made plans to get lunch but she forgot about them and I was left sitting in the restaurant alone for like 20 minutes. The fourth one and I actually made plans and hung out, but she made it pretty clear that my invite was out of the blue and that she really only thought of me as an acquaintance. The fifth one also made plans with me, but she cancelled the day of and promised to reschedule. She texted me back a few weeks later and asked me if I was busy, and I got super excited because I thought she wanted to hang out, but she ended up just asking me to babysit her kid instead because all of her other babysitters were out of town. 
I’m currently part of a club, but we only meet every other week. It’s also a club that’s specific to my major, so we usually have presentations or something every meeting so it’s not really the best opportunity to meet/ talk to other people. I also work a lot, and don’t really have the time to join another club or activity. When I’m not in class or working, I just spend all my time in my room. Sometimes I literally go a whole weekend without saying a word to anybody. 
At this point in college, I feel like everybody already has their own friend groups and it would be weird and difficult if I tried to join a new one. 

Anyways, I don’t really know what I’m trying to accomplish by posting this. Its been kind of rough being this lonely all the time and I feel like I just needed to get this out. I’m trying hard to be social and everything, but I feel like I’m just that person that no one really wants to hang out with. I would appreciate any advice from someone who’s been in a similar position :). 

TLDR: I’m a college junior with no friends and despite my best efforts to try to be social and meet new people, it’s not working out. I feel super lonely and sad and am looking for advice",lonely,I’m a junior in college with no real friends,2019-10-20 18:50:08

I have 2 ""close friends"" that I play games with regularly but never talk about anything else. Even though we spend almost everyday talking, I still feel like something is missing. We never talk outside of playing games and never go out either. We know alot about each other because we used to be in the same class and talk outside of games. Having group chats at night and just talking about random things. That lasted for a few years until both of them left school. I've been the only one to stay at school. We never see each other often now and it feels like everything is slowly breaking apart. I have had a talk about this to them but it's still stayed basically the same. I have no other friends at school, just a couple of people that say the occasional hello and pointless small talk. I can't bring myself to properly talk to anyone else because of my social anxiety and lack of social skills in general.

936,Stonewall-hackson,1571553673,3,"Hey sub, long time lurker, first time poster. Let me start off by saying my loneliness is romantic in nature. I’m at a bachelor party weekend with 18 of my friends and I couldn’t be more alone. I literally have over 100 friends, male and female, that all love me (Sorry to those on here reading this that are less fortunate than me, I know a lot of you would kill for that), but I’m 28 years old and have never had a girlfriend and it destroys me. Most people growing up have a dream that involves their career, all I ever wanted was to find a partner and start a family, and it absolutely crushes me everyday that the one thing I want has always been so far out of reach. Girls I try to talk to and start something with usually click with me immediately but always end up just considering me a friend, they never see me in a romantic or sexual light. And the few that do, I usually blow it with cause I think I try to hard and come on too strong.  But how can I not? It’s literally the most important thing to me. The one thing I want in life. And you don’t get anything in this life without effort and trying your hardest. But the other thing that hurts my chances is I think I’m starting (or maybe always) to give off a vibe of desperation, which is the exact opposite vibe you need to be giving off. So basically my question is how do you not be desperate when you actually are?

Everyone holds so many others that they hold to high regard- leaving me desperately, fruitlessly clamoring to catch the slipstream they leave behind, only for the gap between us to grow ever distant.

At times, my presence may very well be invisible, trapped in the jail cell that is their blind side with no key or escape in sight.

To be put on a pedestal, and beloved is a sentiment seldom felt by me, as I have no good friends to push me onto one. Instead, they turn the other direction, leaving me in their chilling shadows. Again, and again, and again...

Everyone always says, “You just need to find the right people!”, as if they themselves are not the right people, reaffirming these thoughts, and pounding the nail into the coffin of my value as a friend.

Seeing everyone with their best friends, all laughing with each other and enjoying each other sends me further down this dark chasm, and as time goes on, I’m afraid that I’ll be unable to ever return to the light- whatever that may be.

I hope this stays a mere metaphors but it may actualise itself a reality but regardless; I believe I have effectively succeeded in becoming alienated from people yet be functioning and somewhat popular (I am aware this is subjective is it everything)

Yet I have died my heart or soul as you may refer to it, I am not of great age but at my core I continue with great sorrow, pain and idleness. 

The concept of a human being rendered through society's standard I don't remotely come to meet.

If I were to be described as a person I can be summed up in two words ""Utter Chaos"" which describes both my personality and my internal state.

I was literally distorted mentally from inside and reconstructed but whether its good or bad is again subjective.

My pain has brought me to this single point in time where I observe everyone and everything to be mere static.

No more feelings but shallow momentary ""emotions"" I believe I am dead no longer capable of empathy, sympathy or care and I am not guilty for what I have become.

But all my feelings are subjective after all, I'm really just another way the universe views itself and I am part of the universe and also the universe itself, along with everything in the universe which includes you who's reading this now.

I just want someone. I want to hug someone so badly. I want to hold hands with somebody. I want to be with anyone who looks at me and genuinely wants to be with me. I actually can’t even imagine someone waking up and looking at me and being happy and thinking “I love this person and this is who I want to be with”. For people who don’t think I have, ive been trying.. The part that makes me cry every day is just thinking that I used to be such a fun and outgoing person who was always smiling and didn’t care about what anyone thought about me. I used to be a guy who actually thought he was somewhat attractive and was somewhat confident and would strike up a conversation with anyone and have people laughing all around me. But I’m 21 years old now and I’ve never been in a relationship. Fwiw I’m pretty physically fit but I’ve stopped going to the gym because I realized there’s not a huge difference between being fit/in shape and being “ripped” with a six pack it’s mostly appearance (I used to think my personality would make up for lack of appearance but I realized my personality just wont do it). I even went on a date with a girl once a year ago and I thought it literally could not have gone better and that was the happiest I’ve ever been because I thought things might actually start changing but she ended up ghosting me and finding a long term bf like a week after. I later realized it was just because she thought I had money and could buy her expensive things. I’ve been trying so hard... I’ve gone up to so many girls and tried to make conversation and nobody even considers me an option. I used to look at people around campus and in class and sometimes girls would hold eye contact with me and for some reason I thought that was a good sign and that maybe they were interested in me and that would make me happy. I had an epiphany yesterday that it’s actually probably the opposite. Like how sometimes you see someone so ugly that you stare a little bit. I walk around campus now and I went to trader joes yesterday and I didn’t want to make eye contact with anyone. I don’t want to give people around me that satisfaction... I got my groceries and I hurried home. I struggle to eat now for some reason, when I go to take a bite I start tearing up and think to myself what’s the point of this? Why do I even waste money on buying food and waste time eating it to keep myself at a proper weight..? I feel like nothing matters anymore but I can’t waste all of the college tuition and all of the money my parents have spent on me all these years. I feel like I’m trapped. For those of you who think I have depression you’re probably right, but my parents can’t _afford_ me having depression. My dad just had 2 more babies and my parents are paying a lot for me and my sisters’ college tuition. I can’t kill myself because of what that would do to my parents and my baby sisters, what would they think of me..? I want to support them growing up... I feel like I have so much love to give but nobody wants any of it. I just want a girl that I can hold and buy her things and call her and hear about her day and get good night texts and have someone who supports me and I support them and maybe even meet her friends and laugh and have little arguments and watch movies with but nobody wants anything to do with me and it just hurts so much. Every time I even remotely think a girl may be interested I get shot down and shot down and shot down just constantly and I don’t know why I even keep trying but it’s like a defense mechanism it’s like my brain is telling me there’s no way not one girl likes me but every time it’s the same thing. There were a few other girls I wanted to go up to and smile and say hi to but there’s literally no chance I’m doing that anymore. Why the fuck would I do that? To get shot down again and just keep reaffirming what I know already? I heard insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. So I would actually be a stupid human being to consider going up to another girl just to get rejected again. The best thing I can do for now to minimize me getting even sadder is just to keep my head down and not talk to anyone and try to minimize people’s exposure to me. I think if I reach 22 years old in 8 months and nothing’s changed that I might just leave somewhere forever.",lonely,I just want someone,2019-10-20 12:32:56

""Solitude""

&amp;#x200B;

The voice in my head

Is the only familiar voice I hear in a week or two,

The dark ensues,

A loneliness tells me that life’s for two,

But where and who?

How do I find someone for talking to,

A person who,

Will listen and care like I want them to,

To confide into,

To tell me it’s fine when I need them to,

Solitude,

That familiar place, In that hotel room Inside my mind,

That same old view,

Pull up one chair to a game for two,

Lying alone in a bed made to rest two peoples heads on

My Dreams are few,

The familiar hand of loneliness Grips my heart tight and I cant pry it loose,

Come daylight or midnight,

The hurt stands side by my side

It’s inside but outside too,

I tell myself, again and again,

That I won’t feel this pain in a year or two,

But out of the blue,

Quick as a flash 5 years can elapse now at the rate of few,

A moment in time,

Years goes by,

So much quicker than I ever want them to,

I was 22,

5 years on feels like 5 minutes passed in the space of two,

5 years ago I thought 5 years from then,

I’d be happy by now But I’m more consumed,

I’m just confused,

At how I allow myself to sit back while my life falls through,

I try to ignore but the pain comes through,

My whole body aches,

I just need a break for a minute or two,

I’m screaming inside,

I cry all the time,

alone and afraid I won’t make it through,

I'm . I used to spend most of my free time on videogames when I was younger (10 - 13 years old). I just enjoyed playing Nintendo games, CSGO, Minecraft, GTA V, Garry's mod... My friends and I never got bored. And even when all my friends were out in summer for weeks, I was still able to enjoy playing singleplayer games and match-making games.

Now I have more occupations and so less time to play videogames. However, I don't enjoy videogames now more than before. Quite the contrary in fact. I have the feeling that now I only see videogames as a way of spending time with friends. The problem is that most of my friends now rarely want to play with me. And it's not that we have a worse relationship than before (at least I don't think so). They either have other hobbies or play a different kind of games, in which case they never make an effort to play with me.

As a result, now videogames make me feel very lonely from time to time and I have a quite pessimistic vision of them.

I don’t really know what to do nowadays, which is probably why I’m resorting to reddit because I can’t really talk to anyone, and everywhere I turn I tear myself apart. My social life up to this point has been kinda shaky at best. Everyone I’ve gotten close to in the past has either died or left me and I never knew why, maybe that’s just how people work. I’ve had the hope beaten out of me and every social interaction I have now is just a reminder of everything I’ve been through. I know it’s not healthy to dwell on the past but I can’t turn it off. Even now I’m surrounded by great people at school but I’m the broken one and can’t do anything and I fear the ghosts haunting me about my past will permanently ruin any chance I have for happiness.
I know I should learn to appreciate myself first but when I see everyone around me just leave me when I thought we were friends, I figured there was something wrong with me.
I’m just lost and alone and can’t seem to get out of my own head. 
I don’t want to give up because I know I could be a heart friend if I gave myself the chance, but the pain of the past just reminds me daily of what will happen if I try again.

And yet I've spent years refining profile pictures, meeting at coffee shops, and worrying that the current person I'm interested in won't feel the same toward me, just like the last one.

I feel like I'm treading water alone in the ocean, and every potential romantic interest is just a passing piece of driftwood that rapidly deteriorates. It's exhausting trying to keep up the effort to stay afloat, especially with how long it takes for the next one to appear.

Right now, I feel particularly lonely because I think it's happening again. The person I really think I click with has, for reasons unbeknownst to me, decided they aren't interested. Every time someone ghosts me, I can't stop myself from trying to piece together what I did wrong, if any. I get that sometimes there just isn't a spark, but this time that makes *zero* sense.

I was fine, too, before I found this person. It's like I'd gotten used to being lonely again, but was briefly reminded how good it feels to be with someone.",lonely,I miss soft conversations in bed,2019-10-20 00:06:44

I wish I could make this better for myself with some magic antidote, but ultimately rejection hurts. I can focus on other things but the pain is still there, similar to when getting injured. I have to wait it out I guess. it just brings back everything in times like this. All the heartbreak. I’ve been focusing on myself so much, and yet even just letting someone in just a little bit results in this. It’s disheartening, it’s so hard. 

I feel like it’s always like this. I get a glimpse of something amazing with someone and then it just... ends. Whatever the reason, I haven’t felt like people have had the patience to get to actually know me and give us a chance before moving on, or away. 

This time around, I was already guarded. I was already anticipating it to end. And my fears all came to life. Maybe I caused it somehow, but I’ll never know and it eats away at me. I feel so alone even though I have amazing friends. 

I’ve been scared to admit to myself that I want someone to call my own, someone special who views me in the same light. Perhaps I want a relationship with someone I like. I keep telling myself it’s so rare for me to like someone, but maybe if I put myself out there more and saw the best in people it wouldn’t be. Maybe there’s hope... but lately it just feels like fail after fail. 

I feel like crying, but it wasn’t even like what we had was that deep. I feel like crying over the fact we didn’t get to even experience what we could’ve become, mourning a potential. But how sad is that?",lonely,The pain of rejection,2019-10-19 22:25:53

I go from being with close friends, playing splitscreen Halo to being sad and lonely with so much stress. I've never thought I'd be spacing out so much in class. I've been through trauma in elementary but I still had very close friends to be with. All the bullies are gone now(my school is 100% bully free zone) which is great. But I've never been so desperate for love and friends. I've missed them so much. My teacher even caught me spacing out and I was making eye contact at the table and my lips were moving like I was talking to someone. I remember the bullies when they used to kick me around simply for being Asian. I wasn't even messing with them. I've gotten beat up multiple times. And middle school is literally jail. I've looked at prison and they both look like the same thing. So much work and stress, not even thriving for success but instead just trying to pass. I don't get it. Why do we have to go through all this? Why does anyone have to experience such bullshit. I've gotten PTSD from the beatings. My dad also was a crazy guy. He would slap me or get a damn wooden stick and smack the shit out of my leg. I was bleeding once. I LITERALLY cried every night since I was 8. Every day I had an arguement with my dad over the most dumbest shit. I don't know if I could hold all the pain in much longer. I've thought of suicide but never attempted. Like I just feel like choking someone to death, or beating up 10 people at once, and screaming. I always had thoughts of going insane and hurting people. I seem to be so worried about so many things, even walking. I try to be consistent and place each foot down forward. I look at everything around me and think about every possible little detail about this and that. I don't know if I'm nosy or just curious. I have this crush on a freshman but I just don't know how to approach her. I don't know how to make friends anymore. I used to be so social and an extrovert but now, I sit alone in class everyday.

Its gotten to the point where it's become even harder to hold a conversation than when I didn't have all this stupid advice on how to be conversational and charismatic from all those books online. 

I Think the reason why interacting has become more difficult for me after reading all those tips is because I've just become so hyper aware of my actions during interactions that I can't even have fun. And the ""can't have fun"" part only amplifies my  difficulties since it's so obvious that I'm not genuinely happy to the people around me. This stupidity of mine has been going on for months, and I just don't know how to undo the damage. Sure, ""fake it till you make it,"" but all its helped me accomplish is becoming louder and more obnoxious and so much more tired too. I'm exhausted from trying. 

I just cannot connect with other people on a personal level and it sucks. I have virtually no friends in my whole class. I've got a pretty bad reputation in my school (and not to sound self deprecating, but I'm not good looking either) and I'm more than sure that almost every guy who feigns interest in me is just doing it cause they assume that I'm easy. It ruins any chance that I have at a real friendship, and it just feels like a endless cycle at this point.

i am a transfer this year, (my junior year) and i like 2/3 roommates this year. one of them i do not like because i had to take her home 3 times and pick her up from the hospital, she drinks too much. the other 2 i like but are in sororities and kind of hint that they don't want me to rely on them for plans. i hear them talk about my other roommate and how she has no friends and relies on them for party plans, and that is also me too. it is starting to make me sad and uncomfortable because i really like going out with them and i feel like we have a lot of fun but i guess its not the same for them.

i am in a bunch of different organizations but a lot of it is freshman, i always feel like i'm the oldest. so far i haven't made any friends.

My boyfriend broke up with me this summer out of the blue and he was who i always went to when I was feeling sad and lonely. College has become super hard for me when all i want is someone to get dinner with and maybe to the gym.

I am looking through the facebook page for roommates but most do not really stick out to me and I am worried about having yet another horrible living situation. I was thinking about getting a studio apartment and living by myself but I am scared i am going to become super depressed and exclude myself even more. the most important thing is school to me but i am super miserable and miss home.

Hey girls, let’s laugh and talk louder so we can remind him how lonely he is!” I know they’re most likely not thinking that, but that’s what it feels like.

I’ve never been bullied before, which is strange since I know I’m a huge target considering I haven’t had a single friend since 5th grade (I’m currently a Junior in high school). I know that sounds good that I’ve never been bullied, but I’ve been craving attention in school so much that I was thinking about how good it would feel to get picked on. Emotionally or physically abused, please just give it to me. At least I would get attention.

Most days I'm ok. But the nights, and the loneliness cause me to be depressed. I'm 36. I was told to get back out there, just try to be nice, friendly, and I have been. However, bar scenes, and dating apps leave me hollow.

I was a kid when my family dragged me to the city I live in currently, and now it's over ten years later and I still feel like I don't belong here. All my life I've had issues with depression and loneliness and it's only just recently that I've started to handle things better. For a long time my life was a goddamn train wreck and it took every ounce of strength I had to drag myself out of the muck to get to where I am where I'm somewhat stable and am doing better.

But I'd be lying if I said I stopped being depressed and lonely. 

I just got good at handling it. After drugs and therapy didn't work and nearly killing myself I was lucky to find healthy methods that worked for me. But even on good days it can be a struggle. I can put on a brave face, smile, and mingle but nothing ever comes of it but another sleepless night where I fear that I will never know what it's like to have someone give a damn about me. 

And I can't help feel that being who I am and living where I live is a major part of the issue. The people here are just... pretentious. It's infuriating because every time I try to get out of my comfort zone and try something new it's a goddamn failure. For example, I'm a writer so I tried joining the one and only writing club I could find in my town and it was led by a woman who insisted on making everything about her political beliefs, and everyone was basically like her and they just wanted an echo chamber to make themselves feel good, despite the group not being described as such when I first found it. And really that's the same with every club, group, night course, and goddamn shindig I've ever tried to join in this godforsaken joke of a town. Everyone just has this ridiculous sense of superiority and entitlement that's neither earned nor is it endearing.  There is no place for a guy like me who just wants to have fun and be creative and maybe find some friends or someone more to share interests with.

And now my new job has me on a schedule that basically makes it impossible for me to socialize with anyone since I work weird, and often long, hours and am always working weekends. It's now difficult to hang out with the one and only friend I do have. And all I have to possibly look forward to is saving up money and moving away to hopefully start somewhere better and get a fresh start. But in the mean time I'm stuck here and I still struggle with deep feelings of loneliness and worthlessness.

I just want to get through this quickly because I don’t think it really matters. When I was 11 my birth mom died from leukemia and I had no blood family left. I was adopted at 11 (same year) by some family friends and I’ve been raised as theirs since then. They changed my name and I started going to high school in a few years and shit was ok. 

When I got into high school- probably freshman year- I started getting into some illegal substances. I started with weed and then moved onto alcohol, vape, cigarettes... all the stereotypical 21st century angsty teen drugs. I’m a junior now, and more heavily into drugs that I ever thought I would be. 

Another note, my adoptive mother has had breast cancer for over 12 years, and just last year her doctor gave her 6 months to 1 year to live if they could work out other chemos to try. It’s been about a year. She just told the family tonight that she will not be going to chemo anymore and is just going to wait it out until she dies. 

When she told us tonight, I was already very drunk, and I had just gotten back from a night out with friends. I broke down harder than I ever had before. I kept thinking how selfish I was to be feeling sad when the whole family is feeling even worse and also had to take care of me.

About a year or so ago, my grandfather got diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer's. Both of my grandparents live with me. Im a 20 year old male and I live with my mom and sister. Now, to begin with that was pretty hard to live with. It's hard seeing my grandma and mom constantly sad and stressed out. I do the best I can to help them emotionally but it takes a toll on me. 

About 2 weeks ago, I found out my dad called himself into the hospital, apparently he thought he was having a heart attack. We later found out that he doesn't but he has extremely high blood pressure and cholesterol and had to be put on medicine. So I have to periodically check up on him to make sure he's doing okay. The thought of losing my dad at this age would really fuck me up. I ended up watching his house for a few days and watching him for a few days after he got out of the hospital. I was in school currently and had to drop literally the only class I was taking because of my grandpa, my dad and I work two jobs. (I forgot to mention that earlier)

This morning I woke up to see my dad at my house which is odd because I usually know when he's coming over. I saw my sister laying down on the couch PISSED off. I asked what was going on and my dad told me he doesn't wanna talk about it...I heard my mom on the phone with a mental hospital asking if they did psychic evaluations. So I'm assuming my sister tried either hurting herself or killing herself... 

I seriously feel like there's no break in between. The amount of stress I'm experiencing is unlike any other. All I want is to call up someone at two in the morning to hang out and talk with or watch movies or something. Literally something to get me out of the house when I'm not working.

1147,TardisCatTwo,1571327728,7,"I've been lonely practically all my life. I've had few friends my whole life, and only now have I begun to have some roleplay buddies that I can at least somewhat consider to be 'friends'. But even then I still feel lonely. I don't go out with friends anymore, and even when I am around friends I'm still lonely. Some would call me a recluse, while others would call me an attempted and failed comedian. Neither viewpoints are wrong, per say. But I'll explain that later. Although I've been lonely my whole life, I haven't been had the same viewpoint on  my loneliness for all these years. In my early years, back when there was recess, I would spend my time at recess either looking for four leaf clovers, or, on my lucky days, I would play with my few friends (of which I've had a falling out with since). I was lonely, yes, but I didn't really think much of it. I wasn't all too upset about it, I was just accepting of it and didn't really think it wasn't normal. I've also realized that my reasons for not having many friends have actually changed over the years. When I was younger, back when there was recess, I didn't have many friends because I was too zany, clingy, didn't understand the concept of personal space AT ALL, etc. This was because, of course, I was a kid and almost all kids are wild like this. But it was also because I have ADHD and Autism, the latter of which wasn't discovered until much later. I also have an Anxiety Disorder, but this didn't really affect my behaviour when I was so young. Anyway, onto the rest of my past. So, I didn't have much friends because I was nuts, although I did get more calm after I started taking medication for my ADHD. Flash forward to when I was about \[blank\]. I was still kinda nuts, of course, but that was about when my reasons for being lonely started to shift. I began to be outcast less for my behaviour (although that was still a reason for me being outcast, just not as much), and more for my intelligence. Now, up until this point, I had still managed to stay cheery and keep a positive attitude about things. This didn't change right away, mind you, but it did eventually change. When I was \[blank\], though, I did begin to change my looks a bit. I began to pave the road toward my present day signature haircut, and I was proud of my new look. The next school year was one of the better ones, I kept my reputation of getting practically perfect grades and was actually relatively popular for a short period of time. I was also dedicated to trying to help others, and I kept my cheery attitude even despite the family dog (which we'd had as long as I could remember) passing away. My \[blank\] birthday, though, was when things began to change. I was asked out by my same sex crush, and of course I accepted. The school year that followed started off as one filled with me daydreaming about my partner, but I failed to take the fact that we went to different schools into consideration. My partner ended up cheating on me with one of the very people that were there when my partner had asked me out. This is where my viewpoint on things slowly began to change. I did end up joining the theater club and getting another same sex partner. This relationship didn't last all too long, sadly. This was due to peers threatening to take me away from my partner, which, understandably, my partner couldn't handle. This resulted in the breakup, which I don't blame my partner for in any way. I blame the people who made the threats that drove my partner to breaking up with me in tears. Of course I comforted my partner, because what friend would I be if I didn't? The next year was when my change of viewpoint began to show. Over the summer between school years, I got a partner of opposite sex after being asked out by them. I reluctantly accepted and became their partner, of course. Unlike my first same sex partner, my OSP1 (Opposite Sex Partner 1) and I were able to actually keep in touch despite us going to different schools. Things started off fine, but my OSP1 slowly stopped responding to my messages. I soon found out that my OSP1 had been cheating, yet despite this, I agreed to get back together with them. I later found out that my OSP1 viewed the people of my gender as playthings, and that my OSP1 viewed love as some sort of silly game. I left my OSP1 and moved on. Well, or so I thought. I couldn't forget about OSP1, no matter how hard I tried. over the course of the school year that followed that summer break, I started to become depressed. My grade began to go down, and I even cut myself. Fast forward to closer to today, when one of my closest friends asked me out. I was reluctant to accept, considering how I initially thought it was some sort of prank. I eventually accepted, though, making that friend OSP2. Things were good, I felt loved. That is, until OSP2 seemed to stop showing interest in me. OSP2 later dumped me, but claimed that they were still there for emotional support. And yet, they don't respond to my messages and don't even really seem to care. They even claimed that ***I*** had dumped ***them*** when texting a friend of mine. I've since been lonelier than before, and I've been secluding myself from society irl and trying to cover up my sadness with sarcasm and snarky jokes.",lonely,Alone.,2019-10-18 02:55:28

I’m pretty sure it’s the lack of real intimacy in most of my friendships. That feeling that you can really connect with someone on a personal level.

I spent most of my life fairly alone minus superficial relationships and friendships due to living in foster care. I never stayed at a group home more than a few months at time.

Since then I've tried to remain supportive of her and not be too clingy, jealous or anything like that. Only problem is I'm ungodly lonely and she was the only person I ever talked to. I told her things I had never told anyone else. I would go to her when things got tough. I had never been emotionally vunerable with anyone else. She was truly the first person I had trusted.

Well, the meds are working and I feel so much better! But being home while all my friends are off in school is slowly killing me inside. I was pretending everything was fine, but now I'm so emotionally exhausted that I can't pretend any longer.

 I routinely go down my list of contacts in my phone, and text all my friends and acquaintances to say hi and ask how they're doing. And most often, I don't even get a response back. Especially from the people I considered my best friends. I even wrote them letters because I missed them, and haven't even gotten a text from anyone along the lines of ""hey, got your letter, thanks!"".

I'm currently taking classes at my local community college to stay busy, and I have a few classmates I talk to, but it seems like it's limited to in-class conversations.

The only person who seems like they want to listen to me is my therapist, and I'm paying him to do so.

I'm so grateful that I'm alive, and that I've found medication that has made my depression so much less powerful. I just wish I had someone to share my existence with. I recently celebrated my birthday, and had no one to spend it with.

A place where I like to start is meditating on the feeling itself. I am feeling lonely. I don’t try to question why, that always makes it worse. Instead of facing my perceived reality of what ifs and why me, I chase the dream one. I want acceptance, the truest kind, that is what would fulfill my desire to belong. I want to know I am genuinely cared about. 

So I do something that makes me feel accepted. Something I can only do when I’m alone. I connect to myself. My favorite, most fulfilling ways to do this is to either drive around, or go on a walk. I love the colors on the trees in fall, and the feel of crunching leaves underneath.  I love the thrill of walking across a frozen lake. I love discovering new hidden places that maybe one day I can show to a special someone, so I could share with them the gift of acceptance I have made for myself. 

I talk out loud. To my car. To the clouds. But especially to a tree. Trees are alive. They listen. And they always appreciate a hug. Who cares if this makes me look crazy, I am alone after all.

And finally, I make myself feel cared for. I carefully pack a lunch that I imagine only a caring parent or partner could perfect. Except I am making it for myself.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

1185,T4SUK3,1571266061,1,"Hey everyone  
Bear with me, it's my first time posting something on Reddit.

  
I've always considered myself a loner, even though I have a quite some friends and a suportive family, but lately it's getting worse. I have a decent work, college is going great (about to finish my degree), family is there for me and so are my friends, but I always feel incomplete, like something isn't right and I suffer in silence.

Recently I discovered these feelings are probably inflicted by myself for being single most of my life time (I'm only 23 though). Only had 1 gf and it's been a long time since we parted ways. Everyday I look at couples forming around me, couple having fun together, couples loving themselves while I have no one but myself. 

I do miss having atention from the oposite sex, and I miss even more having someone to share life experiences with. I feel like I'm wasting my youth by not having someone. I've come to realize and accept that I'm not the most good looking guy, probably even worse than that. I've had a couple of girls show interest in me, but they always manage to be the type of person I don't identify with. 

It's starting to get the best of me, and I know it's ridiculous, I should focus on myself and my life alone, but I can't help but notice how the others are so happy with their loved one. Some days I arrive home from work really late, and I have no one to talk to, no one to ask me how was work, how was my day, not even texts to ask if everything is going well from someone.  


If you're reading this, I do not wish you to take pity on me. I'm now realizing that I never talked or wrote to anyone about this, and I've been keeping it inside me for too long, and writing about my situation to you guys is slightly helping me control my emotions and feelings.

1193,Imnotcrazyhopefully,1571261750,1,"So I’m really lonely and have been like that for a while. I want friends. I really do. And I’m making an active effort to try and get them. Every day I say hello to at least 5 people and ask how their day is. I try to ask questions, be engaged, make (terrible) jokes, and have a cheerful attitude accompanied by lots of bright smiles. 

I think I do a decent job. Some people seem to be responding. But not in a way that indicates they want to actually be my friend. Like there’s one guy I really like, and I love talking to him and being around him. But when we message, he seems disinterested, and our interactions irl often fizzle out because I’ve been carrying the conversation and have nothing left to say. 

Recently he did sit by me at lunch (I sit alone cuz ya know) during his free period. I was so happy, and though it was a super good sign he wanted to take our interactions further. But a few days later he didn’t come again, and he told me when I saw him at rehearsal that he ended up taking another class that period. I don’t doubt that, cuz I don’t see why he would lie since I didn’t even ask why he wasn’t there, but now it feels like he doesn’t really want to talk to me. And I’m not sure what to do. I want to hang out with him to try and get to know him better, but I don’t want him to get the wrong idea because I’m bisexual and he’s gay, so, yeah. But I wouldn’t be opposed to becoming more than friends later on, hehe

Right now I mostly rely on imaginary friends and online friends for my social interaction. It feels really fucking pathetic, like I’m not ashamed to have imaginary or online friends, it’s just... I have no one else. Earlier today I set up a day to go to the zoo with one of my old friends I’ve fallen a little out of touch with. But that’s it. There isn’t anything else I’m doing. I even went to a concert yesterday and had no one to go with. I’m just so lonely.

Well unless girls are around. It happens rarely that girls are around, maybe once a year. Then I become very awkward. But let's get to the point.

Problem is that when I stop, it's back and usually depression sets in pretty quick. 

I don't know what to do with it. I've read plenty of ""relations are overrated, you need to be happy with yourself"" and it never really helped.

I’ve never been in a relationship and i feel like the only person in the world who hasn’t. My friends are all with or have been with people and every attempt I’ve ever made (albeit very few) to get to know somebody has just resulted in them stopping talking to me. I have absolutely zero self confidence and/or esteem because of my bad experiences and I just feel like it’s going to last forever and the excruciating physical pain I’m in is here to stay. 

The worst experience was a girl I spoke to on tinder (downloading that was a mistake) who essentially wanted a casual relationship, which I was absolutely dying for when she made it apparent. She was cute she was funny and we seemed to connect. We agreed to meet and then she cancelled on me, we kept talking for a while and I was so bought into it that when she stopped speaking to me it absolutely killed me because I thought I was there, I thought I’d made it. This was near enough a year ago and it still gets to me now.

I’d trade all the money and valuables I own for some  genuine love, a cuddle, a kiss, sex, you name it, doesn’t work like that though does it, and my antisocial tendencies mean I spend all my time at home wasting my life away.

I'm head over heels for my best friend. I've never loved another person as I love her and I'm constantly overwhelmed with a sense of dread and excitement. I guess it's kind of cliche when I put it like that but I can't really find any better words for it. She's such a beautiful, funny, thoughtful and compassionate person.

I'd like to think the feelings are real and not just teenage infatuation. I could always be wrong but this feels genuine to me and based on her character. She is a bit of a looker though I won't lie.

I'd tell her all that myself it were possible but unfortunately (for me, at least) I'm not the only one who sees her in that light. Another friend of mine is actually in a very loving relationship with her and while I am incredibly happy for the two of them, It is definitely frustrating to have to bottle up these emotions all the time.  

I feel like in another lifetime If I had been quicker on the uptake and more approachable I could have shot my shot and been given closure but that's not what happened.

All of that is probably pretty cliche', but it's not really why I'm posting it here, although any thoughts or suggestions are welcome.

Why I'm posting it here is that it feels like a grim jerk to reality. A reminder that I am not good enough for anyone. That everyone has better options than me. I guess I can't blame them considering I don't even like myself, but still.

I hate the constant reminder that I am not needed or wanted by anyone. There are people in this world like her I couldn't live without, but to them, I'm sure I'm just background noise. Filler. Just an amusing distraction before they do and talk to the people who actually matter to them in a serious way.

I'm happy for friendship but I hate myself for not being able to handle it. I hate myself for latching on to people and undoubtedly draining them. I hate myself for getting stressed and misreading signals. I hate myself for letting her and people like her dominate my headspace while I'm sure they never think about me. 

I've never felt like I've fit into any demographic. There's no ""group"" I've ever been apart of where I haven't felt the most different from everyone else. I feel like some sort of alien, it's surreal and painful.

I want to stop existing sometimes. I just don't really have a place on the earth it seems. I'd rather not bother with all the hassle for no payoff.

I don't know really what I'm typing about anymore, I'm just rambling.

The bottom line is I guess, feelings for those in love are a wonderful way to remind you that you are not wanted or needed.

I wish you all the best, and again if anyone has any thoughts feel free to share.",lonely,"I'd like to vent, leave advice if you'd like, I would appreciate it.",2019-10-17 03:43:07

I just wanted to hear some advice. For the last year I have been feeling very lonely and I really don't know why.
I have a boyfriend who is always there for me, a loving family and friends that I see regulary. But lately I feel very depressed, as if nobody of my friends likes me, wants to spend time with me etc.
I am a rather introverted person and all my friendships are not as deep as I would like them to be, I struggle with even believing people want to be a real true friend to me rather than just a friend.

Due to University and  moving I also lost lots of old school friends, even my bestfriend who does not talk to me anymore. I also know people at my University, I spend time with them but I dont consider them close friends. I really struggle with this, because I really feel lonely and in need of a true friend.

1228,Zlint,1571216587,22,"Generic advice you’ve been getting on the internet that if you’re a lonely guy who has never dated or had a girlfriend is to “focus on yourself” and “get hobbies” and soon “the girl will come when you least expect it.”

Well, I can say I’ve tried that. 

Almost every weekday I’m doing something. I play soccer on Mondays and Wednesday’s, I go for a social run on Tuesdays, I join an exercise group on Thursdays and guess what? For the past year I’ve done this, nothing’s happening. Where’s the girl I was told would come?

Sure, for the hour that I spend every time I do those activities, I may distract myself from feeling lonely, but at the final assessment, I’m still that one guy within those groups that doesn’t have a girlfriend, that one guy who can’t hold eye contact with a girl, that guy who is only doing all that to distract himself from the fact that he is lonely, who pretends the second pillow in his bed is his non-existent girlfriend, and cries himself to sleep some nights whenever the thought of him being a dateless wonder becomes overwhelming.

1234,throwawaysssshahhaha,1571206530,6,"Starting at grade 11 i was sort of a nerd. Got good grades, played video games, saved money. Never partied and was shy. This is all changed during the summer. I smoked weed for the first time. Instantly became addicted. This opened me up to new friends. I started smoking every day. It was the most fun I’d ever had. Weed truly had a good impact on me. I connected with people and I started making more friends. My grades fell, but I was still passing classes. I went to parties, and had fun. But I stopped saving and spent all my money on weed and food mostly. Grade 12 was much of the same until second semester. 

My parents were getting divorced. We lived in a good neighborhood. My father was experiencing hallucinations, schizophrenia type symptoms. I had to move in with my mom in a bad neighborhood with my little brother, who was 6. My father was in the psych ward at the hospital and I started never seeing him. I had to help my mom more with my little brother cause dad wasn’t there. At first I was holding myself together, still going to school but I was also just starting new classes. Also, my older brother is a meth addict who has stolen things from me.

Around March of grade 12, I started getting very depressed. My older brother was a drug addict, my dad is gone, and I live in a bad neighborhood. Everything changed. I still had my group of friends, but I didn’t feel the same. I felt disconnected from society with a lot of paranoia. I started not going to school, and ghosting my friends. Completlty lost my will to live. Deleted all social apps and went dark for awhile. I started telling my friends that I was just very depressed and didn’t want to do anything. They understood. I was put on anti depressants by a psychiatrist. This lasted for months until September. They were happy to see me and missed me. But I wasn’t the same. I quit weed, and had anxiety from all the time I spent alone. I was still experiencing depression. I was seriously mentally ill. But I kept going out and eventually got better, but still had issues. I couldn’t really speak to new people. My mind was just blank. I lost a lot of my social skills and I wasn’t fun to be around. Until March 2019.

These friends stopped hanging out with me because they made other ones that were more fun to be around than me. I freaked out at them and called them all fake and got into arguments that led to me not talking to them again. They were the only friends I had except for one other. I was finishing high school from home. 

So from March-August I finished high school, but spent most of it alone in my room playing games or watching tv. My depression got worse. I had no self worth. Hated myself. 

September 2019, I started talking to one of my old buddies again and we play games and sometimes hangout. I started smoking weed again for a bit but being a stoner just isn’t me anymore. 

October 2019: I figure out I want to go to college in September of 2020. Maybe take journalism, or get into law enforcement. I’ve already made the plans and this is happening. I just have to wait a year. I’m confident I can get good marks and get a degree, if my mind is in the right place come September 2020. I’m looking forward to college and just want my life to move forward. I’ve already figured out which one I want to attend, I just have to get through this year.

So, as of now I’m helping my mom with my little brother, I’m off anti depressants, and looking for a job, I want to work and save money. I feel motivated. I understand I’m capable of things if my mind is right and get back where I was. I have 1 IRL friend and spend most my time playing video games with online friends and watching YouTube/Netflix.

1242,Big_Cloud01,1571196711,2,"      For about 5 years I've always felt lonely on and off when I don't really have a reason to feel this way. I have best friends and family that supported me when I was back home and still do from the far distance they're way from me, but on occasion I feel like no one really cares about me. I feel that's partly my fault because I don't have great communication skills and can't had a conversation to save my life with a random stranger. In fact I hate having fake conversations like "" Omg hi! How are you! Nice to see you! "" Shit like that. It doesn't feel like they actually care about me, but feel obligated to try and not make it look like they hate me. I still go and play along with it saying the generic ""hi, I'm good, hope to see you soon"". After it's over I continue feeling alone.

      Back in highschool I had my best friends and when I was around them I didn't feel this way, but as soon as I would leave them to go to class. I would just feel so alone walking the halls filled with people that didn't feel like they really knew me or cared and I'm in the same situation now. I'm in the AirForce in the tech school faze of my career I live in a building with 422 people with a roommate and I still feel alone.  The only time I really don't feel alone is when I'm talking to my friends on discord. So I started falling asleep while on discord with my best friend while they play videogames. It's great because it feels like I'm just sleeping over or something. Then when ever they leave to go to bed I just feel empty.

1249,hamartiated,1571187828,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Early on after her breakup we decided to just stay as friends since we didn’t want to accidentally ruin our friendship, however things started to get serious a couple months ago. For a few weeks we were talking about dating, and I was really happy because I really wanted that. However she eventually decided that she was too conflicted and told me it wasn’t going to happen and that she just wanted to stay best friends. I was pretty bummed out since I felt a little led on but I was fine with going back to just being friends. We got into some arguments about stuff (which was completely new for us), but eventually we worked things out and we went back to being best friends and I was really happy. A month ago she got a boyfriend and I was genuinely happy for her since she was trying to move on from her past boyfriend for months. For some reason even though I told her I was happy for her she assumed that I was upset with her. Now arguments ensue. We work things out again. Things are fine for a few weeks, but then one day she explodes and accuses me of a bunch of shit that isn’t true and says she doesn’t want to talk for a while. It’s baffling though because a few days before she blew up she told she loved me and that she’d always be there for me.

Went back to mine and actually had some really really good passionate sex. Which I know was pretty silly but meh.

Woke up in the morning he stayed with me until around 1pm, we watched peep show (if you haven’t seen, you need too) we had a laugh, cuddled, had more sex, kissed and held hands. I dropped him off home and he kissed me good bye and said he would text me later on.

5 hours later no text, so I texted him and I never got a response. I added him on Facebook and tried on there incase he slipped up a digit in the number. He opened the message and never replied.

I guess he got what he wanted at the time I just don’t understand why he had to lead me on like that. I would have been fine with the causal sex because I haven’t had it in SO long.

It’s been 4 years since I’ve ever actually had anybody interested in me romantically, and in that relationship experienced some pretty rough times which I don’t really want to get into.
I’m not the most beautiful woman and I’ve put a shit ton of weight on, mainly from comfort eating and the lack of motivation that comes with my depression which I know I need to control.

my depression and anxiety is taking over, I go to work and come home and sit alone in my bedroom, and that is the continuous loop of my life, the town I live in doesn’t offer a lot of opportunities either.

I feel like I am on my own. I am trying to get off rock bottom, trying to find a job and move out of my parents house. I want to be able to smoke and drink and self destruct without anyone being in the way.
I can't commit suicide for certain reasons so I am just hoping having a self destructive life will kill me instead. I have big plans which I want to fulfill in the next 20 years and then once I achieve that stuff just give it away to people I love. And by that time I will be in my 40s and hopefully die of cancer. I think I am meant to be alone, because I function best on my own. I get lonely a lot but I was lonely since birth so if I survived 20 years I can another 20.
 I don't know what's the point. I wish I was aborted. But my mom wanted a kid so she could feel less lonely. How ironic, that kid she gave birth to is now more miserable than she will ever be able to imagine. I lay in bed all day because I have no will to live. I rarely shower. Sometimes I don't eat anything.
I don't leave the house for months. I got addicted to talking to people online. But now I'm on meds and while I am still lonely, I don't feel like I need anybody anymore. I want to be alone. Because even when I am surrounded by people I still feel alone. A song I love says ""I can't prepare for death any more than I already have"" and that is very true mentally. But physically I still have to prepare. Smoking and drinking for the next 20 years and hopefully getting a job and saving up so I can give it away before I die.
Have you noticed how many times I used the word ""I""? Yep, I am self centered.

I consider myself to have a lot of friends, and would usually pinpoint my loneliness to the absence of a partner. Although I still find this to be the root cause of my loneliness I am starting to feel more lonely towards other aspects of my life. Where it’s starting to become less about wishing I had a significant other but more about feeling completely alone.

I’m a very self aware and self critical person who knows what changes must be made to in order for things to change. This I could do with finding a significant other (ie. putting myself in social situations to meet people etc..). But as I  continue to spiral into this feeling of a complete loneliness, whether it be due to closer friends moving on with their lives, seeing success and happiness of others around you, or just feeling trapped within myself, I begin to wonder whether this loneliness is just situational.

I posted here a few weeks ago, basically talking about how I felt isolated. At the time, I had one friend I was in communication with. Even then, we hadn't spoken face-to-face in months.

Well, I reconnected with an old friend last Sunday.

On the day in question, I discovered her Instagram account. I'm not sure why I felt this was a good idea, but I created an account (since I didn't have one) specifically to reach out to her in Direct Messaging.

We've been chatting through DMs almost constantly for over a week now. It's mostly been us catching up, but she's also given me very useful advice regarding socialization.

So, yeah. On that end, things are going pretty well. There's always the chance she's taking advantage of me, but I can't see a reason why that'd be the case.

At the same time, I'm starting to feel like my other friend is avoiding me.

Every time I ask if we can meet up (and I'm the only one who asks), there's always something happening on his end. It mostly involves schoolwork, but sometimes I'll just get an abrasive ""Busy."" More than likely, I'm just awful with timing, but there have been times where we both agreed on a time and place, only for him to abruptly cancel at the last minute. He was recently diagnosed with depression, so that could have something to do with it. This is most likely just a case of bad timing, but if it isn't...

So, yeah. That's pretty much what's been going on. I don't know what my goal with posting this is. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, leave them below, I guess.",lonely,My friend count grew by 1 a week or so ago. I don't know how long it'll stay that way.,2019-10-15 18:33:04

Hello everyone I am going to present this scenario to you about why I would not kill myself now and hold out for 3 more years. 

So here is the scenario: Last summer I had a girl who was really interested in me that I did not like that much for 3 reasons. She cheated on my best friend, she was going from guy to guy every month (not for sex but emotional reasons) and I was not physically attracted to her. 

So everytime she tried to make an advance I basically pushed her away. Anyways when the school year started she dated another guy for a month and then she ended up dating this sophomore guy and they have been dating for the last year and 1 month. (While she was a senior) 

So basically as I started hanging out with her more as friends and what have you I started becoming more and more attracted to her. She also was staying loyal to her boyfriend which showed me she could actually hold a long term boyfriend. Basically throughout the whole year the regret of not dating her built up every month up to where I am today where I am ready to kill myself.

Now during this time during the first 6 months of there relationship they broke up 4 or 5 times. But the other 6 months they haven’t. I recently told her last month how I felt about her and she told me that “hey if me and Jim don’t workout it’s me and you” pointing to both me and her. She also later on during us hanging out that day told me that I am her favorite person and she doesn’t just say that to anyone and she says she literally means that. I don’t know how true that is considering the fact she is still with her boyfriend. 

Anyways the next 3 years she is still going to be in the area because she is spending this year taking a year off school and then the next 2 years she will be going to a school 45 minutes away. Now after her first year at college her boyfriend will then graduate college and knowing how smart he is will probably go to that college in Hawaii he wants to go to or some where far away. He has already told her that if he moves or she moves to far away from college he will end the relationship. Which makes her very upset. My question is based off this information is it worth sticking around these next 3 years or is there relationship not going to end? Like what are my chances here because I am trying to decide if it’s worth continuing this hell everyday or ending this shit? If you could please answer these questions and NOT if I should move on or don’t do it type answers that would be really appreciated. Thanks

EDIT: Please just answer the question and don’t tell me to move on or life is worth it

EDIT 2: Also when Jim did a ama on Snapchat someone asked: how often do you and Sarah break up?

1326,weasol12,1571107580,2,"I'm 30 and this is r/lonely so whatever it is, TL;DR I'm a lonely effing dude looking for a ride or die best friend.

My whole life I've longed for deep connection. I'm honest, energetic, charasmatic, caring, kind, trusting and slightly immature. I've always been the odd wheel in my friend circles and now I'm the only one that isn't engaged or married. Seems insignificant but apparently spouses and significant others take up lots of time. I'm a spontaneous kind of person. I'll get bored at 4 and send up the bat signal for happy hour or shenanigans that night to no avail. 

I've always had a hard time making the deeper connections with people I want but since I don't know what that looks like I don't even know how to go about getting there. My parents always told me that to have a friend you first have to be a friend. That's gotten me nothing but pain. 

I've never had any trouble getting lady friends or dating but I've always believed that time is the most precious thing you can give someone and I'm never high on the list for such and honor, which is ok because I cherish what time I get, but it would be great not to be an afterthought.

At work, well, I quit my job a few weeks ago. I needed to change roles but unfortunately there wasn't anything available. It sucks, it happens and they're trying to help me find something else in the area. Work, however, was where I filled most of my base social need

I know what I want in life. I know the end goal and what I need to get there. I know that my plan must be flexible because life is unpredictable and I’ve accommodated to that as best I can. I also realize that I must have a rigid basis of which to follow my Golden Path and I’ve accommodated to that as best I can as well. I’ve come far since beginning my journey into adulthood and the path that I have chosen, and have achieved many things that I’m very proud of myself for. But for a long time I felt something that I didn’t understand, but now I do. I’m alone. When I look around me and see my achievements I see what was missing, someone to share those feelings of pride with. Most of my family is gone, either dead or very far away, and my circle of friends is nonexistent. Through initial schooling I was told by my parents that “School is for learning and furthering your growth, not socializing.” I carried that maxim through all of my other schooling as well, and focused solely on grades and my extracurricular activities. I was surrounded by people, and in some cases I worked with them, but I never really interacted with them. I carried that endowed maxim with me up until my parents died and I began on a part of my path that is largely a waiting game. Then I realized that I missed out on a key part of my growth through schooling, socialization. And what’s worse, I’m not that old. I’m 23, and I just missed my opportunity. The door has just slammed shut behind me, and there’s no way to turn back. I started to talk to some people who I used to go to school with. Some of them said that they would’ve offered for me to hang out with them, but I seemed preoccupied or disinterested. But worst of all, a girl who I actually enjoyed hanging around and who I thought of asking out, but didn’t because of my parents disapproval, confessed that she did have feelings for me. But now she’s married. I cried. After those exchanges I started to try and go out with some people I work with after our shifts to try and learn socialization skills by proxy, but it didn’t work. Every time that I tried to engage a stranger in conversation I either, faltered, embarrassed myself, or just gave up. After many months of this I realized how truly clueless I was in that realm. I realized that I’m part of a growing group of people who only speak to others through the internet in extremely shallow, unthoughtful conversations. We make these profiles, these façades, and mask ourselves from who we really are from the world. I want to break free from this growing trend.

1334,pieandsodomy,1571101864,1,"Sorry for the length in advanced, but some of it seems necessary to get what I am trying to say across. 

I hadn't had any friends for about 12 years up until around 4 months ago. I had tried reconnecting with old friends, which lead me to a new one that is friends with my old set of friends. Friend is a somewhat loose term, I suppose. ""Friends with benefits"" is maybe more accurate for what this person is. 

We started off talking on Facebook, pretty much non-stop. He would text me constantly, and this held true for quite awhile after the first few initial meetings. After one specific time hanging out though, he more or less started acting differently. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and fear of abandonment runs pretty strong with me, especially with people I have become fairly attached to. So, when his behavior started to change... mine did. And I know not pleasantly. I started feeling like I needed his constant reassurance that he still liked me, I hadn't done anything wrong, everything was the same... You get the picture. 

I don't normally disclose my personality disorder to people. I find it embarassing. But, I could tell that I was starting to irritate him, so I bit the bullet and tried explaining myself. I had thought with how we had been, he would be understanding and maybe less quick to get bothered with me. He told me he understood and all that, and I tried really hard to not let my insecurity show, but it did again and on top of all the previous stuff, it caused what I think is a permanent change in how he feels about me. He said he got sick of having to constantly try to prove he likes me. We still talk and see each other, but things are just...different.

Anyway, he lives around 2 hours from me. I make the trip to see him every two or three weeks, with next week being our next planned get together. He owes me ""3 requests"" and last night we were talking about those and having a fun conversation. For the first time in about 2 months, things felt the same as they used to. Like he enjoyed talking to me and wasn't doing it out of nicety or whatever. I was trying to get him to tell me if he would do if I asked him this one specific request. He told me he can't tell me what he would do, but thag he might honor that one. I was teasing him and asked if he would tell me just because he ""luhs me"" (a way we have of saying love) and it would make me happy. 

He said ""nahhh"" and I, jokingly, said ""ah, fine, you don't luh me enough"". And he got pretty irritated with me. He said ""Shit always this"". And I told him to please not get upset, I was just jokingly trying to guilt trip him into telling me and he responded with ""Yeah, but it's every fucking time"". I automatically went into apology mode, tried explaining that I was kidding and that it was just a way I joke and that I wouldn't do it again. He ended up just leaving me on read. 

This morning he sent me a message telling me he wasn't mad, just irritated and that he had sat his phone down, also that he really hates having to convince people that he likes them over and over again. We talked a little and he still seemed bothered, so I just left him alone. 

I guess... I don't know if my reaction to this is appropriate or what... But now, I feel too embarassed to go hang out with him. I feel like because I irritated him, he doesn't like me. And I'm also a little pissed off that I feel like I have to constantly apologize to him for stupid things or being me. But, I'm also mad at myself because I know I will go see him anyway, the whole time being worried and embarassed. And it makes me feel pitiful.

1336,hamartiated,1571101464,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

1342,sunflowersunchild,1571097625,4,"Hi. Ok. How to start this...

I’m 25F and have been “homeless” since the end of April. I chose this lifestyle because I had the funds, freedom, ability, and inspiration to do so and I wanted to find a new place to live. Turns out I still haven’t found that place and it’s a much harder decision that I anticipated. I’ve been couchsurfing, staying with friends &amp; family, and camping for the past 5 months.

So, I’ve pretty much just by gotten comfortable with the nomadic lifestyle and will continue it until I find a place I want to live. I have a job so long as I am connected to the internet. I just recently bought my first car, so now I REALLY have the freedom to go wherever I want.

I’m lonely and depressed, just like you guys, but I’m also a lot of fun to be around &amp; I make a really good friend (also, i’m sure, like many of you guys). I have absolutely no plan and truly am as free as a bird.

I do have preferences. In autumn, I want to stay east half of the U.S. as I am very nature oriented and need to be among the beautiful autumn leaves. As it gets colder, I’d like to move west / southwest. But hey, if your town is really fun to be in right now... sold!

I don’t care about your gender, so long as we are clear I have absolutely no interest in anything sexual.

I'm going to community college, begrudgingly, due to financial issues in my family. My parents and I are immigrants, and I've been raised with a post-communist viewpoint towards college, as they were both able to go to school for free. They've been pretty solitary and dare I say, ""anti-social"", so the whole, not-having-a-single-friend thing doesn't really sit well with them as an excuse. The community and general vibe around my school is basically: you go to school, and you leave when you're done with your classes. There are no clubs, nobody talks to each other in any of the classes, the hallways are basically empty, and after your classes you go to either go home or go to work. Being here is taking a severe toll on my mental health, and I'm not sure if it'll be worth it to transfer and actually feel something akin to joy or stay here for another year and save myself from more crippling debt later on. I want to be an RN or a practitioner, so I'll have to transfer at some point, but so far this month and a half has felt like 6 months and I'm not sure if I can handle any more of it.

After spending seven years (literally to the date, almost to the minute) with an amazing woman, our engagement ended in late October 2018. As an east coast native, I have no friends and very few acquaintances here in Los Angeles. She was it. But the night she left, she flew back home to the east coast. It’s been a life of nothingness since.

In two days, I’ll be 34. It’s my first birthday alone. And what makes it the worst is that I don’t expect any phone calls, cards or text messages from anyone other than my immediate family back home.

I go to bars, events, restaurants, etc. No one sees me. When I do talk to people (who aren’t employees), it’s minimal and they eventually transition away from me. I try to be funny. I try to be kind. I’ve lost over 70lbs so I try to look good. Yet here I am. 33 turning 34, alone.

I like school. I need my education to get my job and income. I need my resume to be good so people will either hire me or think I am not up to their standards. Good, then I can survive in this world. I had officially gotten into a college which is a vocational type. I thought life will be much different from my usual secondary school.

I meet people and am in the same class for the rest of the three whole fucking years

You know, what's fucking worse in school? The people there. Everywhere people stick in cliques and never venture out of their zones. I tried to talk to make some friends but it didn't go well. They will always choose their cliques rather than focusing on expanding their network. 

I had friends. Had. I was thrown out by the group. They gave me a silent treatment, ignored, ghosted without talking things out. I tried to communicate but they won't give a glance or a thought. People are fucking liars. When they said you are their best friends or yada yada all the sweetest stuff. They will find other people to replace you. Communication does not do it's tricks. People will just one day throw you out without a word.

I have enough. I am sick and tired of pleasing them or chasing after them for a fucking useless talk. I am sick of being left out. I am sick of feeling dreaded to go to school.

I have fucking enough of dramas. Why can't I find anyone? Why am I always alone in school? I talk more but it didn't make a difference. What is wrong with me? 

Sorry for the rant guys... I am feeling very emotional and want to vent out everything. I have school and never want to come into class just to see them. I have been holding this for a long while.

One month ago I felt super well, my mind was clear and I felt confortable helping people, because my huge sense of empathy.
It worked pretty well and I was satisfied.
A little back story, I am a trans girl, but because of some technical problems I found myself unable to transition and go on hormones.
I faced a lot of hate at work even if no one knows me and my story, and the transition part, of course.
My family is not helping at all, they just ignore and kept saying that I am strange and that this feeling will go away.
I have this feeling since 12,and now I am in my mid/late twenties(let's keep it vague, I don't like to talk about my age).
I tried and tried, over and over to keep my mind focused on other things, on my music, on my work, and helping people.
Dysphoria started kicking so hard that I have now these huge panic attacks, everytime I watch my image in the mirror I am unable to recognize myself, I see a distorted version of myself and I am panicking a lot.
I feel sad all the time, and honestly enough is enough.
I feel just like garbage, I can't stand it anymore.
I tried to get confident with my actual body and once I posted some pics(nothing explicit) I just received hate, from the girls and from the guys as well.
I feel nothing and nothing, I feel just this huge mass of darkness surrounding me and I cannot stop.
At work we have this cutters to do some little works, and sometimes I think ""now I WI go to the bathroom and slit my throat"", and sometimes the courage fades and I start to cry.
I don't feel human anymore, I want to end my life and I know that once I will find enough courage I will do.
I don't feel hatred, I feel bad for myself but I did nothing but tried to exist as myself.
I don't know what to think anymore, and seems that there isn't any solution for me.
Sorry for this dark post, I don't care, i wanted to throw away things from my chest, but I can't stop these dark feeling.
I can't face my sad gaze, I can't stand and image of a stranger at the mirror and my life is a total mess.
I helped people, but now I can't help myself.
I cried again today and I leave the work because I feel ill.

1394,hamartiated,1571019499,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact.

At first glance I thought that you were just another one,
Another that glances and looks away
But the sun shines so bright upon your your lovely face
Our eyes meet like two lovebirds as if they were here to stay

I take another step
transfixed on that smile
Hoping that its not an illusion
Because you can see those pearly whites from somewhere close to a mile
 
As a second step is taken,
I feel my heart pick up speed
As we get closer
All I feel is anxiety

Your tall frame resembles a tree
Long and lanky but calming and sedating
You take one step closer to me
I feel as though my vision is fading

As we stop and meet
Happiness is all I can convey
For you brought light into the darkness
I want to keep it here to stay

The soft crisp morning air
Brushes our arms and legs
While my arms start to shiver
But you come in close and start to warm my face

Now we are closer than ever
And death do us part
For you brought light to the darkness
And warmed a fading heart",lonely,Hopefully there is a light to save me from my darkness.,2019-10-14 12:54:34

Hello Everyone,

I stream somewhat often and dedicate my streaming towards speaking on my issues, raising awareness about mental health and treatment, and just showing people that we can all stay positive together. Today I am doing my first 24 hour live stream. I am making sure all donations are sent to NAMI, the national alliance of Mental Illness, and my goal is to just try and show everyone that we can make a difference no matter how big or small. I am not asking for donations, I am not asking for you to follow or subscribe, I just want you to come tune in and ask any questions you like, and help contribute towards spreading awareness.

Thank you everyone for supporting me and for supporting mental health, and thank you for being here with me tonight. I have a really good feeling this will work out well and am so excited to do this!

1400,Dr_Fluffybuns2,1571012041,5,"I used to have a call centre job that I quit 3 months ago. I was a floor walker so I knew everybody there (which was a lot) and treated everybody kindly and made people laugh. I made around 10 - 15 friends that I hanged out with after work drinking but it seemed I was always the one who initiated it but that was fine. After I quit I sent some people a few messages for updates. They'd either send small replies or leave me on seen. Now 3 months out and I've come to realise not a single one of them has messaged me first or even tried to contact me at all, not even to say hi. I checked through my messages and they never even messaged first when I was working with them. Not only that, I realised that the only person besides my boyfriend that does message me at all is my friend from high school that I haven't seen in 3 years.

Is there something wrong with me? Do people not like me? I don't understand, I thought if people want to be friends they'd talk to each other. I find I'm always messaging people with funny stories or conversation starters and people usually respond, but do people not find me interesting enough to not do the same with me?

I've been trying to distract myself from the loneliness with projects or spending as much time with my boyfriend when he's home as I can, and I know I could message somehow to talk to them but why would I at this point?

Thoughts of her and the special moments we have had constantly flood my mind and prevent me from living normally and I’m not sure what to do or think.

1408,UmbralCyclone,1571009958,2,"A couple of months ago, I ""got together"" with a girl. I'm 18 years old and she is my first girlfriend. Now, the ""got together"" is in quotation marks because I am in my first year of college and she is a senior in high school, at the time of writing this we are both 18 but I'm almost a year older, and the TL;DR version is:

She has a lot of stuff on her plate right now: Med school, finals, she is trying to get into college which is in my town, driving lessons, and understandably (knowing how med school is in my country and, well, everywhere else) she doesn't have time for a relationship.

Now, we come to the problem: I'm so used to people (well, not necessarily people in general, but people I considered friends) leaving me, ignoring me, and not liking me in general (bar a couple of friends) that when we talk over Instagram DMs, and it takes her a while to answer, it's like a switch flips in my brain and I just start imagining the worst. That she wants to leave, she doesn't like me anymore,.... And then that sinking feeling, that void in my chest appears again.

Oh yea did I mention she lives in another city??

On the surface, everything's only improved over the past years — I have a well-paid job that I like, living in a beautiful and quiet suburban town near Paris, don't need to care about making both ends meet, and can travel whenever I like.

On the inside, I just don't know how to exist anymore. It gets to the point when I simply spent half of the weekend sleeping with absolutely no motivation to get out of bed. Every new relationship is ending worse than the previous one, and I feel like nobody cares about me. Gradually, I'm becoming bitter and I find it hard to sincerely care about others too. I used to love playing videogames, and now I don't want to do even that.

It feels excruciatingly unfair that my life seems to be getting better, while I feel more exhausted and broken than before. I look around and see how many people in this subreddit feel lonely, I know there are plenty of people like these around me, yet somehow we never interact with each other and the situation only aggravates.

I want to break this cycle somehow, but I have no clue how. At this point I simply don't have the strength anymore, I've invested so much in trying to find a close person over the last couple of years, that I'm close to giving up on everything entirely.

I don't want to be with a lot of people, two or three people in my life is enough for me. But what I really NEED is a female companion.

Ever since my girlfriend left me in 2014, my life has been fucking ridiculous. I gave her all my love and she just treated me like a joke. It's been four years since I had a face to face conversation with a girl my age. Hell, I don't even know what a girl my age would look like.

I'm almost 22, by this time an average guy has gotten nudes from girls, has been on dates and has had sex. I didn't even get to go on a date with my so called girlfriend.

This overwhelming loneliness led to porn addiction. Right now, I'm on NoFap trying to end it. But I frequently find myself going to the NSFW subs to look at girls. And I don't want to do that, I want something real.

I'm not a bad guy... I think about the environment and animals. I help out people when they need it. I like intellectual stuff (I watch a lot of documentaries). And yes, I'm a bit overweight but I'm far from ugly; in fact I'm much better looking than most guys I see around me who have girlfriends.

The worst part about my life? I'm a high school dropout without a job. I'm trying to get my life together but how long will this loneliness continue? Even I want a girl to like me, even I want to get nudes sometime. I apologize but I'm just being honest.

I have tried chatting with girls on Reddit but I come on way too strong, I can't control my desperation. But I still try to chat, as normally as I possibly can.

Is it a sin to for someone like me to hope for a girl to show an interest in me? I really want to know.

1440,DemonioLaplace,1570987189,3," Welcome to the desert of the real;

Where people entertain themselves, just to evade from the responsibility of taking care of others in need.

Where family members, even knowing your potential, still turn their back on you, because you are struggling.

Where family members have 2 faces and a fake smile. Where there´s a story behind your back and another when you are there.

Where people prefer the soap opera to reality. They prefer imagine than to ask.

Where people fake their empathy and worries about your health, but they only want is to feel less guilty.

Being lonely, even when you are with supposedly the people that should be at your side,  gives loneliness a new kind of meaning.

Because  loneliness is not being alone. It´s the absence of space where you can  share your negative emotions, from time to time, without judgement.

If it´s everyday it´s understandable that people get exhausted. But from Weeks to weeks or months to months?

There´s only one answer to this: F--k them all, but with class.

How?

You recover your life, you pay your debt and then say goodbye to everybody and move on.

1442,danielr088,1570985894,18,"Last night was my first time I’ve hung out with a girl in months since the last girl I was “close with” abruptly left me (also like others in the past) At first I was a bit nervous but it quickly faded and everything ended up going better than I expected.  We walked the piers and the neighborhood surrounding it for a good two and a half hours. She actually became comfortable with me pretty quickly. There weren’t any lull in conversation. At the end of our night, I escorted her to her uber and then went on my way. She ended up texting me first to make sure I got home safe and then she said she was sorry for the way she acted because she was nervous (I didn’t even notice that she was nervous tbh) Then she asked when was the next time we would hang out. 

Now anyone reading this must be thinking “This sub is for lonely people, why are you posting this here?” But I’ve been lonely for so long, not having ANYONE to hangout with every weekend. Every night literally wishing and praying that I’d one day find SOMEBODY. And I finally feel like my prayers and wishes are being granted. It finally feels like someone is genuinely interested in me at least a little bit. But I still understand that it’s still really early. I don’t want to sound like a cynic but I’m still a bit skeptical though. Especially after the last girl I getting closer with left me when everything seemed to be going well.

1447,idxrathernotsay,1570980917,2,"Does anyone else ever feel like that can't breathe even though you know that everything is fine? I'm at the point where I wish I could just flip the ""off"" switch. I would feel bad about it because there are many people who don't want that for me. But I myself don't want to carry on trying.

I'm 24 in less than a month. I moved to a foreign country at the age of 8 and have lived here ever since. I went to school here, I went to college here and now I have been working here for 6 years. I've had friends in my country of origin who dropped off the radar (or I dropped of theirs... I tried contacting them), friends online who disappeared, friends in this foreign country who disappeared... Now I find that every where I look, there is regret.

I've been in two relationships. The first was great for three years, then it became on and off, ""toxic"", for another two until I gave up. We were both immigrants but they outgrew me I guess. I then met someone in one of my most lonely moments and they helped me pick myself up, despite being on another side of this planet. Unfortunately, I guess at this point I was too damaged to be in a normal relationship and I soon destroyed it despite them being possibly one of the single best things that could have happened to me beyond being struck down by lightning.

So today, i find myself speaking to both exes, explaining to the first that wants to help me that they fucked me up beyond repair, and to the other that they was the best thing that could have happened to me. The first wants to get back together because I was to them what my next was to me, but I can't go back. Trust was broken. And the other reads my message but won't answer. They are with someone else, but I don't know if they don't answer because they are with them right now or because they know it's best not to. I hope it's the latter to be honest.

I decided not to go to university unlike everyone of my small peer group, and was the first of my circle of friends to live alone. I thought this would have been a great opportunity for everyone to gather at my place as we were all casual weed smokers, but this was not the case and the few I remained in contact with I believe were just looking for a place to smoke inside.

Even writing this I start to think ""whats the point?"". The truth is that there isn't any. It's just an incoherent wail of what went wrong, and the answer to it is ""why don't you try and move on"". I have.

I'm just tired.

I read a news article on a woman with social anxiety and loneliness in Belgium who is looking to obtain the right to euthanasia. It was the most at peace I have felt in a long time. Work - because if i get fired I'm done: and family - because I don't want my mother to worry, are the only environments that I feel strong enough to soldier on. But more and more and avoid them as much as possible. I don't have the energy to smile any more.

And the worst part? I just want someone to love. But I just feel completely and utterly alien to every single being in this world who opens their mouth. I just want to meet another mute. And hope I don't fuck it all up again.

Be strong every one.

My two older siblings would find me too annoying while my younger sibling enjoyed simply watching my older siblings (or they let them join in as she apparently wasn’t annoying lol). Because of this i’ve kinda been programmed to be ok with just hanging out with myself. As I child I had a vivid imagination and could keep myself entertained for hours simply talking to myself or hanging out with my imaginary friends. 

Now saying this out loud does seem rather sad but honestly I think i’m okay with it, in fact, I tend to enjoy my own company over hanging out with friends. I’ve always been a bit of a loner never quite having a ‘group’ of friends, just a couple close ones here and there who would always tend to leave me for bigger groups.

Never felt anything like it.  Life felt inevitable with her.  Like I was more remembering it than it was happening in real time.  It was so good, I couldn’t believe it sometimes.  Without realizing I was doing it, I started to believe there was something more to the world than what we can see.  Some sort of religious thing I had never believed in before.  Nothing specific like Christianity or whatever, but more like “how could something this good happen by accident”. 
We had 10 good years.  Moved around and lived in different places.  Tried new things.  Mostly we just loved each other and didn’t worry much about anything.  She had a real rare talent for being happy.  Didn’t even know that existed, but it does.  Like being naturally good at running or throwing a ball.  Some people got it, and some don’t.  I don’t, but I was a really good husband.  I think that was my talent.  Anyway.  We found out she had cancer.  
They tried to cure her, and we thought they had for a time, but in the end she didn’t make it.  They took pieces of her out and poisoned her with chemo.  Just taking the fucking biopsies was terrible.  She was scared, but she stayed happy the whole time.  Whatever it is that let’s a person do that is something you are born with.

1463,lifekindablowsrn,1570957535,2,"Get ready this is a long one. 

I’m an extremely social, extroverted person. I love being around people, talking, hanging out, watching movies, clubbing, whatever. That’s totally my scene. In high school, I had a lot of friends, I was friends with pretty much everyone in my graduating class (around 155 people), as well as with people from around 5 different high schools. I thrive off of socialization.

Cut to now, I’m a first year uni student and I live off-campus with my sister, who’s a second year. Naturally, pretty much all of the first years live on-campus, which already makes it difficult to meet people organically. Adding onto that, it’s been tough to befriend people in lectures since everyone is so academically-focused, but I have befriended a handful. Only thing is, almost none of that translates to outside of lectures.

I’ve got a few people I text with, but really nothing substantial. I thought I had my in with the res people since I know someone who lives there, but if I don’t text to hang out, I don’t get invited, so that’s pretty much been given up.

Make things worse, I love to go out once or twice a month. Well, everyone who likes to do that lives on campus, and nobody I meet through lectures likes that scene. But honestly I’m so desperate just to be around people that I go along with pretty much anything they wanna do. I want to be authentic to myself and have fun the way I enjoy, but nobody seems to flow that way.

It’s tough because I see my friends from high school all partying and hanging with friends. I’ve got two high school friends who call me regularly, but every time they do, it’s to complain or talk or cry about their boyfriends. I do the best I can to be a good friend and help them, but I’m getting fed up of being treated like a therapist. Not once do they ask how I’m doing. Not fucking once. I’m honestly getting jaded at their relationship talk. I’ve been in two, one ended because he moved, the other ended because he moved and was cheating on me during long-distance for 6 months. Haven’t had intimacy in any form for a year and 10 months.

Here‘s the kicker. I was in a stupid, preventable accident around two years ago, and got burns on my face and neck. They left some raised scarring on my cheek, chin, and neck. I know logically that it’s nothing major or drastic, but I know it’s noticeable. I am a confident person, I normally don’t give a fuck about them, but on bad days, I can’t help but feel that they’re a hindrance. When I feel lonely, my self-confidence takes a hit, then I start thinking people are noticing or that guys see it and think I look ugly, then I think that maybe if the accident hadn’t happened and if I was with my regular face people would want to be around me, then I isolate myself because I start hating myself for being stupid and causing my accident, yaddah yaddah yaddah and the cycle gets worse.

I’m so fucking lonely. I know I have people to talk to, to hang out with if I initiate it, but I want people to want to hang with me and do stuff that I’m also interested in. I want to have intimacy with someone.  I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me, if I’m just not people’s speed, if people just plain old don’t like me here, I really don’t know. This is such a shock from my high school experience, I honestly wonder if I made the right decision coming here.

I’m not sure what I want really, but I keep deluding myself by saying that I’ll know it when I see it. Somehow by a cruel contradiction, the better I appear to be doing in life, the more lost I feel. Like a stranger in my own skin. Always the black sheep, always the outlier. Not that I don’t like myself. I think I do. Nor do I think I am taken for granted. But it doesn’t exactly alleviate how alone I am deep inside. I know I am appreciated and that I am loved, but somehow, I am numb to the impact I seem to make in other people’s lives. Why does it feel artificial? How can I give and give without a second thought but when I receive it feels alien, like there’s some sort of ulterior motive behind it? Am I some sort of defect incapable of feeling reciprocation? What would others think of me if I told them this? How could I get anyone to understand? I’m just a burden trying to find any semblance of meaning or purpose to my life. Like a ghost, just phasing through people’s bodies. No, I’m not pinning this on anyone. This is all me. I want to truly feel like I matter. I want to feel alive. And more than anything, I want to know why the fuck I’m here if I always go to bed never feeling good enough. It’s not fair. My mind is always at war with itself. I could be in a room filled with the people I love and I will still have a cloud of dread over me. Maybe I should just make my peace with loneliness, accept that it’s here to stay, and that nothing or no one will pull me up from this hole. Just another statistic.

1511,LRN_Trickster,1570907949,18,"How often do we see a movie or read a book about a knight or princess who saves the protagonist from their negative situation and heralds them into a world of bliss and happiness? It is one of the greatest lies or fiction tells us. It is a false miracle of passivity that leads us all into this place seeking answers.

There is no rescue coming. You have to act. Sure, the world seems to just work for other people. There seems to be some kind of machination that delivers people into each other’s arms and no matter how much you burn in secret for attention and affection, it never seems to work for you.

Forget that machine. Even if you were given no other natural gift, you were given agency, volition. Get out there and start changing what you can. Work out, study, take classes, learn skills. Ask people out over and over. Grab the gears of the world that has deemed you unworthy of love and pull and pull until the whole goddamn thing break. Until you are the prime mover of your own life. Show no mercy for fairytale destiny and Hollywood myth. Smile as your childhood romantic fantasies die and are replaced with plans that you made real with aching muscles and tired eyes.

Don’t let all that love you want to share turn into bitter rage. Kindle it into a flame for creation and improvement, and set fire to the stagnant, idle thing you once were.",lonely,There is no rescue coming,2019-10-13 06:19:09

1513,raymondsebond,1570906440,7,"&gt;Yesterday, I thought a lot of books. Every monday, I go to therapy and usually I have lunch, before therapy, in what is a bookshop/restaurant. The food there is good enough and very cheap. Anyway, yesterday I went there and then saw if they had the translation I wanted of Swann's Way. They didn't but I still bought a book: Limonov by Carrère. Emmanuel Carrère is one of the greatest writers of contemporary French literature and I had heard his name, knew some of his works by name and had even read some articles by him, so I thought it was time to get to know more of his literary work. Limonov is a biographical novel about the life of Eduard Limonov, a poet, a writer and a fascist-ish Russian politician. It has been a quite interesting read: Limonov is despicable but his life was (and, I presume, still is) fascinating. Carrère's writing is very honest. I do like buying books. I feel some kind of pleasure when I do. I buy books for many reasons: because I have heard of their authors, because of their publishing houses (yeah), because of their covers. I bought Limonov because of its cover and because I had heard of its author.

That's a paragraph I sent someone. That does summarize my life quite a bit: literature, therapy and France. I've loved France since I was a child (for real); I'm in therapy and I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar; and I love literature and I love writing. Last year, I was interning at a bank and I bought more than seventy books with my salary. I'm compulsive. I love Tolstoy, Faulkner, T.S. Eliot and many others; and I know I might sound arrogant because of this, so I should say I cried at Gossip Girl's finale. Really cried. I loved Gossip Girl. I also love Tintin. Why am I telling you this? Because you might love Tintin as well. Or you might be Belgian: if you are Belgian, please I thank you all for Tintin.

Besides literature, being mentally ill, and having a love for France, I also have a bit of enthusiasm for cinema. I have helped to direct a short film and I just learned it is going to compete in a festival. I'm quite excited. I also just decided I want to study Anthropology in uni. I'm particularly fascinated by Africa. I'm quite excited. I also want to be a diplomat and for that I need to have command of the English language -- I've even thought about studying English abroad, somewhere like Australia, Ireland or New Zealand (if you're from these countries, I'd love to talk). I'd love to talk more about being mentally ill, about loving France (and not knowing French) and many others countries, about politics, literature, cinema, about Tintin and many other things. I'd love to share my writing, to exchange books and chocolate. I'd love you to be from anywhere, be you from India, Australia, France, Switzerland, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Suriname or Luxembourg.

Also, as I previously mentioned my best friend is in a relationship and most of my guy friends spend the weekends now with their other friends so I now just feel disposable and like a last resort for people. It has gotten to the point where I look forward to being in school as I know the weekends will either be lonely or I will just drink excessively and do something I regret.

  I've always listened to my friends problems, their life stories, and their days. They lived a happy and interesting life while I'm just here, listening. I feel like a wall because people can just talk to me about their life while I'll be there, doing nothing. Even so, they'll still be satisfied and I'll be kinda jealous of how them.

  I tried once. I tried being them and talked to someone about myself. It sucks because I feel like they're bothered and bored by me. So I stopped. I never talked about my emotions or my problems. It's gotten to a point where I made a groupchat. A groupchat that consists of only me and myself.

  It sounds weird but I talk to myself. It feels kind of weird but nice at the same time. I pretend there's someone reading it and I can let go of all my thoughts that's been in my head and nobody couod judge me. I don't have to worry about people finding me weird or people leaving me because of things I said. I can vent my anger out and my emotions out and nobody would know and be bothered. I can organise my thoughts, talk about my day and just say whatever is on my mind

1523,BurnDeeHouse,1570894632,1,"So I've changed a lot since I was a kid, not like in an edgy way, *im scarred youd never understand me.* Yeah no, not that. Anyway, when I was a kid I was a loudmouth and a tomboy and pretty social, also a complete dunce. I had a few close friends one of them is still with me. As I got older I got into video games and learning stuff on my time through things like game theory and other fun shows, taking in history, science, not math I still suck at math. I also stopped hanging out with the friends I made, along with the fact the friends I had made didn't share much in common with me. I started hockey and found a good friend, but we didn't see each other often, but that didn't bother me much at the time. Everything was chill I got a good amount of social interaction through school, then I'd go home play some games, go to hockey, then home again.; I had no problem with it. Then I went to a boarding school, (my parents didn't ship me off, I was struggling with school, and I wanted to go anywhere that would help) My first year was okay and then everything fell apart, I accepted the fact i was trans (not gonna go into that, don't worry I'm not an SJW), halfway through my sophomore year I had to be put on anti-depressants. I had a grouop of friends, but I only hung out with them sometimes not too often because I have a really bad case of either everyone loves me, or everyone hates me and is only nice cause I'm the speacial kid. I isolated myself whenever I could, I stopped eating, not like an anorexic, I just didn't want to do anything including eat. I got to the point of being borderline suicidal, and by the end of the winter term, the school said I was a manic depressant and I couldn't be trusted to sleep on campus under the worry I'd hurt myself or off myself. I stayed with my mother off-campus. And for the rest of the year, I just kinda let myself slowly fade away. I guess one silver lining of the hell I had put myself through was I became extremely close to my parents, when you feel like a worthless piece of shit but your parents are constantly there for you, its something else, if they weren't as involved as they were I not sure how that would have played out. Now cue the beginning of my junior year, I got most of my shit together I work out 4 days a week, I do my work, but my whole friend group from last year graduated, I still have a really bad case of I'm either the messiah or I'm a pest to everyone. On the days I don't work out I feel like a piece of shit, I can't and won't open up to anyone other than my family or a therapist. When I talk to people I keep the subject always on them because if it's on me and they seem uninterested I just kinda collapse. I come off as the really smart yet angry kid, I have a very bad case of bitch face. Lifes fine but it's like 10% I'm on top of the world 60% I'm okayish 30% ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. I have no close friends up here, there are probably plenty of kids who I could get closer to but like I'm either incredibly observant or overthink things with an exponent of 10. And I get so lonely, I blow steam off in the gym but then if I wanna stay chill I cannot go back out in public or the smallest stuff will send me right back to hell. And I am so goddam lonely I just want someone I can chill with, just be able to say stuff without worrying will this ruin whatever we currently have, just a kind of unconditionaly support. I also would love a relationship but 1) when I think or figure out people like me it makes me extremely uncomfortable, the girl could be an absolute 10 but I'd run for the hills, 2) Due to the tr\*nny(pls don't crucify me for this word I really think reclaiming words and using them casually is important) shit I am extremely uncomfortable with how I look, even though I look a lot like a dude, broad shoulders kinda deep voice, short but not like midget level, I'm actually pretty damn atractive, but I am still ya know XX on closer inspection. I'd love to have a girlfriend who I care and love unconditionally, and  so like I want to be able to get into some stuff (like hell I'm going to though till I have all the hormone and surgery shit taken care of) But like I don't do anything to go out and get one, Girlfriend or friend, doesn't help when I feel like shit all I want todo is receed into my room and fucking explode, scream cry beat the shit out of something. I'm kinda a dick to my friends, (in like a playful way) and will buy them shit then say in return they're not allowed to talk to me for a full day, (which could be perceived badly) But I'm like a Bernese mountain dog at heart (i know its normally golden retriever at heart, but I have a Bernese) if some just smiles nicely at me when we pass, I'd probably take a bullet for them. Like we have an Italian transfer kid, the dudes huge, but he's really chill and we share class, and he will answer questions I ask and overall a welcoming guy, barely talk to him but like I'd die for him (no homo) same with almost every person whos just nice to me.

I want to write all the selfish things to him. I want to tell him I need him and I'm suicidal and please come home, please talk to me, please don't let me be alone anymore, but he's out of contact atm

1536,counting_sheeps1,1570876809,5,"There are few things that make me more blissful and at peace with my life than being cared about and feeling validated.

It's not about being popular, it's about genuine relations and human warmth. Having someone to hug, to trust, that enjoys my presence, and that cares. Just like most other people have for granted, and have them effortlessly. Its a feeling of bliss that gives some meaning to my ephemeral existence which consists on short sparks of happiness filled by large intervals of indifference, frustration and sadness.

But it's so fucking hard. I try so much, I get through so much shit, so many attempts trying to go to places, meet people and talk to them just to come home with the memory of everyone interacting and enjoying each other, hugging, and holding hands while I was just part of the background. I try the best I can to fake a smile and act like everything's great and I am having a great time, but no one cares. So I reach a point where I can't hold anymore and I simply start staring at the walls trying not to cry, and yet, no one cares. And I go away, and no one even asks if I am doing fine. Every attempt just makes me much worse than I was before.

I just want to find a place to belong to. I wanna be hugged so much, not by someone offering free hugs to random people or just out of kindness. I wanted someone that hugged me for the appreciation of the warmth that I transmit, if I do transmit any warmth at all. I cannot come with any other explanation for this in my life but that I am indeed, somehow, considerably less desirable than regular people, or maybe even repulsive. Some kind of disgusting human being in some form I cannot recognize. I am going through this for so many years and I have tried so many things and acting so many ways, but it never works...

Everyday I am more convinced that isolating myself and accepting this state of affairs as a natural consequence of my conditions will prevent me from distressing myself more. I wanna hate myself more than everyone else so I won't feel any more pain because of it.

Sorry for wasting your time, reader. I just have no one else to share this with, so I am sharing it here. Probably the worst possible place. No need to be kind if this text has somehow bothered you, be it because of my drama or for some other reason. As I said, I am trying to accept my condition, and so unleashing your anger and discontempt at me would very likely help me with that. And you surely won't be able to hate me more than I do.

1551,DrBurnside,1570856708,4,"I don't believe I had a single close friend for most of my life. Near the end of that period, I felt a kind of loneliness that shrank the value of any friendship I had at the time. When I had my first and only close friend, an online friend to be specific, I'm confident that she was the thing I valued most in my life. That friendship presented me with the opportunity to be more lonely, and I took it. It further shrank the value of existing friendships, and I had too much of a drive to invest in that relationship. A solution is to make more close friends.

My problem with loneliness is much older than my Reddit account. I started taking small steps to resolve my issue using Reddit, something I have used nearly constantly (perhaps unhealthily), since the day I made my account. Notice my account's age, and when I started being truly active here. That's basically at least a year of me being in the same state.

Right now, I'm in a better situation. I've interacted with a few people, some I don't interact with anymore, some I infrequently interact with, and one I'm confident I'll be close friends with. That'll be two close friends. So it works. I could have done this around a year earlier. 11 more of these fruitful and happier months. 12 times the opportunities. That's a lot, and I feel better with only one month.

This unfortunately doesn't do a lot to help someone who has problems initiating an interaction with someone new. Think of the time you've lost. Try to break the world record for fastest comment made, or fastest direct message sent. I don't want you to think of how you'll open. Just a random number or character or letter will be fine, as long as the text is sent faster than you can think to change your mind. Remember your lost time, and think of the time you may lose if you delay.

You might be worried that this will go poorly, or you might do something stupid. That's fine, as long as you persist. If it helps, I fell in love with the first person I interacted with here within four days of meeting them, only to learn that the feelings she had only came out of alcohol. I've learned from that, not to be naive, and not to rush things. I hope you'll learn with me if things don't go well. I persisted and carried what I learned, to different people, and now things are good. It gets easier the more you do it.

I hope you get blessed with a need for action. I invite others to try and engage with anyone commenting here. I also recommend r/MeetPeople as a way of... meeting people.

I grew up in a mentally abusive household.  I was the 8th child in my family. My older siblings wouldn’t socialize with me that much as a kid. I talked with my older brother (7th kid) a lot back then. My dad  worked during the day so I never saw him. My mom was consumed with church and my grandma (dads side) lived with us. She was very controlling of my mom. So my mom did not want to raise us with her there, so she chose to pray for our lives to get better and neglected us. 

Growing up, I didn’t know how to interact with people. At home I was pretty lonely most of the time. Before I started school my siblings bullied me and told me my voice sounded more masculine so I was ashamed to speak infront of others. So I was known as the mute girl and as you know being mute isn’t good for making friends. So I had none. 

When we moved and I was starting 5th grade I told myself I would start talking. But I didn’t know how to engage in conversations. And everyone knew each other from the previous years. I was pretty shy and kept to myself. Some people tried to talk to me. But I didn’t know how to reply. So it never went anywhere. 

Senior year of high school, there was a swimming lesson and I almost drowned. And when I was in the water I thought to myself. I’m gonna die and I honestly don’t mind. Nothing is going on in my life. But then a lifeguard saved me and I went home right after. I never told anyone about it. That was the first time I cried so much and realized how pathetic my life really was.  

And here I am at age 24 thinking I should have died that day. I have no idea what I’m doing in life. I have no friends. I’m surprised I found a boyfriend. But now my negativity from my past trauma is tainting our relationship. I’m extremely depressed and have so much social anxiety. I don’t like life.

1573,measlybastard,1570842965,2,"**LONG ASS VENT AHEAD:**


I have one friend, a good friend. We’ve been friends for about 8 years now. Of course we were really close a long time ago, when we were kids, but since high school started and she started socializing we’ve grown apart significantly. But it’s fine because we still hang out once a month or so. I really appreciate having that connection in my life. 

But it’s sucks because that’s my only connection, besides family and counsellors. I can’t befriend counsellors; it’s a rule. Plus they don’t stay. They’re not allowed to. And I have social anxiety so it’s nearly impossible to try and makes friends at school. I can barely string together a simple sentence without my anxiety making me stumble my words. I’m working through it but it’s hard. 

Though there’s one thing that makes me hesitant about even attempting to start a conversation with someone. 

One day I was having a conversation with said friend. She told me she doesn’t really like this person that she hangs out with but they have this one redeeming quality that makes it worth it to hang out with them. I wondered what mine was so I asked. She thought about it for a little while and finally said she doesn’t know. I pushed a little more because I’m annoying like that and she was getting tired of me annoying her so she said just said I’m nice. I didn’t believe her, though. I’m not so nice that it would be my one redeeming quality. At least not with her. So a few days later I asked again. This time she said she didn’t know and that the reason why we’re friends is because we’ve been friends for a long time. And I thought about it. It’s true. I really don’t have any redeeming qualities. So why should I even try to make friends? It’s not going to work. I’d be a terrible friend because I’m a terrible person. She told me I’m clueless and a downer. She often looks at me as though I said the weirdest thing ever. I can’t handle being so terrible. I wish I wasn’t who I was. I am strange and scary and depressing and crazy. 

I wish I had a person to come to school and hang out with with. Just one. Just one person to share a strong connection with. I know I need to put in the effort but I can’t right now. I’m not expecting them to come to me or anything, I’m just too scared to talk. I can only wish right now.",lonely,I have one friend [long vent],2019-10-12 12:16:05

She was the third girl in a row to either ghost me or text me out of the blue and block me before I could say anything.
I know theres no solution to my loneliness other than to just go out or join some kind of community. I joined a gym yesterday but my ex’s best friend goes there coincidentally and that just hurt.

Everybody used to underestimate me and my skills just because the way I look and it's been 20 years now and people still do that, not much though. This kind of environment lead me to become the quiet kid in class who rarely asks questions or gets into fights. I'm an introvert and I feel very strange being one because I think that either I'm less of an ordinary person or I'm better than others which more or less makes me feel like a weirdo. 

Due to my insecurities, I could never get a girlfriend in school and when I finally had the confidence to express my feelings to any girl who I've liked till now, either they would reject me or give me false hopes and finally date someone else who is better looking than me and has lots of money to spend. Just a year ago, I developed feelings for a girl who I had know since 2016, and I guess she was the only one who really wanted to date me for me being me. We used to talk everyday, asking about how our day went, what events happened and all that kinda stuff (be both lived in different cities). She was a fan of my singing. She was one of the reasons I had started singing again after damaging my vocal chords after excessive smoking. I also did sing a song for her birthday which was in May. This was the month where we would start talking less and I was confused that did she really like me or was just using me to entertain herself. It still hurts whenever I think about my experience with women. 

I'm currently a college student. I have developed a better personality here. I mix with everyone, I help anyone who is in need, I try to help my classmates when I see them mentally stressed or disturbed, I can now give a speech confidently in front of my class. While this daily routine kept going on and on, I realized that I do things for people which I have never got from anyone. I never had a friend who'd make me feel less miserable about myself. Neither did I have a good relationship with my family. There would be disagreements with my family on a daily basis. This would make me feel irritated most of the times. 

The point is I know that I have the capabilities to become a successful man in the future, I'll have everything I had ever wished for but I guess I'll always be lonely and will never have friends who act like your pillars and will never find someone who falls for me and not for my looks or my financial status.",lonely,Felt alone since school.,2019-10-12 06:10:13

To this day i have still never had a friend that wasnt online, in school i was bullied alot and eventually i just stopped trying to make friends in school. I would just go read a book in the corner and avoid all other kids, threw school i spent a great deal of time suicidal i would think about it almost everyday.

The only thing that kept me going threw school were my frineds online, playing World of Warcraft a had a few close friends that i would play with almost daily and 15 years later i still consider them friends but sadly we dont get to talk much anymore since they are all grown up now with wives and kids and dont have time for gaming anymore, now without them I really have no friends anymore.

I dont think ill ever have a relationship because even today i dont know what i am sexuality wise, I dont feel attracted to men or women the only thing that has ever gotten me excited is crossdressing (i know weird) and that just gets me even more depressed, forget the fact that i cant make friends and all that but im not even attracted to other people men or women so that just lends credence to the idea i will be alone forever...

I also have no career of any kind, i work retail just enough to pay my bills, as stupid as this sounds i think of the show big bang theory and think to myself how said those characters where at the start when they had friends and successful careers but no relationships, i have none of that, friends career or relationship, just nothing alone everyday.

We can only pursue a life of undetermined meaning; a path we have to carve for ourselves. There is no metaphysical safety blanket of which we can fall upon. The immediacy of being hurtled into an unforgiving world is what makes life particularly difficult; the uncertainty of what the future has in store for us. This existential ennui encapsulates the human condition. 

Life is tapestry of mishaps and pleasantries. However, in its entirety, existence in itself is a tragedy. But the future beckons to us. We can only make sense of the world through the best of our abilities. Everyone is seeking a friend or significant other to either find meaning through kinship or to suffer together. We must remain indifferent to that which makes no difference. We can't change the past, but we can work towards a positive future.

1631,IamKogan,1570767802,2,"I'm 27, and for as long as I can remember I was always the person on the outside of the group. With ""friends"" I was the person they came to when nobody else was around, and when they were around I was always the object of ridicule. Even at my current job, I'm just the target for every single mean joke. With family I'm always the one left out of events. The last person I connected to and was with for 4 years had left me for another guy, and when he left her while pregnant, she tried to say it was mine. People constantly tell me I'm being pessimistic but all I see is a pattern of being the person nobody actually wants around. 

The only friend I have now is on the opposite side of the world, and she has a family so I step aside so I'm not trying to take away time from her kids. But when I try to make more friends, I become that outlier again. Out in public, nobody pays any attention to me. Online, I'm told I'll be invited to group things but nobody ever shoots me a message. It's always just me, sitting in silence, wondering if there is any reason for me to even keep trying. When I talk to people, the main response I get is ""It can't be that hard to make friends."" It is for me, and it hurts being in solitude.

1643,hamartiated,1570761019,9,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

1667,stingrayrodriguez,1570736559,2," 

22F here, new to here, new to reddit, new to being lonely. Over the summer I had a ton of friends, I was meeting new people on a weekly basis. Everywhere I go at least three people would ask to add me on Snapchat. I hung out with someone every single day. It all kind of fell apart and died at the same time, which happens to coincide with the time I moved.

I had an awful relationship with my dad and stepmom who I lived with. I spent almost every night somewhere else. Finally I was able to afford to escape and move out, and now I live alone in my own apartment. That was a month and almost two weeks ago, my dad hasn’t spoken to me since, and my mom was never in my life to begin with. I feel like I have no parents, no one who is there for me, and no one who loves me in the way that family should.

I had like two best friends. One of them, 21F, got a boyfriend about 6 months ago, her first boyfriend, and he has already moved in with her (he did after 3 months) and they spend every day and night together. He’s actually great and their relationship is great, she is happy for the first time and it is amazing to see, but I have seen her like 5 times since then. I come up with all these fun things to do with her and she straight up says no and that she doesn’t want to, then won't answer me for days. 

My other best friend was my ex, 24M. We had mutually decided about 6 months ago that we are better off as friends together. He was my closest friend, I told him everything. One night when I was talking about how lonely I felt due to feeling abandoned by my family and other friends, he absolutely lost it and said that he didn’t care about my feelings, my emotions, my life, or me at all, and that if I bring up my feelings again to him he cannot be in my life anymore. 

Since then I have had no one to talk to. I put all my thoughts and feelings into a giant Word document now. There’s no one I talk to on a daily basis. I started getting drunk every night for three weeks straight, I stopped this past Saturday because I was worried about becoming dependent on alcohol.

I have lost all interest in meeting new people, I am sick of people because to me everyone I know is a fake friend. Friendship is so valuable to me, I would do anything for any of my friends, but none of my friends will even listen to my thoughts or feelings or hang out with me anymore. In my opinion friends should care about each other and be there for each other. No one was excited for me for moving out and being on my own. Yet if any of my friends were moving out I would die from excitement and want to be involved in every step of the way, and chill at their place constantly. Someone was supposed to help me move because he had a truck but he ghosted me, and I moved everything by myself in my little sedan, taking about five trips back and forth, carrying everything down the street to the building and up the stairs, about one box at a time out of like a hundred boxes, plus it was pouring rain when I did it. No one wanted to help me.

I hate these conflicting feelings of wanting to be close with someone so bad but not wanting to either. I know I wouldn’t be able to handle one more person getting close with me and then telling me they do not give a shit about my thoughts or feelings or life. I want to learn to be content alone and to accept that I will always be alone. Sometimes I feel empowered when I think about how alone I am and how I am completely by myself in life, but other times it cripples me with pain. Is it possible to become content with being alone? If not, does it at least get easier?",lonely,Does it get easier?,2019-10-11 06:42:39
1668,Weirddatingquestion,1570736462,1,"i grew up very conservative and the result is a lot of baggage about sexuality. At this point mentally I'm pretty comfortable with the idea of being sexual but I still have a lot of uncomfortable emotions and embarrassment about it.

I want to find a person or a group of people who are open about sex to talk with it about (online) and who can help me get comfortable just saying what I'm thinking. In the past (years ago) I met someone and she talked with me and it helped some but she ended up getting a boyfriend and moving and we ended up losing touch. I don't really know how to find something like that again.

I live -mostly- alone (I share an apartment with my sister but she hasn’t been here in weeks)
The only person i’ve talked to for the past two weeks is my mom, and i only see her on the weekends.

I feel like i have no *true* friends anymore.
I dropped out of school in March, and have been trying to get a job since then but have had little-no success.

The last time I saw any of my friends was in september. I’m really bad at asking people to hang out because I feel like a burden, I feel guilty for everything and feel like I mess up every social interaction I’m in.

I’ve gradually become more and more isolated from my friends since dropping out, most of my friends went to the same school so we were almost forced to hang out.

My best friend as stopped contacting me, she only talks to me when I start the conversation which isn’t how our relationship usually works.

I feel like she’s replaced me with her new roommate and her new friends (who are some of my friends too). I don’t blame her either, I’m hard to love, I’m unstable and have a tendency to isolate myself from the world for weeks at a time. 

I desperately want to just talk to someone, but I don’t feel like I know any of them well enough, and I feel like they all just deal with me because of my best friend and the fact that we went to the same school.

1675,ProgressRoute,1570726369,0," 

Everytime I park my car I look for my friend's car. He has a girlfriend of course. A nice one, cooks for him, cares for him, because he has a big dick of course. He leaves with his gf in his car, or picks up his female friends because I see the spot where his car used to be occupied by other car. This means he used it and usually with his GF or female friends.

My car stays empty nonetheless.

The way I look now, I will never have female friends. Especially in Eastern Europe, because I am on Zoloft (depression) pill and can't drink so I can't socialize.

I am also short (175 cm / 5.9"") and have a small dick (15.5 cm / 6.2 inches)

I also scroll a lot on facebook and once had a folder with my colleagues from work/high school/college in bathing suits, and it would turn me on like shit. I used to put Windows Photo on slide show mode and set my self on the couch jacking off as their bodies appeared on the screen.

I have a thing for navels and bellies. I asked a female classmate ones to send me some gathering photos for like six months because I would have loved to spray my load while watching that. Took some very old color phone to the bathroom with 128 x 160 resolution and zoomed on the belly. If it was flat, I was horny. Didn't care about anything else that much.

That started when I was 15 and now at 26 I still get turned on. Three weeks ago I found some pale white classmate's photo and she was in a bikini.

I snip them to get the important part of the body. Even though she was with her boyfriend in photo I took just her part and took a condom a jacked off in it.

I used to search for a girl's bikini or some other skin showing outfit which would expose navel and maybe training bra or bra for hours . Scrolling through instagram and fb posts installing extensions on chrome which would yield me their friend's of friend's photos.

Kept myself on edge until I found the right photo.",lonely,Watching Chad,2019-10-11 03:52:49

I'm used with being alone all the time, but when the lonely hits, it hits me so hard. This week has been hard for me. It's funny how yesterday in the shower, I was thinking, ""Fuck, I'm gonna make it through all this shit, I'm gonna fucking make it"". And today in the shower the ""I want to die"" thoughts is back. 

I'm starting to sleeping a lot again. And I constantly crying again. I draw depressed shit and sing sad songs and it doesn't help. I want to talk to someone but I'm afraid if I'm gonna disturb them. When I go to class and talk to people, sometimes it helps but no one's is close enough to hang out with.

1684,Creepaface,1570718865,1,"I'm 16. My family has lives way busier than mine and I struggle to find time to see any of them. Ill be wasting their time anyway. It's hard being in public and not having anyone to laugh with and share secrets with or just anyone by my side. Then again i'm an introvert so I perfer to stay indoors but thats besides the point. It's just too hard to be myself because I'm the one who wants to feel love and get love and give love, but I was smart enough to stop myself from giving into peer pressure and toxic people. Yet still feeling empty inside could be worse than at least having someone there even if they are a brainless prick. But it's too late to change my mind. Instead I get to watch all these jocks and stuck-ups and wannabe gangsters and soldiers get all the praise and not even appreciate it. Fuck that. Fuck them. Sometimes I decide to be myself until the day I borrow Kurt Cobain's microphone or die of old age or even die of a brain aneurysm in the middle of the night so I wont have to endure the pain of my untimely demise. Despite the hard facts I face almost everyday, I have heard from my family and a few of my friends that I guess I'm really smart guy, maybe I was a little funny and had a few unique things about me, but no one would want to invest the time to find out those things or even listen to me talk about my personal projects and ideas. Being ignored to the bone and an outcast to everyone, especially by my own blood, creates a terrible amount of depression that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. It also feels like every time I want to make friends I just get momentary praise or I get dragged along by someone so they won't damage their social status or ego. Fuck that. I'm also tired of people saying that they have it way worse than me. It makes me believe i'm not allowed to be sad. Like I don't deserve to feel depressed, which is very meta and I dont know what to say to that. I remember back to some of my friends that I had where I would talk with them and do favors for them and when I asked if they wanted to hang out, the reply would always be ""Oh sorry. I'm busy."" or something like that. And the only thing you could reply to that was ""Oh ok. Sorry"" because if you even dared to question why they always reject your invitations, you can consider yourself dead to them. This whole life that I live is just a cycle of dullness that will never be cleaned, like a rust spot on a piece of a car that wont go away. And yet my cousins have such better lives than me and i'm not too far from their age. One is living with her german gamer boyfriend and their all hunky dory in love. One is  an aspiring abstract artist. One is a body builder that actually got signed by a fucking company. One is still in ASU but has a network of friends and plays Steam games with them when not at school. But I guess I wasnt born under the right circumstances to be a successful person. At best I'll be some coder or game designer that comes home late to a wife struggling with some mental disorder and a kid going through the same perils I'm going through right now. Its just hard not to think about suicide nowadays when everyone you know has much better and busier lives than you and your left with a community of hood rats and scumbags that all want something out of you. Its hard to find real friends and have someone to talk to and vent to and get support when I'm having a bad day. Not even one person to share a singular deep thought with. Even though I dont want to change for people, I hate who I have become. I dont know if being dumb makes me smart or being smart makes me dumb. I remember a lot of stupid shit ive done pretty often. It races around my brain like an earworm and it just cant be ignored. Believe me I've tried. Some days I just want to straight up die. I'm fascinated by existentialism. What does it really feel like to die? To eat a bullet, to burn to death, to fall face first onto hard pavement. And afterwards, do we go anywhere? Heaven? Hell? Afterlife? Ascension? Are there any gods to answer my questions? Anyone out there in the great unknown? I guess I'll never know. And I dont want to know. My life is for a very lonely soul, but I know I don't really want to die. I just want the pain to end. But it never will end, even if I try. So I dont know what to do anymore. Maybe one day I'll get lucky and be diagnosed with cancer or some other life ending disease, because then I wouldnt have to worry about if I want to be alive next week. I'll get an expiration date. I know fully fucking well that I dont have it the worst, but it dosent change the fact my only source of community are suicide hotlines. I need help. I don't know how I'll get help, but I need help. I don't care to text someone either. I want to hear someones voice. I want to see someone's smile. I want to hug someone as they hug me back.

I never really had tons of friends. I've always been okay with having 2-3, I'm not a big group kind of person. I got my first boyfriend when I was a junior in high school. I got pregnant the end of that school year, so I didn't attend my senior year with the rest of my classmates. Me and my friends pretty much drifted apart (besides one) who is mostly too busy to talk now. I've tried calling a few times, but the calls would on to ever be 2-3 minutes max. I see her snaps of her spending time with all these new people. I really miss her. 

My boyfriend still hangs out with his friends from time to time. Even if he doesn't, he still has online friends to talk to (seige, of anyone cares.) I only really had one before I got pregnant, which was crocheting. Super time consuming. I work 2 jobs and I go to school so I don't get to do it anymore. When I am home, I have to take care of the baby. I understand, she's my responsibility and I love her. I can hardly remember when I could just stop and breathe and not worry about how I'm gonna get through the that of the day. 

I love my boyfriend. We live together, and are around each other 24/7. I'm really happy with him. It's just that we know each other so well and that we're with each other so much that honestly, it doesn't really feel like someone else is in the room. Like it's just me. Does that make sense? It's not necessarily a bad feeling, but a tad lonely.  

I have no one to talk to besides him. There are things that I can't tell him that I wish I could say to someone. Literally anyone, but I can't. I've tried talking to my mom about it. All she said was ""that's what everyone warned you about. That's just one of the many prices you'll have to pay."" My boyfriend thinks if I would have just kept talking to them, we wouldn't have drifted, but he doesn't understand. Before I was pregnant, we would like, bowl, go swimming, smoke weed. Once I got pregnant, my stamina was so low, I was sleeping 15 hours a day my first and third trimesters (when I wasn't working, of course.) My pregnancy never stopped him from seeing others.

1704,ClassicNIndie96,1570685595,1,"I was with my ex for 6 months. I am very dedicated when in a relationship. I do my best to please. In my last relationship, I did everything I could to make her happy. I would show her love and affection. When she needed space, I gave her space. When she wanted to hang with friends, I let her. I let her choose places to eat because she was picky. I was okay with taking things slow when she wasn't comfy. She was never around much and she said we texted too much. I did what she wanted from me. 

I tried to do small stuff like let her know how much I cared. I would say stuff like, ""Wow can you believe how long we've been together?"" She'd never dated someone longer than 4 months and me 2 months. So I made a small emphasis on months together. She despised it so I stopped. She also needed alone time when she was busy. I wanted to give her a study basket during finals but I knew she'd get mad if I bothered her.

When she dumped me, she said, ""You say you love me but you never show it."" We had just had our 6 month anniversary. She had been annoyed by month anniversaries so I waited for her to say anything before I said anything. She didn't like month anniversaries. She got mad that I didnt say anything at first or plan anything. 

She got mad at me that I never planned anything but she was the one who was always too busy and would immediately plan with friends when she's free rather than seeing if I would be available soon. And she got annoyed about not talking enough sometimes. This literally from a woman who said, ""we text too much.""

1706,ClassicNIndie96,1570684697,2,"I seem to always do wrong no matter what I do and it causes me to be alone a lot. The following are a few examples.

1. When I started my one job, I would try to make small talk with people. I've been taught it's always good to start from a common ground, so I would try to discuss interesting work stuff and see where it led. I was looked at as being just weird. I would later find out from a friend that they were talking about me behind my back about how weird it is that I talked about work.

2. I get judged for ""judging."" I dont know if it's how I say things, but I get complained about a lot for things that are taken the wrong way. Recently I was trying to answer a women's question on how to prevent roaches and she took it to me calling her dirty and laughing at her. People take nearly anything I say as a judgement of what their choice is. 

3. People assume immediately every aspect of me based on my interests. They assume I've never faced hardships because I grew up middle class and white. They judge me based on my choice to willingly study physics. They dont bother to want to try to see that I lost a woman I cared about in the worst way possible or that I care about the arts as much as science. They see some large obese white guy and assume he's more of a raging bull instead of being like Ferdinand. 

I try to be social, kind, caring, and yet people seem to despise everything I do. I'm not saying that I deserve anything for trying to be a good person. Far from it.

1724,hamartiated,1570670020,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-10-10 12:13:40

1752,carrieesson,1570638433,51,"I got rejected straight after sex last night. 

A couple of weeks ago I started dating someone. I told him the first time I went back to his that sex for me is not a casual thing, that it means something and is an emotional thing for me, and that it needs to be with someone I trust. Due to this I was pretty much celibate for a while, and he listened and understood and agreed to take it slowly. 

We kept seeing each other quite often within the space of a few weeks, and I didn’t sleep with him. He would always say he wanted to see me again etc. Then he asked me to stay over at his house last night so I went there after uni with pyjamas and clothes for the next day and everything. 

The night was going well and we were cuddling watching movies. I just felt comfortable and ended up sleeping with him. 10 minutes later as we are cuddling, he tells me he doesn’t want a relationship with me. 

I tried my very best to keep my cool. I didn’t raise my voice or shout or cry even though all I felt inside was turmoil. I said to him, ‘could you not have told me this before sleeping with me?’ 

He stuttered and kept playing with his hair and could barely look at me in the eye. I asked for an explanation as to why he treated me like this and he kept stuttering and giving me bullshit excuses. He went on about how he’s so happy being single and on his own, so I said ‘well why are you dating then?’ And he kept saying he didn’t know, and he didn’t know what he wanted. He told me that he has only ever been in one relationship that lasted 5 months and I am the first girl he has been actively seeing since her, and that was almost 2 years ago, and he doesn’t know how to be in a relationship. I kept saying he should have told me this before and that I had been treated unfairly and he kept stuttering and saying sorry over and over. The more he said sorry the more angry I got inside but tried not to show it. 

One minute he was saying that he wanted to keep seeing me because he ‘liked’ me and thought I was ‘great’, but it was okay for me to see other people because he might not want it to ‘go anywhere’ so I should keep my options open. The next minute he was saying to me that we should just leave it at that and not bother seeing each other again at all to see where it would go. 

He said I was great and he enjoyed spending time with me, but he wasn’t ‘feeling it’. I asked him what that meant because if he wasn’t ‘feeling it’ then why would he have me round to his house, never mind sleep with me? Why would he keep asking to see me again if he wasn’t ‘feeling me it? Then he said he did that because he wanted to and he wanted to see how he felt after the night. I have never felt so angry and really tried my best to keep my cool. I felt totally disgusted as he was basically saying it wasn’t that he didn’t want a relationship, that he in fact didn’t like me at all (even though one minute he was saying he did), and he just wanted to see what the sex would be like before probably ghosting me.

In a calm manner I told him everything that I thought about him. I said it was morally wrong and disgusting to use someone for sex - especially knowing how that person feels about sex - and lead them on without being honest. I told him it was despicable behaviour. I told him I was glad he has showed me his true colours now rather than later, and he’s done me a favour. He kept saying he didn’t want it to go further incase I caught feelings and I pointed out that he was projecting his own fear on to me and ending things out of a hypothetical fear. And I also told him to get his head out his arse if he thinks girls will fall in love with him. I told him I deserved better, and he should think about the way he treats others and have a bit of empathy. He said he felt really bad, and I told him good because he should, and walked out the door. 

It took me over an hour to get home but as soon as I got in to my bed I felt a sense of relief. I was on the phone to my friend for 3 hours today venting. Part of me feels so angry, used and disgusted, another part of me is relieved and happy I can move on with my life, and of course another part of me is fighting those feelings of rejection, wondering what’s wrong with me, why didn’t he like me, what could I have done differently, am I that bad? I’m angry at myself, I’m angry at him. I’m so upset and fed up of being disrespected and treated like I am worthless and not good enough for people. 

I am having self doubting thoughts. I feel so unwanted and dirty. Rationally, I know that this isn’t a reflection on me, I just feel like an absolute joke, like I am being laughed at and constantly made a fool out of. I’m having dark thoughts saying it’s because I’m fat, ugly, unfunny, etc  Even though I’m a size 8. I feel like I’m too nice that it bores people. The time in my life when I was mentally unstable, insecure, unpredictable with no job, no degree prospects and drinking constantly was the time where men seemed to want me. Now I’ve actually got my shit together and have went to therapy and am (trying) to learn emotional maturity no one wants me.

We usually do football on sundays and lately it just hasn't been happening. This has always been an issue of mine where I feel like things are going great and then poof it's either no reply or cancelling...

NAMI is the national alliance of mental illness and they personally helped me get in contact with a psychiatrist when i needed it most. I started my organization, propositivity, to try to raise mental health awareness and ultimately help people get in touch with the resources they need.

I stream at [twitch.tv/spidermojo](https://twitch.tv/spidermojo) and I would love if you would come by and just talk about mental health or drop a donation for the national alliance of mental illness (: Any help is appreciated be it a follow, a donation, or a twitch subscription. You are all such great people and I want to try and make a difference together!

My schedule is as follows:  
Wednesday 8-10:30  
Thursday: 9-11 (subject to change)  
Friday - off  
Saturday - Noon-5  
Sunday 1PM - Monday 1PM OR LATER (24 hour stream to raise more money!!!)

Come by any of these times and please please please come support this cause because we can truly make a difference together (:

Love all,

I have strong opinions and I can be too much sometimes, but at the same time I can be shy and listen other peoples worries and be the listening buddy.

I think my habit is just to gain more people around me since for example I never had a best friend. I was the extra wheel. I was fine with it really and still this day I feel like I have multiple best friends and not just one. But still I look in the mirror and wonder why I'm like this. Like do I need to change myself so someone could possibly have a crush in me? Seriously my own mind is making me confused since I'm totally fine being single, but sometimes I get those moments where I would love to have someone to just cuddle with me. Simple as that.

I try to think I still have hope left and I'm still young and there will be time (hopefully) where someone tells me that only me being with them is enough. So I relate many of you lovely people, no need to rush. Give yourself the time you need.

Some days I wander if I'm an actual sociopath, but then I don't think so because I experience a lot of loneliness?

I don't think I have any real feelings, everyone in my life could disappear today and it would not really effect me. I don't really have a moral compass. 

I basically have not much to live for, except getting degree and getting good money and living a somewhat rich life later down the track, I mean it is exciting in theory but the excitement is not there.

I have tried making friends but I don't really care about their lives as such, which makes it hard, I just want buddies to go out with, start having a social life again would be nice.

I try, but I can't manage to give a shit about anyone or anything. Everything I do is for my own benefit. I have learnt to be selfish because everyone else is.

I’ve spent up to a week straight in my room, stuck in my thoughts, pacing back and forth, writing in my journal, breakdown after breakdown. Sitting on my floor, in tears, head spinning, can’t stop. I throw all my emotions into my writing, not necessarily songs or poems or any of that shit, just writing what I’m feeling in the moment; the ugliness. Shoulders marked up, why? I dont know, that’s what’s been getting to me recently. Why am I so down? So lonely feeling? I have a good amount of people that know who I am, know my music and see us play often.

I don’t know how to socialize that well (at least when first meeting someone) and my methods usually include staring at a person until they notice me or giving people drawings practically encouraging them to be my friend in a way? Online friends are hopeless, too. Every chat either goes dead or the person loses interest. I also struggle with keeping conversations online. I don’t want to get attached to a person only to have them break it off or lose interest. That’s probably a reason why I don’t try speaking anymore no matter my desperation.

Somehow, I got a boyfriend a year ago, so that means I do have social skills. Some would say he should be enough for me, but I’d love a friend or two to be myself with. I don’t always want him in my business or I be in his, and he has friends, so I should too. I’m usually optimistic but I’m feeling a little down over this constant state of realization and as much as I throw myself out there—I do love making friends and talking about things for too long—I still haven’t found the people who want me. However people have worse things to think about than a lonely girl. Hmm.",lonely,I struggle with making friends.,2019-10-09 18:39:06

She was quite affectionate and compassionate towards me for years and now shows few of those traits. Just to clarify, before anyone tries to shame me, I mean affection as in  simple things such things as hugging, holding hands, and talking. She no longer desires to do things with me in her free time anymore such as go to dinner and a movie or just on walks. I dont know why things have changed so quickly. I do not recognize her anymore, she is no longer the person i fell in love with, but rather someone who is consumed by their work.

1780,Hippityhoppitybip,1570591772,3,"So, I loved to read. I read all the time. I remember spending all my freetime in middle school reading Harry Potter and the lord of the rings an dune by frank herbert, but, that all changed as I got older.

 I started to turn inward as I felt more and more alone. Things just did not feel the same, and slowly I stopped doing things I would regularly do. I stopped eating, I stopped sleeping, I even stopped reading. After a while, I couldn't even pick up a book without feeling sad or overwhelmed, or I would just be daydreaming too much and fantasizing about having friends to even be able to focus on what I was doing. I was so in my shell, that I completely let myself go. I gained 50 pounds, would sometimes refuse to get out of my bed, and I just gave up in school. I did not socialize with others, and I felt physically repulsive to  the opposite sex. I was hopeless, and I thought about just ending it. 

I guess I first started to try and change when I walked on the scale at my doctors office and read my weight: 260 pounds. 260 pounds was a number I could not even believe. At such a young age? I had elevated blood pressure, and my cholesterol levels were through the roof. That's when I realized, I did not want to die.

For the next 2 years, I fought hard, and I fought long to get my weight down. It was not easy, and I would cry myself to sleep some nights when I realized I had gained a couple of pounds, but through dieting and exercise, I was able to lose 70 pounds, coming down to 190 (a bit high still, but I'm working on it). Although now is the time where some would say they regained their confidence, that is not something I could fully say. I still felt insecure. I still felt like I was not enough. I lost all of that weight, but something was missing. I should have felt happy, but I didn't. I began to try and socializing with others.

I found this difficult at first,
 ""what do I say?""
"" How do i act?""

These thoughts tortured me, but i eventually overcame them as I found my avenue in. I was funny, at least to some people, and this really unlocked a lot of doors for me. I became relatively popular with a niche group, and yet, I still felt like crap. I did not know what was missing, and then, I read slaughterhouse 5.

It was an assignment due for english, but I did not read the book. I had a vasovagal syncope related to my stress with the SAT's, so I had to stay home, and I decided to give it a try. 
275 pages. I read 275 pages in one day, and I felt completely different. I couldn't give a shit about what was in the book, but the fact that I read it, and the fact that I finished it was just so thrilling. I felt, almost, happy? I don't remember the last time I've ever felt like this, and it motivated me to keep on pushing. 

I'm a very lucky person, but I wanted to talk about hope.

There is hope, there is a way. Even if you feel like you are at the darkest point in your life. There is hope. I lived in a hotel with my parents for 3 months as we were homeless (I gained a lot of weight here) and I felt completely lost. I felt like I should give up, and I did. I nearly died, but there still was a way. I'm not saying this to make anyone feel bad. I'm NOT. IT IS DIFFICULT. It is not easy. But, you have to know, that you are LOVED. Even if it may not look that way, please, please, please, do not give up hope. 

I'm still struggling, I'm still climbing the mountain. I'm not there yet, and I don't know if I'll ever be there, but looking back, and seeing all the ground I've covered in 2 years is what keeps me going. It can be the small things. You played your rent on time? FANTASTIC. You got a haircut? YOU LOOK STUNNING. You went for a walk today? KEEP IT UP. Progress is not something that is immediate, rather, it takes time. Any small step you take today is something that you should be proud of. Anything that you manage to do NOW is BIG. It is monumental because you are deciding to take a small portion of your life back. 


It is not completely your fault. It is extremely difficult. You feel like you're lost and that you're stuck and that you are the only person on an asteroid that has been shot out of orbit. I'm not saying that to discourage you from posting here either. Posting here, for me, helped a lot. I was able to find support, and by all means, please do what is best for you. This sub, for me, helped. 


I hope I don't come off as rude, but I felt the need to get it off my chest as I've been posting here for a little and I just wanted to share my story.",lonely,I've started the process.,2019-10-09 14:29:32
1781,daniboi_,1570590280,16,"20F, hey y'all. I've been bothered by my ""lack of experience"" and inability to maintain non-platonic relationships for so long now. I hate playing never have I ever because I literally haven't done anything and people think of me as a prude. I don't think I'm particularly ugly or boring or anything of that nature so it's probably just me. 

High school wasn't a great time for me as I was very depressed, had no friends, and was bullied. I didn't talk to many boys and I didn't realize I was bisexual yet. I was never invited to parties or hangouts in high school so when I got to college I was new to everything and scared of everything. The college I go to is for art and design which is mostly women so I've never had more than 5 guys in a class (most of which are gay). For whatever reason, the girls I have crushes on are always straight or in relationships already. Don't get me wrong, I love my school and I have made real friends here but I am so craving non-platonic affection.

It's hard since I have anxiety because I'll never allow myself to be in a vulnerable position which is the key to having healthy relationships. I'll never think I'm ""desirable"" enough for someone to like me or maybe I set myself up for disaster with too high standards. When people flirt with me I get so defensive and uncomfortable even if it's someone I find attractive or it's not a catcall. I've been on a handful of dates with people from dating apps but they have all ended badly because most of them had weird fetishes (I'm Asian) or looked nothing like their profile pics. 

Everyday I yearn for human connection. I'm the queen of pining. At this point, I would probably black out if I received non-platonic affection. I'm so touch starved, even when I just bump shoulders with a person, the spot of contact is burning hot. I don't know how to compose myself when friends give me hugs that are a tad too long or if they put an arm around me in a friendly way.

I know I'm not alone in this and I'm still young but I'm just tired or yearning.",lonely,Never been kissed,2019-10-09 14:04:40

I’m not asexual. I’m not even uncomfortable with the feeling of attraction or romantic interest. In fact, it’s quite the opposite really; I find things to be physically and emotionally attracted to in so many different types of people, and I’m also very bisexual if that provides any context.

1789,hamartiated,1570583373,4,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

Its honestly painful, and my apologies to everyone who are going through these stages of life. Way back 4 years ago, I used to be very much active in this community, and going through.....God knows what, it's a mess. It's not too long during these stages that I decided to chase after money, finding a perfect partner, friends, people to talk to, and drugs....just finding and looking for a way out. Day after day, it's just me trying to hide these negative feelings, ignoring it, numb it. I tried to talk to people about it, no one listened. I tried to hang out with friends more, didn't helped me neither, sometimes didn't even wanted to talk to me. Broken family, no one listened. Therapy, nothing. It's all inside me and I can never let it go. It's a stage of life that have lead me to questions my existence. Fast forward to a year in half later, meanwhile I'm doing well for myself financially. I decided to take a step back and really take a closer look of my life. I decided to go out in the real world, through embarrassment, awkwardness and struggles, to talk to people, network, and learned from the successfuls as well as the people who solved these issues themselves, massive research. I realized something that changed my life forever; 

If you think about it, everything you're going through are controlled by your outer world. You let it be, you are the one who decided not to gain control of your life. ""Law of correspondence"" stated; ""your outer world is a reflection of your inner world."" It is as though you live in a 360 degree mirror, everywhere you look, you see yourself reflected back at you. People treat you the way you treat them. The way you think about your physical body will be reflected in your health habits and your appearance. The way you think about people and your relationships will be reflected back to you in the quality of your friendships and your family life. In every case, your outer world reflects back to you, like a mirror image, exactly what you are thinking in the deepest recesses of mind. You brought to realities what you think about, believe, and expected.
At this point in time, it's important that you identifies firstly, your social life. Since this is what are massively shaping you as a person right now from actions, emotions, to behaviors. They're what makes you who you are.

To anyone who are going through difficult stages at the moment, I would love to talk to every single one of you personally. Please DM me and I'll promise you one thing at the end of the day.

I was so in to what I was saying and then I realized.  I just met this guy.   And I’m talking so much about my interests which no one I know IRL likes.  Ugh I honestly just wish I had friends that liked what I liked,  friends I can be 100% myself with,  have deep talks about mental health and stuff.

Most seats are taken, so the person who is late has to sit beside me. I don't mind it at all but it hurts a good bit when you hear them go ''huhhh'' quietly because of how much they don't want to sit. Another thing is when people look at you, make **clear eye contact** and then just do a quick 180-degree turn and go to another seat.

im new to reddit, hopeful you guys can help me out.

Im a introvert guy. I was always discouraged from talking in public by my family as I would often not know what to  and what not to talk, this lead to me becoming kind of an introvert. the funny thing is my younger brother knows how to socialise simply because he was allowed to do so. i am extremely at a disadvantage as i cannot think of making mistakes during my interactions. this often causes me to freak out and casts a bad impression upon the other person. i have only  2 of my friends who know of my situation like this, they accept me as i am, but i often feel as i am over-burdening them. I accept my situation like this, to remain a bit more less connected than others, but what really pains me is that i fail to build any new meaningful connections and restricts me from speaking lightly and i always have this weight on my chest. I feel discouraged as any new connection or plan i sought is make is often turned down by my family, well my brother's plans are never turned down however rad they might be.

I just wanted to get that out and talk to people who can help me feel better and improve my interactions in life.

1825,Its__Garbox,1570542434,1," 

To start off, I am an introvert male

During my years in middle school and high school, i always wanted to have a girlfriend. As a guy, i will admit i am not a great looking guy. I have tried asking girls out and i have tried talking to girls in person and on social media. Sometimes i am successful and sometimes the conversations don't go as expected because the girl i am talking to does not want to talk to me, i struggle to keep the conversation ,the girl puts little effort to continue the conversation , or the girl i'm talking to just leaves me on read.

(I do admit that i'm not that great at talking to girls sometimes. I guess its part of me being so introverted. I also don't have a huge social life like regular people because i have a helicopter parent \[that's another topic for another day\]. So most of my social life revolves around being in church.

Fast forward to my early adult life , I'm still in the same situation. I still have not found a girlfriend . And the desire to want a girlfriend is vary strong. Whenever i talk to a girl , i feel really good about my self because she is typically enjoying the conversation and she is giving me my full attention . But moments like those rarely happen .

So to temporally satisfy my desire of having a girlfriend, i jack off to some of the pictures of the females i know in real life

Sometimes when i see a girl at an event looking sexy , i think to my self, ""dang, she is really fine, i wish i was dating you.""

I know this is just creepy on every level.",lonely,Can anyone somewhat relate to my situation ?,2019-10-09 00:47:14

So i split up with ex about 2 years ago, i struggled with depression and ended up pushing her away and getting close with someone else. I never cheated on my ex and i will always love her but the situation was strained and we couldnt put the kids through the stress and heartache I had caused.

Thats just a bit of background really, my ex made it clear that the kids could see me but she didnt even want contact as friends.. Two years have passed and I thought I was finally getting over her except I'm not.

I have the kids every school holiday because i live far away but at the end of last holiday she came to pick them up and we spent some time together and I felt happy for the first time in a long time.

We have chatted on the phone a few times and we always chat like old times, she had been looking through old photos and I could tell she misses the couple we used to be.
Moving forward to today and my dog is ill, we need to call a vet out and see her.. the price is a ridiculously expensive but the whole morning my ex has kept in contact and even offered to help out with any vet bills I'll incur.

Today has been emotional, the dog is the first pet we ever got together and i can't help but think about the past and with my ex's recent act of kindness I can't help but realise what a fool i was to lose her. She was the best thing to ever happen in my life apart from my children.

I dont have any friends where I live but I feel like I deserve to be lonely and to never find love or friendship again because the one time I had it I threw it away.

TLDR: My ex has offered to help out with vet bills and the emotional fallout of my dog getting ill has made me realise just how much I miss her and the family we created.",lonely,I still love her.,2019-10-08 23:35:04

Walks past the mailbox to the end of the street,
Maybe this isn't so bad.
Makes his way up to the girl of his dreams,

1832,ProgressRoute,1570519291,3,"I sometimes wish I was dead. Because, at 26 I missed a lot on life which is never going to come back. 

I have to sacrifice my health in orded not to be lonely because I can't drink on SSRI (Serotonin prescription) but I do anyway. Because I feel I have to be part of the group. I feel I have to belong somewhere. I have to be in a group .

Some part of my life revolves around waiting for somebody's birthday to happen so I can invite them on my own. The main idea of that is that some other friend may see that I'm not completely left out , even though some of the friends whose birthday I am going too don't think even remotely the same as I. But I am going anyway not to be left alone. 

I don't feel that bad now that I do it , but still I'm prompted to eat a lot of junk food after that .

I have posessions, I won't lie, and making pretty good money. But still, I act as a freak and I know it. I am also short (176 cm / 5.9""), somewhat bordering what is genetically acceptable for reproduction. 

I have edgy comments on about everything and this might be what sets off women. I feel like if I try fixing myself in terms of clothing, because I shower and brush teeth daily maybe it will work. Maybe it will work if I do those things , but still I missed my prime years doing nothing.

In Eastern Europe, I think there are also normal women. Maybe there are some, because they feel somewhat put off by my edgy comments. I feel I have to be a normie to get girlfriends. Because I don't look good I have to be a simp and cater to their needs. But somehow they also reciprocate. They have feelings too. I used to think a woman gets pounded in the pussy every night of the week. Not anymore, but still can't accept the idea that some of them have a harder time to get sex than me. 

I see my friends with girlfriends and wives and they think of me as somehow a lady's man which I am not. I am just a degenerate pathological liar which has almost nothing going for himself in terms of dating women and has never dated properly ever. Every dates I went to were awkward, trying to get laid all the time, trying to find a place to fuck the woman all the time, thinking about pussy all the time.

If I had a large penis I would be able to simp and cuck because I would have gotten pussy anyway because of the curiosity of women.

I look all the time at my friends's girlfriends and wives and think to myself. Why I am not lucky? But I realize it's tied to my obsession also. When I do get to meet a real girl and not a hooker, I usually cling on like a needy wimp, hugging and kissing and showing affection. I also hug pillows and sleep like a fetus because I am so damaged and broken inside. I feel lonely, but can't admit it.

Days go by, and I'm stuck on the last experience. I went on a trip with a girl I met through a friend and another couple of that friend and his GF. I still remember and it makes me sad how the girl I was supposed to be with, in one morning just got in the bed of my friend and started hugging him . He had his female-friend and his girlfriend hugging him at the same time and I got nothing. 

Maybe I came across as too needy and that put her off. Maybe women are able to sense neediness, maybe it is really repulsive.  But if I try to switch it , I become too extreme and lash out indirectly and become the ultimate jackass.

I'm somewhat of an extremist , either too nice, or too much of an asshole.

I look also at some friends's car to see whether he moved so I can just imagine he going out with his female-friend of his, which rejected me , they having a good time togheter and I miserably staying alone in my house. When he gets a message on the phone from her (I know because I track her facebook  profile like a loser which has nothing else better to do with his time) I imediatelly imagine how she makes me a loser and a simp and then proceeds to tell him how better the other guys were. Of course, as a woman you have way more choices to date than a man.

I feel the pain so bad I even started to joke about killing myself at work. And just joke about some things I really feel like doing, and think about seriously. I have no one to talk to, even though I can afford to a therapist.

In Eastern Europe, service is poor on all levels, maybe I should try western, and I also have a genuine fear of my thoughts being disclosed. Not that I don't have the money, I have money, I'm just too paranoid or fearful to go a therapist. My shrink tells me it's ok , I progressed. Maybe I have, she knows better and I couldn't keep and honest journal of my evolution. I had some but I burned them , also because of how paranoid I was. 

So, if I go to a therapist I fear that they might disclose what I tell them, and If I somehow reach out and try to become a public person they might disclose it or blackmail me . I think with a therapist maybe I could have someone to talk to, it's still humiliating to pay someone to listen to you, but at least there is someone you can relate and who doesn't leave.

My sex drive is driving me insane, and I cater to it almost everytime. I didn't use to be like that, but since I got somehow good with my life, I forgot how to take care of myself. Because I didn't have proper set goals. When I go to hooker I am polite and ask them about how they feel, about their family, trying to interact. I should be cucking myself like that. Or maybe that's a good and humane thing to do and not cucking. I really don't understand a lot of human interactions and I feel it's too late to do it at 26, when almost all my friends have GFs and wives and I still lurk on gay sites trying to get a quick release blowjob from men. 

It's ingrained in my psyche. So many times I said I wouldn't go to men anymore after the last time I did it, but I still went anyway, because I had that drive , that sex drive which kept me focused on searching for men. 

Travel experiences, I have a lot on my own. Not with women, not with friends.  

I am also very chaotic in my approach to work and life, and usually do bits of tasks. I start something, then I start something else and I finish all of those with great difficulty. Or, when I get obsessed with something, I feel like I have to finish it and get it overwith as fast as I can and never come back to it. And then, I come back to it again. Like gay dating apps. I deleted my acccount there and created new ones I think a thousand times in 6 years.  Maybe I should learn to focus better.

I imagine myself as being a sort of a hero who gets out of pretty bad situations and keeps his composure and I am regarded at work and in social interactions as a tough guy, even though I am somewhat weak or see myself as weak. When I used to like a girl, I would look at their photos, or when I got a text from a woman I liked I usually put on some music, like the same parts and danced to it imagining I was some sort of savior, which is getting seen or noticed by that woman. I even imagine myself as being an influencer or some sort of an personality. It's just daydreaming which I think, in my head should be regarded as a mental disorder. 

I should be focusing on doing real work of improvement,  like real work and stop thinking about how I would save the world and shit. it is highly unlikely. 

I get obsessed when I set myself a target and I won't rest until I do it. So maybe I should chill out and think there are normal people there and if I become normal aswell maybe I have a chance at life. 

My life is good if I think of it objectively, if I look at it through somebody else's eyes. I have a safety net, a family I can go to and I think even friends would somewhat understand me if I opened up.",lonely,It's Over,2019-10-08 18:21:31

1838,Radium3y3s,1570510922,1,"I did it but failed at the same time. 

I got to Pittsburg where my friends dropped me off after we smoked a little bit on the way. It helped my nerves immensely. I waited for I think about three hours on the bus heading to NYC. 

I walked outside and met a guy with dreadlocks. He was an attractive black man probably in his late 20s. He was super sweet and we walked around Pittsburg together for a couple of hours smoking on two blunts and just bullshitting. I’ll call him D. Before I had to go D tried to talk me into coming to his house for more smoke but I kindly declined and went and caught my bus. 

I got on the bus in Pittsburg. Rode it to NYC. Mildly scared and alone. I didn’t know what I was doing for the most part. I just knew that I had to meet you. To solidify my thoughts and feelings. I was excited. I imagined so many different scenarios. None of which ended the way things actually did. Most we just me meeting you and leaving... but still accomplishing my goal of... well meeting you. 

I transferred buses. I got on the Grey line in NY to NJ. I rode it and then realized that hey... this mother fucker isn’t going to the station. Nope. It sure wasn’t. I got off that bus and walked a ways to another bus stop in the opposite direction and let the driver know. He let me back on for free and I walked 2 miles to the store... when I got there... the doors were locked. 

I was so incredibly sad inside. I cried for a little bit but pulled my shit together. I spoke to some therapist that was beside the store. She told me where the bus station was so I wouldn’t be cold. I saw a bus coming shortly after and spoke with the driver about how and where to get back to NYC terminal. So I crossed the road and stood beside this nice Asian lady for a little bit. We joked a little about how many busses were going to pass us and. It pick us up or find the right one. It was funny. 

After I got back to NYC I met a guy who showed me the ropes and gave me some good smoke. I walked 42nd street all night. Hung out in time square for a little bit. It was very lonely. I talked to a lot of homeless people. I would just go up and talk to them. They appreciated the connection. 

I sat down in mcds to warm my hands and feet. A nice man who shared his experiences of prison and the street life. How he had COPD and couldn’t breathe.. he gave me his receipt because apparently you can’t use the bathroom in NYC with out a code. He offered me a meal and hot drink but I respectfully declined. I hate taking from people but ended up having too later on. Eh. But I saw this man soooo many times in NYC. He would always speak to me. It was nice felt like I had someone that had my back there. “Gosh girl you’re everywhere he said” lol thst I was. I walked my ass off. 

The cops kicked everyone out of the bus terminal the first night so that’s mostly why I was walking the street. They won’t allow you to sit down there. They make you move. So I did. 

I thought I saw her... I squatted with my back to the wall to rest my feet a little bit. This woman sat at a small table alone. I wanted to speak to her. She had on sunglasses. It was night. I immediately wanted to check on her to see if she was cold. I couldn’t move though. Paralyzed by my own thoughts. “It’s in your head. No way is it. You’re going to make everyone her.” When I saw her walk past me, I got up and walked behind her for a few blocks. She had a pink suitcase. She turned right and I felt too uncomfortable to follow. I was afraid she would think I was a creeper... because who does that??? (Me apparently.) I wanted to follow her down the ally. I envisioned her turning around and talking to me... hugging me.... kissing me. I walked on. Later that night I thought I saw her again from behind with her hair down this time.... i walked passed and didn’t look back. I wanted to. So much. Just look. Just look. 

I kept walking. Feeling sorry for myself believing it was all in my head. My mother didn’t help matters. She told me “I told you so.” Before I left she said nobody as pretty as her basically would ever be interested in someone like me. I agreed. Logical to presume. She could have anyone... why would she want me? “So it was just some joke, huh?” Mom said. I hung up on her and cried. And cried more. Sitting alone... in the streets of NYC crying. Cold. It was rainy. There were times I couldn’t feel my hands. I wanted so bad to just even have been able to see her. Guess I’m a dreamer. &lt;/3 but... I’m not the only one. 

My ticket wasn’t for another day or so and a couple of friends that I met on discord really saved my ass. (Thank you guys. I absolutely love you two.) they sent me a ticket and $50. I cried my eyes out more because I’m just not use to that kind of nice. Tore me up. I really didn’t know what to say. I was just in shock that someone helped me like that. 

I walked around more the next day. Used a kiosk a few times to charge my phone. Got hit on by a bus tour worker who invited me to dinner. I didn’t go. Made me feel good though because I looked like actually hell ran over me in a Mac truck a few times lol and I did NOT smell the best. (Ughhhhgh hate that!!!) lol but yes. I finally got on the bus to come back home. Everything is gone. My computer, Xbox, games. Everything I cared about I gave up for her. You know what? I wouldn’t change it. I had a good time and it really made me grow some. I would do it again. 

I love this woman. I do. I can’t help it. But listen... if you don’t try how can you succeed???? If she asked me to jump.... I’d ask how high and make it happen. I just would. Just how my brain is wired.

I’ll fight for you. You have no idea how much I care about you. Maybe a little bit but I hope one day I can show you. I’m not upset anymore. I was deeply hurt... at first. I heal quickly. That I assure you. I’m like a rubberband. I snap back. But you’re worth the wait. You’re worth the fight. You’re worth any suffering. We are both human.

1846,hamartiated,1570503615,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Being unattractive or socially incompetent is a deterrent for anyone of any gender, of course, but when most girls around me seem to have one or the other or both, and you're one of the few who have neither, it gets brutal. You're socially ostracized by men, by women, by people older and younger, because you're not the archetypal attractive and charismatic woman that society seems to hold on a pedestal.

She doesn’t really seem to want to talk to me as much anymore. I’m worried that we’re only being carried forward by momentum. I love her, but sometimes I think she loves the way I treat her more than she loves me. Maybe we’re dying out, I don’t know. I feel more like a prop than a boyfriend lately. This could all also totally be in my head. Maybe this is as good as it gets and I just don’t know a good thing when I have it. She swears she loves me as much as ever, but I don’t really feel loved sometimes. I think she just likes having a boyfriend, especially one who is as good to her as I am. We’re viewed as “couple goals” by a lot of our friends, but they don’t see all of the details that have been bothering me.

I’m trying really hard, and I hope she is too. Doesn’t make this any easier though. I want to make her happy and I want our relationship to be healthy, but she’s seemed so different for the past few months. I’ve talked to her about it and we’ve tried to make changes but I feel like nothing’s sticking. 

Another factor is that every now and then I get hit by waves of depression. That always makes things worse because I get stuck in my head and then all of our problems feel even worse. I don’t want to be a baby about my feelings though. I try to keep in mind that when I’m in this sort of state, I’m not thinking and feeling as clearly as I normally do.

My most recent really good friendship lasted from about seventh grade until the end of high school when he turned out to be completely fake. Shortly after, during the summer after senior year (summer 2017), my girlfriend at the time broke up with me as well.


Went to college from fall 2017 up until the end of 2018, and I can count on one hand the number of people I talked to there outside of group project type situations. Granted, I didn't make the greatest effort to talk to anyone (obviously), but I always felt like It'd be weird just randomly striking up a conversation with someone outside of class. Although, I wasn't completely lonely during that time since me and a guy from high school would text about random shit on a daily basis. 


Stopped going to college, dude that I would text pretty much made it obvious he didn't want to talk anymore, so we don't talk anymore. Briefly made a friend at the job I was working at and hung out a few times, but it became increasingly obvious from the bizarre things he would do/say that he was completely disconnected from reality. Had to distance myself from him and haven't hung out/talked with him for a few months. Honestly, I don't really plan on hanging out with him again.


That brings me to now. No in real life friends, no ""online friends"", studying for a career path that doesn't require college, and I have no clue how people make friends past high school or college, let alone find a girlfriend. Haven't talked to anyone except for my family members for months. It's weird. In a way, I don't really care, but at the same time I know it's not normal or good for my mental state.

1905,StagedError,1570417008,1,"I’m in a weird spot right now. I’m a freshman in college and i feel so alone and left out of the dating world it feels like. My first roommate, who we’ll call Roommate A, came to school with a boyfriend, broke up a month into school, and is now having her different “friends with benefits” coming to visit her next weekend. While my other roommate, Roommate B, was talking to a upperclassman for a month and they slept together and stuff, until she got friend zoned. While all this was happening, Roommate B and I were always hanging around two floors below us where another boy comes into play. This is the boy that people were CONVINCED that he had feelings towards me and that he was interested, I wasn’t sure because I’m cautious when it comes to expressing my feelings. But I started slowly seeing it, he’d look at me certain ways, if I’m being quiet or seemed left out he’d always come and talk to me, would always ask if I was okay and all that fun stuff. But than when Roommate B got rejected, this boy expressed his feelings for her. At first she wasn’t feeling it back, but now she is. They always hang out together, I see their texts, I see the way he looks at her. It made me realize — I did like this guy after it was too late. I had told my roommate that I didn’t like him, but now I’m stuck in this place of being a third wheel who DID in fact have some kind of feelings for the boy. 
I just feel stuck, both of my roommates have boys catering to them and I feel just plain sad because I can’t express any feelings now since my roommate, and basically best friend at this point, is now talking romantically to the guy I was convinced (and others were too) liked me too.

I have a girlfriend but we're long distance so there's no hanging out, but we do call every single day. I really, really like her, but it is so very hard not being able to do things with her. I would give anything to just be able to hug her. 

My three close friends I have known the longest don't really want anything to do with me. One of them is two years older than me and he never wants to go out. The two others are both my age but all have found new people to hang out with and sit with at lunch and stuff. I am never invited. One of them completely ignores me when we see each other at school. Most of the time I suggest we do stuff, they say okay and we say we'll do something on the weekend. The weekend comes, I remind them, I get no response and I'm stuck at home alone once again. 

I am kinda friends with this one girl but she graduated last year so we don't talk much anymore, although we did text a lot recently about college and life and general and it was nice. I miss having her in class. 

I am friends with two girls I have marching band with. We are kind of the outcasts of our section. One of them used to be mind of mean to me in a joking way but I think that's changed and now she confides in me a lot. Her and I have a bit of a judgment free zone where we talk about stuff like her experiences with drugs, which boys she likes, and last night we both talked about how we're kind of confused about our sexualities. I am the only person she's talked with about that, so it was nice to know she trusts me enough to tell me that stuff. The other one is a really sweet and innocent girl, she's a bit weird sometimes but I like her. She told me she was going to cry when I graduate and that made me feel at least a little bit like someone actually likes me. Us three laugh a lot and it's just nice. I don't talk with either of them outside of school though, and we really only talk during football games and competitions. I love them as friends and will miss them when I graduate next year.

I have another friend from band who is not a member of my section. Her and I talk a bit during school and practice our music together. We usually sit on the bus together on the way to events and just chat about whatever. We also text outside of school and send pictures on snapchat, but our conversations are super short and I think she might be getting bored of me. I'm almost 100% certain she doesn't have romantic feelings for me, which I like because I am very lonely and need some platonic friends.",lonely,"I have ""friends"" but I still feel very lonely.",2019-10-07 13:56:14
1907,hamartiated,1570414963,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I do crave good relationships with people. After high school, I left a abusive friendship group, but I was deemed responsible for the breakup. Even by my mother. 

Now as a first generation college student, even more responsibilities are left upon my shoulders. With a brother who has learning disabilities, I gave into insecurities and gave up finding who I am.

Even though I talk often with people, people just take advantage of me. Either with homework or assignments, people are quick to respond to my text messages. I’m tired. But I don’t want to become absorbed into loneliness, even if I’m comfortable with it sometimes. 

Who am I to complained? I have a body, working limbs and a functioning soul. Compared to my brother, I can easily learn lectures at a normal pace. So I’m not excused to be stupid nor dumb. Last nights, I had an argument with my mother. She asked, “Do you have anything to say?” I just shook my head. I’m never allowed to complain nor to cry. That’s how I was educated. Even though she has expressed “It’s like you have a retarded brain?” (Rough translation from Spanish) when I do something ‘stupid’ , I apologize. I’m sorry for not learning how to drive, I’m sorry for not knowing how to cook or clean at age 20, I’m sorry for giving up my expression of freedom for academic responsibility because I’m the one whose suppose to achieve greatness, get a great career and take care of everyone. 

Sometimes I feel like I can’t handle it. Even though I went to therapy sessions, they say that I must communicate with my parents. Ha. A joke. 

I guess no one remembers my emotions or my treatment. No one remembers how they expressed disgust at my belly during a doctor checkup. No one remembers how I wanted to sign up for Pre-AP classes at 6th grade, because it was too hard. No one remembers how I wanted to play basketball, but had to choose academics. No one remembers.

&gt;i dont fit in  
&gt;  
&gt;my bf/gf left me  
&gt;  
&gt;i dont have friends

And I am here to say, I experience all of these feelings everyday. A little over a year ago, a girl I had been dating for about five years cut ties with me. I am still hurt to this day because of it. Shortly after, I moved to rural Missouri for work and quickly fell into depression. I had no friends around me. Felt like I did not fit in. Had trouble making friends. I do not fit in with my coworkers at all. For the past year I have literally done everything alone. I do not complain about it but my family have taken note of it. 

My dad on the phone: really so you're going to go drive there all alone? nobody wanted to come with you? 

Me: Its fine dad.

Because at the end of the day it **was**. Some of the most fun times in the past year I have done completely alone. Few things about doing stuff alone.

* It is not hard to make friends when you are alone.

I have gone to concerts, bars, festivals, you name it alone. And almost **every time**, I strike up a conversation with somebody. People do not consider myself a very outgoing person. But people do not like seeing somebody alone. Went to a festival a month ago alone and camped out and within the first few minutes people were inviting me into their camping area, asking if I wanted to hangout with them, asking who I was most excited to see. Just last night I went to a bar alone, bartender and a women next to me both struck up a conversation with me and I was only there a few minutes. 

* It allows you to explore.

I never thought I would be doing half of the stuff I do, nonetheless be alone. I drive into the city, hop from one bar to the next, catch a show, go back to another bar, watch the end of a sports game. Drive home. Most likely, if you were with somebody they would not want to jump around that much. Or want to spend the money. I can plan trips completely accordingly my specifications. 

* I cherish times with friends a lot more.

When I get breaks from work I travel and meet friends around the country. And we have a great fucking time. I tell them how much they mean to me all the time and tell them I have the best friends in the world. I filter out who my real friends are who carry through with plans or just ignore me. I never thought I could enjoy a 7-hour car ride so much when you have your two best friends to bullshit with. I am planning a trip to see them all next month and I cannot fucking wait. Literally. I am going to take so many photos with them and not drink just so I can enjoy every second.  

I can go on and on, but you guys see my point. Its hard to commit to doing something that you will do alone. But I promise you, get out there and go do it. There are people out there waiting to meet.

1939,Swagpotato44,1570397982,3,"Back in 9th grade, my girlfriend of nearly two years broke up with me and left me for her abusive, lying ex, and it tore me (M) up. 
I texted my (F) friend about this and she told me something along the lines of: ""Someday you'll find someone and you'll lay there next to her and talk about everything you've been through, and she'll tell you that she went through the same. You'll lay there, holding hands, looking up at the stars and you'll realize that all this was worth it. Worth that moment.""
And it stuck with me. 
About a week later, her boyfriend of two years broke up with her, and it destroyed her. One night we decided to call and talk about all this. My phone was on speaker, and it was next to me. She did the same. 
In that moment, i remembered what she told me. I'm not one to really believe in coincidences, so i fell in love. 
But we've been best friends for years. We hugged everyday, we texted every day, and it's been great. I am now a junior, and she's a senior in high school, and has a boyfriend that graduated. I did confess my feelings towards her, and she didnt feel the same. I didnt care, as long as nothing between us changed. So that was the deal. But throughout all these years, I've been trying to get over her and I've had to tell myself every day that I dont stand a chance, that she deserves better, and those feelings did eventually kind of went away. 
Fast forward to about two weeks ago. 
She texted me, and told me that she was getting uncomfortable with hugging her in the mornings before we went to separate classes. I didnt see what the problem was, considering we've been doing it every day for years now. She then said that she thinks I like her again. I explained to her all the torment I've put myself through to try to rid myself of these feelings. 
So she decided we were going to stop talking. 
Its been two weeks, and we havent spoke since. 
I dont get notifications on my phone anymore. I feel like no one's there for me anymore. 
She was so much more than i thought and now that she's gone, its like I've lost it all.

1942,ellie_f89,1570396157,7,"Im a 29 year old girl from the Netherlands and tonight I found myself at this forum. More specifically, at the part that's called 'lonely'. I am feeling scared, pissed and relived. All at the same time. I don't want to have to find myself here, and it scares the *** out of me that I do. It scares me because I don't know how to make it better. I don't know how to feel connected to the people around me. Because i have people around me. But they just live their lives, growing up and moving on. People who I used to hang out with on a daily or weekly base have found SO's to spend time with. And they should, I don't blame them. But I am left behind, and it keeps hitting me that I am nobody's priority anymore. I was always there for everybody. They were always welcome. And now I am no longer needed. I am redundant, replaced and irrelevant. I do not matter anymore. It makes no difference for anybody whether or not I exist. And that hurts so extremely bad. Feeling completely irrelevant. 

And it makes me pissed too. Pissed at myself for allowing myself to feel this way and to end up here. Pissed because I have a nice job, a house and a cat. I am healthy (as far as I know), and are my family and 'friends', and I still feel like this. But also pissed at everybody else. Pissed at my friends for not seeing me, while I'm standing right in front of them showing them how much I'm hurting, for not hearing me when I keep trying to tell them over and over. But they are either blind, stupid or simply not interested, because they have their own lives and I don't really matter. My role is so unimportant that nobody notices that I don't like my part and I don't want to play it anymore. I can't. I won't. But I also don't know how to stop it. And that brings me back to being pissed at myself. Because maybe I am not speaking loud enough, even though it's the loudest I can. And I can't blame them for living their lives, getting married and having children. I can't blame them, but I still do. And I blame myself for not being able to do the same thing. Instead I am here, feeling very sorry for myself while I know I am the only one who can fix it. And for some reason I am too weak or stupid to do it. And if that is the case, I don't deserve these friends. They deserve better. 

I am also pissed at my mother, for making me this way. I love her but I hate her so intensely at times. She is the reason for me being completely unable to trust or open up. To actually ask for help. I hate her for always being the child, never the parent. For always wanting attention, but never doing anything to fix herself. She should have tried to fix herself, so I would know I can fix myself. And not expect me to fix her, because I can't. I can't fix her, even though I would everything to do so. And I hate her for not being somebody I can talk to. She wants to help, but she is so immature and broken that she can't. Telling her something only results in me having to make her feel better because 'she is so extremely sad and worried about me'. Its easier not to tell. It is better, because then I don't have to deal with my own *** and her worries about my ***. Its just easier. But I wish she was someone I could talk to and she could make me feel better. But instead, I am on this world to make her feel better. Because I have been the adult ever since I was 12. And you don't dump your problems on a child. So I tell her that I'm ok, just tired. And hey, that last part is true. 

Also, I am a little relieved.. relieved that I apparently recognize what my 'problem' is, and that I am writing this down. I never did that before. But maybe, just maybe it helps a little bit.",lonely,Invisible and irrelevant,2019-10-07 08:09:17

No seriously why?

When a girl tells a guy he's ""too good"" for her, we are labeled weak because she doesn't find you attractive or her type?

She'll throw u in the friend zone and tell you ""I wish I could find a guy like you""

Yet when we friend zone you, it's world War 3, ""he's such a dick"" etc etc

And I've seen the way girls talk about guys... Lemme tl you something it's disturbing...

Haven't been with a girl in months, ""wow I don't know how u survive""

When a girl hasn't had been with a guy in months, it's self empowering.

Personally, I don't just want sex from you, I want someone to share the happiness of life with, sex is a bonus.

Stop treating sex like its something you need. Men this goes for you as well, find happiness in life and share it with someone.

1952,ceradia,1570392462,4,"I’m hoping typing this will help me get it out, because everything I do is an experiment to see if it’s gonna help, the latest being this exact post to a subreddit. Mind you it’ll probably get deleted for some rule I forgot to follow.

I’ve never posted here before, and I imagine the text will be an absolute mess but I’ll do my best.

As of recent, I’m getting by on my own. I went into town today to buy a winter jacket. Last time I went into town I got laughed at by more people than I’d like to admit. 19yo Males aren’t usually as short as me, and also don’t usually wear work attire, so I can understand how different I looked. Maybe I got laughed at today, maybe not, I had music on so I didn’t care. It’s an active effort of mine to stop caring what others think, and it’s hard when people genuinely laugh at the sight of you, but I’m working on it.

I’m also working on the whole lonely situation too. It’s now an effort to embrace it rather than an effort to repel it. I went to see Joker alone, like I do most films. It’s oddly freeing to me to be alone in a cinema. The thing about the loneliness though is that I know I have to face it head on. Going out and getting friends and having relationships isn’t solving the issue, it’s just putting it off for later. It’s why I’m actively stopping myself from doing so. Every time I go for a new Tinder account, I have to stop myself, because it won’t solve the core issue. Every time I feel alone I sit alone, in silence and experience it. I’ve yet to figure out if it helps, but again, it’s an experiment. 

I also feel emotionally abused by my parents. I feel like a trophy to them, as whenever I make a workplace achievement, it gives my mother an excuse to post about it on Facebook. I know it’s because their proud, but I also feel like it’s their way of fuelling their own desires of having a perfect son. They threatened to kick me out recently because I wanted to get my ears pierced, I feel a lot more in tune with a feminine side of me I never knew existed until recently, and want to express it, but I get the “everyone will think you’re gay” and “not while you live under this roof you won’t”. It’s petty, I know, but it’s something I want. 

I feel like I finally got over my ex too. It only took me 8 months. I know that with her, I was happy and that is no more. I banked my happiness on something so volatile and that was my own mistake, which is probably why it took me so long to stop hating her, to get her out of my nightmares and finally accept everything. There are questions left unanswered, but I don’t care. It’s over. 

I will tell of another romantic incident, in which I met her online, we hit it off, I go to where she lives, an hour away, and spend some irl time with her. As a person who considers himself awkward. I’m proud I kept the conversation going for almost 4 hours. At the end of the 4 hours, she pulls me aside and says that online dating was her experiment to see whether she was bisexual or a lesbian. She recent figured it out as lesbian and had to tell me before I emotionally invested in her. I just told her that we are 18, and still figuring ourselves out, I left with a smile on my face, and didn’t cry that night. I felt actually strong, then about 2 days later I burst into tears in the bath. I still feel strong about how well I handled it in the moment. 

The truth is there’s still part of me that wants to connect. I still want a romantic relationship, even though I may not be entirely ready for one. Desire overtakes reasoning, and I’m in a constant battle because of it. I think at the end of the day, I’m a very sad, melancholy little man, who desperately seeks attention in a friendly and romantic sense, and when I seek this attention out, and then, as a result of not being ready, I fail to obtain this attention, and it spirals me further and further into feeling overall worse. 

However, I’m making an active effort to stop this self destructive behaviour. I’m working to embrace the loneliness, trying to stop fawning endlessly over a relationship I may never get to experience. I’m hoping to volunteer for my local Samaritans when an interview becomes available. 

Finally, I don’t know why I made this post. Maybe for attention, maybe to vent, who knows? Respond if you want, don’t if you don’t want to. Everything is my experiment.",lonely,Just gotta vent,2019-10-07 07:07:42

I always feel like I'm the least favorite of all of them. I feel like they think I'm a loser, and it just fucking sucks. I wish I could open up to them more emotionally but I just feel like I can't because if I do, they'll think even worse of me. They're all very physical with each other, but I feel like it just isn't the same with me. I don't really ever get touched by any of them. The only touch I really get from them is the occasional weak hug. When we're all together, I can sort of keep up in conversation, but whenever I'm alone with one of them, I feel like it's just kind of awkward. They all call me a best friend but it just does not feel that way. They just don't treat me the same way they treat each other and that hurts. I guess a good way to put it is that I sometimes feel like it wouldn't make that much of a difference to them if I wasn't there. I feel like ultimately I'm not an important figure in their lives. It just sucks because I don't know what to do. I don't want to feel lonely, and I would have thought that the one group of people I could go to were my ""best friends"", but when I'm with them I feel even lonelier somehow. Like an outsider. I can't tell if they really think badly of me or if I'm just overthinking things. I don't know what to think. Sometimes I think it's my fault for not opening up to them enough. I just don't know. I don't think I could ever just move on, I love them, I just wish they loved me (Or if they do, I wish they would show it).

1979,asdzx1,1570347024,5,"Sorry for the rant that is going to follow but I just need someone in the world to listen to me. Sometimes I just feel so so lonely. Even if I have so many friends surrounding me- so many people with me- there’s just this inner loneliness that never seems to leave me no matter how much I hope that it goes away. It seems like everyone else has a best friend, someone they consider to be their person, but I dont feel like I have that. I’m so replaceable, so unwanted. Everyone always finds someone else. I’m always a second choice. Life as a college freshman isn’t easy. I’ve tried to put myself out there, tried to make friends and it’s working but why do I still feel so incomplete? Why does it still feel like no one even wants me in their life? Maybe it’s just my brain overthinking everything, like when I’m with two other people and one of them doesn’t give me any eye contact when they talk. Or when I say something and people seem to brush it off or completely ignore what I said and talk over me. Maybe I’m just overreacting and am selfish and stupid and needy but everything still hurts. I barely had any friends in high school. I tried so hard to be nice to everyone and look out for people but no one likes me. And the friends that I did make seem to be moving on, all at their own colleges with their own lives and I miss them and the memories we made. I miss not being a part of their lives. I get so depressed thinking about how alone I am sometimes, especially in the night when I’m left with nothing but my thoughts to eat away at me. I always feel like I’m stepped on and mistreated no matter how hard I try to be nice and caring to everyone. Even if I try my hardest it seems like it goes unrecognized. There’s always someone who people consider to be better than me. And I don’t want to be the best but I just want to be valued and appreciated for what I do the way other people are in their friends’ eyes. I’m so jealous of people who are able to make long-lasting, loyal friends so fast. The kind that want to stick with their group, who uplift each other, and are comfortable with each other. I don’t know why I’m never good enough to have that. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong that it seems like everyone’s against me. I miss being at home so much. When I was in high school I didn’t like it. People constantly bullied me behind my back, telling others that I was dumb or that no one wants me around anyway or whatever. But my family was always my rock and now they’re not here. I feel so disconnected from them too. Even if we talk everyday it feels like their lives are changing and I’m no longer a part of any of it. It’s like everyone’s moved on but me. I don’t know why I always feel like a second choice, never good enough, and so replaceable. For example, I have this one friend and it seems like everyone appreciates her so much. They’re respectful to her and value what she has to say and take her advice but no ones like that with me. Nothing I say ever matters. I’m always just brushed off. I don’t know how I can change myself and be someone that others actually value and care about. thank you for listening...

I feel like I'm the only person on the planet to go through elementary school, middle school, high school, and college without a single friend. If a genie would grant me a wish. I would automatically wish to relive life, but always with a real friend. I wouldn't care if I had to relive life in the worst living conditions in the world. I feel like my whole life has been wasted because I'm so lonely. I went to more birthday parties uninvited than invited. I love concerts and and sporting events. Almost every-time I've gone to one, I've gone alone. I was so lonely I sat next to people, who in respect were not my friends. I think they only let me sit next to them because I had no friends.  Even worse at some point, I think some people gave me rides to church not because I was their friend, but because they felt sorry for me.  On my last day of high school I remember crying in the parking lot because everybody else had friends and everybody went home with friends to celebrate the last day of school. I called my dad to pick me up from the middle school because I didn't want to explain to him why I was the only one in the parking lot.  I remember in 2016 I was so desperate for a friend I went to meetup after meetup. It took about 10 meetups where nobody liked me before I finally got a friend. The ironic thing is if I wasn't so desperate. If I quit going to meetups after my 10th pointless one, my friend drought will probably still be going on 25 years later. My friend moved 1.5 years to be with his girlfriend. I remember that for once, I was going to have somebody to hang out with during New Years Eve. Then my friend got a girlfriend. I'm dreading this New Years Eve. I am going to be alone again. The worst part is that I've o close to making friends in the past. I've met people. They liked me. In less than a couple of months, they get bored of me. I feel like the biggest loser ever. How many people can say it took them 2 decades to find a friend, more than 5 to get my drivers licence, 10 years to get a part-time job, and more than 5 years out of college to get my first full-time job? I wish I could live life over again. FYI I drove all they way across country to Sillicon Valley to find a full-time job. I got one at the airport, where I also lived in the terminals for a couple of months to save money. Now I work at a big tech company, get paid well, and lively extremely cheaply with my coworker. I can't believe I was in high school when the labor market collapsed, and it literally took me all the way until the end of the bull-market to get my first full-time job. I don't think anybody's life is more pathetic than mine. I just wished at some point in my life, making a friend wouldn't be so hard. Most people figured out how to do it before they turn 10.

2013,FatherWeebles,1570321349,5,"Hi all,

For most of my life I've been a loner.  I can build rapport easily but I don't necessarily seek it out.  I was content with seeing my family every Sunday while I lived in a major city center by myself.  I traveled all around my home country by myself.  I saw myself as being more resilient than most. 

Then I moved abroad for school over 2 years ago to a major city in Europe.  It was my second time going abroad for school; previously I lived in another country for about 5 months and did fine.  Anyway, the first year was good - had temporary studio, decent grades, etc.  In the second year I met my now girlfriend, who's from the new country.  The problem is, the housing supply in the new country sucks so bad, especially for students, so I ended up having to move out of the studio and into what I could find, which turned out to be a bad roommate situation at a new house.  Nearing the end of the second year, I was desperate to find a new place I could call my own.  I found a place in a far off, bedroom community type of city.  The studio is the size of a one car garage (literally).  I began living here on September 1st.  Basically, I moved away from my university, a big city, my friends (save 1) and my girlfriend.  That's when problems started.  

In the previous month of August, I spent about two weeks with my family in my home country, and then they followed me back to Europe for about 2 weeks.  Them leaving and then having to start a new life in a new city kind of wrecked me.  But!  I had a certification exam to pass, so that kept my mind off of my living situation once I got settled.  I passed that certification exam two Wednesdays ago and things have taken a turn for the worst.

I feel like I'm wasting away, and it's started to eat away at my mental health.  It's almost like all of the culture shock from the 2+ years of living in the new country was distilled into a week and a half.  I go to the gym a few days a week and try to eat healthy to keep my spirits high but that's not enough.  My parents are okay with moving back in with them for a few months until classes start up again.  But that would mean running away from the problem and putting the relationship with my girlfriend in jeopardy.  But I also don't want to fall into depression by staying here.  It feels almost like a lose-lose right now. 

***More details about the current situation:***

1) The small size of my accommodation is a motivation zapper.  Normally, I have high motivation to always stay productive.  Instead, I'm watching Alien lore on YouTube.  I stare at screens so much now that my eyes hurt.

2) I'm taking no classes until February.  I hope to nail down a thesis topic in the next week or two and start early, but I'm worried about #1 getting in the way.   I could force myself to go to university every day to try to be productive I guess?Normally classes are a way to keep myself occupied with a preset goal.  

3) Landlords use the washing machine room every day.  The washing machine room is on my floor.  I've talked with them about it, and they've mitigated some of the issues involving noise and timing, but not the frequency.  It's definitely better, but still rather annoying and excessive.  This problem went from being a major/moderate problem to a minor one now.

4) The new city kind of sucks.  It's way smaller, and it doesn't even have a stand alone movie theater!

5) My neighborhood is full of young families.

6) My good friend from school and his wife live in this city, which is partly why I moved here.  The thing is, they're so content to be with just one another that I can't seem to hang out with him/them.  They also didn't offer to show me around the city.  Every time I try to schedule something it either gets canceled or other excuses.  Very disappointed.  They might as well not even be here as far as I'm concerned.

7) I see my girlfriend usually once every 2 weeks.  She lives in the larger city and has two kids.  Usually we talk on the phone 5-6 days/week.

It's going to be like in elementary school. I feel it. I know it. Noone needs me. Noone needs to write me. Hell they didn't even put me to the class group chat. I knew it. I fucked up again, I don't know where but I did. It's all my fault, I'm going to be lonely again. Minimum friends. Minimum people hanging out with me... At least some people talk with me while we have class. But after it I become a ghost. Minimal social interactions.

It's a weird feeling when you're walking with your classmate home (I think it was just his bad luck, and he didn't wanted to be rude and tell me to fuck off) and he says ""gimme a minute I gotta call a friend"". He called him asking if he didn't wanted to hang out with him. Of course he got a no because the person was playing rainbow 6 but still. I have free time and he knows it, yet he didn't bothered asking me. I get it okay? Maybe he just wanted to hang out with someone he knows better and longer, but still not even being the last person someone would ask to hang out with... Its a weird feeling.

I miss talking to people. Even people online forget about me. I'm trying to find someone who would satisfy my ""feeling smarter today"" needs. It's basically that I want to speak in a more pleasant language? Just using that.. More smarter language? I can't explain it. It's a weird feeling of comfort I get and it's kinda nice. I feel smart even if I'm not. It just makes me feel wroth something more than just 2 glasses of wine and few minutes in bed.

I just feel I'm annoying. I constantly seek attention and it gets annoying pretty quickly. I just wish.. Someone would call me, message me or just directly ask me if I have time to hang out. I know it won't happen.. But we all can dream.. Can we?

As I noticed having tinder for a little over a year and as I met many people from there, I feel even more alone knowing that the feeling to get close exists for a bit and then it goes away and the person I was talking to has moved on sometimes without saying and we split separate ways. I think I just don’t like that? I feel like I keep being left with this wow this was for nothing and getting my fantasies with them is going to trouble my mind to remove them. I get mad only because they were the ones to walk away while I was wanting to see them more, etc. A guy wanted to get blown by me while he had been seeing a coworker and now are dating. I called him out that I felt very connected and feel like it is disrespectful that he didn’t let me know he was seeing someone else.  Then it hit me last night that I haven’t really seen a guy actually make an effort to see me often. It has always been me that goes out of my way to listen and be there for my few friends but it’s not been reciprocated for romantic relationships. I feel like it’s going to be the same from here on out and I am never going to experience actual love. I’m almost 21 and feel like I’m going to remain a virgin till I die and okay with it. This pop culture made me have fucked up expectations that going out with guys and seeing them once and being intimate was a way to see if we are compatible. Honestly it isn’t even just Tinder. People I met who used tinder are legit all the same way and for whatever reason don’t want a girlfriend but get one like a week or month later is honestly making me so confused and hesitant. I have been working on my body too to change my appearance and currently boy told me I was too fat to date made me really insecure about how others see me, and I don’t know if it’s just the people that’s the issue or if it is me. I started to have jealousy show up when a guy friend I was seeing but eventually said it is the best to just be friends lost his virginity not long ago. I thought he was cool but kind of immature and surprised he has a girl now. This shit is messing with my mind so I’m gonna try to stop using tinder lol. Just needed to vent.

I realized my relationship with my sister was really bad and so I decided to try to bond with her and we were suppose to go saree shopping, and my mom was mopping the kitchen floor so she didn't want to go in with her shoes to get herself some hot water, so her tone of voice can be very aggressive, and it sounded like she was yelling at my mom. It stressed me out so I told her I'd get her the hot water because I was already in the kitchen. She was just what no, and just yelling as if she was trying to prove a point like I'm going to break my bones but she wanted to get it really badly.I got the hot water in the cup anyway to be nice, but she was angry and she said had to put in her glass..and she was just being annoyingly rude and like she went into the kitchen and I'm pretty sure she tries to intimidate me because she doesn't like something so she like bumps into me and then tells me like wtf am I doing? like I did something awful. It's soo friggen weird (she's older than me) and tries to make me seem like I'm the crazy one. I literally feel like I have zero confidence because that's how I've been always treated and I feel like when I hang out with other people I tend to vent to them because I have no one else to vent to, but then people can see how insecure and how low confidence I have that no one wants to hang out with me. I feel like all my friends they have a big family where as I don't and most of friend's families get along and don't fight all the time, and I don't really get a long with my family, I can't vent to them with my problems, because they end up getting mad at me or telling me what i've done wrong, sometimes its their way of love...""because they care for me"". I'm 27 right now and I am trying to work on myself esteem.

Now, he's getting married and I feel like a part of me is missing and i don't know how to fill that void. I'm trying to value myself within, i feel like all i tell my friends are negative things about my family , my feelings and a cry for help..

2026,surreal_01,1570306766,3,"I just started my first year of high school (I started halfway through because I was at a small middle school for 4 years) and I'm finding it really hard. The classmates and teachers I have spent the last 4 years of my life with are all so far away now and are no longer part of my life. 

That school was like a sanctuary for me, it was a place where I felt safe and loved and respected and I was very happy. I've already lost touch with most of my friends from there, except for one who is always there for me and I'm always there for her. I'm so grateful that I have her in my life, but she lives far away from me so I don't see her much anymore. But at least I have her to talk to when I need someone. 

In my neighbourhood, I used to have a group of kids who I pretty much grew up with. Every Friday night we would get together and play games/watch movies together. The memories I have with them are literally some of the best memories I have. Unfortunately, most of them are in university now so I don't see them much anymore. One of them recently moved to live in residence in university, and the Friday night thing has kind of stopped. I'm grateful that I grew up with that community around me, but I miss it a lot. 

When I go to school, I don't talk to anyone. I've always been a fairly quiet person unless you actually try to get to know me. I wish someone would do that at school, but they don't. It's the weirdest thing it's like I really really want to be noticed but at the same time I get so uncomfortable when people pay attention to me. Also everyone in my grade has known each other since the beginning of high school. It's kind of like I'm living in a bubble. 

I really really wish that I could just be myself, because I think I'm a likeable and fun person to be around. It's just that when I meet new people, I don't talk to them. I don't talk at all. The most I do is smile or laugh in reaction to what they say. I know from experience that if I don't put myself out there and talk to these people and try to get to know them, I will stay in this bubble until high school is over. Unfortunately that's probably going to happen. I just wish I could be myself.

I've also been thinking a lot about how after high school, there will only be more changes like this one. Basically I'm just stuck longing for the past. And I'm terrified for what's to come. 

I'm grateful that I have a loving family and a home to live in and I get to go to school and learn. I don't have a bad life. Sometimes I just wish I could escape into a fantasy world and do and be anything I want. 

Anyways, I just wanted to put this out there to people who might understand. It was nice to vent even if nobody reads this.",lonely,I'm kind of lost right now,2019-10-06 07:19:26

My point is so many women get with guys like this and cry when it goes wrong, and I do feel for you. But it seems to be you go into this relationships again. 

Is it a case you dont feel you deserve better, due to a past partners comments.

Where I struggle is I cant pretend to be something I'm not, I can't act obnoxious or full of myself. I'm told to stop complimenting women so much, they dont like it. Dont want to be put on a pedalstil.

It pains me as I respect women so much, I fully support feminism. I want a woman to be her own person, where I'm more there to  build her confidence to be the person they want. I want them to feel good about themselves. Is this wrong or do women actually still like a man to 'take control'.

I don't feel comfortable around people I don't know and do not enjoy  social gatherings such as parties or having beers in a pub with mostly unknown people, which limits my possibilities for interaction and new connections by a good amount.

Yet, I consider myself to be social; I long for having few people similar to me in my life, with which to share experiences and common hobbys.

2058,krazykwikkrane,1570257512,5,"Hi this is my first post, so thanks for reading.  

I just drove to a bar where my coworkers were hanging out after I was done working, but was nervous to go in.  I texted a coworker if there was anyone left hanging out there, and she said that “we all left.”  Except that the bar was full and I saw her car there.  I drove home, feeling a little broken.   It was like she said “we don’t want you here.”

Yesterday I drove to go see a movie by myself, Joker.  I don’t have any friends to go with, and I’m not close enough with my coworkers to ask comfortably for someone to go with.  (The last movie I went to with someone was a client for my job, who has autism and needs accompaniment to places.  So I was paid to hang out.).  My roommate and I aren’t terribly close, and she left before I could ask her.  At the theater, I was too nervous to find my exact seat number, so I just sat down where I thought it was.  Someone asked me to move.  It happened twice more, and people started laughing at me.  I watched the movie in a corner of the theater, and it was cold. 

I met this one guy a few years back, liked him sooooo much that I moved in with his mom and brother to win them all over.  I did, and the guy told me he liked me back and let me kiss him and I was in cloud freaking nine, when he suddenly stopped talking to me.   I tried snapchatting him little jokes and such, no response.  Once my coworker (who was friends with him), snapped him and he responded, but when I snapped him something similar (it was a joke that involved me and him), he didn’t respond.   He was avoiding me.  I apologized in case I did something wrong, and he responded that I didn’t, and that he would tell me why he ghosted me “soon.”  Except he didn’t and I found out via Facebook he’s been dating another girl.  She’s young and pretty and lively.  And I still live with his mom until December in a lease I can’t leave.

The church I go to is very nice.  There’s a lot of multiethnic people from all classes, so it’s diverse.  I have a small group of people there who I talk to and work with, but they’re all mothers and fathers and young families.  There’s only one other young single woman, and she and I don’t have a lot of friendship chemistry (we went out to lunch once, nothing).  I feel disconnected.  

I’m popular at work.  I’m the “tall funny girl” who makes everyone happy like her.  I’m also the butt of a lot of jokes. It’s always been like that.  I’m the butt of everyone’s joke, and I’ve never known why.  People have pointed it out “why does everyone always make fun of you?” So I know it’s not in my head.   But I don’t really go out ever.  I’m guarded.  I’m afraid of being the “comic relief” of friend groups, again.  The joker.  The dumb silly goofball.  I hate it.  I’m me, and yes, I can be funny, but I want to be bland and quiet sometimes too without being told to “smile because you look grumpy.”  I want to have those intelligent conversations which make me happy about politics and religion and philosophy and art and shit.  I don’t want to just bitch about coworkers.  People seem to only want to complain to each other about things instead of looking with interest at the world around them.  (Yes Hannah, we know you hate everyone, it’s been three years and you’re still bitching about the same people.  Drink your cosmo.)

My family lives three hours away.  When I go visit them I’m overjoyed.  It’s so nice to sit with people you love and just watch a movie, eat, talk and laugh with ease.  I just wish I could get that ease here in this city that I moved to three years ago.  I moved here for school, but that fell through because of money and probably ADD.  Now I’m stuck here, wondering what to do.  

I don’t feel I have a core.  The only consistent thing in my life has been my INCONSISTENCY.  I’m adaptable and I try to be happy.  But I’m so.  Fucking.  Lonely.  I don’t know what to do or how to solve this.  I’m the happy clown who cries in bed by herself.  The tall girl who’s also invisible.   No one has ever wanted to really date me, even though I’ve been told I’m attractive.  The one who’s surrounded by people but might as well be an ocean away from everyone.  The popular girl who’s diverted from hanging out at the bar.  The strong-looking girl that “never lets anything get her down” who struggles with depression and is flakey and directionless. I have no core.  

I’m not some emo kid who’s going through that early-twenties depression everyone goes through (I’m 29 lol).  I’m not a washed-up late twenties/early thirties single mom with a string of exes (Id be grateful for even ONE ex).  I’m a single lonely loser and college dropout.  I’m guarded against making friends and lazy with going out because I’m afraid of being the comedian and the butt of every joke and not just...me.  

I want a core.  That’ll solve all my problems...right?",lonely,"I’m a sad-faced, giraffe-like, butt-of-the-joke clown with no core.",2019-10-05 16:38:32

Not sure why I continue to put myself out there if all that happens is being canceled at the last minute or I get ghosted.

I just feel so helpless and want to give up but I know it won't be any better if I do.

I live in UT where it seems that everyone is settling down and having whole families by the time they turn 22/23 so it's definitely hard to feel like the clock isn't ticking in terms of relationships or even friendships with people who aren't in relationships of their own.

I've tried all the subreddits, ended up finding someone who turned into my best friend, we dated (mistake) and they cheated on me. I was more sad about losing the best friend I've ever had and how worthless my trust was to another human, but that's in the past.

I've been using ""people finding"" apps since my bad breakup. Tinder, Bumble, OKCupid etc. I'm mostly looking for friends and I put that in my profiles but the matches I get are short-lived. I genuinely think I'm pretty entertaining, at least more so than the standard dude on apps like that, but most of my matches ghost me pretty quick or the conversation dies off despite my attempts to revive it.

I had two really great friends I met a while back on Tinder but one of them moved away and they were the one who was able to transport us most of the time so naturally my remaining friend and I just quit hanging out.

I'm complaining mostly about how difficult it is to find someone to talk to for more than a day online. I play games and have some diverse interests so I'd think it'd be pretty simple to find cool people to befriend and trust online. Maybe I'm just bad at it? 

I understand it's not super easy to find people you vibe well with but after two years of consistent attempts I'd think I'd have found some people willing to be around me longer than a few weeks.

2075,BrightInvite7,1570237942,1,"I've been faced with a bout of sadness recently and just want to tell a little story about myself, the gradual decline of my social life and gradual increase in my loneliness , not sure if it'll even be interesting to anyone but it's mainly for my sake.  
So as a youngun, sub 10 years old i'll say, I was seriously as happy as a kid can get, had plenty of friends, fun family, all was good, never a reason to complain.  
It was around age 12 where things started changing, where I'm from that's the year that 'high school' starts. I kind of made it my mission to be the coolest cat in the kettle of high school, and honestly I didn't do a terrible job, I was quite popular, outgoing and was connected with all the other 'cool cats'.  
I had 2 super close friends amongst all the people i knew. One of them was a true friend and while I don't talk to him anymore, I still consider him the best friend I've had. The other was a bit.. eh.. It just took me a long time to realise that he wasn't as 'friend' like as I originally thought. I remember one time I was staying overnight at his house, and he literally forced me to not sleep, he would punch me hard and call me a pussy every time my eyes slipped closed. It was horrible, and soon as I got home the next day I passed out and slept basically the whole day. Not too long after that we fell apart, and I'm kind of thankful for that.  
Somewhere in here I met my first girlfriend, it was basically your standard first girlfriend relationship, we all were 'together forever' and sent heart emojis on facebook so yeah pretty big deal. Anyways we lasted a few months but we had some complications that I won't write here that lead to the end of that.  
We actually talked as friends for quite a while after that but sort of got bored of eachother I think and just eventually stopped talking.  
Anyways, the other friend remained my friend for another year or two after that.  
Our interests eventually kind of split, he found himself practicing multiple sports/other activities and he really didn't have much time outside of school for me. Honestly I still don't really know what happened but we just... stopped. Turns out at some point he became the only thing keeping me attached to the rest of the 'cool cats' and as soon as he drifted out of my life I had no desire to associate with anyone else that I used to.   
So i was basically alone after that, my own fault probably, but I still had confidence at this point in my life and I was able to socialize well and look for new friends, and that I did.  
There was a guy and he seemed quite lonely and I went out of my way to sit next to him and befriend him, the first and last time (unfortunately) that I'd done something like that. I absolutely didn't regret it. I'd say he became the 2nd best friend I'd had, he was a really nice guy. Skip ahead probably a year or two, and I kid you not, he became really close with the same guy that wouldnt let me sleep. They both started doing weed and became generic stoner kids. I kind of just lost all my respect for him after that, am I in the wrong for that? Probably. It is what it is. I wish things didn't happen like they did but oh well.  
(I'm probably jumping through time alot with these memory snippets mb)  
So this is where things really start changing for me, probably 14-15 years old.  
My ideals have completely reversed, no longer did I want to be popular and known, no longer did I have the confidence and extroverted nature that I once did.  
I guess that's a trait that some girls like, because I managed to gain the attention of a girl who became my next girlfriend, and my goodness was it an interesting relationship, it was very up and down, very back and forth, very on and off, she was also significantly more confident than me at the time. In all ways... and sort of used that to her advantage.  
Looking back on it, i'm pretty certain she just liked the fact that I was lacking confidence and initiative because it gave her some kind of 'upper hand'  
Like my first girlfriend, we actually talked for a long time as friends after our 'break-up'  
and also like my first girlfriend, we fell apart.  
I'm really not sure what sparked this whole thing, but I just wanted to be unknown, hidden, and boring. I became scared of conversation and was quite introverted.  
Honestly i'm still like that partly, i'm a load better though.  
Fortunately for me, in high school, people like that kind of band together somehow.  
That's exactly what happened, I somehow ended up with 3 more friends, pretty good friends, not without flaws of course. but they were alright, and just as introverted(if not more) than I was.  
The hipster  
The gamer  
The smarts  
That's how i'll describe them.  
These guys remained my friends up until I was around 17.  
Hipster was interesting but i quite liked him, was frustrating sometimes because he shunned any kind of pop culture which made it hard to talk about a lot of things.  
Gamer was consumed by games and had 0 desire for any real life commitment whatsoever and shunned the thought of that.  
Smarts was really intelligent, shunned the above 2 things too but alot more reasonably, he was the one i was closest with.  
I sometimes felt that when we'd all talk, they'd band up and fight against me and whatever I'd say, whether what I was saying was right or wrong. They also never trusted me with anything, which really hurt, and still does when I think of it. Although I dont think they trusted anyone really.  
It really did get to a point where I actually considered myself to have been bullied by them honestly, never really mentioned it and kind of looked past it.  
We shared a discord server that we'd use to talk outside of school hours.  
After year 12 (the last year i was in school with them)  
We only ever talked in this discord server and didn't spend time with eachother in real life.  
But in the discord server they'd share really ridiculous nasty explicit things, i'm not a big fan of the kinds of tentacle nasties that they were sharing so I asked if they could stop posting them.  
Well that turned out to be the biggest mistake... The amount of spite pictures that began occurring after that was just dumb. They were just constant, and at that point it wasn't the content that bothered me, but the fact that they're laughing and spite posting all this stuff just to bug me really was upsetting.  
I tried to explain but i really don't think they understood.  
While there were some parts of my friendship with them that i really liked, i felt so targeted all the time. like they were always going out of their way to upset me or something.  
I left the discord server out of frustration and never looked back.  
Not sure if I regret it or not. I figure that people who go out of their way to make you feel bad aren't really great people to have around, but I also feel like for the most part they didn't actually know better.  


That left me in a really bad spot though...  
After year 12, for reasons that I'd rather not say, even anonymously, I acquired a commitment that requires me to be at home for most/all hours of the day.  
So I was left with 0 friends, and 0 time to make any more.  
This commitment remains today and is the biggest barrier blocking me from life and I have no idea how to lift it.  
I'm currently 20 and still have 0 real life friends, it's been about 3 years.  
And I just have no idea how to make more, it's easy when you're in school because there are people everywhere, but I can hardly get an hour of time away now, whenever I can get out I usually just go visit my grandma because she lives nearby.  
I do have a few internet friends, not super close, except one.. sort of..  
I met someone online and I don't know why, but I trusted them, and knew I could. (I am usually not particularly trusting, i'm pretty darn reserved)  
I told her everything, literally everything. I'll say now that I still do trust her.  
but bad things happened, someone gained access to our messages and read them all... and now some goober knows everything about me which I hate so much.  
After about a year of being friends with her, she became very busy and couldnt talk to me as much as we once did. This kind of conditioned her to be without me, and she just wanted to talk to me less and less, as she got more and more accustomed to it. She expressed to me that she just doesn't feel the same way about our friendship anymore. We still chat occasionally but it's entirely superficial and I really fear we'll be done soon. I still miss it all but I guess i should be used to this by now.  
So yeah here I am, 20 years old, 3 years feeling trapped with no friends, the only person I ever fully trusted wants to be out of my life.  
I do feel sad but honestly I mostly feel angry. Not even sure why  
Not really sure why I typed all this.  
Not really in the mood to proof read either.

2076,hamartiated,1570237808,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

2077,pepsi109,1570237670,3,"It's Friday night and I'm in my apartment alone with my two cats. They're sleeping. I'm bored out of my mind.

I drift through life working and trying to make myself happy by doing the things I like, but I feel numb when they're over. I barely feel like I'm a person. I say the same things, day in, day out to my coworkers in a mechanical, Groundhog Day type fashion:

""How are you? Fine. That's good. Boy, this week's been gloomy, so much rain. I know. Have a good day. Thanks, you too.""

I just feel like I'm losing touch with the rest of the world. Each day I get further and further away from whatever force is keeping everyone alive. At least I'm not apathetic enough to quit my job or stop paying bills. Cleaning is a different thing... does it really matter if most of my laundry is on the floor if I'm the only one who sees it and it doesn't bother enough to stop doing it? Sometimes I blur the ""I'm lazy"" and ""I am an adult, I do what I want in my house"" lines a bit.

Sometimes I think I've wasted so much of my life doing nothing, being unhappy, that when I do get what I want, I'll have it for like a year and die in a freak accident. I'll never get that time back. Each day is one day closer to the end of my existence. God, that's such a simple and terrifying thought.

2078,TexasPlasticIsland,1570236964,5,"So I know this is pretty common, but I'm the roommate who is being left out. My other two roommates have established a great friendship and hang out frequently and just never invite me. We have never had any conflict and I genuinely don't think they dislike me. But they also don't seem to like me enough to hang out with me. It really hurts my feelings to open their Instagram stories and see them hanging out together. Like right now, I can hear them making plans to go downtown for some drinks and meet with roommate A's friends. I then heard roommate B say ""Is roommate C \[me\] home?"" and the other say, ""Yeah, I think so"" without any particular tone of voice. I was hoping this would be the one time one of them would knock on my door and invite me to go out with them, but no. 

I've had a really hard time making friends since I moved to this new city one year ago and I really don't know what to do. I can't confront them and be like ""I want you guys to invite me to do things"" without sounding like a whiney sibling. I have invited them to hang out several times but they always manage to turn it down for one reason or another. Anytime I try to initiate any kind of socialization with them (even if it's just having tea together in the house) I can always hear the hesitation in their voice.

I don't even know why I'm posting this or what kind of response I'm looking for. I'm just so fucking lonely in my own house and in my own city. I've always had a hard time making friends despite always being told that I'm funny, fun to be around, interesting, smart, blah blah blah.

I’m a 20 years old (male), 21 on the 28th!!! I transferred schools after my freshman an currently in year 2 at my new school. It’s a lot bigger than where i previously went. My old school had about 900 people in total (a liberal arts college) but i made friends almost my first few seconds on campus there that i still talk to, to this day! But they are 3 states away now..... I’m now going to a state school with 20k+ students. BUT ITS SO MUCH HARDER MAKING FRIENDS HERE! It’s been almost 2 years here an I’ve yet to make a friend that I see on a daily basis or even talk to on a daily basis, besides seeing them in classes. An once the semester ends it’s like we are strangers all over again. I have no idea what the problem could be. I’m not really into smoking or drinking that often because my freshman I about kicked out for all that. I Had to think about some of my priorities. Also weed gives me terrible anxiety and I get antisocial as fuck when I’m high. So maybe that’s the problem? Maybe people here hate sober people??? I have noticed that when i rarely do get invited places it’s always to a bar, a frat, or a hotbox sess, but I’m not into those things. I’m down for nights just watching TV and casually drinking with with my friends, goin to a movie, dinner, game nights, hiking, bowling, etc. stuff like that than a frat party clubs or bars. That’s just not my scene and I struggle to feel comfortable at all in those environments. My body always gets uncomfortably hot an I can’t stand being around people drunk out of their minds on the verge of blacking out. It drives me crazy. But I have yet to find anyone who is down for what I like an I try an talk to about everyone who either sits near me in class or just eating around me... lately my days have been just me chillin in my room alone, finishing my homework way too early because I’m bored an have nothing else to do. then playing my PlayStation.

Six months ago we adopted two females that lived on my grandmas property that were, unbeknownst to us, pregnant. One named Sweety and the other named Honey by my little brother, they were sisters. Honey only gave birth to a single kitten, Aella, and was the first time I witnessed any sort of birth as I sat there, the storm only just beginning as Aella was born, I instantly felt a connection to the little kitten. Sweety gave birth to six kittens and I watched them and Aella all grow, we gave most of the kittens away and eventually both moms ran off till we were left with two kittens, Aella and her cousin Fiona. I loved both of those little kittens but Aella was my baby. Before Aella when I would get depressed or lonely, I would just sit in my rooms, playing video games and feeling sorry for myself but since she was a small kitten she would cuddle with me whenever I would get depressed, it would make me feel so much better to feel that little ball of warmth cuddled against me. She truly changed me, I know it sounds silly but I wanted to better myself, even if it was just in the eyes of this little kitty. I got a job, started losing more weight and finally getting under 300 lbs after a long time of being over 400 lbs. I wanted to make a better life for myself in hopes that someday I could move out of my parents house and have a place of my own, my mom won’t allow cats in the house because she is allergic to them so my cats lived on my back porch (very comfortably) but I still hoped to bring them with me so they could be inside cats someday, Today I woke up to yowling coming from my front yard, Fiona was crying under my car but she was fine so I was weirded out by why she was acting so strange, I moved her to the back porch but when I went back to the front yard I still heard faint yowling coming across the street, I drove over there and found Aella caught in twisted branches, she must have flailed too hard and broke her back, she was barely still alive when I found her, we got her out of the tree and she died in the back of the truck on the drive back to my house.

2104,nevets181,1570201236,4,"Hello

So o am typing this to more or less self reflect.  

So a little about me, I am a 37 year old male been married now for 6 months but been in a relationship now for 5 years.  

I am a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan, I have been diagnosed with ptsd and depression. When I got out of the Army I was single for almost four years.  But I did talk to a lot of people because I was always trying to find a date. Talking to someone for weeks then meeting and being ghosted that was the story of my life. 

I enjoyed getting to know people, but since the start of the relationship with my wife I feel that I am not able to find any other real human interaction.  

Oh sure we text all the time but it’s not like we r saying anything. We r either complaining about the cat or she is talking to me about the gossip at her work. I don’t know if that is how it is supposed to be or not but I am more lonely now that I was all those years in the army when I was single.  I feel I am not supposed to have friends or interact with anyone other than her. 

I have gotten to the point where o have thought about paying people to talk to me.  What I used in the military to talk to people were all dating sites and stuff like that.  How do u make friends being married or is that even allowed.  I don’t know had a lot of changes in my life the past 6 years from leaving the army where u always had someone to talk to.  Then straight in to a relationship that is nice but that’s all that there is. 

Is this how married or civilian life supposed to work?   With both big life changes happening so quickly I just do not know.  I keep trying different things to get through life without other human interaction, from leather bonding books to nature &amp; wild life photography.  Is there more to life than just work a hobby and listening to my wife.  

Ok I am done rambling.",lonely,Life ...,2019-10-05 01:00:36

2108,AppleEatPear,1570195080,8,"Hey there. I’m a 15(F), who’s currently a sophomore in high school. I’ve been through a lot though. My dad used to beat me, my former best friend, and my first ever crush, completely cut off all ties with me when I told him about my depression, my friend I met freshman year faked being on drugs to scare me (I almost call the police), and yesterday, I got rejected by my crush. I tried asking around if I should just take the jump and ask him out, and a bunch of guys said that if they were asked out by a girl, it’d make them super happy. So I did, but he said he wanted to focus on his studies. There’s a little piece of me that hopes that maybe we might be able to try something out over winter break or summer vacation, but I know that I don’t think I’m ever going to truly be happy. It just feels like every time I open myself up, I just get hurt again by the people that I trusted. I never really felt loved by a guy in my life, I always felt they were lying, like it was forced, because even though they said it, they never really showed it. So I guess that’s why I want a boyfriend so bad. I just want to beep validated, to feel loved, to feel like it was just luck and that there’s not actually something wrong with me. I just feel like I’m not good enough, I’m worthless, that this is what I get for existing. My dream is just to be a mom and start a family, take care of my kids, try my absolute best to take care of my husband’s needs, and just have a happy family of my own. I just feel lost. I just want a guy to tell me everything is going to be okay, that he loves me and that I am worth it. But every time I turn my head, no one is there. It’s just me.  I know, I’m only 15, I have my entire life ahead of me, but, so many things have happened to me in such little time that it all just feels repetitive, hopeless, and just idiotic to continue on with doing.

I have no brothers or sisters. I usually don't see any family members. I used to have one sweet aunt, but she died of ovarian cancer when I was 14  

I was kind of a paranoid kid. I didn't trust other people. Things changed when I turned 20 and
I met a co-worker. I never felt anything like this. I'd catch a bullet for her. She makes me feel strong. There was nothing I couldn't handle, as long as I got her. She means the world to me.

2116,CowdingGreenHorn,1570187810,2,"Hello r/lonely, this is very long but I have no one else to talk to about this so please forgive me for I need to vent. I'm a 21 \[M\] college student who has never had a girlfriend who is also a virgin, and kiss-less. I had come to a point earlier in my life where I had decided that I wouldn't let my lonely situation affect me anymore and in fact I would embrace being a lonely virgin and live my life out as such. Well that only lasted until I got to college where I realized the only reason I could manage such a mentality was because no matter what happened or how I felt I always had my high school mates to lean on. Well with them gone the weight of loneliness became unbearable once again and the sting of never having experienced an intimate moment with someone became painful. So, I started working out for the first time in many years, got a trendy haircut, learned about fashion and I made my first move a girl, and it went absolutely horrible. She was a classmate, and after I had approached her she blocked me on all social media and stopped going to class for weeks. I was devastated, I may be inexperienced but I understand the do's and don'ts when it comes to flirting with women and interacting with people in general, I was respectful and put the best version of myself out there but she was still repulsed. I felt hopeless at that moment, and I thought about suicide for the first time in my life though it was only for a moment. After this had happened I noticed another girl, far more attractive than the girl who had just curved me, but seeing how my previous attempt went I was scared to do it again so I let the semester pass on. A year later having overcome many more tribulations that tested my low self-esteem and anxiety, I had developed a more confident mentality, this is the state I entered this semester. I entered my first class with no expectation other than receiving a mental beating, and that's when I noticed that girl was in my class again, the one I was too scared to approach for fear of being rejected. She was still as beautiful as ever, I questioned if approaching her was right, I hesitated for a moment but ultimately I forced myself to take the first step forward. So, I sit next to her and I'm getting super nervous, I mean it was so bad that I tried to logging into my laptop but I couldn't enter the password because my hands were shaking so much. I calm myself and find some reason to start a conversation with her, and well I shocked  because of how great it went, we talked for a while and she was actually interested in who I was, she asked what my major is, where I come from, where I want to go, etc...  It was perfect but I still couldn't help but feel like it wasn't real, with someone as beautiful as her? No way! The next day I came in melancholic and expecting her to be gone but she was there! Sitting at the same place as before and not only that but she had saved the seat next to her so I could sit with her, OH MY GOD. So we walk out of class, we're strolling through campus enjoying a nice conversation and as she's getting ready to leave, I take a chance and ask if I can have her number. Not only did she give it to me but she's been actively messaging me with wonderful messages like I've never seen before. So this is where I'm at now, I'm shocked someone as beautiful as her would be this interested me and I'm scared because I don't know what to do next, I've never been in this position. Do I ask her out? Do I wait? I have no idea but I really like her and I hope she does too.",lonely,I got a girls number,2019-10-04 21:16:50

2129,m-xt4pe,1570164243,10,"When I’m alone, I am safe. I am free to be completely and unapologetically myself and it feels so good to not worry about what I look like, sound like, and sometimes not even be aware of the world outside of myself. I have been living alone for a few years, since I turned 18, and have loved so much of it. 
So often, when I tell people that I am lonely, they tell me that I need to learn to love myself as if loneliness takes away my capacity to do so. When I say that I am lonely, every response that I get makes me feel even more so. 
I dont have the energy, the words, and frankly I just do not have the want to explain to anyone that I feel lonely because I am unable to relate to anyone. I spend my days alone, in and out, entirely. I am lucky to have physical contact (a hug, or even a fucking handshake) every other week. I am even more lucky to have a sustainable, out-loud conversation not involving work. And everyone around me has someone to go home to, whether it be there S/O, parents, siblings, best friend, whatever. 
When I say I am lonely, people will say that they are too, but its not the same. Its hard to watch everyone around me live their lives with other people and I only have myself to share everything with. And no one understands because they’ve never experienced it. I just want to be able to relate to someone. I’m tired of feeling more lonely in a room full of people that I care about than I do in a room where it’s just myself. 
It all makes me wallow deeper into my solitude and it’s making me numb. I cant connect to other people, I’ve stopped feeling emotions toward everyone around me. I care, but only so much that I cant feel it. Being alone has done so many great things for me, but I’m starting to think that it’s taken away my ability to exist outside of myself and how the hell am I supposed to say that to anyone? No one cares anyway.

2137,Eppimoo,1570159112,3,"I know this is a lot to read, but this is 5 years of my life coming out after so long and so much. I just want people to know my story.

I'm a junior in high school. I've always been told that high school is the greatest time of your life and that you should make it last and enjoy it because it's a time to live free and have fun and become a new person.

I realized how important it could be and I had a vision for myself and I told myself that I'd make it to a good place in high school, and live almost like a good dream life that would make me happy. I wanted to be able to have a lot of supportive and smart people surrounding me who I could have experiences with and grow into the best version of me with. I wanted to be involved with school. I wanted to leave an impact on people and have importance and make other people happy by being everybody's friend.

Since middle school there was always a certain group of people who were like a family and who were smart and had futures ahead of them and who wanted to live the same good life I wanted. They're referred to most as the ""popular"" people. I wanted to be a part of that because they would be so involved, and they would make connections so easily and just had good open personalities. I wanted to live a life like that.

So fast forward to my freshman year of high school. Right after middle school. Middle school wasn't the greatest for me. I had a few friends but really I just floated along, and I didn't really have any social skills or open personality. 8th grade was especially a very lonely time for me.

I wanted to change and become a new person. I really put myself out there in my freshman year and tried to talk to a lot of people. I tried to make as many connections as I could. I pushed myself forward to make friends, mainly with the popular people. 

In all honesty, it worked somewhat. I was able to go up and talk to some of them whenever and see them in class and the halls and things like that. I thought I was doing great. I thought my high school life was going in a great direction and that I would be a part of that group of people who looked so happy.

But something and I don't know what, was between me and them. Sure I talked to some of them but I wasn't a part of them at all. I wasn't a part of the class of 21 who leads our school and lives the dream life. 

One of the worst pains I've ever felt is sitting on my bed on a Saturday night, after being home all day, looking through my phone, and seeing that while I'm home in my room by myself, a group of people in my school, who I admire so much, are having a backyard party and living the time of their god damn life.

I didn't know what was wrong with me! I didn't know what it was that kept me from being a part of that. I had connection with those people, so why wasn't I happy? I guess then I realized that friendship (especially in groups) is a lot more complicated than I thought. This happened a lot. The exclusions hurt really bad. 

Not only did I have exclusions with the ""popular"" people, but others too. In my freshman year I sat with a group of guys at lunch who were pretty cool and I felt much more included with. It was a more happy part of my year. The thing is, I was closer with them than I was with the ""popular"" people, but I still was excluded from them.

I'd see again on my phone that some of them would all get together. Excluding me and a few others from our table. But it hurts me most. Because I already had felt the exclusion. And I realized why we were excluded. Because a majority of the guys at the table had been friends since middle school! That's why they were so tight. Because they had a long connection. The same with the popular people. They had been together since 7th grade.

So then I realized. The answer to an amazing high school experience is to start right away. To get to the top in middle school. And that sucked for me because middle school already ended, and I didn't do much there.

I did have hope that I could make it though. Because some new people just magically started appearing with the popular people. They just joined in with no problem. Having fun and going to parties and being with friends late at night and things like that. I was so confused because they got there so easily and I had tried since the beginning and still hadn't gotten anywhere. But I still put in effort because maybe just maybe it was possible.

Freshman year went on like that. I'd try to get out there, I'd be sad because I was excluded from multiple groups, but still try to make friends. It's like I was lacking the secret ingredient. It's like something was missing. I hated being an outsider. I hated watching everybody live their life and make friends every single day. I hated seeing the same couple of people every single day. I hated not being a part of something to make me happy. I hated the fact that I didn't fulfill the one thing I told myself I'd have in high school.

Sophomore year was similar to freshman year, I just tried significantly less. It wasn't worth it. I was already at the halfway point for high school and I just wanted to have at least a few friends. 

But because I followed the world's advice and ""put myself out there"", now I was no where because I didn't get anywhere in freshman year! So much for that stupid ass quote.

I still observed the popular people as I cruised through sophomore year. I'd still get hurt because they were living the dream I wished I could live, and I was still confused about why I wasn't there as easily as others.

Then one day everything came together. I found the answer. I found out why some people are chosen to be popular. I found what makes popular people popular. I realized and it just fit together. It made so much sense. It was 1 thing I've hated all my life.

Sports. Sports. Fucking sports. 

I've never been good at sports. It's just not my interest. I'm just not into sports. Hell, in middle school I couldn't even catch a basketball in gym class. I just didn't care for sports. Imagine a gardener trying to make rock music. Yeah that was me with any given sport.

Yet the one thing I absolutely suck at is what made popular people so successful and close. Sports brought them together and gave them something to grow together and work together with. That's how new people just joined them so easily!

They are also very confident. I lacked confidence once I gave up more on ""putting myself out there"".
Sophomore year I just decided to stick with a few people. And that's who I had all year. A small group of a few friends that aren't very involved in school or passionate about things they want in the future. We don't really hang out too much and recently we've been more distant since junior year started because just we don't see each other around school. They still my friends regardless of anything. I do really appreciate them. They are all I have in high school.

And here we are. Junior year. This year, for sure, will be the year I make an impact and live the good life, and be surrounded by great supportive and successful people. Or maybe not. Because I've told myself this for 3 years. And look where I am. In the back. A floater watching everyone else.

I don't want to seem conceited on here. I don't want to look like an asshole complaining on this sub when I have a few friends. I really don't want to seem snotty. I just didn't know where else to tell this story of my life. There's more I can say, but nothing people would care enough about.

All of you reading this are some of the most accepting and understanding people I know. The reddit community is great, because there's no bias with anyone. It's just one person to another. And I just wanted to share my feelings.",lonely,Story of my recent life.,2019-10-04 13:18:32

I made one good friend but she graduated, I have another good friend that I live with but she goes to live with her BF most nights, leaving me alone in our apartment. 

I’m currently dealing with a mixture of current stressors and long time issues. This week hasn’t been the best, I’ve cried most everyday and at night I lie in bed unable to sleep because my mind is too focused on how I’m probably going to die alone (I’ve never dated anyone, and sometimes I feel like I never will at all, even though I’d like to). 

I’ve never been good at concealing my emotions, and apparently I’ve been letting them slip through too much in my major classes because two of my professors want to have a meeting with me about my mental health. 

This stresses me out to no end and has only made the physical aspects of my mental health worse (when I get too upset I can’t eat, my stomach gets so tight I feel like I’m constantly going to throw up). 

I expressed that the thought of this made me anxious and I apologized for how I’ve been, but they’re insistent on meeting with me. I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to talk to them about my true feelings and problems, but I probably can’t get out of this meeting. 

TLDR; professors are concerned about my well being but I’m too anxious to meet with them in fear that I’ll be yelled at. I’ll have to meet them at some point but don’t know what to do",lonely,Lonely in College - Professors want to have a meeting with me about my health,2019-10-04 12:58:51

I think one of my closest friends has picked up on this, because she told me to go on tinder to put myself out there, just to take that step. Two days later (today) I deleted the account because I felt like no one would want to date me. 

I’ve been thinking this way for a couple years now. The only time it eased up was this summer, when I did date someone, but when that relationship crashed and burned it left me feeling far worse.

2143,hamartiated,1570154553,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I'm Joseph. I'm 20 and I'm in a poly-marriage. My wife has a bf and I've been given the ability to share my emotions and love with people. Its funny because no matter how much love i give, i still feel.. hollow. My wife is a sweetheart and our boyfriend is a tender soul that i care for, yet i still feel out of place. I love talking to people, I love giving people all my attention in the moments they want to talk but it feels like no matter what, people arent connecting correctly with me. It always feels like if it works, its temporary. It never seems to last longer then a week and im not sure what to say to tell people they mean more than they think to me. 

People tell me that I'm kind, that I'm loving, yet they still leave just the same as if i was crual and vindictive. They block me out as a relic of their past and through that i have learned one thing about myself.

I am a stepping stone. I will get you to a better place but you're gonna move on and i guess im ok with that now. I just wish i could have someone else to reach out towards.

1. **Expression** 
   1. **Don’t be uptight/inexpressive.** Confidence, rhythm, charm are intertwined. 
   2. **This is a PERFORMANCE.** Think about performance like singing or dancing. Any performance is an extrapolation of your internal state. Voice, body language, dress, attitude. 
   3. **Nobody will judge you if you are expressing yourself congruently.** Things that might be totally bizarre coming from one person could be the best, most unique things about another person. All that matters is that it’s coming from a 5 place of congruence, as opposed to seeking validation. All charisma comes from within. It’s already inside of you; it’s just a matter of removing that which stifles it.

But shit. It makes me feel goddamn lonely because all those ""adult"" things that other people experience are things I'll never get to experience. I don't have any friends so I don't get invited to parties and have the opportunity to fuck my life up. Just once I'd like to try to get drunk and hook up with a random stranger and have a shitty time, but at least I don't feel like I'm missing out on what feels like rites of passage into the adult world. Apparently you make friends this way too so that's another reason why.

2163,josh__6264,1570134485,5,"My heart sinks 
My body aches 
Just the sight of her beauty is so extravagant that I cannot comprehend anymore 
Is it her aura 
Her energy could be felt even if she's miles apart 
But what is this beauty that attracts me so much to her 
The first time I met her I was ignorant of her presents 
But the casual encounter and couinsidential meets 
Has made her like diamond so bright and elegant
But it is too bright for me 
I cannot defile this beautiful creature with my gross hands and unsightly appearance
I can only admire and look from the distance 

I would fantasize if I actually did approach her 
But my presence is so insignificant and I think she would never notice me 
You might call me a hopeless fool or romantic
But I cannot
I am unloved and ghastly 
So fragile and weak
So small and most of all
Ugly 

No one other than my creators have loved me 
But I feel as though they are beginning to 
Despise me 
No matter,it does not surprise me I was always at fault I am the wrong doer

When you develop individualism and when they cannot control you anymore they start to desert you and when they are old they beg you to help them and remind you of your childhood and of course you help because they are your creators because humility is better than revenge 

And so back to her 

Why did I a grotesque creature such as I 
Get ensnared by you 

As one lady beautifully replied
""You loved her face
 not "" Her "",
You just like her appearance
Not knowing anything about her
It's too Shallow"".

""Shallow""
Yes 
My rock was found and 
That is what I needed 
Another illusion of want 
It was never love to begin with
It was just animal
Basic instinct
Already written down 
Just no connection
Only me

My heart aches
My body sinks 
As I realized that
Love is always alone and in need of someone
Even if that someone is Alien
This is why there is so much loneliness in my life 
Because I was in Love by myself and no one could give me the same amount
It scares me and torments me when I sleep and when I am alone

2164,pessimisticslutbag,1570134369,2,"I’ve started sixth form recently. 
The subjects I chose are going okay, the only problem is there’s massive breaks 1-3 hours between some lesson where I have no choice but to go and “study” in the library, even if I have no work to do. I have no choice because it’s been 4 weeks and I haven’t really made any friends yet :/ lol.

I do have one friend who I knew from before I started college but I rarely see her and she has her own new friends anyway so I don’t really want to intrude.

Anyway, in short I just feel lonely. I feel like none of my friends from outside of sixth form are there for me on my bad days (which I’ve been having A LOT of recently).

I feel like they’re only there when I’m in an okay mood and I can comfort them. And I guess I understand why they wouldn’t want to deal with me when I’m upset - they might find it exhausting. 

But I’m just tired I feel alone wherever I go and I hate feeling alone. I hate not having anyone to talk to for hours at a time between lessons.

2168,Andysunshine,1570128341,1,"Hey, so this is my first time posting here although I've lurked around for a while now. It just helps to see other people struggling with loneliness, it makes me feel less alone with my emotions. The past few months were pretty good, but I've gone through an experience that I just need to talk about because it keeps rattling around in my head. I have a close friend who I've confided in with all of my issues concerning loneliness and isolation. He's the only person who really knows how deep it all goes. Last weekend we went and saw a concert out of town. We went with a couple of his friends and we were having a really good weekend. I drove my car all the way there, on the way back from the concert (which was amazing) my car broke down in the middle of one of the least populated cities in the world. I found a mechanic and they said it would be fixed in the morning. My friend turned to me and told me that he would stay with me that night (the others got a ride from one of their parents who was going to drive up that night). I turned and spoke with the mechanic and when I turned around he was talking with the others about going with them. I asked him if he was going to be leaving with them that night and he said ""yes, I'm sorry"". They left me alone in this town for a night. It really stirred up all of my anxiety and depression surrounding loneliness and isolation. He called me when they got home about six hours later and I asked him why he would say that and then turn around, and he said ""I don't regret my decision."" Two nights later (I made it home safe) I confronted him and he was super apologetic and bought me a meal and spent the majority of the evening with me. It was nice. The problem is that I feel all of the residual anxiety around the situation, I feel like I can't trust the one person who I put so much trust into. I feel like even though I try my best to be there for people and to be a good person, they all leave as soon as things get rocky. I just have so many emotions and I don't want to be controlled by the anxiety that I have concerning loneliness and I don't want to lose my friend. I just don't know what to do. I feel like if I bring it up again then it would come across as flogging a topic or trying to guilt trip him.

The only social contact I'm having is talking to my ex-girlfriend, who was dating another guy as I was waiting for them to break up. After they broke, we started to see each other and started to be friends with benefits. In the eyes of anyone this would be good, but not mine, because I know that our relationship has almost no chance to advance from this, for me, a guy who grown up at a place wich the common mentality is to get going with as much girls as you can, living a shallow life finding in the next what you wanted in the last. But I'm sick and tired of this, after years living this way I just wanted to find someone to connect, as I did. But I managed to fuck things up, again, and break up with her some years ago. Now, that I know what I did, knowing that I am unable to follow to the next step with the person I love, because she had a couple of abusive relatioships and now just want to be alone, I keep going with this affair with the false hope of someday she changes her mind.

2181,RustyWood86,1570109786,1,"It's been six years. Six years since I broke her heart. Six years since I made the most life deranging decision possible. Six years since I failed to learn my lesson. Six years since I've known what it was like to wake up next to someone. Six years of profound but not unjustified loneliness, depression and boredom. 

I broke the heart of the best person I've ever known. I find it impossible still to imagine myself as worthy of love or capable of returning it in a meaningful way. 

And yet I am lonely. Deeply, profoundly lonely. It's been so long now I've accepted romance is something for others but never again for me. Every happy couple, every beautiful woman, and every song of love absolutely breaks my heart. 

Through all of it though, something in me still cries out for a companion. The voice is small and weak because I have nearly beaten it to death with the illusion of comfort that comes from the bottom of an empty bottle and a burnt pipe. 

The belief that perhaps, against all evidence and against all hope, I may yet look into the eyes of the last person I will ever love, refuses to die. I have tried with all my might to silence it, to lock it away where I cannot hear it's cries. Yet, I fail and against all reason and in spite of my efforts, hope refuses to die. 

If such a person exists, a person who could love all these broken pieces... I fear my struggle against my loneliness will blind me to her.

We were really great friends for a few months until suddenly, she started ignoring me, not picking up my calls or responding to my texts. She would still call me and talk to me ever so often, but only when she didn't have anyone else. For all that time, I knew that was the truth, and she was only making excuses for ignoring me and the conflict between my love for her, her excuses and the fact that I knew what was going on always put me in constant denial. Because of that I quickly fell into a terrible depression and started hurting myself to get her attention, to no avail. All of it made me feel like shit. But my stupid mind didn't want to accept that she's just a stupid bitch. After a while I started to lose my interest in her when I found out just how stupid she was. I'm ""sapiosexual"" meaning I'm attracted to someone's mind rather than their looks (i still have standards for looks, though). In the beginning she looked the average nerd girl but as time went on I was disappointed. I'm very knowledgeable when it comes to computer science and cyber security, it's (kind of) my profession at this point. One day she asks me, ""can you download games on an acer computer?"" Another time I realized she does NOT know how to pronounce the word ""shadow"" correctly. When I first heard these things I didn't mind them but looking back at it I am petrified. How could've I loved a girl that doesn't know how to pronounce common words in English as a native speaker? Or that you CAN in fact download games on computers? To be fair, she did want to play ""Slendytubbies 3"" with me but that piece of trash is windows exclusive and she had a chromebook. I knew she'd fuck something up if I taught her how to use ""wine"", so I brushed that off. Either way, her basic, reduced digital competence is NOT a thing for me... 

It took me whole months to finally say goodbye to her, slowly removing her from my social media... I can't believe I started cutting myself again and becoming depressed because of such a dumb bitch. Love sucks. I made a post on new years saying I should filter the people I keep in my life as fast as possible, I guess I should follow my own advice!

For the time being I've given up on dating and it feels so good to know I won't miss her.

2196,CCChamp75,1570077592,3,"So recently I’ve been through a lot and it’s left me feeling desperately alone. 

I’m not an antisocial guy by any means, I have a great group of supporting friends that I spend a lot of time with, but I always feel like the 3rd wheel friend. I’m not jealous of my friends gf’s and I actually genuinely enjoy spending time with every one of them. 

I’m single and I’ve been single for way too long. All I want is someone to talk too, spend time with and that shows they actually care about me. I’ve experienced short periods of time while dating people that show me a flicker of empathy towards me and it honestly feels amazing and I become obsessed with feeling that way. But life doesn’t work like that and each time it’s ended very quickly and badly. 

The last time this happened was not too long ago, this girl was different from the others. By far the nicest person I’ve EVER met, one of those people I could talk hours with and never get tired of her, we had so much in common, but one thing lead to another and it all ended very quickly. 

I want to feel loved the same way I felt when I was with her for that short period of time. I’ve cried myself to sleep a lot thinking I’m never going to meet someone better and that I’m just purely alone because I can’t share how I’m feeling with any of my friends. (Can’t share with friends cuz they introduced us, and they’ll tell her, and she can’t know cuz of what she’s also gong through). All I want is someone to share my feeling with and someone to actually care, give me a hug and tell me everything’s gonna be okay. I wish she could’ve been that.

I just kind of wish that I never knew a friend like her, I wish I never knew what not being lonely felt like. Because it stings so much more now that everything reminds me of her. It’s worse than a break up, if I’m being honest. 

The most human contact I get sometimes is at my tables that I wait on. Then after work, I talk to my bartender at the bar I frequent. Try to find someone to hook up with in my intoxicated state, even though I know they don’t give a shit about me.

2206,hamartiated,1570068328,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I (23M) am not a complete loner. I have a couple good friends actually, but even in a group of people, I feel alone. I'm not anyone's best friend, or even really a true part of any group I hang out with, I always feel like a ""third wheel friend""if that makes sense. I consider my friends to be friends, but they're not people like me. 

I guess now would be a good time to describe myself a little. I'm somewhat of an introvert, but I like to be out. I spend a lot of my free time at the bookstore, the movies, and when it's warm out, exploring my city through walking around and finding new places to eat/drink. I dress very nicely compared to most people my age (or really just in general), I'm always in a collared shirt, normally slacks or chinos, and usually penny loafers or more casual leather dress shoes (wingtips, split toes). I don't dress to impress others or girls, it makes me feel good and confident about myself. Even if I'm spending a day by myself, I like to look nice for myself. I would say I spend a good amount of time out by myself, I try to not be cooked up in the house too much.

One thing is it's very hard to find like minded individuals in my  geographical location. I don't mind going out to bars or clubs on the weekend, but that's not what I want to do EVERY weekend like many people my age. I'd rather go to a quieter spot to grab a drink and bite to eat. When I suggest this to friends, they usually protest and prefer the same old same old. One thing I'd like to start doing but haven't is, I'd like to go to o some local plays/shows, poetry slams and things of that nature. My reason not to is I don't want to be alone in a room full of people who are all with someone else. I should probably take the jump and just go, but situations that like make me feel really low, being surrounded by people who are not lonely. 

This probably goes with out saying, but I am single. I haven't ever really had a REAL relationship before, just the ""relationships"" in high school that ended within weeks. I do believe there is a woman for me out there for me, but I've grown frustrated of not having a girlfriend for so long. I've obsessed with the idea of just having someone to hold hands with and talk to, or show someone the amazing and fun things in life that make me smile. I don't necessarily feel too jealous of other couples because a majority of women in my area really aren't my type.

I've come to the conclusion that eventually I need to take the jump and move somewhere else. Maybe there's somewhere with more people like me, where it'll be easier to build healthy relationships. But in the back of my head, I always feel like I'll be the single, third wheel friend.

I recently got in two major fights (separate occasions) with two friends. We won't probably hang out anymore, there's simply nothing else to say or to do. 

Now I feel like I'm losing my third (last) friend who is also my friend in Uni. He's going through some shit but he literally put a wall between us and when we're hanging out it's like he's not there, or he's on his phone talking to his best friend and we can only talk about things that are on the surface. He even told me the other day, he can't express sympathy towards me because he becomes too involved and it sinks him. That felt like a dagger sliced my heart.

I actually have no one to talk to. I used to be on my phone a lot - for communicating. Now I go days without using it.  I feel sad because if there was someone who was dear to me, going through a similar pit hole, I would be there for them, day and night. No one's here for me.

I feel my chest is going to explode. I don't eat. I just want to cry all the time. I'm going a little crazy and thinking about the end...

It's been now a month that I haven't talked to anybody in real life. Not even a word. I tried to but I feel like I am bothering them. Students in my degree organized an integration party, I only learned the date of the party the day AFTER the party was held by hearing some students in the corridors.
It honestly hurts so much. Everytime I think about how lonely I am I tear up.

2232,alxshai,1570042635,2,"this is what people do when they don’t understand one another,they hurt and continue to hurt when they can’t understand. Especially people that can’t understand or don’t know how to love,because it’s confusing it’s a lot it’s hard to love yourself so only imagine how it is to love somebody else truly. i have never had a problem understanding my own love it’s understanding other people’s love and how they perceive another’s love. i understand in all its simplicity how i love people and why and how that love comes about. I am able to love other people as it is the same to breathe,i am able to love myself subconsciously but it is hard for people to love me, it’s hard maybe cause i put myself out of reach,i don’t allow people to understand me. i don’t think or act how the majority does i always say i think i’m before myself,i feel stuck like i’m in the wrong place all the time. The way i love is first through affirmation,i’m too loyal to  disloyalty this is my biggest mistake. Then it is the semi attachment obtained from hours upon hours of endless talking and conversation in one time because one doesn’t simply do this because they are bored it because it means something? incorrect this is my second mistake people are unpredictable,sly and manipulative characteristics someone like me fails to see as i only see the best in people even if it means i have to invent it myself. People can pretend for the fun of it or to gain something out of it. this i know all to well because when loving or feeling i have always been put in the same position different exterior same interior, each boy with a different look each with the same intent and goal. For there has never been one boy who has kept me and solely me in their heart,i have never been anything but 2nd best. I am nothing more than someone to pass the time with until something better comes along, this has broken my heart too many times for me to feel,i will admit i don’t feel love because why would you when it only proves to be destructive why would you want to feel that so i turned that feeling off believe it or not. i stopped falling for words,i stopped falling for actions. i stopped falling. Instead i followed, i followed back on the words i followed the actions i reciprocated in a way as to keep up appearances. i saw the wolf dressing up in the sheep’s outfit and i did nothing but go along with it’s actions until the day it would decide to undress. because all wolfs get tired of sheep’s clothing especially when they meet something else. It was just a case of seeing who could hold out the longest my mask or my feelings. When the wolf begun to start undressing which didn’t take long it didn’t hurt i didn’t feel anything but anger,angry that a wolf could think they deceived me a wolf running and screaming to the mountains it deceived me when it was not me  that was deceived but the wolf, i let you think you had me and that you played when it was me that was going off on you,laughing at the things you would say,rolling my eyes. not even slightly amazed at the actions you put together. i over analyse and create patterns that aren’t apparent i do this and go off this. I wish i hadn’t been broken so much times,the more you break something the more and more it fails to work as it did,i fear loneliness because that’s what this does to me the fear of not being able to trust,not being able to feel,how can you form a connection with someone you can’t feel for or can’t trust because at all costs you cannot afford to get broken again because you cannot guarantee to yourself that you will still function, what an upsetting cycle it is for someone who longs to be loved that can never be loved. Someone who cannot have a guard up as every person is ‘different’ and will offer something new and the bombardments of what if. what if this one is the one i mustn’t shut him out in fear he will only look else where. This is how i love and can never be loved. His words echo in my mind. “There is no one for you “ it repeats in a dead tone in the front of my mind. “there is no one for” a destroying sentence in itself, there is not a single person in the world in the great mass of people not one person will be compatible for me, this isn’t a stranger saying this to me it is at the time my boyfriend whom i’ve loved for 3 years and been with for a year the boy who told me he wanted a future with me is the same boy who told me no one is compatible for me. not even himself and this wasn’t said in a way as i am so superior nobody deserves my love or can even level me it was said in a way that i should spend the rest of my life alone because i do not deserve to love anybody. this was said with nothing but malice and anger. i don’t trust words or actions so how do you plan to prove you love me for real and how do you expect me to fall for you",lonely,thoughts to share,2019-10-03 04:57:15

2234,BootyDroppinJane,1570041157,31,"I hesitated on posting this here because what I’m dealing with is not loneliness. It’s like the calm acceptance that comes after you’ve realized you pretty much have to be alone. When you google things like “Can’t love” of “must be alone” or “not wanted” everything that comes up is about self-worth. “Oh well you feel like you don’t deserve to be loved, so that’s why you’re alone.” No. No no no no. I’m so sick of reading this. Undoubtedly it’s true for some, but for me this does not resonate. I *did* hate myself for probably the first 25 years of my life. But that’s no longer the case (after much therapy and support group work) and at this point I do love myself. I’m very aware of my flaws, but I know they don’t make me unloveable. But just because I feel loveable does not mean that people suddenly love me. That’s a bullshit narrative that I am sick of hearing, not only because it’s not true, but because it places the blame on YOU. “Well yeah others would love you but they can’t because YOU don’t love yourself.” If anyone reading this came from an abusive family, which I have a feeling many of you have, you know this isn’t true. Your family didn’t NOT love you because you didn’t love yourself. That was their shit, not some unconscious belief around your lovability that you had as a baby. Children inherently feel lovable and are only taught otherwise by the people around them who mistreat them. So that “low self-worth” narrative literally does not hold up to 30 seconds of scrutiny. 

I’m also frustrated by it because it overlooks the fact that, for any multitude of reasons, some of us are genuinely more difficult to love. While I am aware of some of my inherent disagreeability, people that I care about often leave me or get angry with me even when I’m behaving as well as I possibly can with them. Even when I’m doing my best to be open, communicative, loving, and respectful, this happens to me. (And this happens to everyone to some extent I think. Loving yourself does not, I repeat, does not mean others will magically love you, too.)

And so when I Google these terms, what I’m looking for is somebody who shares my experience. That’s also why am posting this here. If you hate yourself and that’s why you feel lonely, then this post probably isn’t for you. But if you also feel the way I feel for the love of God please say something because according to pop psychology websites, people like me supposedly don’t exist, or we’re patronized and told that we must just subconsciously believe we don’t deserve love. Bollocks. This is also why I find self-improvement talk frustrating at this point in my life. It focuses solely on the psychology of the individual, completely ignoring the majority of our lives are determined by external circumstances, not by our thought patterns. Annoying.

Firstly I'm broke AF (don't pity me) and living paycheck to paycheck. Also, I'm lonely as a 30yo male in the South West of the UK.

This all started a month or two ago when my other half broke it off with me and took everything.

I moved out of the house and went to live with mum. Then as the loneliness creeped in I started to hit up guys  and offer head to them just for the fucking company. 

Now the problem is that I've done that, it's all I wanna do. Part of me screams to pick myself up and deal with it and the other half says ""no, get used, you love it"".

So for a little back ground information. I am a 18 year old male at his first year of university, I have no roommate and have only had about 4 or 5 actual conversations with people here so far. 

In highschool I was typically the kid everyone overlooked until senior year. My senior year was wonderful, I had so many friends and someone always wanted to spend time with me outside of class which was really nice, also going to a pretty small highschool everyone knew me and said hi in the hallways or in classes. Of course though I lose that social life I had after I moved to my dorm about an hour away from home, ever since I got here ive spent most of my days locked into my room hiding from everyone because I think they already have negative thoughts towards me. This behavior has lead me into a downward spiral of missing class and scrambling to come up with deals with my instructors to let me turn in my homework a little late. 

Im so pissed off at the world and at myself most of all, I have no one here I can hit up and ask to hang out with, no one to ask me how my days going in the hall, the only person I have that I talk to everyday is my girlfriend, who lives 900 miles away :( 

im so tired mentally I just want to lay in bed all day and give up, I thought going to college was going to be a lot of fun, I thought living alone and having freedom was going to be amazing but all ive gotten from it was my depressive tendencies back and a general disinterest in life.

2265,DrBurnside,1569987477,2,"I want something that I shouldn't be allowed to have yet. I have to stop myself from being driven by love, I obviously wish I could let my love find a victim and not be concerned about it. It makes me smile to imagine I'm with a loved one who could make me feel loved. I could hold their hand or make them smile or hug them. It really makes me happy to think about things like that. They don't even have to be there, as long as it's a loving exchange of words.

I have qualities that will make such a relationship poor for the other person. I think I could potentially be a bad partner. I don't think I should have those qualities and that relationship at the same time. What's unfortunate is that it will never stop me from wanting that kind of connection, so I imagine I'll eventually set myself free.

I've tried to interact with people online to see if I can form a relationship not like above, yet have it be one that will satisfy me. The sample size is really small, so there's some hope of success. Upon learning someone is male, I quickly lose interest in forming a relationship. When I learn someone is female, I continue communicating. I've been what I think is a caring friend to some, and that feels good. But I had a secret hope of that friendship developing into something bigger, and the action made by that hope is very quick. So making friends doesn't seem to be a solution, but again it's a small sample size. I've considered purely sexual relationships. I haven't had one, and haven't tried having one. I'm sure I'd love having one. I believe I'd be quick to love the partner, that's what could go wrong. I may be too focused on what might happen though, rather than trying things out and assessing things. But I predict having a friend with benefits or something like that won't work.

My final solution is to have a pet (tortoise for sure, though I don't know if I'd feel loved by a tortoise). I can love it without the possibility of becoming evil to it, and perhaps they could love me back. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to have one, when I'm not living with parents who don't want an animal in the house, I'm living in accommodation that doesn't allow pets.

2273,hamartiated,1569981707,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I’ve lived a very transient life and have moved a lot. I’ve actually really worked on being more social for the past 10 years and have really improved. I feel very comfortable now striking up conversations with people but I have a hard time forming meaningful connections and maintaining relationships. 

I’m back to university as a mature student (29) which makes me feel even more isolated because I’m surrounded by 20 year olds that I can’t relate to and people my age are getting married, got careers, and are having kids.

About 5 months ago I started dating a girl and we had a very deep and meaningful connection. First time in a long time that I’ve connected with someone on that level. Things went great for a while then we went on a big vacation and she went cold on me when we got back. 2 weeks later she tells me that she saw things on the trip that would make us not work in the long run.

I accept the fact that it’s over. Whatever, that’s life. Now I just feel right back at feeling isolated and lonely. Moving around so much has made me not settle anywhere and build a community. I’m almost 30 now and I have no idea where I belong in this world.

I always pictured finding my SO someday, having a family, and feeling like I belong to a community but I’m not sure if that’s ever going to happen. My biggest fear in life is being a lonely old man and every year it feels like that nightmare is going to come true.

Forgive the flow of thoughts, as i am not a writer, and forgive my english, since its not my mother language,

  


most of my life i spent it suffering, most of my memories is of pain.

no, this is not an exaggeration, nor it a plead for help.

i feel empty, like there is no soul inside, like my heart beats blood and nothing else.

my definition of happiness is the absent of pain. for its all i feel.

again, this is not a joke. not an exaggeration, nor is it a plead for help.

  


i tried finding someone to talk to, someone to listen, there is none.

i don't even know how to express my self, for i am no writer,

nor do i know where to begin, i opened this document for that purpose,

maybe writing will help me organize my thoughts.

  


allow me to start by giving a picture of my current state.

  


i spent most of my days drugging my self with music, video games, and sleeping.

i tried so hard to learn programming, art and video game development,

as i do know that i am intelligent, not a genius, but intelligent.

i love creativity, as for art, i always saw it as an outlet.

however, i am a procrastinator, and no will power nor the inspiration to follow thorough.

i tried once finding friends on-line to help me, as i have read somewhere that

its helpful to have someone to keep you accountable, however there was none.

  


no friends, no family members can understand, and no one to turn to.

a dead end job, where my co-workers are nice, but no friends among them.

never been in-love, overweight, passive-aggressive,

always had a problem making friends, and have problems understanding jokes and sarcasm,

as i tend to believe everything, take most situations seriously, personally and logically.

  


had a traditional marriage, chosen by my parents, only lasted for 5 days,

you see, i had my suspicion that she was not an honourable woman,

on the fifth day, i managed to find a proof, she was cheating on me.

i divorced her after that. i could have jailed her for that.

but i chose not to.

  


all of my life, my parents have favoured my younger brothers,

my mother threw me a way as a child, so my father disregard me,

he is physically available, however he never treated me as a son.

he bought all my younger brothers new cars, i had to buy my own used car.

he is used to giving my brothers all the emotional and financial support, never me.

  


even now. as i type this, i feel nothing.

no pain, nothing but total emptiness.

  


i have considered suicide, many times,

but a part of me remains hopeful,

one day, it will all be better,

i don't why this hope is still alive, i swear i don't.

sometimes i cry, for no reason, sometimes i cry myself to sleep.

sometimes, i wonder, what happiness feels like,

i can't even remember that.

  


speaking of hope, sometimes i try list all the good things about me,

sometimes it makes me feel less pain, sometimes more,

when it makes wonder why do i deserve all of this pain.

  


i am good by nature, my conscience is alive, i never want to hurt anyone,

as it makes me feel guilty, a burning sensation in my chest,

i don't want to ever feel that,

i am extremely loyal, as i try to never break a promise,

except promises i make to myself,

i am intelligent and logical,

i am really good with computers, technology in general.

i have a passion to learn new things, like languages and art,

whenever i can gather what little will power i have.

for some reason, i believe in love, that love can make everything better.

especially if i entrust my aching heart to someone who deserves it.

everyone who knows me, tells me that i am extremely kind hearted,

to the point its considered a weakness,

  


for example, when i discovered the betrayal of my now x-wife,

i tried to forgive her, i really tried, but i never could,

i was honestly surprised by that.

for the first time ever, i could not forgive someone for hurting me.

other than my parents, who i am still trying to forgive.

2288,esmereldacortez,1569963279,1,"Hey yall sorry for the long post, just trying to work some things out. 

So I've been battling depression since high school, always the loner type. I (29f) started getting panic attacks pretty early on and didnt know what they were and thought I was crazy. Made me more depressed and felt like more of an outcast. Never told anyone what was going on with me, just buried it until one day in a psych class in college found out what had been happening. I eventually learned how to talk myself out of an attack when I felt one coming on (to this day I still get them sometimes but I'm pretty good at stopping them). 

So depression lingers in the corners of my brain for years but im also pretty good at snipping it in the bud. I meet this guy at college and he starts saving my seat for me each day, we end up dating. I find out early on he has a heroin addiction but hes working on it. I, at 20, have no idea really what that even is. But I'm supportive in him staying clean and we have a beautiful and difficult relationship for the next six years.

   After multiple relapses over the years and doing everything I could to help him, and he was trying just as hard..I found out he had started using again. Confronted him, with his parents, he was high and tried to run away.  I ran after him and convinced him to come back that we could work something out. He would get the help he needed. I laid him in our bed to take a nap. When I went to check on him, he had accidentally overdosed, I didnt think to check his pockets. 

    It's been 2 1/2 years and I'm realizing I cant do this alone, I needed some help. I for the most part have worked through the trauma and pain of losing my best friend but I also alienated myself with our relationship. I lost many friends and to this day only have one or two. I can't remember the last time I had fun or actually enjoyed anything, on a real level. I feel like I'm floating through space in some dark reality. But I don't want that to be true. 
 So I'm really hoping this will help, I dont have insurance and cant afford to talk with a therapist so I'm just trying to really think as positively as I can and focus on the future, whatever it might have in store.

If you think that no one notices you or that no one notices you, just look for it. I always think that no one cares, but I return several hellos and smiles every day. And I’m by no means popular or out there. I’m not one that people would pick out of a crowd. Just try to be just a bit more scocial. Just a little bit. It might not feel like it makes any difference, but if people see you coming out of your shell, they’ll be more willing to approach you. Yes, it’s uncomfortable.

1. **Inner game** 
   1. **What is it?** Confidence, beliefs, self-esteem, thought processes, etc. 
   2. **Without it, socializing will seem unnatural.** But without outer game, you’re less likely to get success and hence confidence. You need to be strong in both. We gravitate towards people of high status. There are many ways to convey this, but inner game affects how you come across. It manifests through your body language, eye contact, voice, and many more cues, which are imperceptible. 
   3. **How to develop it?** It’s best to start with your outer game. Experience breeds competence, which in turn breeds confidence.",lonely,Inner game,2019-10-02 04:56:59

Due to the school being too difficult for my disabled brain*  I changed to another one, which is, they say, much easier**


So here am I, in a class full of people that are a bit younger than me, that already have their own groups of friends. My astronomical intelligence is too high for me to socialize with new people, therefore I am quite alone in this new class.


I also am kinda losing contact with my ex-classmates, strange to think that the only times I have ever met them was when we were at school.


In the meanwhile I can see (on socials) that they are actually having fun times together, you know, doing things that friends do and stuff. Also the only times where I receive some messages is when they send me a meme that talk about me, which is kind of sad, considering they are all about being bad at art, computer science, but mostly memes about depression. The only times we ever talk is when they have technical questions to ask from me (""hOw dO i dOwnLoAd PoWePooInt??, DuDe AftEr EffeCts is Soo Hard!! How do I maKe ePic GameR InTros???"")


I got the pleasure of meeting then again two times, and at the end of the days I felt like I was there just to be there, I could barely talk and they would barely listen. Dumb me I can't spit 4 words consecutively that make sense without crashing internally.

so yeah, aaa, why am I even here, what's my purpose? Helping people with things they can easily google? been wondering about my place in the world recently, and the more I think about it the more uncomfortable I feel about being me.

how do I get out

TL;DR have the IQ of a wet stone, friends don't wanna be so friends, new class neglects my existence, existential crysis , want to escape from this hellhole, even though I will def fail, like my last year at school.

  And so, it's happened again. I haven't ghosted a single person who has reached out to me, but my notable ghost count is probably at about 10 now. Because I post with passion (main account, not here, obviously) in what I call the miseryphere of reddit - s/lonely, s/suicide watch, etc - I occasionally get women who reach out to me and wax lyrical about how well they can relate to me, and how we should be friends, etc. Or people responsive to my dms. And inevitably they always disappear. This time the person has deleted all their Reddit content, and their disposable email account, etc - cutting ties completely.   

  
  The thing that fucks me off is these people know how lonely and depressed I am. That's why they contacted me. Because I'm writing about feeling worthless, and shit, and having no hope. What the fuck is wrong with them that they can't see how shitty their behaviour is? Find a lonely person and... and leave them feeling even more alone! I'd never contact a depressed girl, yet alone someone posting on suicide watch, string her along, get to know her a bit, let her open up about her problems, etc, and then just one day disappear without an explanation. It's shunt like behaviour.     
  Thankfully, I have someone I still write to, and have for nearly a year. It's unfortunate that she is on the other side of the world. Out of the tens that have come and gone. So Reddit isn't all bad.   

  
  But I can't trust anyone on Reddit now. Since day one I have been on the wrong side of this behaviour, and I'm sick of it. I'm going to have to find the self control from now on to politely refuse any interest that comes my way from people on mental health Reddit. Because, frankly, I am too vulnerable.

I spent 15 years doing literally nothing but jerking off, watching TV, and playing video games. And for a time, it was good. But a few years ago extreme suicidal depression set in out of nowhere.

So to avoid hanging myself I got a shitty part time job but made some work friends who I'm working on making actual friends since I left with two on deck; one's on a trip right now, the other says she's down to do something but her and my schedules aren't aligning right away.

I wish I could say that it started when I moved to a new town with no friends around, but I’ve been more lonely ever since my ~2 year relationship about 7 months ago. It’s an incredible loss to no longer have that one person you could count on to be there, to talk to, to vent and to hold. I’ve successfully gotten a job in this new town and it’s quite well, I seem to be understanding my roles and everyone there is kind and friendly. But I don’t know how to interact with them outside of work. I’ve had and opportunity or two but things just feel awkward. I’m still so new and it almost feels like people are respecting my quietness and not provoking me with questions, if that makes sense.  I just am jetting this feeling that I’m in a rut of being lonely, and how I project that is people leave me alone because that’s what they think I want.  Of course I haven’t verified this, but I might try to find out if I’m right. 

I’ve been looking at ways to not be lonely around here, joined some MeetUp groups, looked into volunteering.  I even tried setting up a Match profile but that lasted all of 5 minutes. I was kinda okay going through the questions, they were quite simple but wen it got to selecting a picture of myself I just locked up.  It’s always been a bane of mine that I don’t have many pictures of myself.  I’m a 22 year old guy and have never been appreciative of how I look. It obviously doesn’t help that I have a hard time controlling my diet and fail to keep a regular schedule of using the workout room at my apartment complex. Anyways I tried skipping the picture and going to the site.  I just couldn’t take the feeling of the site, I hated how it made me feel. I deleted it promptly and haven’t looked back since.  Before my relationship I would create dating site profiles, and time and time again they never panned out.  Something about me just doesn’t seem appealing.

2350,hamartiated,1569891750,4,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26, guy, Europe - Clean audio chat - Looking for online friend, who needs regular conversation and emotional support - Depression, anxiety, arts, books, philosophy, music",2019-10-01 11:02:30

I know I sound whiney. It’s not as bad as some people on here. My boyfriend is busy tomorrow so he’s letting me visit him later in the week. I’ll see my friends soon enough for non-birthday reasons. I’ve just been really depressed, I’ve been crying alone in my room for over a week and the fact that I’ll be alone for my birthday is proof of how alone and inadequate I am. 
I’ve never had a party thrown for me, last one I had many years ago, half of the people I invited didn’t show up without telling me, most of the other came very late and the few people there just sat not socializing, so I was just embarrassed the whole time. I’ve had my friend group of 12 years ditch me this year due to one of the members constantly organizing events without me, and me not noticing until it was too late. I now can only meet up with a few members one on one because they don’t want to risk being dropped too. 
I’m really hoping tomorrow goes better than I think because I don’t want to be bitter about other people’s birthdays all year. I really like celebrating with people because I know what it’s like to feel left out. The silver lining I guess is I won’t feel like I have to stay up until midnight to say happy birthday, or organize presents and cards, and go to awful parties and dinners because I’m obligated. 
My wish this year (not that I have candles) is that one day someone will organize something on my birthday, even coming over for coffee, or I’ll have friends I can count on enough that I can throw a party and they’ll come.",lonely,Alone for my birthday,2019-10-01 07:57:16
2364,OoMunchkinoO,1569880452,12,"Well hi. To start this off I’m . 
At the end of November of last year I got out of a two year relationship. I took time off from everything. Friendships, I stopped caring about school, literally I pretty much stopped living my life for a long long time. 
A while ago I decided to start making friends again. I started trying to get my life together. I went back into therapy, started trying to be as social as possible for me (an introvert) and I got into a relationship. 
Well this guy had some issues, and I was okay with that because I did too. He was so sweet to me, but incredibly rude to other people. He put up a “front” around his friends. He tried to act tough. 
I really did feel like behind all that, he was a good person. I made excuses for his actions, and lost friends over it. 

Well one day he called me and said he didn’t want to be with me anymore. His friend was in the background calling me names, and he was just laughing at what his friend was saying. He said he had another girlfriend and all these things that really really hurt. 

The next day he texted me saying “sorry I didn’t mean what I said”, but he was with his friend when he said those things. He was trying to be mean to me to look “cool” in front of his friend or whatever, he did many hurtful things that I won’t say here, but I won’t forgive him or give him another chance. I don’t deserve to be treated that way by anybody.
But I’m so lonely. I lost friends because I defended a guy that ended up hurting me. I still have my closest friends, but I do miss being in a relationship and feeling loved in that way. I just feel so alone. I’m not sure what to do, I don’t want to go back to being the way I was when my other ex left me, that was so unhealthy for me. Any advice on how to try and stay mentally healthy at this time? How do I go about making sure my relationships with people are healthy ?",lonely,"My boyfriend fucked me over, and I’m feeling lonelier then ever",2019-10-01 07:54:12
2365,jobunnhei,1569879778,20,"In highschool I was excited to date and make lots of friends. I seem to just become friends with outcasts who move away after a year. People forgot me easily and took advantage of me. Never got even close with anyone I had a crush on.
Then after dreaming for highschool to be over, I imagine college to be much better. Still no love, not many friends, not much of anything. Still feeling forgettable and unnoticeable. 

Life is constantly dreaming of something better to happen but it doesn't. I know I ""have control over how I respond to things and what actions to take"" but it feels so hard. It feels like I don't know how to. I feel like there's no one to talk to anymore since every response I get from a friend is dismissive or ""you should go to therapy"" ""you should take meds"" when I already have tried and they know it.  

Everyone wants to be happy so they try to show it in media and such but then it causes an idealization and expectation in people's heads that don't get met.

I'm hoping after college things are better and I'll be free but I feel like I'll be more alone than ever and miserable. Casually thinking of suicide. What is there in life? I guess I have family left. 

""Think positively""  I wish I could. 
""Be grateful for what you have""  I wish I wasn't feeling down. I know people have it worse than me. 
""You're young! You have time!"" Time runs out fast and I think I've already wasted so many years of my life when this was supposed to be ""prime time"".

I've kinda spent the whole day over thinking it all but realised I can't let myself get caught out by a false sense of security again because that's how I get hurt so I've cut myself off from any contact with anyone, not like anyone really spoke to me anyway, just so I can get used to being alone again.

Every passing day sends me closer to my departure date. 

Today I woke up to my email telling me that it is almost time for my trip. I know, Gmail, I know. My backpack is sitting beside my bed looking at me. It is empty. I haven’t packed a single thing yet. I haven’t arranged anything other than.... I'll be there. 

I've been considering selling all my games, consoles, and movies. Just to make sure I'll be able to get back. (yeah, don't have that worked out either. Really inopportune time to lose my employment, thanks anxiety. Goddamnit..) That's okay. I'll figure it out as I go. I always do. Need to arrange transporting my stuff to the shops tomorrow. The hour is upon us.... I have to arrange transportation to Pittsburg too. I may have it all lined out but I'm preparing for flaking becssue people tend to be that around here. It would take me 22hours to walk there so that isn't particularly a great option (I would do it though. And don't think I wouldn't.;)) It's $15 to take a different bus from there but I would have to sit in Pittsburgh for 9 hours at the bus stop waiting on the right bus. (so that would kind of suck too.... But will do it. So feel special.) Hopefully Kris does what he said he would but I'm not putting all my eggs in that basket just in case. 

Tonight I'm going to pack and make sure I have everything I need. I know it's still a few days away but I want to be able to rest without feeling like I still have stuff that I need to be doing. 

I got back into my .edu email finally. Going to fix what I need to for that job. 

I know I can be hyperemotional. I know you're the same way too. I love that about you. (Not so much meeee buttttt it's cute on you..) There are times when you truly make me feel special and loved. When that darkness creeps in, let me go ahead and apologize about it, it's not good and I'm sorry. I'm working on it. You should have met me as a teen...lol you think I'm emotional now whew.. I've grown a lot since then baby.  And I'm still growing. 

I saw something today that made me think about you... It was a quote from Bob Marley.. it said ""If shes amazing, she wont be easy. And if shes easy she wont be amazing. If you give up, you're not worthy... TRUTH IS, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for."" 

I would suffer for you.... All day. &lt;3

Sometimes I can see us sitting around pretending like we are in the Renaissance in corsets and stockings (hot much?!!? Fuck) and drinking tea and laughing and the most obscure and random shit. At least we have a blast in my day dreams. Are you as nervous as I am with each passing day? I bet you are. You won’t regret it. I honestly think this is the start I’d something beautiful. My subconscious agrees lol

I am scared of the new semester coming up. Don't get me wrong, education is important. However the people there made me dreaded to go to class. I felt isolated and crying every day. Without a fail, my brain will rewind to the past event, reminding how much of a dumb social human I am. 

I realised my mistakes but the deed was done. I can't return back to the past. Now, I am feeling worse than before I am in my secondary school. Whenever I find myself spending time in my room alone, I get emotional and cried out.

I have a job and it is making wonders on me as my manager put on the position of a cashier. I was slowly able to do the tasks and speak to customers. Still the thought of my friends disturbed my flow of work. 

I can't concentrate on the things I like. I felt disconnected from everything.
