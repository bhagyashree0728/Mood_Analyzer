2,goodforyew,1561899531,2,"Growing up, I was bullied hard so I didn’t get to make many friends. I had one really good friend in high school but I can’t keep up with her since we started university. (Different universities) She’s financially comfortable so she likes to go out everyday and eat at fancy restaurants, I don’t have that kind of money so I join her once in three months. I had been betrayed by my only other friend yesterday. I know she did not value our friendship as much as I did but what she did was quite mean. I know people, sometimes I get to hang out with them but I am never their priority. I know they only hang out with me if their other friends are unavailable. It’s always been this way so you would think that I would be used to by now but it gets harder as I get older. I am scared that I will let loneliness get to me and make me do things I do not want to.

I've been friends with this girl for at least over 7 years and shes a core in my small group of friends. We've been close for at least 2 years now, and theres always been some tension between us, always thought she was pretty. Also recently we have been hanging out with just us two which was new. We were drinking at my friends house the other night, both pretty intoxicated, she was getting close and touchy with me. At this point in life I'm feeling very lonely and it's been a while since I felt like this with a girl. I thought to myself fuck it and kissed her and she was into it. Ended up making out a while, and eventually just fell asleep together(nothing sexual happened). I thought it was a good night, in fact hadn't felt this not lonely in a long time. Woke up before her the next morning and left for work. Talked to her about it the next day, she said she was just drunk and to move past it and said we were fine. She doesnt even try to hold a conversation with me anymore and it just feels like the dynamics changed.

Today two of my classmates from high school had graduation parties. Even though I had wanted to go before but today I just ended up not going to either. Suddenly I just lost the feeling for being around people (even though the last thing I really want is to be alone). As soon as I got home from the doctor earlier in the day I locked my door, went in bed and slept. When I'd wake up, I just went right back to sleep. Before falling asleep the first time, I just felt really really gross in my own skin because of some past things. And I felt like maybe i was too disgusting to be around people? And i started thinking about who my ""real friends"" were, because for some reason I just don't feel ""in place"" with the people I've been around in high school. All of that culminated into me feeling repulsive and like no one cares about me.

Idk. I think I just feel really drowned out. And I guess part of me thought that if I went to the parties I'd be drowned out too? Because I would be out of place? I think I'm just really lost right now?

19,The_Lone_Musician,1561865404,3,"I've been feeling more and more lonely by the day, and the want for companionship has turned into a toxic mindset of self-deprecation. I just want to be loved, but I feel like my appearance as well as the issues I have will prevent me from being loved forever. I only ever wanted somebody to love and care for, to write and sing songs for while I play guitar or piano or something for them. Somebody I can write poems for and do whatever I can for. It also doesn't help that I'm a goddamn sissy. I'm not a man and never will be. I mean, fucking poems and music? What a load of shit. I could never be anything close to a man. I'm just a goddamn teenage sissy pretending to be a man. I don't know. 

Anyways, the loneliness has gotten worse and worse over the past few months. It's made going to sleep quite the task. It also make it hard to look at other couples, even harder than it's already been. Hell, just looking at girls fucks with my mind. I don't get it. Is it simply that I'm unlovable? Am I simply not good enough? Is it my overly sensitive nature? Is it the way I speak or walk or think or something? Is it some deep rooted issue within my mind? Of course lack of confidence takes a toll on my appeal, but I've seen people who hate themselves meet somebody that loves them, so surely it's more than that. I just don't get it. I don't get what I'm doing wrong. Perhaps I'm too antisocial from my near crippling anxiety? I just don't know. 

On top of the loneliness and lack of companionship, I keep worrying about my future. I always feel like I'll never properly adjust to adult life. That I just won't be able to do what I must to meet ends need for a good job. I want to, or need to, go into trade school. I want to go for something like welding, since it seems decently easy as far as jobs go, and I also want to work on music stuff on the side. I don't think I'd be miserable doing so, I just don't feel like I could do it. That I'd lack the means, or the will, or that it will make me too miserable or something. I don't know. I just fear that I won't ever be able to do it. 

To finish this post off, I want to mention how I also fear that I will never get fulfillment and/or happiness out of life. That this may be all that my life will have to offer. I feel like nothing will make me genuinely happy in life. It's harder to explain, so I'll stop there, but I'm sure some of you will get what I mean.

24,FafDuPlesis,1561860542,2,"Hey Redditors!

Mustering up a lot of courage to share this. Life has been very lonely over the past 6-7 years. I am an international student in the US. Grew up in a society in which people didnt really care about you and treated you like dirt unless you had a certain name for yourself or had a bunch of money. 

After having moved to the US, I made it my life`s purpose to make a name for myself, which i did, not to feel cocky but to be accepted in my society. Ambition was, has been life. Awards, scholarships, fame, everything. People back home now `respect` me but this ambition has come at a cost. In the process of making something out of myself, i never gave anybody any time here in the US. 

One of the most popular guys in the city but got no real friends. Everyone knows me, but nobody KNOWS me. People look at my public life and think I have it all when in reality, it is faaar from it. Everyone else, who has not done 5-10% of the work I have, seems to be happy and satisfied and content. All these awards and accolades seem to mean nothing. I look at my wall, full of stuff about ME. And not a single group photo or photos with other friends. 

The ones who ARE my real friends seem to be married or are in a relationship. The ones that are single have a gang on friends who always do stuff together. And all i do is work my ass off, keep hustling, hit the gym and back again. 

Life has gotten so busy that I cant turn back now. Making decent money but I HAVE to be on the grind because I have to support my parents and my sister back home, gotta have this `tunnel vision` that people speak of, but I only continue to feel lonely. VERY. It has been over 5 or 6 years now, dont even have people to talk to as i cant relate to them and they cant relate to me.

Hoping that I can make some friends on Reddit, planning on joining r/penpals and stuff. It doesnt matter if people remain anonymous, I just want some human connection, even if it is just chatting with people online. Do you have any suggestions, Reddit or otherwise?

31,redsuedeshoes23,1561854668,1,"I moved to la for college last year, and like it’s cool, but now that I’ve finished first year, moved out of the dorms, and decided to stay in an apartment, and take classes for the summer instead of going home, I’m realizing how lonely it is here. 

As a kid I was super outgoing and had a lot of friends, but when I went to high school I don’t know what happened but I just never felt comfortable around anyone anymore. All my friends made new friends, and now when we hung out I would have to be around their new friends, but I would be so uncomfortable I always felt like I was intruding and that know one wanted me around. When I was a senior I finally started to feel comfortable new people and I was able to make friends some friends, but my freshman year in college felt similar to freshman year of high school.

Sure there are a lot of people who are forced to be around me like my roomates and my teammates (I’m on the school track team), and I’m cool with all of them, but I don’t really feel that close to them. Like we all have stuff in common cus we’re all athletes and college students, but past that I feel like I don’t have anything in common with anyone. I feel like when it come to high level athletes, a lot of them are the same, so it’s like there’s a mold cut out for me that I’m supposed to fit into, but when I don’t everyone always asks why I’m doing what I’m doing, and I just want to tell them “cus I want too!!” but I usually just end up coming up with some half baked reason like “I don’t know I was bored.” 

But now it looks like I took the surface level friendships I had with my teammates for granted cus now in the summer my roommates are both a lot older than me and neither of them talk to me really, and I know that their just not very talkative, but I always feel like I annoy them somehow idk. So now all I do is go to class, go to my job where I’m the only person under 30 let alone the only teenager, then go home and study and maybe watch some anime before I go to sleep. It’s my first weekend of the summer and it’s really making me realize that I’m out here hundreds of miles from all my family and friends totally alone with no one to talk to or hang out with.

32,Idohaveaname,1561852831,2,"Video games, writing, media in general... I’ve lost some of my interest in these things. Before it was enough, but somehow now it isn’t. These things keep me company as much as my friends.

I so desperately want to just plunge myself into a hobby, something that will take my time and make my heart swell with pride at the end of the day, but I spend most of my time searching, and when I dedicate time I feel hollow and pointless about it, like I am just pretending. When I feel happy (and it does happen fairly often, usually related to my interests or just a mood), I’m met with the thought that it’s a temporary thing, or that it’s a superficial emotion. In retrospect, when I look back on how I’ve felt, it feels like there may be a lot of this kind of thing. 

I’m 21, school has been a little rough but I’m getting there. I have time until September to get a job and work in the meantime, my mother suggests I do 40 hours to get a taste of what “real life” will be like. I am afraid of working though, because I spend most of my freetime now on reddit, or youtube, just reading and listening to interesting or mindless things. I know I can do it, but I know that work will increase these tendencies even more in my decreased freetime.

No true hobbies I care about. I’ve always dreamed I can turn something I like into my career, slowly, while I go through work and school, but it feels like I don’t even like anything enough. 

Maybe working and entertaining myself with a few friends and maybe a girlfriend one day would be enough. But even if I could be content with such a life, I feel so empty about everything. I feel I lack vitality. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism before, and a new doctor told me I was either fine in the first place or cured. I felt he took something away from me in a way, because that condition gave me a physical and medical reason why I feel the way I do, but no more. I went to a therapist and he said I was fine enough and didn’t have much anxiety, which was my reason for coming in, and it may be true, but I just wanted someone to talk to about my existential thoughts, not a medication. I didn’t have the heart to say it at the time, I felt like a pretender then too.


I don’t know what this is. Maybe when I get my own house and start working full time it will become clear what I need to do. My mother wants the best for me and can tell I’m down and stagnant in my life but she doesn’t know how she can help me, so she just pushes me towards work and school. It’s probably for the best, but I am ashamed I have so little passion for my life I have resulted in the default options instead of creating something unique for myself, I am tearing up about this part, so I guess I care about being unique.

I am not sure why I am making this post. Lately my interests, which have always been there to give me reasons for living, have felt hollow. I guess I am wondering if I’m depressed.",lonely,Losing interest in my hobbies makes me feel lonely.,2019-06-30 10:00:31

As of recently I keep hitting low points, when I have no reason to do so. I have people in my life who at the moment can't make the time to talk even a little throughout the day at all.

Two of my newer friends also argued and fell out because one of them saw my friendship as a threat when we are ALL friends.

I can't help but feel as if I either don't fit in or just cause issues wherever I am, even on the internet. I also drifted away from longer term friends because they stopped replying most of the time we talked.

I know I shouldn't blame myself but it's hard not to. I just feel so useless and alone and haven't felt this kind of alone or low for a long time now.

37,zahat1,1561848145,3,I don’t make very good first impressions. I am awkward and it makes others uncomfortable. When people attempt to make conversation I don’t know how to keep the convo going and I get anxious because I don’t know what to say next. Typically any attempt at a talk ends in awkward silence. This drives people away. I started a new job a few months ago and at first my employees were nice. But I would either shut down the conversation because I would get nervous or not talk at all. Now I’ve noticed people actively avoiding me. Like avoiding eye contact and walking in a different direction when they seen me. They’re still polite but they try their best to stay out of my way. I’ve never been a really social person but i used to be good with people. When I was in high school I could always find a way to make someone laugh or put a smile on their face and I prided myself on that. But after I started college something changed. I became self conscious and anxious. And I lost my ability to make people smile. Now I spend my days pretty much day dreaming about having friends (very sad I know). I’m young (25 m) I should be going out and having fun but instead I’m pushing people away and spending my weekends at home alone.

I feel really bad for posting on here because I know that there are those of you out there that are far worse off than me. i just don't know where else to go really... im a 29 yr old male, got myself a girlfriend, job ect. I have recently come back from travelling Australia with her for a year and we are doing really well. The problem is, I have no friends left. She out tonight with her closer friends whom I havent really had the chance to get to know yet. The problem is that after a year of travelling, I have lost all of my friends to drugs. To keep a long story short, since we have been away they have all fallen heavily into drugs, were talking LSD, MDMA ect. We since have had a really big falling out due to the shock of me seeing whats happened to them all and I pretty much have no one else left. I have always struggled with self worth problems and social anxiety to quiet a high degree and I just feel lost, like I wont ever get the chance to make any friends ever again due to the way I am. I generally don't like people too much and really struggle to connect with people on a deeper level than small talk. Is there any one else out there going though similar things or what? I just feel a little lonely and I guess my girlfriend does a little bit too, but she does have a small circle of mates she can rely on.

50,Belsoe,1561830397,4,"I grew up in a pretty difficult and depriving environment and was isolated for most of my childhood, youth and young adulthood. It got somewhat better but I am still not “normal” in this regard.

Contemplating my past, I see that one reason why I kept to myself was that I was very aware how my family/me was different in a negative way. We didnt have a real home, it was messy, the adults where off etc. Later I was starting off on my own dirt poor, I had no decent clothes my teeth where bad, again I resided sub par, I had no great plans or interests so didnt fit into peer groups that would form roomates/shared housing etc.

In short at no point during those years did I have a life that I wanted to share or thought anyone else would want to be part of. I also knew this was not short term - I knew as a kid my family would never change and later I knew that in order to work through saving up, getting teeth done, getting a deposit for a proper place and all, I would need many years given my low wage job. So I had no real perspective for that better life being within reach and I would remain low on the ladder for quite some time.

It also made me avoid people who where doing great stuff, being in college or careers, being in relationships and getting what and where they wanted. I knew the same things would take me years to catch up and didnt want to feel like lagging way behind all the time seeing them. I went to a High School where most had solid double income parents and lots of opportunities and ambitious life plans, so I had suffered enough of that kind of contrast.

Sorry for venting. But I kind of understood this was a very massive factor in my isolation - I did not have a life and circumstance that I felt like worth sharing.

I recently started on medication to help with anxiety and depression and since taking it ...well... let's just say my sex drive has increased exponentially. On the surface this is a good thing but truthfully it's absolute fucking torture.

It's really confusing and it drives me crazy. I just don't know what I'm going to do.

Go out in the morning and have coffee, go out for lunch somewhere, nice go to a pub or a bar in the evening, go for a walk somewhere peaceful, if you live near a beach go for a swim. Basically my point is it's better to do stuff alone than sit indoors all day, if you never go out and do what you would like to do with friends you won't know how to when you do make friends, and you are a lot less likely to make friends or meet anyone new. It probably won't make you feel completely better but (for me at least) it helps a lot, looking forward to going to my favourite bar on Friday, taking a bus to another city, discovering new places to go to...

If someone had told me to do this a few months ago I would have believed i was too socially anxious to, but like i said if you never try new things you won't get anywhere it's worth feeling a bit anxious the first few times, after a bit you'll look back and see how much progress you've made.

Is it so wrong to want to be around people? I feel like it is, but I also think I'm wrong. It's times like this at 1.40 in the morning where I feel the most alone. I have fast beat music in the background to help me write. I usually send these late night pieces with a friend, but this I feel should remain solely on my person. I lay on the couch, as I have been nearly everyday for years. I just wish I could share it with someone. I understand that this is not the way to obtain a partner. I fear the real approaches. I am not forward at all. Most if not all of my emotion is a front. Sure, I have a sense of humour, and sure I can be sympathetic. But the bravery and strength? Fake. I am not strong. I am not brave. I feel weak all the time, and hate the little control I have over my own life. I fear circumstance and general happenings. I have no clue what my future will be, and I try to forget about it all. I understand that relationships in high school are not meant to last, but I feel like I need someone. I've slipped into an old habit of need for physical touch, touch from someone I could care for. I do not mean my family. I do not enjoy my family. I understand that they provide for me, but I also feel like a captive. I am expected to do many things with my life, and I am expected to love. Love is not a thing to be expected. That is disgusting. Love is supposed to be natural. Despite my lack of first hand love, I know what it is not. Sometimes I imagine the perfect partner I believe I could have. It is personal, something I don't think I could ever write down. Just know that she is loved, her reality be damned. Is it wrong to hold a pillow as you would a lover, in lieu of someone to hold at night at all? I hope it isn't. Many people my age feel as though sex is the penultimate goal in life, to which I deny. I feel like having someone at your side is better. I've had close encounters with both. I firmly believe in the latter choice. Never in my life have I had a more genuine feeling of happiness than when holding someone I care for in my arms. Albeit, one of those times was as a friend, and another a relationship that never was. Is it wrong to want to hold a woman? As in, to just sit under a tree or on the roof and just coexist? Is it a moral shame, to want nothing more than that? I understand that writing this down will not solve my problem. In all honesty, I would love nothing more than to have someone else approach me instead of my fruitless attempts to go about it myself. I have no tropes to exhaust when it comes to romance. My friends are just that. I know no one well enough to become more than that. Those that I do know that well are already 'taken,' as it were. That's fair. Either they expressed no interest in me that way, or I did not act. Either way, what isn't isn't. I cannot change that in a fair way. I feel like sitting here and typing is pointless. I wish I never had to do this. I wish I had someone to hold. To talk to honestly. To be around. To help. To love. To care about.


I'm sad now. I am getting slow in my words. I feel like my motivation is falling short. I know I'll be in a fit of depression, seeing as though summer is here.

91,MusicalKnight,1561773729,1,"Occasionally, people will bring up the idea that they desire a partner. One way or another everybody has considered being with somebody and how amazing it would be. In my opinion…


Im ok dying alone. Living life with no children,grandchildren, wife, husband, and pet. It's not so bad. Nobody is forcing me to have kids and certainly not demanding that I get a pet. Yes dogs, cats, fish, frogs, etc, are lovable creatures. But they're not needs. Animals can't really pay the bills, unless you show them off in social media and get some sort of youtube money. Taking care of them and paying for their daily maintenance, in a cold way feels like freeloaders.


Dying a virgin? Again, all and all, not bad. 100% chance of never getting an STD, never being cheated on, never going to divorce court, never dealing with false accusations of rape/assualt/battery, never needing to spend money for a wedding, and you never need to worry about how well you do in bed. Maybe in the future I might find a relationship but… I doubt I'll be actively looking for one. 

Emotional support? Sure that is stupendous, then again there is that chance that their SO could be abusive. Plus there are places, like this reddit to help with emotional issues and loneliness. Sometimes, its nice to take a walk, breathe, drink some water, take a nap, etc to regain a placid state of mind. Lonely life could be worse. 


The only thing that immediately comes to mind in terms of benefits is financial support. Which could be supplied with a roommate, just in case one of you lose a job. But in a relationship, you two are theoretically meant to be there for each other lowest low until your SO gets another job. Sadly hypergamy exists and I'm not too sure my wife would be happy supporting a fired man.. I know vice versa it would be ok. There might be a compelling argument for a relationship to work well money wise, if both of the partners have similar goals in mind. Unless your roommate was a permanent, single dude/girl that was perfectly ok being two peas in a pod.

94,cuteraspberries,1561772733,220,"If you are reading this right now, you may be feeling a lot of pain, like I am.  But I want you to know that no matter what you're going through, your pain doesn't define you.  You are so, so much more than your pain.  

Often when we run into run into situations that make us feel isolated, we think that our isolation is our own problem.  *I'm the reason my friends rejected me.*  *I deserve to feel like shit when I made that mistake.  My parents and in-laws are valid to hurt me.* 

But you have to uncover deep-down--no matter whether you're 17 and are still trying to figure out who you are or whether you're 70 and have scars from who you used to be-- no one deserves to hurt you, **especially yourself**.  You do not deserve to hurt you.  I love you more than you can imagine, and there are other people who love you more than you can imagine.  You are smart.  You are loved.  You are beautiful.  You are not your pain.  

**Embrace self-forgiveness.**  Even if you feel that you are failing as a parent or you feel that no one deserves to like you because of things you have done, you still deserve forgiveness.  Forgiving yourself is the first step to healing and becoming an even better human being.  

I've been a bit lonely recently.  I've been thinking about how there is no one in my life who I like that loves me back.  My mother loves me, but I don't like her because of how much pain she makes me feel.  I like my friends, but not one of them makes our friendship a priority-- our friendship is only secondary to other friendships.  I don't blame them.  But as I've been reflecting, I've realized that while I've been living in a world where it is believed that success comes only from hard work, I've come to think that my constant venting about my pain and my accidentally offensive behavior is NOT what is to blame for my short-lived friendships and angry parents.  While those reasons may be true to an extent--it's doesn't even come close to being the biggest reason.  Sometimes, people just give other people more shit than they deserve.  Can you think of a time where you gave someone more shit than they deserved?  Sometimes, you're a new kid at school or you're a new employee and everyone else has already made lasting friendships.    

So if you are lonely: **it's not you.**  And I want this post to be the one post you go to when you're feeling alone.  Because you aren't to blame.  You are sexy.  You are energetic.  You are lovable.  You are beautiful.  You are smart.  You are kind.  I dare you to say it out loud to the sky for me (yes! you can do it!) Say it out loud with me:  I am sexy.  I am energetic.  I am lovable.  I am beautiful.  I am smart.  I am kind.

101,justOneOfTheBoys23,1561765849,1,"So, heres a bit of a backstory.

I am 23M, and live in New Mexico. I have been battling anxiety and depression issues for almost my whole life. My grandfather died in 1999 very tragically, and it tore my Mom apart. She began drinking and smoking and becoming a nasty person. She took it out on me and my brother for most of our lives, and our father kinda let it happen, claiming she was just “venting”. 

Growing up in this, I became very anti-social, awkward, and paranoid of the people around me. Every friend I had growing up took advantage of the kindness I would try to give and would hurt me in some way, whether that be stealing or bullying. 

The cycle has repeated since then and even till now, post college. The only friend I have had for a while is so wrapped up in his life that I never see him, and when I do he doesn’t want to do anything, and doesn’t like drinking. Other friends are always busy and seem to change plans last second to exclude me. Its always “This day works better for everyone” or “I forgot about this thing I have to do”. 

I was in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist for 4 years and made great improvements to my confidence and general outlook in life, and have seen my mom become better in recent years and have gotten much closer to her. I am a fan of drinking and smoking weed but also know to stop at certain points and refuse to do any of it if I am emotional.

Now to today:

I recently moved out on my own and have been getting an overwhelming sense of loneliness. No one at my work seems to see me as more then a co-worker, no one from my college classes seem to hit me up, and I just don’t know where to go from here. I am on dating apps trying to meet people, I go to the gym, I hit up local stores a-lot, and really try to meet people, but nothing has come from it. 

Am I wrong for wanting someone to hit me up and ask ME to do something, rather then always being the one to initiate something? Am I an asshole and don’t realize it? Do I push people away and not realize it? I really wish I knew and could change it.",lonely,Feeling kinda lost (Kinda long rant),2019-06-29 09:50:49
102,TalkToTransformerMan,1561765677,1,"Hey everyone. New Redditor and new to this subreddit, but I felt it might help me just reach out to people.

Little about me: I’m a recent college-grad and soon-to-be grad student, but I’m still waiting a few months to go to grad school. I took a year off before applying to grad school, and am back at home with my parents.

Why I’m lonely: I’m lonely because I have not been able to find a job. I studied English and Theatre, but as a humanities kid in a tech-heavy town, I just didn’t want to work my hundredth job in Sales or HR. I want to teach, I want to make art, but those gigs don’t work in the summertime and/or don’t pay. My high-school friends are all in grad school on the West Coast (I’m on the East Coast), and avoid texting whenever possible. My college-friends all have jobs, and are the same way about communicating. My girlfriend of five years (we love each other very much) is a Park Ranger who is (unfortunately) stationed in Oregon for the next five months, and without a good cell signal to communicate. Finally, my younger sister is still in college, and works on-campus over the summer so we can’t hang-out.

I don’t have anybody to commiserate with, my therapist even said (because I JUST started therapy to deal with anxiety and depression) that I am—and I quote—“a very, VERY lonely man.”

I can’t find work that will pay and be willing to train me before grad school. But my parents come home and resent me everyday for sitting about and being sad. I stopped going-out with friends, and I only play video games to make the sun go down so I can go to sleep again.

I know this is only temporary, but it hurts like hell sometimes. Does anybody have any advice on things that will help?

&amp;#x200B;

Some more background information, for who is interested?

TL:DR in the end

&amp;#x200B;

I would say this is the first time I'm really without a partner by my side. I'd say I've had two relationships: one starting when I was 17 and ending when I was 22, closely followed by my recent relationship that lasted just over a year.  In what little space there was between, I did have myself a bit of a slut phase, so I can't consider myself very 'single' for that period. 

Before I got into my first relationship, I lived with my parents still. I have since moved to another city in order to study veterinary medicine.  Being a good student and enjoying the company of my partner have been the two focal points of my day to day life during the past six years at uni.  With both partners I have planned on, but never actually went through with, living together. It's been me in my own student accomodation thing on campus, and them close by so we got to spend most of our free time together. 

Now I have so much time on my hands all of the sudden. I greatly miss having someone to come home to. Someone to vent about your tough day to,  someone to cook a meal for, someone to cuddle. All the good stuff. I miss someone to love, what a surprise.

The most daunting thing right now is my graduation. What am I going to do after that? Most likely find myself a job, I'm going to need to generate some income. Very likely this new job will have me move from my city, as it is very hard to find a job as a vet right here, and chances are much better an hour away.  I have to move out of my house anyways, as only students can live on the campus.

I very much dislike the idea of living in some apartment by myself. Dragging myself out of bed every morning to go spend the day at a job I fear I might hate, only to come home by myself and try to work up the motivation to make some actual food. Then ??? for the rest of the night so I can go to sleep and repeat this the next day. I know I'm making this to be the most negative it can be, but this scenario seems very very realistic to me. 

An additional thing I'm worrying about is how to ever cross paths with a new partner. For now, I'm good and I very much need some time by myself. In the longer run though, I'm really not excited to live life by myself. Perhaps a little too focused about this? Eh. Here in the student city I now live in, I'm practically surrounded by attractive men who are around the same age, intelligence and life phase. When I move into the periphery I'm not going to be running into them as I am now. I'm a very shy and introverted person, and I tend to stay away from hobbies and activities that have me interact with new people a lot. (also I just tend to not interact with these attractive people I see around).

I'm very fortunate to have few, but very very good friends. They would be a reason for me to stay in my city a bit longer, were it now for them also going to graduate and move themselves in the near future. This general uprooting of basically my whole life is very, very scary.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Let's get to the point finally. I'm very likely going to be living a new life all by myself, where I envisioned to take these steps (house and job) together with a partner. Additionally I'm fearing some long-term loneliness as the friends around me are moving away too, and I expect my chances of running into a new mate get a lot smaller when I start work. I don't connect easily and have some social anxiety going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think there must be a lot of other people that have been in a similar situation. Did you move to a new house and start a job? How did it feel? Did you manage to get comfortable? Were you able to get into a good rhythm? Did you meet new friends in your new situation? How are you feeling now?

We would talk for hours after work and office. She joined along with few other guys who turned out to be friends (I reckon). I always had reservations when she would go outside with someone else. (I may be wrong) Anyway, as I explained in part 1 that she is/was engaged as she told me. She was with me but at the same time but she was giving her ex, a chance to return. We would discuss her ex and his behavior (I never liked it). The story will get interesting and twisting as we move along.

One of her coworker tried her, he was looking for his chances but she just thrashed him ""I can do anything for him (me)"" her qouted words. That was the end of the one who tried to derail our relationship. The real reason which lasted for long was her ex, she was emotionally with me but just trying to fulfill her promises she made with her ex. (She always said that she loves her ex.) 

I would insist her to say the three words YOU LOVE ME but her responses would be ""I don't, maybe, yes,"" a few more words ""you are the perfect man I imagine to be my life partner"" and a few more ""You were my crush the day I saw you and I would discuss you with my female colleagues"" 

During the time I managed most of the stuff she needed, from electric plate to dish washer. But her mood swings, I remember she shouted on me, not once, not twice but almost every time and it became a routine. 

We had a great time together, those 16 weeks passed by, in a blink. It was fun, we attended concerts, we walked in moon light, I counted stars with her. 

During the period she almost took over, she was the lady and would decide for me when to speak and what to speak :), when and which suit I should wear; all of these were in her hands and I followed her instructions. She was caring and loving and she proved her all the times. She guided me in many ways, this could include the aforementioned stuff. 

Like the romantic saga of the 90s, we picked up the same telecom company. ( to save money and talked for hours)

I have an incredibly hard time finding close friends. There are so many people here and everyone sticks to their high school friends. I don't have close friends that I can just call up and ask if they want to hang out. No one asks me either. I just have people that I occasionally talk to through text. I spend almost every day alone. Meanwhile, the social environment is much more open where he is. I think within his first 2 weeks he already had an established close group of friends he talked to and hung out with all the time.

Not only do I hate the feeling of being alone (I constantly try and ask people to hang out with me but I rarely get a yes from anyone), but also the fact that sometimes I still miss him and remember he couldn't be happier with all his new friends regardless of my presence.

131,jfreeman1506,1561727342,4,"Not sure if this is really the right forum to post this on but I needed to post somewhere. I've never been good at making friends and I only really have one or two people I would still say are good friends all of which are left over school friends. By the end of school I'd say that I had four but two of them never respond to my texts anymore so I never meet them. By the way one of them goes to the same University as me so its ridiculous that he doesn't seem to want to just meet and chat for an hour. The third I still consider a friend but he's just a very busy person and its rare that he's free to meet. 

The fourth friend of mine is probably who I consider my best friend as I'm actually able to meet up with him at least once a month. But I've noticed recently that almost everytime we meet up its because I text him. Its the same with any of my friends and with a few exceptions its more or less always been this way. Apart from big events and birthdays I was almost always the one arranging things. In the last two years I can't think of a single time where I've just been invited out by someone except for a class reunion and some gig my friend was playing at one time. Basically we never meet unless either I text them or my friend has some big thing going on.

I'm fairly certain if I never texted my old school friends they would never contact me and we'd be lucky to meet up once a year. It just got me wondering whether or not they actually still want to meet with me. They don't seem very interested and what got me thinking about this was what happened today. 

I had arranged to go bowling with that one friend I still meet a lot and he said yesterday that he was free and we agreed on a time to meet. I had something important to do that day but decided not to do it in order to keep time free so I could meet with my friend since its really only a monthly thing. The next morning I texted him first thing to make sure it was still on. Several hours passed and he still hadn't replied. I eventually assumed he'd just meet me down there since he said he would so I headed down there. Checked the place where he worked. Called him four times. Waited an extra twenty minutes then went home. I don't have a problem if he couldn't come but I at least think he should've had the decency to cancel. If he had done that I could've done what I was supposed to and have a productive day but instead I left the day free for him and now I'm just sat around at home.

I guess what I'm getting at is that I feel like I'm putting all my effort into these friendships while my friends don't really seem to care. I get that its been a few years since the end of school and most people have moved on and have made new friends. But I don't see why that should have an affect on past relationships. Especially when we don't live too far from each other. I tend to drop anything that isn't really important to meet up with my friends but it doesn't feel like they would do the same for me.

Since I left school I've tried to move on from them and make new friends. As someone on the autistic spectrum that's not very easy for me to do. My old school is probably the only place that I ever considered myself popular. I've made a grand total of one friend since I left and he lives like seventy miles away so do the math. At Uni I do have a social life in that I'm part of a few societies and have fun with the people there but there's nobody I've connected with on an individual level. So naturally I'm left trying to connect with my old friends during the holidays. The holidays are a lonely time for me when I'm basically just sat at home completely alone with nothing to do. But of course it doesn't feel like they care enough to put in the effort. Even when they do meet up it partially feels like they're just doing it out of some obligation as opposed to them just wanting to be there.

Am I overreacting here. Sorry if the post is a bit long I tend to ramble on a bit and I felt the need to rant a bit.",lonely,I am always the one who arranges meet ups. Do my friends actually want to hang out?,2019-06-28 23:09:02

Sorry if that doesn't make sense. So I guess my two questions are; 

&amp;#x200B;

  1)Once this person I really cared for told me ""You were in the back of my mind these weeks"" since we stopped talking, of course the message had more and I didn't ask them  to say that or anything. I just went ghost because I was going through some challenges.. They went on how  they wanted to text and all but didn't wish to bother me once I texted back and felt silly about thinking like that toward texting me.. And recently this reappeared for me in thought(the you're in the back of my mind-thing)  I looked up the meaning  and it basically said ""unimportant or too little effort to care about"" is this me being too literal and maybe they meant as ""I was thinking about you here and there"" Of course I can ask and  will but  

part 2) of this is: recently..I tried to delete myself from the program called ""Life"" I feel like I am full of errors.. and maybe all this is life's  way of removing a problem by showing me I don't belong. They reached out awhile back and asked if I was okay because..I ghosted again--because once more I just felt like this stain..And seeing them do this confused me. I feel I had a chance to speak how I felt but didn't know how? So I told them thank you for a lot and how I saw them as this character to my person (I sometimes compare tv show characters to express my emotion toward people. Like ""you're my Watson to my Sherlock "" for example) then I  deleted the way we mostly talked and most of all didn't give them a chance to reply. I feel like being real with them because its stupid I ghosted but I want to explain myself..I just don't know how? Maybe its too late and they're better off?

But this month has completely destroyed everything I had left in me. I had my birthday this month. Invited 5 people. 1 came. Ended up just inviting her to come to dinner with my family. Where my mum did her best to embarrass me, and my friend spent more time talking to my family than to me. I thought, at least at the end of the month I'm going to see my best friend, who lives a 4 hour drive away. I packed, was stopping at my parents' house overnight and picking up an air mattress from them so I could stay at his. 

I woke up this morning and text him for the address so I could get driving over to see him. He replied ""don't bother"". And I know it's my fault, because when I was down the other day, I sent him this huge text venting about how I was feeling. So it's my fault. 

I've deleted FB and messenger, because I can't bear to see all those happy people, the ones people actually care about. I had been trying to lose weight, but why should I? I'm fat, ugly, and clearly unlikeable, so why should it matter? And on the point of health, do I really want to live a longer life if it's just more of this?

I can't even keep a friend, so no way will I ever have a partner. My life just keeps circling the drain. Debt, failure, ugliness, obesity, and generally being a disposable human. Maybe I should just finish the job and dispose of myself. 

I'm so fucking done. The only reason I haven't tried yet is that I don't want my family to find my body or be stuck with my debt. I can't face it any more. My life is a wreck, and no one cares.

All I really wanted for my birthday was a ""happy birthday"" message from someone, anyone, but I never got one. I've been homeschooled a majority of my life and never had any friends, besides two people I talked to at a summer camp for about a year or two. When it was their birthday, I did my hardest to show my appreciation for them and spoil them as much as I could afford to. I gifted them with so many things and always tried to be there for them in times of need in an effort to make them realize how much they meant to me. I genuinely cared for them and I wanted them to know how thankful I was for them to be in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

But whenever my birthday came around, neither of them remembered. They just couldn't seem to bother. Besides not remembering my birthday, they never invited me to hang out with them once or even talked to me that much throughout all the time I knew them.

155,hamartiated,1561685478,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

It feels so uncomfortable to hear those things that it makes you want to say, “Well I wanted you around before (or I was indifferent), but now I don’t want you around because it feels awkward.”

I almost caught myself saying something similar today when I was reaching out for a favor. I almost said, “If you feel this is inappropriate, it’s totally cool,” but I stopped myself.

The only reason to preemptively reject yourself on someone else’s behalf is because you’re afraid they’ll be mad that you reached out, as if you committed some great offense. It’s like you’re apologizing in advance. But that’s actually kind of rude to the other person because it’s assuming they’re going to act like a conceited jerk. They can feel that fear. Then they’ll also feel a subtle sense of guilt to say yes to you, which feels terrible.

It’s just not a nice thing to do, and it also makes it more likely that you will be rejected.

We meshed so unbelievably well, we communicated and supported each other. It was by far one of the easiest relationships I had ever had. But then after 2 years together, he decided to go back to school. And because of how his brain works, he believed he couldn’t be in a relationship, he wouldn’t be able to provide or give enough attention. Even though I am an extremely independent person and provide for myself and work insane enough hours that I don’t require much attention. I tried to be understanding, he still wanted me in his life, wanted to be friends until life was less hectic and we could pick back up where we left off. Somewhere along the way, things changed. His words and his actions didn’t mesh, it started to feel like he was manipulating me and the situation, keeping me in his back pocket. 

After a year, I told him he needed to give me a decision. He had made new friends in school, a lot of them girls, changed his social habits completely and then it came, ‘you’re amazing, you make me so happy, but I only want to be friends’. Ouch. 

I made the decision that I couldn’t be ‘just friends’ with him. My heart is devastated, and I feel a pain and loneliness I haven’t felt in ages.

Friendbox

Friendbox is a place in the 4th dimension where you can meet people in real life and make friends. We will also make some form of app as well to spread the word.

Friendbox is for platonic friendships. No sex or hookups.

I'm down to build a friend app called friendbox where people can find friends and hang out and make their lives better. If I can make just one true friend it's all worth it. Good friends are priceless. I have several, and I could always use more. I appreciate my friends.


Soulmate

Soulmate is a place in the 4th dimension where you can meet people in real life, make friends, and find your soulmate. We will also make some form of app as well to spread the word. Soulmate is for finding your soulmate. It is created for you to get married. It's not for sex or hookups.

I love gentiles, but I can only marry someone Jewish. I love my awesome family and I'm not getting into problems with them over marrying outside the faith. It is what it is.

Everything in that song is true. The same way there's separation between Church and State, there's also separation between Religion and God. Gentiles are gentle, so I'm kind of pissed I can't marry one!

Anyhow, it is what it is. For better or worse. Right?

I'm usually quiet and introverted but a rather pleasant person. Seems like can't make friends as easily as other people though. A doctor evaluated me and apparently saw social communication disorder or some kind of austim (apparently maybe Asperger's) but I can't tell if it's like a proper diagnosis.

I have a few friends but they're all distant in one way or another. Having few friends isn't bad or anything but I'm not anyone's priority and it seems like no one cares about me most of the time. 

I just want a best guy friend (I'm a guy as well), someone like an older brother (I'm also an only child). Someone true who cares and thinks of me. Someone open minded and I can talk to freely. Someone I can pour my heart out to. Someone Of course, if I had someone like this I'll return the favor with no problem.

We rarely see each or talk to each other for more than a minute a day. I still try to talk with them today, but there is no point in trying to hide the obvious fact that my parents just aren't concerned with the problems or events in my life. Therefore, I try to seek connections with people outside of my family.

Some days I wake up and try to convince myself I don't feel lonely. I can bring people together to create lively times, have people who would consider me as their friend, and genuinely care about the people I spend time with. I think to myself that being surrounded by people won't make me lonely. Yet, every friendly encounter leaves me feeling empty, I stop dreaming and realize that there is no point in faking being happy.

One question that I can never answer is if there anyone who genuinely cares about me? After years of meeting people and tricking myself into thinking I was their close friend, it seems not one person truly cares about me in the same way I care about them. I can't remember when the last time someone has asked me how I am feeling. When I am walking, I can't help but notice when people are smiling and talking with their friends. This is going to sound very bad, but please listen. When I see people lollygagging and having a good time, it just reminds me how superficial a lot of people can be. Their smiles are unconvincing, and this just all reminds me how no one cares about anyone. I just wish there was someone in this world who is interested in talking with me, cares that I am not feeling well, and most importantly, someone I can look to and their gaze will convince me that they genuinely care.

A year ago, I tried opening up to my dad about my loneliness. That turned out to be a mistake. Instead of helping, he highlighted just how lonely I was and said it was my fault. He said verbatim, ""You are the most cynical person I know. Jeez, it's no wonder why your girlfriend left you.""l Even though I know I'm not a cynical person, and others know I'm not either, hearing my dad say that reaffirmed all of my insecurities. The demands and responsibilities of college and jobs offers offers temporary distraction from loneliness, but it has gotten so bad that the quality of my work is starting to be affected. Now that it is summer, I am left with my festering thoughts, and I can't take it anymore. 

Side note: I am looking for any advice, and I really do appreciate whatever feedback you give. I just want to let you know that I have been in and out of therapy for the past 3 years dating back to high school. The advice they gave was not helpful.

I’ve met some truly kind people, but it’s not the same as a inrl friends/relationships. But sometimes I think because I spent so much time with virtual friends I’ve stunned my real life social skills. So because of my lack of real life social skills I would continue trying to make virtual friends. 

But because of my desperation for understanding I’ve been deeply hurt and used by “virtual friends.” But I know real friends do that too. 

Because of these negative feelings I cut off all of my virtual friends and tried to focus on inrl people. But I feel so painfully lonely. Maybe I should try making more virtual friends? What if I can only connect with people virtually? It almost feels like that at this point.

I’m really into children’s cartoons and sad music, however I’ve hardly met anyone who wants to do these sorts of things with me. I don’t like movies, video games, drinking, drugs or any of the other things that seem like they could lead to fruitful social interaction.

I know it sounds kind of trivial, who cares if people listen to different music or whatever but when everyone wants to talk about gossip, movies, tv shows I’ve tried and failed to find interesting, or go out drinking and talking about these things I don’t see how I could maintain a friendship. It seems a lot of people I talk to are into anime, I’ve tried and I just can’t find anime interesting. I don’t find the school girl stuff to be all that cute and I don’t find any of the jokes funny.

203,hamartiated,1561598983,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

210,realtalk1233,1561582752,5,"Lets break this down.

I'm 26 years old and in a place in my life with a TON of free time even though I'm trying to keep myself as busy as possible.

Lets list all my horrific problems shall we?

1) I'm religious (Which isn't a ""problem"" per say). I truly believe it but have a difficult time living it out. I live far away from the closest group to me that shares my faith and I have to travel quite a bit to get there. I overall feel like I complete failure in this part of my life which is ironic cause even the people who know my faults who are part of my faith group do not judge me or make me to feel bad. I'm much harder on myself than basically anyone Ive ever met.

2)I have all kinds of emotional issues. I'm hypersensitive though I typically do an ok job hiding it. I'm insecure, I think no one wants to be around me. Which is obviously not true cause its very common for me to hangout with friends 5+ times a week. If they didn't like me they wouldn't keep inviting me back. I'm a funny guy, i get people to laugh more than I use to (finally developed a sense of humor). But once I get back home its just all gone. All I'm left with is this empty feeling.

3) I want to have a close intimate relationship with a woman. Ive only ever had one girlfriend and it was a long distance relationship (We meet initially online, spent several years as friends, but then decided to be a couple and met in person). So I never really had a lot of physical contact. Its not even about sex for me, its the desire to feel known and loved, to have physical (and emotional) affection. Last time I got a hug was around 6 months ago.

4)I'm an addict. I have an addiction to what I'm going to call ""Lust"", but in a nutshell. When I feel tired and lonely I seek out porn and cybersex to make myself feel better. I just want to feel a connection with someone and so I seek it out. Its become compulsive and destroying my life to be honest. I'll stay up until 4am some nights trying to find someone only to collapse asleep when I can't and then try again the next day. Eventually I'll get through my binging, and try to stop the behavior but then its not to long till I'm back again. I hate myself even while I'm seeking it out. I just don't know how to stop because its the ONLY connection I really feel to other people. I feel like a woman is never going to want me (which objectively is false, thats an issue i'm working through in therapy). At least if I'm voice chatting with a woman online I feel something with someone. At least thats what i tell myself. I'm currently in a 12 step group for it.

5) I'm in a 12 step group, its an over an hour away from where I live, which is exhausting (living in the middle of nowhere sucks especially when you can't move for a few more years). I struggle to call my sponsor , i struggle to call other people and talk about my feelings and emotions. My whole life I was always told that my feelings were wrong, and truth be told many of them (Like the insecurities) ARE wrong. But constantly being told that and living with someone deeply manipulative fucked me up really good. The internet with it anonymity is the only place i feel safe to express myself in any way.

6) I'll never find what I want online. I straight up won't. What do I want? well thats easy. I want to find a woman around my age I can talk to with COMPLETE transparency (while still retaining anonymity). Someone I can explore the sexual stuff with who won't try to make me feel guilty but also won't try to keep me from feeling guilty either. Someone I can talk to and share stuff with right out of the gate without the bullshit and the games. Who has clear boundaries and clearly respects my boundaries. Someone who I can just be, completely emotionally naked with, as well as talk about sexual stuff casually with where she is just as comfortable talking to me about emotions as she is talking to me about a porn video I enjoyed.

I just want a friend that I can talk to and maybe even become best friends with. I would be so grateful and feel so blessed for that bond truly. 
A little about myself is that I have a boyfriend, I love music (any genre really), video games are super fun, I love talking like so darn much lol (Venting, talking, laughing, being a shoulder to cry on, having super deep conversations that make you think etc), I love animals, and reading, and makeup/fashion is my thing as well :) 
Maybe one of u might be feeling just as alone as I feel (friendship wise) and maybe would like a best friend too if so definitely message me and we can talk about whatever we feel like (literally can be anything 🙂).

• This post might be a weird illogical ramble but I just need to vent.
• Im adding those points because Iam on mobile and I kinda want to seperate different paragraphs in a way so its easier to read for you all.
\

• Im so tired of being alone, but also so scared to go out of my comfort zone because I’ve burnt myself like that last time (wont get into details about it, but people //NOT ALL// I talked to back then sucked...).

I suck too (actually Iam terrible) not gonna lie. Im ok not having friends, I can entertain myself and make myself busy, sometimes If a friend (what I call a good person that sticks with me) is not compatible (has different tastes in stuff, hobbies etc. etc.) with me I end up ghosting them and, well, its a real shitty thing to do for someone, I know.

Now talking about relationships. Oh boy It was hard to find someone and even if i found someone interested in me in that way It didnt work out... mostly people interested in me were kinda using me really. But I guess I deserved it. 

The problem is that I really crave love and affection. I dont care about sexual stuff but I’d love to wake up to that special one next to me, get cuddles and kisses. Thats all I need. One person that I can call mine, but Im not sure where to find it. Now, Iam a lesbian, homeschooled and pretty antisocial at this point. The only social thing I do is go to the gym and ofc I did develop crushes on girls there, but I “dont want to” talk to them because 1. Iam the only one there who looks gay; 2. They would think iam creepy because they are probably straight: 3. Im scared to bother them.

239,Human_Kaleidoscope_7,1561526227,2,"I went and visited friends today. This has been the  first time in months since I have been around someone who wasn't immediate family. Let's backtrack. 


My parents are really strict. They complain that I don't spend time with them if I spend any more than 1/4 of a day in my room. Any day. Even outside of my room, nobody talks. Mom watches Netflix on her phone. Dad watches YouTube, that is when he is here. My sister watches YouTube and scrolls through Facebook. We don't really talk, except for the repetitive small talk that makes us feel like we are a family. 


Simple solution: talk to them, they are understanding, right? Wrong. My parents are self-destructive and will get super defensive against anything that is not in the norm. My sister is 23, and I am 19, and we are yet to be treated like adults. Having recently graduated college, my sister is looking for jobs and trying to get out of the house (too bad she's bad with money). I'm about to leave to my second year of college in August. August... It feels like years ahead. We are poor, and we never hear anything else other than ""we can't afford"" and I understand. 


Doesn't sound bad, but all of my high school friends cut ties and my college friends are all busy and live a ways away. My parents don't let me do anything. They barely let me distract myself with video games long enough to try and not realize that my situation is bad. I feel trapped. Locked in a cell. 


Today I went to visit my college friend, Chris, who has had a birthday. I spent the morning and afternoon making muffins (baking relieves stress for me) and the rest of the afternoon and evening with him and his family. We barbecued and played sports at a lake a few miles away. I told them a little bit of how bad it was at home (I am sparing details for conscious sake). They told me that they were always ok with my company, and to be honest, after 2 months with no company, I almost cried. The way back home made me cry and I felt a wave of depression hit just seeing the house. I entered made my peace quickly, and headed to bed. 


I've been crying ever since. I'm upset that Im lonely. Upset that I live in the middle of nowhere. Upset that I don't have friends. Upset that I don't have and have never had a girlfriend.

So through the years i had few friends and was generally not messed with, i had crushes but some i abandoned knowing time would rob them from me and after that i gave up on dating as well, here i am graduated from school with no emotion on my face as i learned emotions are quite meaningless, with no friends i don't go out or have fun, with no crushes i don't feel anymore and my love is all for my family.  But time has passed where im now tired, tired of being this way, while being single gives you time to do the things you want and study, but you can't have dinner with yourself, you can't feel the warmth of another, and it's that feeling that drives me to escape this and open up, I'm scared of being alone and it's fear that drives me, please please take heed of what ive said and go and live life.",lonely,Rant,2019-06-26 14:56:01

So today at orientation I tried to open myself up, I made small talk with a lot of people but I feel like I got no where. I hid in my car for an hour. 

Maybe I set my expectations too high. It's not like I would make close friends with someone through a single day at orientation... 

I'm just so scared of being lonely again. And yes I plan on joining clubs and going out of my comfort zone, I've already been pushing myself a lot to talk to different people.

I have depression and the whole slew of lack of self confidence, appearance and fashion, hobbies, never having had a relationship, and the need for external validation (because I can't validate myself) has left me broken and jaded.

Most advice I've listened to say I won't find love if I keep looking for it. Instead I should focus on myself, having hobbies and improving myself in all relevant aspects. Then perhaps I will find someone who has the same interests and can appreciate me. It'll come when I'm not looking for it. 

Even outside of romance, having more quality friendships comes from self improvement and more effort at socializing.

But isn't it ironic? People say I shouldn't change myself for others, but I still have to change to be liked by others? I have to improve to be more worthy? I want to be validated and have self worth, but that won't happen until I'm a better person. And the end goal of self improvement is so others will approve of me?

I dont really know how to format this so i will try my best.
Ah here i am rambling again. Lets get started
So i am [REDACTED] and my age is [REDACTED] (i dont like sharing stuff like that) and im autistic. I also have anger problems. Before the devil was born i had a pretty good life. I was happy carefree and cared about. Three years after my birth THEY where born. The devil themself. Lets call them E. They are a SQUEAKY ANNOYING BRAT! They cry and yell when they dont get what they want. And it seems my parents care about E more than me! When E does something wrong, i get blamed, when i want to do something and E does not, i cant do the thing, but when i dont want the thing and E does, the thing happens when i dont want it! YOU DIDNT WANT IT EARLIER E! WHY DO YOU WANT IT NOW? TO MAKE ME SUFFER?!?! Thats the only purpose you hold E. And worse, they have an equally as snotty friend. Lets call them V, well E NEVER KEEPS QUIET! After many times and turning up the volume on my headphones while listening to Blooming Villain from P5, (E and V are the villains of this world) i STILL HEAR THEM! They never, ever, quiet down. And E watches morgz! I dont want to hear a morg at all! And in school, (before we move on im an introvert so that may be the source of the next problem), i barely have any friends, and the friend i do have wanted to kill themself once! (Didnt have the will to, he is alright. For future reference lets call him D). I moved classes in that time. Before i moved classes, i was bullied, an outcast. My only friend was him, lets name him X. (He isnt a bad guy he is a friend) X was nice though we didnt interact much. So again, alone. I also had this crush. (Lets name her H) one day i confessed and we became friends, nothing else. (im good with that, at least it is something, they where also out of my league so i expected that), and when this new person got added to the class (lets name them C, man im running out of letters!). And H became friends with C and next, i hate this. They became rude. Ruse, and just rude. Another bully added to the list of bullys, lets call them M, and HN. HN and M are AWFUL people, i met HN in second grade and M in fourth. In the grade we where in way back when, they bullied me hard, when i got home i was stressed sad and tired. It went on for a few months in that grade. And then i moved classes with, lets name him X2 (X and X2 had the same names in real life).  X2 was rude, he was in my class when i moved classes in 4th grade (HN was in my fourth grade class and X2 was in my 2nd 4th grade class). I didnt run into X2 much though. But my new class had another new bully. Lets name them P, P was RUDE! They said they raised an autistic child or two. But the way she treated me told me she didnt know how to parent. In the grade i was in we had two teachers. I had P and, the other we will call N. (How many letters of the alphabet have i used for names so far?) N was good, so we will talk about P. P was RUDE, they yelled for no reasson, (they said they didnt but your reading this right? P is a liar) they got mad for no reasson (mainly at Me and D, and yes D was in the same class), i got the benefit of breaks when i needed them (only learned how to utilize them to their full potential in the last few weeks, aka when i got super mad and sad.) This one time in a break some people from my class where walking back to class and asked if i waa ok? Surprising to me. I still dont know if they faked compassion or where genuine. I also had a crush in this class. (One of the people walking by, lets name them J) my crush on J began in december (the month i switched classes, because HN fyi). The break event happened in about march. Once i told J i wanted to meet with them in break time or whatever. I was hoping they would remember. But I am insignificant enough for that thought to never be remembered. I was dreaming of all the outcomes and what i would say for weeks. Dreams. CRUSHED! (pun intended). I still dreamt of outcomes after the summer (even though i was going to a private school). My one chance was wasted... oh........
Now a story from 4th grade: So at lunch one time, me and some other people (including M and HN) where sitting at the table, i went to go get something (lets just say water its been a few years) and they put this weird, goop, sloppy joe thing on my plate. I got pretty mad and tried to give it back to them. M and HN denied they did it (the others supported them). I soon yelled (imagine this as a sentence somebody could hear from the USA to Australia) 'WHY DID YOU PUT IT ON MY PLATE, I DIDNT GET THIS, IT IS YOUR SO TAKE IT BACK!' they where scared as heck and took it b-*laughs hystaricly* NOPE! You think a fat kid with an anger problem would make them scared? HM: 'No, you got it!' M: 'Yeah it was on your plate before'. I was pretty pissed and eventually told on them (like the tattler i am). They won the and they told me to 'dEaL wItH iT!'. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER THIS IS ON MY PLATE LUNCH PERSON!?!?! I am glad they got minimum wage for that job.
Right now E and V are calling and its making me ballistic. I asked them to quiet down and they said 'wE aRe In tHe SaMe RoOm Luigi_Maxwell!'. How do i tell them to stop?
So this is all i have to say...

291,BackIn2001,1561473714,5,"Hi there people, sorry if it's a long post but I kinda need to vent and could really use some of your advice. Sorry if it looks weird, I'm on mobile. Thanks in advance :)

I'm a 17yo guy, introverted, I genuinly like to stay indoors reading, watching shows, playing video games, etc.. Being introverted, it's no surprise that I have very few friends. Still, I'm that kind of introverted who still loves to go out to travel, visit new places, take pictures, bike riding, go to the movies, etc, but I only really enjoy it if I'm next to someone I can trust. I love to do it with my parents and family, and I also have this one friend who goes to the movies with me and we're currently planning to watch Toy Story 4 (for nostalgia purposes). The summer vacations already started so we can do this stuff. Still, that one friend does nothing else with me. He's also an introvert, but contrary of me, he doesn't leave his home for nothing at all. When he wants to go out with me, we go there, watch the movie and then he wants to leave right away. And he's kinda awkward just because he's in there, in public. Then I have other ""friends"" who are more extroverted, I already asked them out but they either didn't respond, or said that they were available but didn't touch the subject again, like ignoring it even when I ask where they want to go.

See where I'm getting? I have friends, I guess. But none of them has deep conversations and/or friendship with me. That one cinema guy only talks about super heroes and football, may it be online or in real life. We only talk about anything else if I give the subject, and even then he starts to answer very vaguely, clearly stating that he's not enjoying the conversation. The more extroverted guys only really talk about memes, and even when I want to start a more deep conversation they completely ignore my intention and start to make humour out of it. I don't know if this will sound silly, but can it be because I'm older than them? I'm 17, almost 18 really, and most of my ""friends"" are 15, kinda turning 16. (I failed a school year so I got kinda late). I'm interested in cars, and getting my licence already and they still find that boring. (In my country we can only get licence at 18). Don't get me wrong, I also like that stuff (Memes, Movies). But when it's constantly the same conversations, about the same stuff, over and over again, it gets boring and tiresome.

I need someone in my life that I can completely trust. I need someone to have a deep connection with. I need someone mature.

But how can I find those people? I'm nice to everyone that I meet. Still, most people do not fit my personallity and don't like me and just use me to copy during exams and stuff. Do I need to change something next year?

I know that calling in because I'm depressed probably won't help me and isn't the right thing to do, but I'm pretty sure I'll crash my car asleep at the wheel if I don't, I almost did yesterday.. 

I saw extendedfamily this past weekend.. part of it was good, part of it was really hard and I have some rough things that are keep cycling in my head. 

One member took the chance to ask about some traumas that I went through with my bio dad, and although it was nice to say yeah that happened and it was shitty, it brought all those conflicts that I have right back.. and then my dad called the next day and I couldn't do it. Im going on a family vacation with him to celebrate his parents 50th anniversary, and I'm not looking forward to dealing with my dad again right now.. and something always comes up between us. I have made peace and can accept a lot of things, but it seems like problems just keep coming back. 

I brought my boyfriend to my extended family, which is a big thing for me because A) it's meeting the additional family and B) I genuinely have some role models in my family that I look up to. I brought my ex years ago, he's in all the big family photos.. everyone liked him. I think they like my current bf too.. too bad we talked about breaking up yesterday and have been having this conversation for the past few weeks.. Travel plans don't care what you're going through.

I need her more than she needs me, and I feel like it makes me look desperate in her eyes and less appealing, like I'm needy for asking to hang out. My other friend is too social to have time for me. She's married and spends a lot of time with her husband and brother in laws. Plus a few other friends she'll see on occasion. Which means she only has time to see me on rare occasion. She's nice, but I'm very low on her priority list. My other friend spends a lot of time chasing women. Again, low on the priority list.

330,hamartiated,1561426692,5,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

The worst part is when I'm really depressed and/or unwell and I find myself with no one to talk to, how do you cope with that ?

I just really don't know what to do during these times and makes me wish I knew more people, but then once I start trying to meet new people, I don't get along with most and slowly lose contact with the ones I do get along with even when I try my hardest, which is really depressing

334,RichmondNorth,1561424392,5,"Hi, first time on reddit. I think this is the ideal place to post my thoughts. I think I have come to a point in my life when I have to accept my loneliness. For long I have deluded myself into thinking I am not lonely, that I have a great bunch of friends. But I actually knew all along I am just an outsider to the group of friends I sometimes hang out with. It isn't that I stay all the time home; even when I hang out with ""friends"", there is this gnawing feeling of loneliness. It never really goes away, this feeling that there is always a barrier between you and the people around you.

I have anxiety and depression for which I have undergone treatment. In the process I have brought some changes to my lifestyle which includes quit drinking. But now I feel all the more lonely since drinking was a great way to socialize. I have failed at relationships. It is like I do not have the skills to make any meaningful contacts with people anymore.

340,Malammore762,1561421095,11,"We were like brothers. I held his son in the hospital the day after he was born. Call me crazy, but it's very similar to how they portray it in films or fiction. Something completely dreadful will happen and I feel him sitting beside me making some kind of comment about how fucked up that is. It's not always bad though. Sometimes I have good, happy moments and I can still hear his laughter. 
Lately I've been going through some tough times. I lost my job over something completely unfair and illegitimate so I have way too much free time. I guess you could say we've been ""talking"" more. 
I know he's gone. It's not like the paranormal or voices inside of my head but more like he just comes along for the ride. 
We trusted each other with everything. Thick as thieves. I could read him without saying a word and he could do the same. We grew up in an area that was dirt poor and filled with violence and drugs but we survived it and tried to make something of ourselves. I always thought he would be the one to outlive me. 
I feel it getting ""darker"" and depression beginning to become more and more prominent. I try making small steps toward progress and often feel him guiding me with words of encouragement. When we were kids I could have never imagined this. 
Lately it feels I've just been bombarded with disappointment. Individuals showing their true colors, deception, abandonment, loneliness, you name it. I don't take shit from anybody either so every time I decide to remove someone from my life it's like I can imagine what he would say if he were here right now: ""Fuck em'. Think about it. Are they being selfish to you?"" And when I think long and hard enough about that question it makes the decision of cutting them off just a little bit easier. I guess I would rather be lonely than to keep these fake people around.

I have friends at work and I hang out with them also, as I am running D&amp;D for them as well. But why do I still feel like nobody is there for me? I desperately want someone to be close to, someone who can tell me everything will be alright, but at the same time I don’t want or can’t do that with any of my friends. We’re either not close enough, or I don’t want to accost them with my stupid life. I think it’s my self-esteem too. I’m always second-guessing and worrying that everyone hates me or just tolerates me until I leave. I just get too affected by that kind of stuff. One of my groups shared our birthdays so we could all celebrate each other’s when the time came, but nobody said anything on mine. Then, in the same month, someone else’s came up and then the discord flooded with happy birthdays. I’m not mad, but it just hurts a little bit that nobody said anything at all. Should I have said something? I don’t want people to make a huge deal really, but just having it completely ignored really stings. Am I asking for too much with all this? Is life really just having friends to bullshit with and nothing more? Nothing is consequential. I went out and got drunk with some friends once before and had a great time - I vented some feelings and felt sad with my friends and we all consoled each other. Then one of my friends got concerned for the smallest girl in our group and then she said she was going dry. Now we don’t drink, and now I don’t feel like I can be honest. The alcohol made it so much easier to cry and talk and be real. Everything feels like it’s behind a one-way mirror. And here I am again, coming back to reality realizing that this whole rant came from me whining about my friends missing my birthday. I have no goddamn reason to hurt, and yet I do. It’s frustrating, and I want out. That’s why I’ve fallen in love with D&amp;D I think. It’s so much easier to be real when you’re playing a character who isn’t really you, dealing with what you actually are. I really don’t have a reason to be so sad.

You should wonder why I uninstalled this app because in fact it's sometimes seen as ""a fun app to chat with friends"", and doing that will probably make me even lonelier. But, like most people on the sub, I don't feel alone. I have a family, and indeed some ""friends"". But the fact is that I still feel lonely.

Some months ago, I really liked this app because I thought it was a cool way to talk with my friends, and as I am very shy, also a way to talk with other people I usually feel kinda embarrassed with. But, as months go on and on, I feel like everything has changed so much.

My best friend got a girlfriend who was in my class some months ago, and since this event, it is just not the same thing with him. He seems to have become more mature, and this is kind of sad because he was a friend who you could always laugh at everything, even the dumbest things. He also seems to only think about her all the time. Some days ago, we went to a musical event, and he was always saying things such as ""Ah, I wish my gf was there with me"". Therefore, he is not really enjoying time with us, even if he denies it. 

I tried to have a new best friend, another guy that I really liked. I liked him because he was a shy guy like me, with the same problems, and a really funny friend. He was always a member of our group, you know, we were kinda the geeks/nerds of the class, often playing card games during free time, or programming. But these days, he seems to not like our group anymore. I think he looks at us with the same eyes as anyone else, thinking we are only a bunch of geeks with no social life, even if it's obviously false. Now, he wants to hang out every day, he doesn't seem to appreciate anymore spending ""normal"" time with us, always saying shit like ""memes are for kids, your jokes are childish, stop it"". I really hate that kind of toxic behavior, so I told him, and a debate started. After some hours, he just decided to stop debating.

A lot of other friends disappointed me this year. At the start of the year, there was a new guy in my class, coming from the center of the city (the high school we are in is in the suburban area). He moved during the summer, so he obviously didn't know anybody and was kind of shy. Therefore, I went to talk to him, and we quickly became friends. But, during the year, he seemed to not like spending time with me anymore. In fact, he approached a group of girls, and became friends with them, leaving me kinda alone. I have always seen him as a true friend, and I talk about all my problems with him, but I just realized he never saw me that way. Even if I spent more time with him than anyone else, he only talks seriously with the girls, including the gf of my best friend, who is basically his best friend now.

Of course, there are a lot of things I could talk about (including the fact that I always thought the gf of my best friend was a friend, but in fact, she only thought of me as a ""shy buddy""). But I'm just tired. Everyone that I seem to like either change, prefer leaving me for other people or isn't even thinking about me. And the worst thing about all of that is Snapchat. This app is like a demon for people like me. Everyone seems to be so happy, sharing cool moments with their friends, while I only have problems with them. So I just uninstalled it.

357,SonnyBrigante,1561392147,12,"I did find myself in this situation last year. As a teenager I was just this guy who had friends at school, but I almost never met with them outside school. I wasn't also a person who was very fond of parties, because although I drink alcohol myself drunk people (especially the agressive and touchy drunks) and the atmosphere at most parties made me feel very uncomfortable. So when someone asked me to go to this or that party 9 out of 10 times I refused.

Then since last year (I was 21 at the time) I did feel myself become more interested in parties and meeting more people. I guess it was my puberty that made me kind of an asocial person. Now the problem is because I burned so many bridges in high school, because I always refused invites, I don't have contact with those people anymore. 

So right now I kind of regret I was the way I was in high school. So now I'm struggling with trying to meet new people but that is a very hard quest.",lonely,"Anyone who was at first happy about being a loner, but then suddenly it became something that bugged you?",2019-06-25 02:02:27

366,adambebadam,1561356880,3,"Frankly, the concept seems delusional to me. Humans are inherently social creatures, and craving external validation and social interaction is completely natural, and having that desire fulfilled is absolutely necessary to maintain good mental health. For those of you who have seen the film *Cast Away*, Chuck's ""friend"" Wilson is a great example of this.  
Despite this, the overwhelmingly recommended solutions to loneliness (as far as I can tell) are:  


1. Learn to love yourself and love being alone, because being desperate for human connection drives people away, and only by becoming emotionally independent will you become someone people want to interact with.
2. Make more of an effort to foster and grow relationships (both platonic and otherwise).
3. Hang in there; it all comes in time.
4. Seek professional help.

While these are all given with the best of intentions, I have a problem with all of them. Firstly, while 4 is a really nice thought, many people do not have the financial resources for therapy (myself included), and a significant number of young adults have families that do not believe in or shame mental illness (included again, yay!). Perhaps these issues aren't as prevalent in countries other than the US, and if so, tell me.  
I really dislike number 3 in particular because it acts as if your mental health won't be significantly affected by isolation, and that a person's support system will just magically appear if they wait long enough.  
Unfortunately, I happen to know for a fact that 2 does not work. People will not respond to your invitations, people will be reluctant to accept your requests, and people will shut you out faster than you can say ""thanks for hanging out with me today."" Personally, I think the reason for this is as described in 1. People can see your need, so they push you away as to not feel obligated to fulfill that need. Personally, I think this is as only a bit less fucked up than, say, denying food to a starving person at your doorstep, but hey, to each their own.  
Finally, I have a personal problem with recommendation #1. I dislike myself, and I struggle to be happy on my own. I exercise, play games, and watch shows, but do so mostly out of habit than desire. Recently I got a job, but I've found that money is useless when you don't enjoy experiences anymore. Any happiness I do feel is sporadic, with the duration of my happy moments shrinking slowly and subtly as the days go by. There are times when I'm content, but then I make the mistake of having a thought. I hate having thoughts. They just sit there, in my brain, reminding me that they have no reason to be expressed. Nobody wants my ideas. It'd be a waste of time to express them, though I hope that doesn't apply to this post.

Every time I see couples buying food or coffee, getting groceries, walking their dogs etc, I just feel a burning in my chest.

The worst part about it is I've tried to fix it. I joined POF last year after three and a half years to try and get back out there. I later joined Facebook Dating to widen my field. I had more luck with FB than POF, but had the same problem on both sites: started talking with women, set up dates, but then on the day of or day before they'd cancel on me for one reason or another. Whether it was not feeling well, an old flame,another guy or kid being sick, I kept getting stiffed. I actually did end up with three dates with three different women, but after that I didn't see them again. And really, three dates out of eight didn't make me feel enthused about my chances. 

I've given online dating a break cause I'm sick of getting canceled on, but still the longing is there.

A few months ago a girl I was dating for 2 years broke up with me because, ""She was bored, and didn't feel like trying in the relationship anymore"". Back story to that is she was still in undergrad for college and I am currently working on my masters so it became long distance. I would drive 3 hours almost every weekend to go see her, I put in so much effort to make her and keep her happy because she was dealing with the death of her grandfather.  I also was the one putting in the 90% before that. To add to that she face-timed me and broke up with me randomly. We didn't communicate as much because our schedules didn't work but i did my best to make it work. When that ended I felt like I was used for 2 years as convenience since we were both at the same undergrad. She was like the only person I really communicated with so I was lonely after that. I had recently been home and a girl ive been chasing since I was 14 i reconnected with only to be told it was to soon after my break up and that she was working on herself. A few weeks later she was dating a dude she was doing marines training with. She stopped talking to me shortly after. I started my second year of grad school and it is tough and I had noone to talk too. I mean I have my bros from undergrad but they dont understand depression and loneliness. Their response is always ""just be happy dude"" as if it were that easy. I tried all the dating apps only to get ghosted.

I have no desire to date him because we're very different people, but sometimes I fantasize about laying next to him and having him stroke my arm or hold my hand, or just embrace and lay there for a while. 
I have this urge to straight up ask him if I can just cuddle with him for 15 mins so I can get my fix. I know that he will think I'm a total creep and I'll lose a friend.

If you are alone you don't have to worry if your girl is lying about not being out tonight, you don't have to worry if your friends aren't just fakes. It's kinda nice. Find a way to see that and enjoy that. Find lots and lots of ways to cope with being lonely, and find happiness in them. Play a multiplayer game to get some human contact, get a pet for physical contact, be happy with being lonely. 

Once someone sees you being happy and content, they know that you don't need them. You don't come off as desperate and lonely, you come off as a badass loner who's chill and happy. Everyone wants to be friends with someone who's already happy. Nobody wants to be entirely responsible for someone else's happiness. 

Was alone and sad about it for about a year. Would hit up dms and old friends and ex's just trying to get anyone to reciprocate. Then one day I backed off and focused on me. Worked overtime and played video games, didn't worry about meeting people and just got to know myself. Didn't really feel compelled to try and hit on every girl who gave off a positive vibe to me at work, or ask every guy who seemed chill to hang out. Eventually a girl started coming in every now and then I started seeing her alot and would often be the one to help her. I never tried to get at her even though it seemed like there could have been a chance to escape my loneliness, I just didn't feel the desperation to do so. Eventually she asked me out, so I said yes. We started dating, and I got to experience not being lonely again, met alot of new people, and got the motivation to quit my job and find a better one. Life has been uphill since then, even though we broke up a while ago, I realized that the trick to attracting people into your life is being happy.

When my small group met up, it was really hard to be around the friend who ghosted me. Knowing that they don't want to talk to you. So I decided to isolate myself.

After a week, I wondered why no one had messaged me to see if I was okay. I opened up to a friend that I was feeling incredibly lonely. They informed me that everyone is too busy to deal with me at the moment and that it sucks, that you're lonely.

Just hearing that sparked me off, it was a turning point that made me think ""screw that"". I accepted that I am lonely and realized that I have no one to commit to but myself. Put less effort into worrying and caring for my friends and more into putting more effort in at work. Finding things to do for myself, instead of being very helpful to my friends. I've noticed big changes in my mood, I am no longer feeling low all the time, I am content and even happy at times.

422,RestrictedWings,1561283922,6,"Hey r/lonely. Nice to meet you all. 27, male, Canadian and I want to tell you about my loneliness.

I always was the lonely person, from childhood to adulthood. No children around my block when i was growing up, no friends there or at school either. I remember most of my days consistently became very quiet, as I'd walk alone and be alone always. And even in a classroom I'd have that feeling of estrangement. Nobody looks your way, rarely if ever does anyone speak of you and to you. 

My one escape from it was a buddy system for the lower grades that we only saw on special occasions, like Christmas. But that was the school, not the people who cared.

Even when i was brought to daycares, i would be alone because i didn't take naps. So an alone child would sit there in whatever room, with only his thoughts echoing in his mind. And i became so much more quiet as i stopped talking as regularly.

Highschool wasn't much better either, and college only proved more of the same. I was a pretty outgoing and silver tongued person in my days as a young adult, but speaking only ever felt like it was done out of a necessity for needs, or to acquaintances that would eventually fade. The people I met and knew were cold to the emotional touch, and always seemed distant to me.

In life, i have been the outcast since day one, and ever since turning 23 i began to experience how a true loneliness feels after it sets in. A true desolation of the mind, heart and soul. Nobody seeks you, nobody understands you, and everyone you love and cherish grows distant. 

And i began to wake up into cold, careless mornings that seemed to have the walls feel like permafrost, and my head would throb with the pain of a loud crackling tv static, rebounded by nothing but space, my gaze piercing, but empty.

To know that you live in a town xenophobic and filled with cliques who do not accept you when you have lost every last old contact is an excruciating, unique pain. There was a spark, but now its gone. And i see not days, but endless night as quiet existence crawls on.

This true loneliness as been with me so long that sometimes days and nights lose meaning, and sleep is to only wake up again to see the same room, making no noise, just existing as you do. To walk without meaning, to breath without meaning. To be a shell. 

Sometimes there is hope that something beautiful could blossom from a shell of what once was, maybe a candied shining trinket of speech to convince there is more, but try as one might, this is the reality we have to accept. And so Without people, without friends, without love, there came an almost cruel, and ironic acceptance of what life will be and why. Knowing you'll live alone, die alone, and the whole point of your existence- is to exist for the sake of it, nothing more. 

To accept there is no love, and will be no friends, no more warm feelings of belonging or a purpose to be alive actually feels somewhat enlightening. Because in that sober realization, there's a small, certain kind of assurance in your life. You know how it will be, so it will be. And even though loneliness consumes all, I live lonely laudably. 

It's okay to be completely alone.

It's okay.",lonely,Living with loneliness.,2019-06-23 19:58:42
423,pieandsodomy,1561281479,4,"I (31F) had an online friend from another country that I was very close to a couple years back. We talked nearly all day, every day and I could tell her things I wasn't able to tell anyone else. I had a problem that I found embarassing and I was sure meant I was mental, and when I found her and found out she had the same problems, I didn't feel as alone.

She ended up getting a boyfriend though and everything changed. We didnt talk as much because all the sudden *her* problem was no longer a problem because of this. Eventually, I just gave up. Sometimes she would randomly message me, saying we should talk but then when I would respond, she would leave me on read, sometimes for months. The last time this happened, I didn't let it go as I normally did and after 3 weeks of being left on read, I told her ""good talk"". She read that too and never responded.

I'm normally someone who will let someone go when it becomes obvious to me that they don't want to be friends, speak to me, whatever. And for awhile I was fine thinking we were finally just done. But as time goes by I am having a harder time with my problem and I feel totally alone and quite depressed. I don't have anyone I can talk to about it that I think would understand and it's getting harder for me every day.

424,messythehoe,1561280442,92,"..... It’s the saddest adult truth. As a kid, you have teachers who care about your education and future, family members who care about your wellbeing, friends who are interested in you, and parents who are always looking out for you. But shortly after growing up you realize that no one really cares about your life and what you do. Your college professors are just there to get paid and don’t care if you’re learning any of the stuff. Your boss doesn’t care about who you are as long as you’re doing your tedious job. Most people aren’t interested in being your friend unless you have something they want. Parents are not worried about your wellbeing or happiness because they’re just dying for you to find a miserable job and move out. Even in relationships it feels like someone always gets bored, ghosts, and then it’s like they never cared for you in the first place. 

I have no idea how to continue by myself. I don’t like “like” myself enough to finish my dumb degree, look for a job, and take care of myself. TV shows will tell you that with a group of friends surviving together it’s not so bad. “No one told you life was going to be this way. Your job is a joke, you’re broke, and your love life is DOA” but the funny thing is that no one is really there for you either.",lonely,Nobody cares about you,2019-06-23 19:00:42

Sometimes I feel my language abilities are lacking because I don’t really talk that much to anyone anymore. I just feel so disconnected, like nothing matters, and no one will want to get to know me. I’m not pretty anymore, I’m not thin like I used to. Sometimes I wonder if I should start wearing make up and put more effort on my hair—maybe then people will see me?
I have also recently realized that my family treat me like what a lot of men complain of: I am not allowed to be sad. I was not allowed to grieve my mother, nor am I allowed to be depressed or lonely.

I seem to be coping with my loneliness well but it’s definitely not healthy. I spend so much time talking to my self. Sometimes it’s legit conversations with my self but other times it’s me pretending I am talking to an old friend or movie character. I also talk to the tv sometimes if there is a movie playing. I get so connected to characters cause I have nobody else.

The thing that is really weird is that I sometimes pretend that I have people around me. It’s not schizophrenia because I don’t see them and I know they aren’t actually there but still it brings me comfort. Sometimes to fall asleep at night I have to pretend a character is cuddling or sleeping in the same bed as me. Maybe comforting me through my thoughts while my mind races.

But the really crazy thing is it almost feels like someone is actually there with me. I can’t actually feel or see them but my mind kinda is thinking that way. I might feel warmth from where they are sitting.

I'm just the kind of person who overshares and wants people to share back at me and that's the kind of friendship we USED to have but during her previous relationship, I feel like our friendship became not even less important, but completely unimportant to her. And when they broke up and we were hanging out with her other friend and she was talking about all these red flags in their relationship and her other friend was like oh yeah to everything and I was sitting there like a fool being like what you never told me any of this...it was honestly more depressing than her just not talking to me.

455,The_Lone_Musician,1561244069,1,"With exams having ended and Summer officially starting, I decided to go down to Olcott, NY to visit my grandparents for a few days. They have a really nice house that's right next to a beach, and the view is astonishing. I wanted to get away from everything for a few days. The area is really small and everything is pretty close together, so it's hard to get lost and it's easy to get around. My grandfather lives there with my step-grandmother. She's quite wealthy because her husband passed away from mesothelioma, her getting a financial compensation from it. They're both very nice, and have practically treated me like a king. It's amazing here. However, it's a double-edged sword.

You'd think being in a place of luxury and relaxation, away from all of your problems and issues, would be liberating and fulfilling. But, upon my time here, I've felt something so strongly that I often don't feel; I feel empty. The issues follow you everywhere. At home, I'm an outsider, on the outside looking in. Here it's no different, especially since there are lots of rich people that don't really care for people who aren't particularly beneficial or relevant in their lives. Now, before somebody in the comments attempts to rip my ass apart for ""feeling entitled"", let me say that I'm in no way entitled to anything nor do I feel that I am. However, common decency is something these people seem to lack. Manners, for lack of a better term. It just makes the feeling of being on the outside looking in more apparent and strong.

Another thing is seeing all the couples and girls and such. They're are a lot more here, since Olcott is sort of a touristy area, and there's a little carnival there too. So, naturally, more people (and especially couples) flock here. It just sucks to watch the sunset at the beach (technically behind it, since the beach is flooded over currently) alone while I see couples and friends doing it together. It just gets depressing. I really wish I had a special someone to be with while I visit here. It'd make things one hundred times better. I digress.

Being here has left me feeling empty, depressed, lonely, and overall discontented. Does this mean there isn't any good to being here? No, not one bit. I've been having a nice time, and I'll probably want to come back again and again during this Summer. But the negatives definitely make the positives less effective. 

In conclusion, I feel really lonely and sad, and especially empty. I wish I had somebody here to spend time with (somebody who I have a deeper connection with than my grandparents, though they're great), and that I didn't feel as alienated and such. I don't know. Maybe I'm just being dumb.",lonely,A Hellish Paradise.,2019-06-23 08:54:29
456,anewstart0,1561242239,11,"i know it shouldn't mean much. that i should be stronger than this. 

i uninstalled all social media a few months ago to focus on my studies. it's been fine and dandy since i never talk to anyone or interact on there. i mean, it should have been, because i reinstall and uninstall instagram a few times a day. it's always for just a peek and then i remember wtf am i doing and uninstall. i just can't help myself and i'm working on it. 

but, i reinstalled it again and i saw the two people i share this one class with have stories up. and it was them in the library studying together. like, i've always known that they are closer to each other than with me, but seeing that just hurt. i didn't get a text, no invite, nothing. i know i've turned down one invite before, which was a few months ago, but that was because the other friend couldn't go so i was the last resort. i know that, and i still felt hurt. even though i shouldn't have!

it's always that everyone has better friends. people who they are closer to. i know that. i've come to terms with being the absolute last resort. it's easy to get bitter and resentful of everyone because i've completely shut off my phone for a few days and didn't get a single text back even though i've double texted and anything more would be too much. i've caught myself slipping into the mindset of ""well i dont need friends, i'm just really introverted and i can make do."" but no. i'm trying to lie to myself and it's not working. 

i have my last final in a few days. this semester has been my toughest one yet. out of my four classes, in two of them i've had the teacher ask me if i had any friends, or try to encourage me to make new friends since it's so obvious i'm the odd one out in group projects. in the third class there's no group projects, so naturally it's my favorite class. i love it. my highest grades are in that class :)

but holy hell, group projects. hearing those words makes my blood pressure shoot up. it's unreal how anxious and terrified they make me. it's not like i can't communicate with people or anything. it's just that everyone else has better friends and i always have to muster up the courage to tap someone on the shoulder and pathetically ask if i could join their group. 

last summer, i made a few online friends. it was okay for a while, and i could feel the change. i was happier, had more energy, and was more flexible. i hate how being social has that much of a positive effect on me. 

oh yeah, i don't talk to any of those people anymore. because they moved on and gradually texted less and less and now we never text at all. the fact that i stopped playing multiplayer video games also exacerbated that but i didn't want that toxicity in my life anymore. but now i have nothing to connect with people to.

We only went out for a couple of months. There are too many details to explain but at the end he broke up with me.

It's not always the case, but 8/10 times it is...most of my time is spent at work or hanging out at home, playing games with a friend of mine, doing some drawing, watching YouTube or spending time with my gf... I'm not a very social person in all honesty, especially if it's with someone I don't know, I don't do well in that situation, so making new friends is difficult...as is finding a gf, who isn't my ex and isn't disliked by my entire family/friends...(but that's another thing, for a different community)",lonely,A realization...,2019-06-23 02:37:19

473,hamartiated,1561214011,18,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat),2019-06-23 00:33:31
474,jellokie,1561209513,7,"It's like every summer I dive back into the same routine which is not doing great things basically lol. I just become more lonely than I was during the school year. It gets to the point that it makes me want to hurt myself, but I know I won't do it. I honestly just wish I had someone to talk and vent to. I tried telling my younger brother how I felt sometimes (lol idk why I even did that) but he wasn't really listening and didn't seem to care and just gave responses that basically showed he wasn't really listening so instead I'd just sit his room and tried talking to him about his game or anything else but he still doesn't really listen especially if he's on his game lol. It's like when he's on his game he suddenly become meaner sometimes which I understand if I'm bothering him (I probably am lol). 

I would talk to my mom but she has alot on her plate already with her working till really late, being in school part time, closing on our house soon, my sister being in rehab, and my sister's kids (4 and 2) staying with us so who's taking care of them? I am. Although right now my aunt helps too since we live with her, but my brother doesn't really besides pulling out their bed (a pull out bed in a couch) and doing their bath water. He mostly stays on his ps4 all day until between 8-10 pm he'll get off or my mom or aunt will tell him to get off.

I wish I had someone to talk to besides chatting with strangers on omegle. I've chatted with people online before and irl but all I do is push them away and especially online after like 5 min of talking I suddenly just don't want to talk anymore. It's like I like the idea of having someone to talk to but don't want to necessarily idk.

I'm quite scared to share this part of me with you guys and I hope that even if you don't understand my situation or find me disgusting because of it that you can be respectful because it's already hard enough as it is.
That being said, let me drop a piece of information of me which is a constant burden in my life. I'm transgender. Which means that I was born differently than how I present physically today. Now I am a guy in his twenties and have been in transition since I was 14. If I hadn't gone through with transitioning I'm sure I wouldn't be here anymore. I've been through all the surgeries and feel better in my skin. 
What botters me is that a lot of people don't see me for who I am. They are proud of being friends with ""a trans guy"" but not proud of being friends with me as a person. This also happens to me when dating. I met some really cool people over the years but everytime there comes a moment where I have to tell them I'm trans. And then they cut me off. They act as if I'm some weird creature and tell me that it's a shame I'm so handsome but happen to be trans. This has been said to me numerous of times and it makes me sad. It makes me believe that I'll never be enough and that I'll end up alone without experiencing what it means to be loved. I feel alone all of the time and I can't shake off the feeling. I'm waiting for someone to give me the chance to show them that I can be worth it to be their friend or lover.",lonely,It hurts,2019-06-22 20:56:18

478,WHAgent13,1561197189,1,"I just turned 27yo and lately I've been more depressed than usual over fact that I'm going to be alone forever. I'm not looking for attention or pity in this post, I just have no one to talk to about this stuff or at least no one that care or can help. So here's my story.(I try to make it short)

  First of all, I have a very demanding, full time management job (work=home) at a motel. I have no freedom and I dont get breaks (I get to play my beloved video games at least). My boss is great most of the time but he did once tell me that this job doesn't allow for a social life. Five years ago I didnt want this job and it's my first real job. It sounded great on paper. I never cared to have friends anyway and I never was in love or completely understood compassion but now things are different.

  I face a few obstacles in love. 
Obstacle one: I'm overweight, I want to start going to the gym or go on walks but I can't be gone from work long. (Side note, when my friend, Britney, lived nearby we would go to the gym to get fit together, I loved going and it was easy cause we motivated each other and i struggle with depression so motivation is hard for me. We would go late at night when work was slow for me and my boss had a problem with it so I had to stop. Again, he's a great boss just a little(a lot) narrow minded.) Anyway, because I'm overweight I have very low self esteem and no confidence. Not much I can do about it. 
  Obstacle number two: I'm a gay, nerdy, atheist,  oddball that lives in south Louisiana. Not many options for me. And most if not all the options are trash people. I dont know anyone remotely like me. 
  Obstacle three: As I said, my job is restricting. I can't have a social life. I can't be gone long to go on a date and I can't bring a guy here (cause this is my place of work). 
  Obstacle four: I've always struggled with the idea of love and compassion. I know what it is but never understood what it was like until recently. To be clear, I have felt LUST many for times before and still do, its LOVE I struggle with, trust me I know the difference. 

  Conclusion: I'm in love, actually in LOVE. But here's the catch: Even though I have seen him and listened to him and learn about him and got a feel for his interest and hobbies all thanks to the power of internet (I'm not a stalker, I promise) he lives in New York and is famous and WAY out of my league, even if obstacles 1-4 weren't a issue. But despite all that he makes me smile on the worst days and we share alot of interest (some of which I haven't tried but would love to). I love when he posts something. We share views on important issues and he's so dorky sometimes. He's the perfect combination of cute, handsome, sexy, adorable, beautiful, and loveable. I love everything about him. At first I thought it was a crush and maybe it was but it's been about four years now. I thought that it could be lust but even though I think he's physically perfect, just love seeing him smile or hearing his voice. He makes me smile not so much drool. I get giddy and all warm and fuzzy when I see him.
  So basically the ONE guy I've EVER LOVED is unobtainable and I have no way of meeting someone else. I'm growing use to the idea that I'll never have someone but it hurts more and more everyday. Thanks for coming to my sad TedTalk",lonely,I dont want to be alone,2019-06-22 19:53:09

I feel incredibly alone. I have nobody to go to, and nobody to just let my feelings out to. Sure, I have “friends”, but do they act like a friend? No. They’re just selfish and narcissistic and don’t give a shit about me or anyone else. Kids all want to be “popular” in school, and almost everyone’s lost the value of a real friendship. I’m constantly ignored and my opinions are disregarded in almost every circumstance, it’s like I don’t exist. It’s like I don’t exist. I talk to nobody day in and day out, and now that it is summer, it’s really not helping my situation. 

I just want someone who I can trust, someone who cares about me and actually listens to me. It just seems so hard to find those kinds of people these days. It’s all about them, not about you. That’s how I feel about people, and I’d like to change my perspective but I don’t see it changing any time soon.

i’ve been friends with some of the same people since freshman year of high school and they just  now seem to consider me somewhat of a friend. we had a pretty big group of friends that slowly dwindled down to just the 4 of us and i feel like i’m only apart of this group bc i’m not a problematic person (there was a lot of drama with the other people but that’s high school so what do you expect).  i’m closer now to one of them now bc were in another group and we all have a similar hobby (basically we’re all couples and we play dnd) but i feel like all of them are closer to my boyfriend than me, and if anything happened and we broke up then they’d take his side and i’d be completely alone. i have some friends outside of this from college but we’re not really close. i had my 21st birthday and my friends from school that i made completely on my own couldn’t show up but the mutual friends me and my boyfriend share came, and i realized that i wasn’t even close to most of them and i barely considered them friends, i think they just came for my boyfriend. i’ve never had a best friend and the two girls in the dnd group are and it sucked hearing them make plans together and their other friend group knowing i wasn’t invited, it just brought me back to high school. part my original group would always hangout and i would have to hear about it the next day at school cause they had such a fun time and obviously wanted to talk about it. they saw movies together all the time and the only time i got invited was bc we were no longer friends with one of the girls in the group who would go with them. i feel like if they never had drama i wouldn’t have been invited to so many things. i just feel like no one actually cares about me. even with my boyfriend; i know he loves me and he calls me his “best friend” but i know who his Actual best friends are and i’ll never be on that level since they’ve been friends since middle school and elementary school, and we’ve only been dating for 2 years. i feel like i’m not even a second choice for a lot of people too, like i’m a fourth or fifth. i wish i could just be a hermit and not care about socializing but i could never do it bc i just want to feel wanted.

01 Jun 19

I'm still trying to process the past couple of minutes. I'm trying to wake up from this dream. It just can't be true. There's only one thing going through my mind, ""I don't want to be alone"". I start driving to the only thing that I know that would be open this late. I'm not really a patron that partakes in this exact vice, but I just can't be alone right now I just can't be. I nervously walk into the bathroom to start looking at myself in the mirror. It's weird seeing what other people see when it comes to yourself. Kind of how your brain tunes out your nose unless you really try and concentrate on it. I tried that but I wasn't trying to concentrate on my nose. No I was still seeing that it was me. I should probably also say that I'm on acid and the trip is just kicking in. I didn't really notice it since the aggression help me through the drive. I don't know what I'm doing here. I feel disgusted and vile just stepping in this place. It's just this is the only place where you can buy some companionship even if it's only for a little while. I decide that I should just go with the flow and withdraw money from the atm. Well if it ain't just my luck the damn thing is saying I'm out of funds. Did I already hit rock bottom that hard that I actually didn't notice this time? Nah it must be a machine error. I decide that the bartender should be able to get me the funds I need for the company I oh so desire right now. I stumble through my words to be able to communicate that I need money and I need it badly. I need something to go right tonight. I guess he saw how badly I was tweaking out looking like shit that he might have fell some sort of pity. It's neither here nor there all that matters is that i have 60 crispy ones and two bottles of cider as well as two vodka in me. It's showtime. I make my way to the table right next to stage to get a better look. At this point the drugs and alcohol were screwing with my already messed up eyes. I couldn't really concentrate on the girls. I was more entertained with the flashing light going on around them. I just kept looking at them as if I finally found the distraction I needed the one I was looking for. This was all cut short when one of the dancers decides to inquire for the reason of tonight visit. I tell her what happened and she tells me that terrible. She asked if she could provide me with her services. As soon as she said that the lights flashed in her face and I saw a good look at where I was. I think she saw the expression on my face I have a terrible poker face especially under the influence. I politely declined the offer with just saying that I'm just too sad for that right now but thank her for the offer nonetheless. I should probably clarify that I'm not happy about this situation, I'm not happy that I have to pay to not  be sad in my own pity party, and I'm not happy about what we talked about. The lights soon turn on and it was time for the vermin to find another hole to crawl into. I ended up feeling more empty than when I first arrived so I went back home. I found it so hard to go into my house and go to bed. This just can't be real. All of this is just a dream I must have passed out and I'm just dreaming of all this. I check my pocket to find a bag of shrooms. Well since this is a dream, well fuck it. I down the bag and leave no trace of the earthy tasting mushrooms. I muster up the courage to get myself to my bed where I just start staring at the ceiling. I just want to make as many self destructive decisions as possible today. As soon as I was about to get up again to start my next spree I catch a glimpse of the movies you gave me. I haven't seen the second one and i don't really have any plans right now so i guess my rampage could wait for a bit. I insert the disk and get whisked away into the world of anime heroes. I usually nerd out internally when I watch this sort of stuff but the drugged made it seem like I was actually there. I felt amazing when the hero was showing off, I felt sad when the hero hit a conflict that stop his progress to save the day, and I cried when he pushed thought despite the odds. For a moment I felt like a kid again and I was happy. I didn't know about anything else expect that the hero will make it through this time he just has to. The movie finishes and the TV fades to black. There he is again you,me, myself. ""You know I fucking hate you"", I yelled at the TV expecting to get a response. There was none obviously. I needed something else to distract me so I decide to stare at the ceiling fan while I vaped a bit. I remembered that we switched vapes and i had yours. I hold on to it for dear life because I know if anything happens to it I'll die. I mean I know that I wouldn't really die, but I felt like it so I protected the only thing I had of yours. I start remembering you. I start crying. I can't stop crying. I don't want to stop crying. It just feels right. So I cry until it hurts cry till my tear ducts run dry. I'm so lost right now. I thought sleep sounded like the best thing to do for now. I forgot that I self medicated a bit much so I'm stuck with my inner thoughts all night long. I hear voices that say I should fucking end it. That I'm worthless burden that contributes nothing to the people around me. It would be a favor to everyone if I was just gone. I tried to reason with the voice, but he only got angrier as well as yelling louder till my voice became a silent whimper. I cover my face to find out that morning is finally here. I muster up the strength to get up and look out my window. I start looking at the floor. I'm peggy high off the ground really never noticed till now. The voice told me that this is my chance. Just make my way to the roof to finally put an end to this all. I opened up the window to be able to climb to the roof. As I gaze as the floor before I start thinking how much this is going to hurt. I stop myself and remember that book I read. The name escapes me right now. Its kind of funny that I can't remember the story title anymore. I pull out my phone to look up the name before it starts to eat at me. I forgot that you're still my background wallpaper. I start to cry some more, then I start to listen to old voicemails to hear your voice before all this,  and then I cry some more. I used to cry all the time when I was a kid even if it was for the smallest things. It's kind of hard finding a reason to cry now except for that one time when my cat ran away from home, the aftermath with my friends, and now for you.",lonely,3 a.m. thoughts feel free to criticize,2019-06-22 13:11:28

503,cinnamonbumnab,1561161473,1,"Dude, take the time to read this, fr im kinda fucked up, suicide/murder are legit options to me rn.. CARE FOR ME ( jk, dont take this as a first impression)

I met this someone in high school, I became best friends with this person at the time, we'd hang out for hours on for 3 years, i used to be comfortable and just speak my mind and be funny about everything and it was okay for me, sometimes he's mean and critical of me, and i block him for that for a while then i forgive him. I shared all my interests to him and he picked up on a bunch of them, especially what i watch for entertainement. i noticed at the 3rd year of our friendship he liked to copy me, especially with the cercle of friends that were close to me but then he signed up to school cafeteria so he hung out with us and them too and he would say ""this is what nab (me) would do"" and he starts kind of imitating me, in my words, in my manners, in my way of moving around while telling stories, and all the sort of funny punchlines i say. (It prolly sounds weird but theres are so many things that are specific to me, and i dont own them, but i feel like ive grow to make this collections of things i say or do or be like and it kind of defines, but i think thats normal... right?!?) Anyways, I got him to meet alot of my other close friends and got him to join us in our organization doing volunteer work, so he basically knows all my friends at this point. After those 3 years i was accepted to a college abroad, i left the country for a year, lived in through dorm life, and because of the time in loneliness and stress i started to feel more and more shy and insecure of myself (I've always felt anxious, ive had to move out alot in my life and get used to new shit so shy n insecure was not new, but i always figured out a way to adapt) and i got influenced by different shit, I wasnt the attention whore guy anymore, i learned to let things happen, and observe and listen more. 

This guy on the other hand, is not only cute according to some people, he also doesnt have the same insecurities as i developped over the years, because my life was filled with ups and downs (that might be the reason why i appeared to have a different way in ģetting to know people, which obviously rubbed off onto him).

Everytime i say a new word or a new bit, it sticks to him and he repeats it to his friends, which are my friends, and he does it while im there, and they think he came up with it and he's all that charismatic funny guy and not only do i feel invisible, but i feel used, and lonely.

When i talk, its like im talking to me a year ago, he literally copies me, and he knows it, he doesnt do it maleciously, but it hurts, and he hurt too.

We once texted how i dont wanna have a conversqrion with u because id be having a conversation with myself, and when he called and i answered, we both answered the phone in just a similair way qe both did this lil meme at the same time its so weird
And then i proceed talking about how fucked up this obviously is and he says ""im the better version, the 2018 version, ups and downs u know, its okay, im not critizing, im judt critizing your personality"" (supposedly as a joke but that were some real fr understones there u can actually smell them)


This is basically what sucks, i feel lonely now, and invisible, because there's a better version of me out there that doesnt get shy, and he hogs all the attention to himself, and often times he embarasses me in front of people by bringing up fucked up shit about me that i told him about without realising he's being mean and embarassing.

There's a group of people at my work who I'm friends with, but I'm not invited out as often as some others because I'm not the ""best"" friend. I tried asking my friend if she wanted to hang out this week and of course she will hang out with the best friend instead. It just sucks not being enough for someone. I love spending time with them but looking at when I don't get invited to certain things, it kind of sucks. I also got out of a relationship last month. I just always feel like I'm always the one caring the most but it doesn't matter, I always fall short of importance to other people in their lives. I give and so much love and affection but it just goes to waste, like it did with my ex. He fell out of love. I don't know why, but I'm trying not to blame myself, because I never treated him badly, neglected him, or harassed him. I loved him and he realized he couldn't love me the same way, even though he fell in love with me very hard at the start. And I know it's important to enjoy spending time alone - I mean I'm an introvert and I love my alone time and need it to recharge, but there's only so much alone time to enjoy without getting lonely, longing for that human connection. That's what I crave and long for, and I guess that's why I loved being in a relationship - I had a physical and emotionally intimate connection with a person, something I've craved for my whole life. It's gone now. Maybe I'll find someone else later on, but for now I just want to heal. But healing causes you to reflect, and now it just seems like I'm not good enough for anyone to actually care, love, and think about me. Either way feelings are fickle and temporary and can change so easily. I'm really afraid to pursue anything else when it comes to finding a connection with another, even though I want it so badly.

527,hamartiated,1561114015,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

528,echointheempty,1561108092,7,"One thing I've noticed through all the numerous subs revolved with loneliness, is the type of girl everyone longs for. 

You wouldn't have to scroll very far for someone to mention something along the lines of:

""I saw beautiful girl on the subway and it made me sad to think of how she would never like me.""

""Really cute girl smiled at me today.""

""In my dream last night I had a girlfriend, she was blonde and beautiful and held my hand.""

None of these are bad things of course. Everyone has their own dreams and desires and they are all valid.  Nor am I asking anyone to lower their standards. We like what we like and are attracted to what we are attracted to. Loneliness doesn't have to be a competition of whose more virtuous.

And yet...reading these things time and time again makes me so sad. 
Because I'm not *that* girl. 
I'm not beautiful or lovely.
I don't make the guy riding the bus in front of me stop and stare. My smile isn't something anyone thinks about afterwards. No one is doing a double take.

Sure. You may date me because I'm not hideous and you are lonely. And oh yeah, I am a girl. You definitely wouldn't say ""No'"" right?

But I'm not what you wanted. If you had other girls interested in you and were capable of having numerous dates. If you basically, *had the choice.*

544,danzi897,1561075111,2,"I know why I don't have friends...

It's because I'm way too comfortable with being alone that I can't ever imagine sharing any aspect of my life with another person. I've been this way since I was 9, ever since I practically locked myself at home, thanks to me being a bully magnet for some reason I still don't understand.

I think I just grew to love my own company too much. I learned to adapt to it from an early age and I know no other lifestyle. I don't like speaking nor making contact with people because people don't even understand me most of the time, or make fun of how little sense I make. And the bigger culprit is probably that I don't even care much for other people either. I can't bring myself to genuinely care long-term for another human being. I feel empathy, sure, but I don't want to be involved with them. When I get into trouble, I don't like relying on the people I know either and just try my best to get out of it on my own. When people offer me a hand I feel nothing but stress and discomfort. I often find myself wishing people would leave me alone. It feels... wrong to me to associate with people at all. 

Solitude comes with its downsides too: loneliness and depression, but these are already part of me and they actually get worse when I'm with other people not the other way around. I can't for the life of me understand how other people do it so effortlessly. I mean the simple stuff really. Approaching people, talking to them, making friends, 'hanging out', and just... existing around each other. Also it's not like I don't have desires to start a family and have a wife and kids and live normally... I just don't think I can do it and I get depressed thinking about that, and the result is me writing something like this to justify to myself the lifestyle I feel like I can't escape.

Do you think it's bad to feel so comfortable with solitude? Is it possible to change so drastically?

546,PM_ME_UR_PETHAMSTER,1561067350,22,"**I am afraid of being abused.**

I've heard a lot of horror stories about abusive relationships and how x% of men cheat and how an SO will sometimes force the other to stop talking to siblings or friends for their benefit. I do not have good mental health as it is, and being abused by someone could drive me to something bad like alcoholism, drugs, or suicide.

**I am afraid of fighting.**

My parents fought A LOT. I have seen a total of 4 divorces between just my Mom and my Dad, first eachother then other people. My Mom and my step father got into nasty fights in the past and sometimes dragged us into it. I am afraid of getting yelled at now and I feel like I hate people more as a result.

**I don't know how to reapond to certain emotions.**

If an SO needs me to comfort her in a traumatic event of some kind, I don't know how to actually act. I am generally uncomfortable around people displaying very strong emotions of any kind. I'm almost a robot. Generally, friends and peers growing up tended to get angry at me if I tried to be of any kind of emotional support and blew me away. I am genuinely shocked and uncomfortable when people go out of their way to hug me (besides family).

**I am insensitive.**

Damn I say a lot of stupid shit. I don't consider the current situation or how someone if feeling before saying something. So I tend to hold my tongue as much as I can.

**I am afraid of women.**

Idk what to say here...just that my Mom is a very intimidating woman along with my grandma.

**I might have depression.**

I get in depressed moods, but still move out of them. So I'm not going to go and self diagnose here. I *am* on anti depressants atm.

**I'm fucking annoying and loud**

I have a reputation for being annoying to people. It was worse when I was young. I'm afraid of annoying people now and try not to say too much. I apologize a lot.

**I am oblivious to social cues**

Not sure what to add here.

**I have no friends**

I feel like only having a girlfriend and no friends is a BAD idea. I can be clingy and annoying since I have no one else to go to.

**I am insecure**

547,bakedfob77,1561064911,1,"Hi all I would like to start by saying I am a lonely boi as well, but when I get down about it I like to ride my motorcycle, it is an incredible escape of everything on my mind weather is be over analyzing decisions or dealing with my forever alone self... F's in the chat pls.

But I'm not here to tell you that I have found my happy place, but to tell you about the incredible world of two wheels.

I would like to encourage you to give it a shot.

Now I know your saying, ""but that's complicated, I can't even ride a motorcycle"" or "" that's too expensive and dangerous"" 
To which I say, it doesn't have to be.

But first I would like to explain why you should ride a motorcycle the first reason is because you are completely free of all of your daily duties and responsibilities in the general grind that is life. No  worries about weather somebody is going to call you today or how much reddit karma you accrue. Reason two: There is no thinking about anything outside of what you are doing on the road and the feeling you get from smelling the fresh breeze and seeing the world in a new fresh light. In the truest sense of the word, freedom, is what I can explain it as the freedom to go where you please how fast you want to get there and how long you'll stay. It's an adventure everytime you go for a ride. 
Reason three: you will meet an encredible group of people who also love riding motorcycles, and who will love to meet you, since it's mostly a solitary activity riding a motorcycle other people who ride them love to chat with people about it and even ride together. Not to mention you don't need to feel bad about riding them alot as they burn far less fuel than pretty much everything on the road.

Now that you've made it this far you might be wondering how can I even start riding a motorcycle to which the answer is if you are in the United States you should take the msf class which is a motorcycle safety course where you will learn how to ride a motorcycle safley and fluently, the course is only a couple hundred dollars and it will fill out one weekend of your month, but you will be doing it with other people who are usually as confused on what to do as you, so there is a great bonding over the time you spend with everyone there.

You also might be saying that loud obnoxious motorcycles isn't my speed. well the good news for you is you don't have to ride a loud  abnoxious motorcycle if you don't want to there are many options out there including scooters and small quiet motorcycles, big loud motorcycles, fast motorcycles, slow motorcycles and motorcycles that you can ride around the world on.

Just some food for thought if you'd like to change your life in an encredible way.

I understand that everyone has flaws but the flaws I witness in people are too much for me to handle. Cheating and disloyalty, for example. And the way people can just fall out of love scares the heck out of me because I take a long time to love someone but once I do they become apart of me, no matter how much they hurt me, it becomes almost impossible for me to stop loving them, which is a dangerous thing. So I often think about my ""perfect match"" and how would they would treat me and make me feel, and it makes me happy even if I dont have anyone like them because just the thought of a person like that existing is enough for me. So I guess you could call it a bittersweet loneliness. I know fantasies can be dangerous but they can also be healing at times. So anyway, I imagine someone who is..

-in touch with their inner child, someone who isn't shy to do things like swing on play sets or finger paint.
-playful and witty but kind. Someone I can have playful banter with but who doesn't cross the line when it comes to my real fears or insecurities, and is there for me if they come up instead of belittling me for them. 
-not afraid to care, or show that they care. They pay attention to little details like breakfast, if I'm cold, if I like the song that's playing on the radio, just little things that most people would ignore or not care about. 
-adventurous and wants to make the most out of life, because they understand that life is short and material things like money don't matter. 
-open minded about things and not quick to rule out the paranormal, but still skeptical enough that we could have discussions 
-relax and laid back. I tend to latch on to other people's energy so someone who doesn't get stressed will prevent me from getting stressed
-kind to others, especially those that are weaker or in need of help such as animals, children, elderly and the disabled. 
- this is oddly specific but I'd really love someone who enjoys dancing, not like hip hop but duet dances like waltz and salsa. 
-someone who sees wonder and beauty in nature, so that we can go on a lot of camping trips to watch the stars.

568,hamartiated,1561028082,7,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat),2019-06-20 20:54:42

570,ThisAccIsATrashedOne,1561019132,2,"So I'm posting this on a different account, my other is linked to people I know irl. Anyway lets get into it. And yes this is a huge vent.
I'm young, 16 guy kind of young, and straight. Got a job, and I take care of myself. But I'm not an idiot/entitled/ignorant/arrogant/etc. Not a douche basicslly. I wanna say mature but Im not really in the position to. I'm also very sarcastic when talking, but I make up for it. I got respect for people and all that. Including those who treat me trashy. I recognize when I'm wrong and admit it, then try to fix it. I'm calm, understanding, and simply peaceful. I don't hate or dislike any people or groups. I don't creep on anyone, don't waste money, don't hurt anyone, hell I don't even lay a finger on anyone, at all. Also I don't have any physical conditions, or mental conditions (at least not diagnosed, I wont webMD diagnose myself thats stupid). Overall I'm an alright person I'd say.
That said, you could say I'm 'rebellious'. I smoke weed yeah, I drink yeah, and stuff like that. Sure I'm not allowed to, but I do it anyway so whatcha gonna do ig. But I don't let that define who I am or control who I am. I do it all safely, responsibly. I prioritize what's important before anything else. Like I said, not an idiot. 
Now, the actual story. I have a few groups of 'friends'. 1st group, 3 other guys, who can be nice. They don't really give a damn about me. Never talk, never check up. Never invite me anywhere, other than to chill for an hour or two and expect me to leave after. Always invite someone else to a party or to do literally anything, in front of me. They dont hate me, they dont love me, but they dont like me that much either. Only times they do care at all is when I have something of value, OR, when they are in need of an emotional outlet. And surprise, I'm the outlet for them. Outlet meaning I'm the place where they spend their negative emotions. We all get along great on occasion but there's no consideration from them directed at me. Sidenote, their interests are mostly music and drugs, different from mine. 2nd friend group, 3 girls. These people are the best to be around, literally. I've only been with them maybe 3 or 4 times since i met them, which sucks. But they are chill with me, and I'm chill with them.  The catch is, theres nothing to talk about. So, there's a lot of silence. Its awkward for sure. Today they invited me to come over to drink and swim, because it's Summer break. Which was going to happen, I was talking to one of them, then another saying yeah I can go. Last text was basically ""Yeah I can go"". Got left on read :). I don't know why, nothing bad was said, she just left me on read for some reason. So I waited, and eventually gave up cause I never got a response. Maybe she simply forgot about the text, but lets face that's probably not the deal. So I have no clue why it happened. The last girl I texted is the girl where we both end up flirting... like no matter what, its not intentional. It always ends up nowhere, emotionally my brain isn't doing great so yeah im a little bitch and havent tried to ask her out. Side note, one of then ripped me off when I bought 'something' from her, but I let that go, grudges dont help anyone. So yeah, theyre great, but leave me hanging a bit.
Now the 3rd group of friends, the mega party group, about 16 people. I only meet these people a couple times a month, but not one of them really includes me in anything. Dont get me wrong, they're all really nice.We meet up spot, we go, but eventually I only end up talking a few times and getting ignored often. A lot goes on without me included in it even though its right next to me. However there are about 2 people there who do see I exist and call me a friend, which is good, those 2 are amazing.
-Wrapup- I'm just an outlet for a lot of people I'm nice to. Except for the 3 girls, another couple people who i rarely see, and my old middle school boys I still know. This sounds like yeah I know a lot of people, which is true. But no one has made a significant effort to know me. I don't know if I come off as desperate, or pathetic, or a pushover. I also lost of a lot of confidence and enthusiasm, sinced I placed it in a year long relationship which ended. And imtimate(emotionally and physically) relationships help me feel a lot better but i dont have that right now :). Yeah that's my story, I never get invited or talked to except from 2 girls. Maybe that will lead me somewhere that's better than being lonely, but I don't want to push it.
Maybe this is all overthinking too, I do that a lot.",lonely,"Have 'friends', but still lonely(Long)",2019-06-20 18:25:32

Today as i was stuck in traffic, i thought about all these posts. i decided to take action. i pulled over and text 'good morning' to a couple of people.
person#1 responded like if i needed something. once i articulated that i was just saying hello, he invited me to watch a movie with his family this friday. boom, done.
person#2 (backstory)was a guy i met via the online chat of my ps4. he lives in the same county. hung out with him 4 times in the past. we have not spoken in months and he never texts me. his response to my text was a happy: whatss up! what have you been up to? after a few back and forths i found out he recently lost his job due to bancruptcy. he is looking and asked if i had any recommendations. i took his resume and pointed out a direction for him. he thanked me and we made plans to eat breakfast as soon as he settles.
i just have a strong feeling that our mind just fucks with us. many of your stories involve multiple group settkngs that you feel left out of. i say, fuck the groups. divide and conquer. spend time with people alone to get the real them. i groups everybody is acting. anyway, my two cents.",lonely,i combated lonelyness today,2019-06-20 17:51:30

First person I ever opened up too about my feelings. Never liked her romantically, always respected her. I obviously just exploded quickly cause I needed someone to talk too and it was just a burden for her. It's something I can understand but it just really sucks. When my girlfriend of two years left me by surprise for another dude, talking to her helped me distract myself. Though shes honestly just a super intelligent volunteer therapist who isn't truly my friend for the same reason everyone else isn't. I'm an annoying dick, I try my best not to be but I picked up poor behaviours from my parents and are a dick when I simply don't realize it.

&amp;#x200B;

You know life is a real challenge. Cause only a year ago, I was a senior at high school (I'm a rising sophomore in university now), had like a 97 average was co-founder of the school's largest club cs club, just hungout and enjoyed quality (like yknow..) time with my girlfriend everyday, driving around. Life was so fucking good. Went to university (3 hour drive from my gf, we visited every other weekend or so), man that was the end of mental health right there. University killed me, was way harder than I thought, and was focused on class so much that I didn't live up to other goals I planned to achieve like at all. I had literally no one to talk too in real life, the one friend I did have was far. I was just crushed, morning to night studying. I managed to get the GPA i needed to get into my major (barely) just to not get in cause I missed the deadline to apply, cause my university's emails ended up in my spam folder. My cousin who was really my only friend, was super close, we hungout every weekend all throughout my childhood ages 6-13. Became a fucked up drug addict, who asked me for money, i sent a sentimental text about how he should get his life together, and he just spam insulted me drunk last tuesday night. Instantly ruining what was once such a meaningful relationship. I don't know what the fuck is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I just crash. Like at night, when I'm trying to sleep (the worst, being alone in my thoughts, the worst). I have to get up, move around, turn the lights on, look outside. Cause I'll have these instantaneous moments of just feeling trapped and crushed, in an absolute fucking nightmare. In high school I didn't really have friends but at least I had people to talk too, acquaintances, people who would say hi back if i ran into them and said hi to them. I literally don't even have that anymore. I have no one, I have nothing. My dad is a miserable alcoholic (was over that ages ago) so can't really talk to him, he always seems bothered by me (definitely doesn't hate me cause hes quite financially supportive), and I don't have much chemistry with my mom (english as a second language, i don't speak her first). I was never even close to them. Though do you get how I feel? When I just crash and, I have nothing, everythings going downhill, and I just feel like ultra fucking shit, and I just gotta get up and move and just look around cause I literally feel like im dying, its hard to explain. I got tinder, even paid for plus, swiped right on so many people, literally didn't even bother on attractive people, and only got one match who just isn't responding. Like I didn't know things were that bad in terms of my looks, I managed to get a girlfriend in high school I thought thats supposed to mean things are okay.

&amp;#x200B;

On the bright side I'm moving towards getting my life back together cause I have time to do it. I'm fortunately not employed so I'm just focused on myself. Working on my technical portfolio (I'm in tech), got into the gym and going consistently, going on hikes, focusing on my social manner and being a better person. Though for fuck sakes I have nothing and no way to get anything.

  
I seriously feel like fucking shit, and the worst is being alone with my thoughts, cause the exponential growth of shitty feelings. Though there isn't much time in the day where I'm not alone with my thoughts.  If anyone else can somewhat relate, and need someone to talk too. I got a DM for you to slide in here on Reddit.

587,danielr088,1561001677,2,"I started feeling exceptionally lonely last September. I realized this girl, I at least thought, I was close with no longer wanted anything to do with me and I had no clue why. We would do so many things together all the time. For months following this I'd just stay home after school and basically would lay in my room for hours until it was time for bed. It started driving me crazy. In late December/early January, I decided to get back into the gym (I had quit that August) so I'd have something to do. I also had been feeling self-conscious about my body because I'm skinny. Now after 6-7 months of consistently going, I'm finally starting to see results on my chest and arms!!!! Hopefully my body will look appealing to a girl if I ever get one.

I usually only went to the gym three times a week so I needed something else to fill in the other two days. My school had been offering to take a free college class at the nearby community college after school twice a week. I decided I could use that as an opportunity to possibly make new friends so I signed up for the classes. While I didn't end up making any friends there, I had an excellent, passionate professor, learned something interesting (nutrition) and I earned three college credits at the end of the semester with a B-!!!

These past few weeks have been difficult, the person I cared for a lot left me. The THIRD time in my life and it really fucking hurt. It sucks when you barely give a shit about anything except for a few thing and that thing just ups and leaves you without a care. I'm about to graduate in a week and looking back, I feel like I went to the wrong HS and was robbed of my high school experience. I barely clicked with anyone at my school. And on top of that, now that Summer break has essentially begun, I'm about to feel even more lonely. Despite all of this, I've been actively look for things to do to occupy myself these days because being home all day literally drives me crazy. Yesterday I decided to go into the city and sign up for a youth recreation center that seems to have cool programs and opportunities to meet new people. I'm going to be checking them out soon. Hopefully I finally meet new people and make real friends. Today I also starting going through the process of getting signed up for a paid internship program. Maybe that’ll be another oppurtunity as well 🤷🏾‍♂️

As much as I'm wallowing in my sorrows a little bit with this post, I think it's also a success story in a way. My feeling of loneliness pushed me to get back into the gym and take the college class.

So that generally leaves me making impulsive actions to “find someone” to give me attention - whether it be drunk as fuck at the bar, or occasionally when I download bumble or just sitting in a coffee shop hoping to grab even just eye contact with someone I can imagine in my head is “interested” in me.

I miss having someone special to look forward to talking to. I have friends that love me, sure. But that’s not the attention that feeds the beast &amp; loneliness. My dire need for love gets the best of me &amp; into trouble. Progress not perfection. I’m counting my blessings I’m not currently in a state where I just want to be blacked out wasted or desperately scrolling through dating sites grabbing onto anything that will give me that feeling....

SO..... here I am.

And why?
Because of the way you look at me?
Because it feels good to be wanted?
To be wrapped in your arms.
I hate that I can’t help but think of you constantly.

She hasn't gotten the divorce yet but is already dating someone else. 

So that means that most of the few friends I have are married or dating and now my soon to be ex-wife is dating someone else. I'm pretty much the only person I know that isn't with someone.

603,internetmop,1560990211,0,My boyfriend and I have been together for four years and he has never had trouble making friends he’s always been pretty popular but it’s the complete opposite with me. We have the humor where we can kind of say anything to each other and not get offended but I had introduced him to my new and only girl friend I have had in a really long time . I get super lonely because I am homeschooled and don’t have the best luck making and keeping friends. She ended up acting very weird when we hung out that night telling my boyfriend she wanted to “eat him out” and telling her I talk shit about him and I had her over to spend the night and she told my mom I wanted to be a PORNSTAR.. so soon after all this I ended up breaking off our friendship and keeping all the clothes she left at my house ..lol. Not long after this whole “ordeal” my boyfriend and I were at the park and he made a bet with me I couldn’t make and keep a friend for at least one month. It’s been like two months and the conversation of me being lonely has come up a few times and me telling him how much I miss him because he lives an hour away from me. Somewhere in this conversation I just remember him saying the words “well yeah I mean I don’t want you to be a loser with no friends” and those words have been eating me alive day after day as I’m in my house spending my summer all alone with no friends to talk or hangout with.

606,ThisIs-Not-MyName,1560985163,3,"I've (M26) been living across the sea from my family now for over 7 years. For the past 3 years I've been feeling alone in, always in the house and even when my wife (F26) is at home it's like I'm still all by myself. 
With that I had to make the hard decision that the marriage wasn't for me and I'm moving out in a couple weeks. I've decided to stay on this side of the sea as I have my career here and back home there would only be a life of darkness (drink and drugs).
A few months back I met this person (F24) on a new team that I joined temporarily, she was a little off with me and because I was sitting facing her I thought it was going to be a tough few months.  With everything I already had going on, now I'm going to feel awkward at my place of work?! 
Each day I'd go in to work, make some effort and ask how her evening was, what she had for dinner and small things like what show was she watching on TV at the time.
After a few weeks the small conversations turned into talking about life events that were coming up and started to joke and laugh with each other.
So I got the idea of asking her and a friend (M29) from my original team to go for drinks on a night out and also asked them to invite a friend of theirs each.  I really just wanted to get out of the house and change my environment, put on my happy mask elsewhere for a few hours.
They said yes and agreed it would be a good idea.  When we went out I talked to the awkward girl the whole night and laughed so much that I didn't need to have a mask on. The next day I had a text from her saying she had a good night and from that I replied, I don't think we have stopped texting and talking since. 
We have built up a friendship in the space of few months that you would think we had for years and we could fully trust to tell each other secrets without having to worry.
I told her about my loneliness and depression, for the first time in my life I've had someone take the time to understand it instead of saying ""it will be ok, you should see a doctor"".
When I met my this girl I thought we would never hold a conversation never mind becoming best friends. I wasn't searching for this friendship, life just gave it to me. So don't lose hope, I fully believe life has a plan for us that we can't control and eventually we will all meet someone that will help us get through life by giving us back hope even if it's just for a short period of time. 

On that note, goodnight everyone, I send you all of my love and I hope things work out for every single one of you.

Ps. Meeting this new friend has nothing to do with how my marriage has worked out. There has been a problem there a lot longer than a few months and I don't look at my new friend in that kind of way.

660,Crocks098,1560907554,2,So a few months ago a lot changed with my dynamics with friends. At first I had a lot of great friends that I had known for a while and really trusted and cared about and would do anything for. But just recently for no known reason to me pretty much all of them just stopped talking to me and began to avoid me and not want to be around me at all. So then when all of that was going on me and 4 other guys reconnected and became very close all of a sudden but we’ve all known each other for a few years. The first few months of this new friend group were amazing. We hung out multiple times per week and just chilled with each other and had a blast and it made me super happy to have that closeness with a group of friends. But ever since my summer started about 2 weeks ago it has gone completely downhill. I know people say this a lot but I truly feel like the “friend” in the group that no one really wants in it anymore but there’s not really a way to like get rid of me in a way because of how established the group is. Every time we go to hang out or make plans it feels like whenever I’m involved everyone gets bummed out and makes me feel like such a buzzkill. Actually just today I was talking with one of them that I’m probably closest with(or at least I thought I was) and he straight up told me that whenever we are hanging out that I am a buzzkill to the group. And also recently it feels like I’ve lost the closeness with them it seems like all of them have so much in common and they all have this connection with each other but they suddenly just left me out of all of that so I feel very disconnected from all of them and like I’m not even a part of their friendship anymore. So yeah sorry if this seemed disorganized or didn’t make sense I was just kinda typing out whatever came to mind and just wanted to say it somewhere and get it off my mind. Thanks.,lonely,I thought I had great friends but I was wrong and in reality I have no friends,2019-06-19 11:25:54
661,hamartiated,1560907400,5,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

670,lunadeluxee,1560901201,1,"BTW this is my first post ever on reddit so idk if I'm doing this right

I recently ended a 1 1/2 year relationship with who I thought was the love of my life. Then a month later, my best friend moved away. Then, all of my friends at work quit the job I'm working at. Next 2 of my other best friends moved. I still have friends, but I cherish the close relationships to having many surface friendships.

I used to spend all my time with my ex. We worked together when we met so we shared a lot of mutual friends. We then after work, would plan to do something for all of our time off, whether that be traveling, hiking, going out, seeing shows, or going to the beach. I spent so much time with him, that when the relationship ended I became so afraid of being alone again. It was a toxic relationship that nearly ruined my confidence so I don't feel ready or attractive enough to date right now even though I no longer have feelings for him.

So I went out with my girls a lot after we broke up, luckily at that time I still had a lot of girlfriends in the area to hang out with, but my closest ones moved away shortly after.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I moved to this town only a month prior to dating my ex, so I never got the chance to really expand myself and figure out how to be alone in this town. It's a small mountain town so it's very hard to meet people unless you know them already, people are very friendly but also very flakey and keep to themselves for the most part. It's also very transient, people come and go with the season and move frequently. The close friends I still have here are amazing and I love them a lot, but they have very different schedules than me so it's near impossible to see them. So I've been left spending all my days off alone. I've got back into working out which is great, but I feel this deep emptiness like a void that I can't seem to fill. I feel like my life has turned upside down. I went from having all of these amazing people in my life to having hardly anyone. I know it'll get better. It's hard for me to want to go out right now, in case I run into my ex or any of his friends since it's such a small town. The times I have gone out, I've ran into his friends who I like but I no longer want to have contact with because I can't bare to see him anymore. 

I've never felt so alone or so sad before. I'm having trouble coping with this. I recently just left my job too to pursue another place hoping I'll meet new people, but it is a small staff and they are mostly guys, one who is even a close friend of my ex. I know I just need to meet new people and get out there, but it's so hard and I am lacking the confidence and motivation to do so at the moment. It sucks, because its summer and most of the stuff to do here is outside and fun for groups of people, I can do things alone and I do, but I feel insecure when I see groups of people having fun when I'm all alone wishing I wasn't.

She goes to sleep way earlier than I do, and I end up sitting on the couch with our dog and watching tv before eventually taking a shot of zquil and going to sleep. She and I don’t speak the same love language but we’ve managed to understand each other’s and try to work with what we have. I know that she loves me and I love her, but we’re different than when we started dating. I mean, Obviously as you get older you change and that’s normal. I just didn’t expect to feel so alone in my married life. A few weeks ago we were talking before she went to bed and she told me that we don’t have anything in common anymore, all of the things we used to do when we first got together have fallen to the wayside. For example, when we met, I was in a band and playing shows regularly, and we would read together and go on random adventures and have long discussions; now those parts of our relationship have dwindled down to us barely enjoying the same tv shows. So I’ve tried to make an effort to pick up my guitar more, and to try and read around her more and spark some interesting discussions, all to no avail. It always ends up with me, on my couch, alone at night. I got off work early today and expected to spend some time together when she got home and we talked for about 15 minutes, she then took a bath and went to the bedroom to lay down saying she was tired. I went to go lay down with her and she asked if I would go to the living room because I’d be on my phone and keep her awake. So I’m in the living room browsing reddit and feeling lonely. Which is not unusual at this point. I don’t want a divorce or a hook up or anything like that. I’m not here to emotionally cheat with someone over the internet, I just don’t want to feel alone in my own home. Obviously you folks aren’t gonna hear every single detail about my life, I won’t bore you with that. But the gist is that no matter what I do, I feel like every day I’m moving farther and farther away from the closeness I expected out of building a life with the person I love. It’s becoming harder and harder to deal with, and when I bring it up, I’m met with what feels like annoyance. I don’t know. Either way, If you’ve read this far, I appreciate your time. If you have any advice, I will be appreciative of that too.",lonely,Marriage isn’t what I expected. (Not looking for hookups or ANYTHING like that) just venting.,2019-06-19 09:19:37

I have one friend who lives like 6 hours away, I work from home, I live with my dad but we don’t talk, I never go anywhere except to get my hair cut but I don’t really talk to the guy because I don’t know how to, I try to comfort myself with movies but most of the time they just make me feel worse because I look around and have nobody to discuss them with, I wanna be an author but I have too much anxiety to actually sit down and write, I’m slipping deeper into depression the older I get (26) and I’m reaching my breaking point, now there’s temptation to cut myself, starve myself, anything just to punish myself for putting myself in this position. I mean it’s my fault, right? Nobody forced that shit down my throat and I got myself into a situation where the only solution was to stay inside until my friends forgot about me. I thought I was in love last year but it didn’t work out, now I don’t believe in love anymore. I don’t think I’m making it to 27. I have a dream of exactly how I want my life to be, and it’s not even unreasonable or impossible but my outlook on life leads me to believe it’s just fantasy. It’s really simple stuff too like a successful career, marriage, daughter, cats, all that. But I’m absolutely convinced that I don’t deserve it.

I was recently in a long-distance relationship, and he left me for another girl in the middle of our wedding arrangements and in the middle of my immigration arrangements to move to his country to be with him and get married. Every time I try to make friends, people get bored of me or ignore me. I am 29 and feel like I have already missed the bus with getting engaged and getting married. At my age the dating pool is small and most guys are already taken. People always say to enjoy being single. But I can't enjoy being single when I have absolutely no friends to hang out with and nobody to talk to. People also tell me to concentrate on myself, but I have been doing that for most of my life as I have mostly been single. It makes me feel angry and sad whenever I see someone showing off their engagement ring, wedding pictures, or wedding dresses. I have to go everywhere and do everything alone. I live in a small city so opportunities to meet new people are very limited. I also feel like people don't get to know me properly before writing me off as a friend or love interest. It's very frustrating and I have so much anxiety over my future. Because of my anxiety I can't eat because my stomach is always hurting, and I am down to 90 lbs.

I'll admit that I didn't really put in the effort then, or maybe I did what I could at the time. I'm just so bad at talking to new people, even online through text, much less so in voice chat.

&amp;#x200B;

Socially, I had veered off the beaten path a long time ago. You could consider me a ""shut-in"", except that I can leave my house. Started work 2 years ago. Moving through different temporary positions. I'm on my 3rd one now. Monetarily I think I'm fine for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

Things at work are okay. I think I do my job well enough. It is people that I always have trouble with, and by trouble, I don't mean it like I don't get on with them. I think I just seem so uninteresting that it wouldn't be worth the effort talking to me. I would and I do try to engage with others but what is there to talk about when there is no common ground? No shared experiences, things to relate with, apart from vapid things like shows, or video-games, which I do enjoy talking about, I just don't want it to be the only thing I can talk about, y'know? Years of social isolation really doesn't help in gaining talking points, or experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's more is that my colleagues primarily speak a another language. I live in a ""multi-cultural"" city and while being a part of the ""majority race"", I do not speak the mother tongue. It's an issue here being monolingual. I think I have a pretty unique perspective regarding that. Constant feeling of unbelonging. Having no tribe.

&amp;#x200B;

It really does me no favors that I am a quiet person. (i guess no shit at this point..) I get called ""quiet"" all the time. It saddens me that it's the first impression I make on people, even in the times that I do try. The irony is that I could probably talk about ""real shit"" for days.

Anyway, I will be 23 this year and I don't want the rest of my life to go to waste. I am tired of using dissociation as a coping mechanism for work. I want to save myself. I feel like trying.

I'm a 22 year old dude named Michael from Florida. I'm pretty shy IRL and I'm generally pretty introverted aside for people I know. Like one on one I'm pretty outgoing and I make TONS of dumb jokes and silly voices and whatnot but when I get into groups of like 3 or 4 or more I tend to clam up.

I'm working on improving my life right now and I don't feel comfortable dating someone right now due to the fact I just don't feel like I""m good enough.

I also value someone with a sense of humor. Like my sense of humor is a bit silly. I make dumb voices and make dumb jokes and curse like a sailor when I'm joking around and I want someone who can appreciate that and also be able to make me laugh.

703,Owmyflushot,1560850579,363,"I see posts where someone says some version of “I’m lonely,” and then several people reply with some version of “me too,” and that’s about it.

I also see some version of “I want to talk,” and people reply “me too.” And that’s it.

Okay folks, new formula. Try this:

(Specific thing) made me feel lonely today. What can I do about it? (Or, “Does anyone else experience that?)

That gives people something to talk about. And ta-da, everyone feels more connected. Also try this:

I wish I had someone to talk to. Would anyone like to talk about (insert thing)? 

Then, for lonely lurkers, try asking the OP about the thing, even if it’s not that i interesting (at first). That will help all parties feel less lonely, plus is it social skills training for the real world.

I got over it, but I felt lonely. I lost touch with the few friends because they would bring back the memories of old days and I could not think about it. I went online dating and met a lady who had a past that I found out later and could not accept. I tried to get out of the relationships without luck because she was a bit desperate of getting married. And I got her pregnant one day. Under the pressure, we got married but there were a lot of fights. I got arrested for Domestic Violence and spent a night in jail for the first time. She had an abortion and we became separated. We are going though a divorce now. I will be alone again. I go to work 60 miles away every weekday. I don’t really connect with many people there.

714,maxipadsforeveryone,1560835026,2,"I’ve never had aspirations, even as a kid I didn’t I kinda just went with the flow. I’m used to just doing school work that’s thrown at me. I mean i’m still only 15 now so i’ve got a little bit of time left to “figure things out” but I just don’t know.

I kept getting panic attacks from regular school so I did a program similar to homeschool this year through Apex Learning. That stuff was just a mess of boringness. I never even got through all my classes this year and the instructor didn’t even care. 

I somewhat liked the learning aspect of school (unless it involves math) but my anxiety and depression drove me away from regular school. My dad is trying to get me to go back to school next year but I’m not sure what i’m doing yet. I have selective mutism so I can’t talk to anyone i’m not comfortable with plus I had no friends at school (yes i’ve tried therapy and meds.)

It’s summertime now and i’ve been very isolated and sad. I’ve been hiding in my room all day reading, playing videogames, or watching tv. I have no hobbies other than that. I tried playing violin for 3 years but it never really worked out. Tried playing piano too but I sucked at it I just didn’t understand it. Not great when it comes to sports either.

I never really enjoy hanging out with people anymore. Well the only people i’ve been hanging around with for the past few years are my dad and brother. Anyone else makes me so anxious that I can’t even speak.

It’s not that I don’t like people it’s just I like them from a distance. I’ve always had a fascination for celebrities. Well I guess a lot of people do but for me it’s because I don’t really have anyone else. They are lowkey like my friends in some way. This sounds like the saddest shit but sometimes I imagine them hugging me to sleep because otherwise i’ll feel sad and lonely.

Everytime I see a documentary or interview about a celebrity they had a spark in them from when they were a child. Whether they were born gifted in music, acting or whatever. I’ve never had that. I can’t think of anything from my childhood that could lead to a future career. As I kid I kinda just got through life everyday because it’s what i’m supposed to do. I don’t really think much about the future.

My depression and anxiety have completely taken away my personality. I’m the most boring vanilla gal who has nothing to bring to a conversation. Only thing I ever really want to talk about are celebrities I like but I hold it in from not wanted to sound self centered.",lonely,not going anywhere in life,2019-06-18 15:17:06

As the title states, I'm a 40 yr old single father with custody of my children, I work full time, my kids are into sports, I coach youth football, and I'm lonely as hell. I recently moved over to a neighboring town where i know no one and this is a VERY small area, eastern Kentucky. Been single for quite some time now and tried looking on dating sites, PoF, Zoosk, Match, etc etc and that seems like an absolute waste of time. So i guess what I'm looking for is some insight from other single custodial fathers, or anyone really, as to how you break the trend of work, family time, then bed. Where do you fit in self time and how do you find people to date? My kids are my world and we have a ton of fun together, yet i yearn for adult conversation and the touch of a date, friend, lover.

I'm Jake, I'm 21 and I live in the UK.

There isn't much to say about me, i'm a musician but i have trouble leaving my house due to Social anxiety and Depression. I messed up High School, College and Uni and thanks to Anxiety i have trouble working. I also like Dark humour, the darker the better.

I'm preferably looking for someone:

In the UK although i am happy to talk to people from all over.

Age range of 18-24

Who can give regular conversation (i don't do anything so I have a lot of free time)

I'm a big gamer, pretty much constantly playing, I'm on Ps4 and I typically go for Single Player/RPG games (Going through the South Park games and Evil Within 2) I'm also trying to get into co-op as well so if you're on Ps4 let me know we can get a game going on something.

I like Reading and Writing, My favourite author being H.P Lovecraft and favourite story is Shadow Over Innsmouth. I'm trying to write a book atm loosely based around cosmic horror but with more of an old school Satanist vibe about it, and i also write songs though they rarely turn out well.

For films I love old cult Comedy/Horrors, Evil Dead and FrankenHooker are two of my favourites i also like watching through the Video Nasties occasionally. For TV i watch some American shows on Netflix (Riverdale, Sabrina and AHS mainly) but mostly i watch British comedy shows (Bottom, TaskMaster, Big Fat Quiz, Peep Show, IT Crowd etc.) If you're into any of these maybe we could try and watch some together through Rabbit.

With Music I tend to stick with Progressive Rock (Camel, YES, Comus, Jeff Wayne, Mike Oldfield etc.) but i do listen to bits of other stuff as well I'll leave a link to a Spotify playlist for you to have a gander at. Music is quite big to me, it helps me get through a lot so if you like talking music then that would be great.

Link: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/36oUOaC4K75OJDt0XsuIwK](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/36oUOaC4K75OJDt0XsuIwK)

In summary , just looking for someone round my age, Preferably UK based and is free to chat a fair amount through the week, maybe even meeting IRL some point way down the line if we get on enough (i'm not too fussed about this though)

Obviously having similar interests would be best but i am also open to learning new things and i'm happy to talk about anything (If i could find someone maybe religious to have discussions about that with would be great, I'm don't really have a religion myself)

Cheers for reading and have a nice day!

754,dramaqueen2408,1560761062,0,"TL;DR: my depressed boyfriend pushed everyone away including his family and me. He thinks we are toxic. How can I help? 

Hi,

My boyfriend has suffered from anxiety and depression after I left him as my visa expired. I have been trying to help him for 5 months and he was on and off. We have distance so it is very hard as he is always run away.

He had depression before he met me. We were happy and I was his motivation before he turned to blame me who caused him depression again.

He has a scar from his childhood (from his mum) which mainly caused his mental health issues. His family doesn’t support him at all but they still keep contact until 2 days ago I guess. He finally decided to tell them all the reasons why he got depression, it came from his mom (he accidentally observed she cheated on his dad). His brothers and sisters turned their backs on him as they think he was just talking shit and the problem was not that bad, said that he was lazy and had an easy life. They now blocked each others in all means.

He has been suffering from that problems recently and at the same time he told me he doesn’t love me anymore and doesn’t want to see me again even I have completed my documents to come back to him. In the past, he loved me very much, more than himself, even he had to die to show me his love. He is spending a lot of money when he didn’t care and didn’t spend much on things in the past. The only thing he spent a big amount of money on was for his music equipments. He got fired from his job as he was always late as well. He has been rushed to see girls, I guess to replace me in his heart, but it makes me more worried, as it proves that he is loving me but that love is deeply in pain, even though he is still doing everything normally. 

I know people dont choose to be depressed. I got depression from him, but I am okay now, I am doing well and I want to back him up even he says that he doesn’t love me anymore. Probably it sounds stupid to choose to stay with him instead of just leaving and having my better life. But I know deep down inside, he is still loving me hurtfully, need me and wants to be loved.

Okay, so, I’m in my 30s, and this guy is in his 30s. He has a lot of low self-esteem issues (which are totally whack, because he’s handsome and smart and kind and wonderful).

He had a gf. It’s only his second GF ever, and he hadn’t even had a GF until he was in his 30s. She is gorgeous, smart, had a good job, and she lives about 1,000 miles away. He is such an avoidant person that he won’t move to be with her. But he says he loves her and they talk all the time. They also fly to see each other every couple of months or so.

Anyway, we used to work together, and when we worked together, he would follow me around like a magnet, and he also would text me a lot and ask for my help on things a lot. But he also made sure that when we hung out that it was never something that could be construed as a “date.”

When I told him about how I had a fling with a coworker, he asked me all about it, and he also urged me to cut contact (because this other guy had used me and was abusive). Then, when I said I had found a guy on Tinder to go on a date with, he asked me all about it in a seemingly anxious way.

He used to do things to take care of me: bring me snacks, save me a seat in meetings, rush to end conversations with other people so he could walk with me. Sometimes he would come find me for no reason and just hover around me. Other times when I was sitting near him, he’s get super uncomfortable and tell me he had to leave and then he’d vanish for a bit. So odd.

I can’t tell if this guy is in to me and is just really, really shy, or if he just really likes having me as a friend and it comes off like he’s in to me, or if he doesn’t like me at all and he just pities me and acts like he is a friend. Or maybe he just has really bad anxiety so he was clingy with me when we worked together. Or maybe he’s just such an avoidant person that he’s too insecure to keep reaching out since we aren’t coworkers anymore?

Now that we don’t work together, there isn’t much excuse for him to reach out, and I don’t want to be weird and bug him for no reason. But gosh, I miss him SO much. He was so kind and interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

August 2016 - I move to Spain to study abroad for a year. Everything's going great, making loads of cool new friends and having a pretty good social life. I've always been a weed smoker but it was just easier to get over there so a once-in-a-while habit turned into a can't-live-without-it kind of thing. I'd literally stay in my room from whatever time I woke up until whatever time I fell back asleep just smoking. I think I just liked how it made me feel like.. not a person. Anyway as you can probably guess this fucked me up mentally. This destructive behaviour culminated in me getting a bad case of food poisoning and ending up in the hospital. In Spain. Alone. Attempted suicide. Next day, I called my mum and told her everything, and she flew out to come and get me. What a legend. 

&amp;#x200B;

March 2017 - Back home, lowest point of my life. Crying every day for no reason, completely isolating myself. Sometimes I'd be completely catatonic. Like, I could hear my mum's voice but something in my head told me not to move or make a sound. Kind of scary actually. After a few months of medication I finally start feeling better. Decide to get a job at a local bar. 

&amp;#x200B;

August 2017 - Life is finally getting back on track! You know why? Because I have my first ever boyfriend! He's funny and... actually, he was just funny. I didn't see it like that at the time but hindsight is 20/20 I guess. As the human brain is wont to do, I start convincing myself that this boyfriend is the reason I got better. Of course he was! It totally wasn't my already-fucked-up-brain making arbitrary associations! Obviously! Anyway, I was getting better and it was (apparently) all because of him. I convinced myself that what we had was love. Yeah, he'd make me have sex when I didn't want to, and yeah, he'd belittle me and make nasty jokes about my body to our coworkers, but he said that was love and who was I to argue?! 

&amp;#x200B;

September 2017 - He raped me. He then told everyone we worked with that I'd made up a story about him raping me and not to believe it. He also told everyone about the suicide attempt. Who would believe the crazy girl, right?! I quit.

&amp;#x200B;

November 2017 - Finishing my last year of University. 10th best University in the world. Not a brag, just a lot of fucking pressure. I stop talking to friends. Even when they reached out to me, I couldn't bring myself to reply. They all eventually drop off the radar. My fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

September 2018 - At least I graduated, right?! Not a terrible GPA, not a great one. But I did it! I have a degree! Now what?

&amp;#x200B;

June 2019 - I've been unemployed since September. I've got a great degree, but no friends, no job and no money. I live at home with my parents and my cat. I don't talk to anyone. I stay in bed all day and watch youtube videos. I'm trying to come to terms with all of this but I honestly don't know how. I can't even get an entry level admin job because I have no experience. I speak four languages and have an IQ of 129. What the fuck is the point of all of that if I can't afford to do an unpaid internship?

I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

Currently on the usual suspsects, (have been for about 6 years, give or take) Tinder and Bumble and have only met up with one girl, that never really worked out. 

I get about a match every other day on average, but I just never have the will to persue anyone, more so of late. Like I match people that I am phsically attracted to but cant really bare the though of having to deal with all the small talk + Im really bad at starting/holding conversations when speaking to new people. This stems from previous interactions on said platforms that never really leads anywhere. 

I have never approached a female in a social setting, really dont think i ever will, I just think that is weird/cringey. Im also a virgin which holds me back alot, I mean 25 years old and never even slept with anyone, thats awkward to even type that out. Safe to say noone is really aware that is the case. I feel everyone just presumes that I have been intimate. I wouldnt say im much of a looker nor that im particularly ugly, just a normal guy.

I've always made it clear that I will drop everything to help out or be available to listen and when I commit to hanging out, I show up.

I've never really thought about it at length before but I guess I've come to realize that while I put my friends as priority number one, I am no one's first priority, especially now that my friends all have spouses and businesses. I'm almost always the one who has to instigate a hang out and if I don't I won't hear from them for weeks on end. And when we do make plans I often find them getting cancelled last minute, or find my friends needing to bail partway through die to family or business.

790,alienOsc,1560709781,8,"A couple of years ago I had anorexia and I hated anything that was related to food. I managed to starve myself to an unhealthy weight, to isolate myself from everyone and to gain such hatred for my body that till this day I cannot shake off. Somehow I understood that I was literally slowly killing myself and decided to recover but instead of that I started to binge. And believe me, I binged HARD. I gained a healthy amount of weight and since I went to a mental hospital for that I stopped binging for a while but I didn't become social and I isolated myself because I think I look disgusting. Now, for a half year I just feel so lonely, so lost. 

I have (had?) a best friend who now has her own life, many friends and I don't have a place in it, even when I got hit by a car, she never asked how I was feeling, never visited me. I am the one to initiate conversations unless she needs help somewhere. My ex, who also had(has) problems with eating, now has a perfect boyfriend and amazing grades. And now I'm left alone with couple of video games (Diablo 3 is a savior tbh) and the food. Food has become a comfort for me. Since I feel a hole inside my chest, since no one(except for my family, god bless them) care about me too much, it seems like I fill it with food and at least at that moment I feel great, but the weight is getting higher and higher and the anorexic side in me is just screaming at me at full force to just stop fucking eating and get a grip of myself and just starve.

I began to volunteer in a food bank (sadly the car that hit me stopped it but in few days I'll go there again), I tried to talk with people but it seems like at the end of the day I'm left alone, that I'm just a background character in everyone's lives. I hate this feeling. No matter how hard I try to make new bonds, no matter how much I want to be confident in myself and enjoy the life as it is, everything seems hopeless. I hate the fact that I use food as a comfort but it seems like it's the only thing in my life that will never leave me, even though everyday I hate myself more and more for eating.

I had and still have friends. We met almost 10 years ago. I've never been good at meeting people but I'm glad because I've had a lot of fun with them. We've grown up together. Lately I haven't felt perfectly comfortable hanging out with them. I don't feel like I can really be myself around them. They say all those mean things to me with or without knowing they hurt me.

It’s hard not to feel as though I am never going to meet someone, or that I won’t always feel lonely.

I have this bad habit of picking people to like who are completely unavailable, either through distance, emotionally or they have a partner.  Or a weird combination of all three. 

I’m exhausted from seeking out connections only to be disappointed. 

This week I have been chatting with someone I met on reddit. His friendship has made me feel not so alone.  I never text anyone but I’m attached to my phone waiting for his replies.  He has made me feel happiness that I haven’t felt in a really long time, but it’s also really scary for me. It doesn’t matter what type of relationship, be it friendship or romantically at some point everyone leaves.  I’m expecting nothing less in this situation, for him to get bored of me, the response to slow down, the friendship die out.  The thought of that makes me so sad, I didn’t think that I could be attached to someone I have never met, and so soon.  It’s really weird for me to be feeling this way. Connecting with someone is such a rare occurrence for me, it almost never happens, yet this stranger on the internet has become the highlight of my day.  I don’t care What capacity this person is in my life I just want them in my life. His friendship really means a lot to me and that makes me feel ridiculous. 

I really don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I feel guilty for feeling lonely because I have a great life and I have amazing people in my life and still I want more. I think if the Ani Difranco song Grey, there’s a lyric that states “what kind of paradise am I looking for, I’ve got everything I want yet still I want more.”  Even romantically, if I wanted to date someone there are men locally available who like me, who would date me seriously.  Yet here I am wanting something else, someone else, something I can’t have. I feel so responsible for my own loneliness, it’s almost like I choose to feel this way, but I don’t and I can’t shake the feeling.

So, a user on here that I had been messaging for a decent while offered to buy me a gaming laptop. This was a big deal for me for a few reasons. One was the simple fact that I've never been able to game on PC because, well, my family isn't exactly well-off. One of the other reasons is, since my other PC broke (which is the one I used to play games on. It wasn't good, but it just barely worked), I haven't been able to talk with my friends for a long time. I have more online friends than offline friends, so it's been catastrophic on my mental, social, and emotional health. So, I shook at the thought of somebody being so generous. We talked a out it for a bit, I got all excited and appreciative, I asked them if they were sure they wanted to do it quite a few, of which they said yes. And then, after I had said something like ""I'm trying to comprehend if this is a troll or not"", they simply said ""Lol no I'm not a troll."" Then they didn't respond for the rest of the night, and they still haven't. I checked their comment activity and saw that they were still active after that message, so it became clear to me that I had just been tricked. That I had made a fool of myself. I know it was dumb and selfish of me, I really do know it was. But, being a teenager that nobody wants to hire, coming from a family that's always been poor, wanting to be able to experience high end gaming, and simply wanting to be able to hang with my friends again blinded me. I was an idiot. I'm even mad at her for pulling such a joke on me. I'm mad at myself for believing it and going along with it. I should know better. I'm so fucking gullible and stupid.

That weekend, I went to a party with her and a couple of her friends (my friends didn't go) and I had an absolute blast. But she wasn't there until later because she had some important stuff to do first. But I was still very happy before she got there, even though I have barely talked to the people that were at the party. Fast forward until when the party is over, I am at home once again, the sadness ensues until were texting, and then I get on a voice call with one of my best friends (from school) and I'm still sad. In fact, I'm writing this post while I'm still in the call with him. I am so, so confused on why I'm feeling so sad after me and this girl both said we liked each other. I really don't want to feel obsessed with her, and I don't think I am, because I'm happy when I'm *with pretty much anyone* in person, not just her.",lonely,I can't tell if what I'm feeling is loneliness.,2019-06-16 21:43:16

Is what constantly goes through my mind.

I have a concert next week and I'm going alone.. A part of me feels ok with that, listen to good music drink a couple beers and have a good time on the other hand is it sad that people I know are going but could take it or leave it if i hang with them? 

I'll be 28 in 2 weeks and I'm pretty lonely... And the hardest pill to swallow is that no one really cares. Ive kept myself busy with 2 jobs so I feel less alone and could concentrate on work. 

How can i make friends, I dont think I know how to be one let alone have one. It's super depressing and id rather put that energy elsewhere. It sucks to know that people you once were close with just suddenly acts different towards you without explanation.

I'm in a relationship but I feel like it's one sided. I'm a helpless/hopeless romantic while my gf isnt. Shes just always distant, one worded replies, doesnt really let me vent without sighing. Feels like I'm bothering her. At the same time I dont want to leave her because she is literally ALL I have.

“Look what he bought me”
“Like where he’s taking me”
“Look at the fancy dinner I got FOR FREE BECAUSE HE PAYS FOR EVERYTHING”
I’ve been supportive
I’ve been open and tried in numerous occasions to talk to her about what annoys me
But she doesn’t understand

I’m a single parent, with lots of financial struggles. I’ve explained how although I’m happy for her, I don’t want to hear about his money, or the things he’s buying her, or how she doesn’t have to worry about money because he decided to just come along and pay for her life-
Yet she wants me to come celebrate HIS new house that she will “one day move into”
Or celebrating how HE DECIDED TO PAY for the repairs on her car 
Or hearing about their 100th concert this summer that she’s so glad he gave her his credit card so she could buy them all month and months ago

I finally just stopped talking to her
I’m so sad
But I’m tired of fighting jealousy/ of feeling icky inside or feeling like I have to compare- and let me tell you- as a single parent, recently divorced, and also recently rejected by any attempt to move on... I just could t take it anymore

I’ve tried to talk to her- but she literally just doesn’t understand that I don’t want to hear about her stupid boyfriend all day long.

814,heisntlikeothergirls,1560671606,1,"I want to be pretty short and sweet about the way I have been feeling for a while. But first a handful of relevant details about me - I am male, heterosexual, single, and of moderately lower age so ""between 17 an 27"" should do it. Trying not to be too specific lest a potential friend is choosy based on some of these things. I am seeking friends my age to help get me through the summer. I like both guys and girls, but I do seem to feel more comfortable around girls and I never found out why.  So, if that helps any lonely females out there I'm a pretty harmless human being, I like to chat and converse it's one of the great joys I have in life. I believe friendship is about loyalty and bonding, making memories - and once you have me, you basically have me for life I am like a pet I'd do anything for you, haha.   


Why am I lonely, I'll keep it simple and avoid self pity - most of it is temporary - I'm away from family this summer and I have some mood/anxiety issues that hold me back in a lot of ways. So for an example, some roommates of mine might want to go do \[insert activity\] but I wind up talking myself out of it. This happens a lot. And I get friends telling me stuff like ""you're on a different path from mine"" which is heartbreaking because it amounts to friend-dumping! I said I'd avoid self-pity, so OK - ""lonely because"" - well, mainly because of some of that and the fact that I do have a disability. I try not to let it deplete my potential in life but reality bites  and you know.. And finally, I have have some past trauma I'm dealing with also that has surfaced recently and been part of my anxiety as well, Sounds like a handful, I know. But we all have our issues and we all want to get better. I'm here for you guys and I'm just looking for a friend myself. So try me, maybe - and you never know.

I'm 19 and about to graduate with my 2 year degree while I'm working in retail and I feel like I haven't had a true friend in forever. Nobody ever texts me or invites me anywhere and it just makes me feel like theres something wrong with me. I get the feeling that I'm annoying, stupid, and over share when I get nervous in conversations. Because of all the social anxiety I get, it makes me even more boring than I already am. I never get out and do anything and I'm stuck in an extremely small town where theres absolutely nothing to do but go to the lake or get fucked up on the weekends. Without friends I just stay at the house watching netflix, playing video games, and hanging out with my weird family and they never do anything either. I've been smoking pot to deal with my boredom, loneliness, and depression.

Anyways is there anything you guys do to cope with loneliness or do you guys have suggestions as to what I should be doing? Keep in mind, theres not much to do around here.

816,iveyjbdeykj478vu,1560668045,2,"Idea! I’m gonna break down these quotes I took note of and why they might be important to me. This should be interesting... “It’s usually the people that want it the least that need it the most.” Not sure where I came up with that, and I know it’s not true for a lot of situations, but I mean, idk... next. “The taller they stand the harder they fall.” Ah, this is a quote from the Dishonored credits song. I do believe that to be true. The more you have, the more there is to lose. “Don’t be the person you think people want you to be, be the person that allows others to be who they want to be.” Quoted from Michael Steven’s (Vsauce) Ted talk. I was really trying to think of ways to be more social at the time and this quote really caught my eye. I do believe it to be true but if you try to apply it consciously it won’t turn out the way you want it to. “When we find a problem, we never look back and say “One chance, one moment, it’s gone so easily...”” This is from Here I am by The Explosion. This line in their song hit me hard in the feels reminding me of all my regrets in my life so far. “If you spend too much time trying to prove to someone that you’re trustworthy, you may forget that they have to prove they’re trustworthy as well.” This is one I came up with, and I feel I could word it better, but it gets the point across. “A life not lived is not a life worth living.” Came up with that after reading Into the Wild and relating with Chris. “Sometimes the little things start closing in on me. When I’m feeling down, I wanna lose that frown. I stick my head out the window and I look around. Those clouds don’t scare me, they can’t disguise this magic that’s happening right before my eyes.” Tried to cheer myself up with this line from the Spongebob song Best Day Ever. “Your dark defines your light.” From Chronic Future’s Time and Time Again. Showing one side of yourself generally defines everything about you to someone. “Hindsight is co-standard with rose colored lenses.” Kind of modified quote from a song. 10 points if you guess the song. At least in my version of that line it’s saying that you always look at your past as being ‘the good times’. “We’re all tied talk when push comes to shove.” Another modified quote, another 10 points if you can guess the song. In my version it’s saying that when things start getting out of control being verbal won’t get you anywhere. “There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it” I do believe I got this from a thread here on Reddit. All I can say is that life indeed sucks. “There is a certain solace in silence.” I think this is mine. Trying to find peace with being lonely.

817,iveyjbdeykj478vu,1560667316,3,"Here in this post lies another random expression of my lonely life these past couple weeks. I use the term lonely vaguely because I’m not “lonely” in the physical sense. I have family all around me that wishes to support me, and a friend back in my hometown. But mentally I feel isolated. Anyway, i have had some glimmers of hope for my future recently. Friend of a friend told me I wasn’t completely ugly. I’ll take it. Family says I’ve lost weight even though I’m pretty sure I’ve stayed the same. I’ll take it. I was finally able to give my family an answer to the “What do you want to do” question. I’ll take it. Now I just have to work off of the motivation I’ve been given and improve myself even more. // I’ve noticed something... my online persona is a complete 180 of myself. I present myself as a female in most if not all video games that allow me to do so. I don’t catfish or anything, i just like using the opportunity to not be me for a while. This has recently caused some trouble though and I’m still not sure how to handle it. I met some players on a game i like and they know me as the female that doesn’t talk (for obvious reasons). Well now they wish to get to know me better and make me a part of their staff team on the server they run in the game, which I would love to do. If I told them the truth I obviously wouldn’t be trusted to be staff, and if I leave them in the dark they will never know me any better than this persona that can only go so far. So yea...  here btw, forgot to mention that. // Relationships! Aren’t those fun? I wouldn’t know. Senior year in high school and the only one I’ve had ended as quickly as it started. I have a huge crush on a cheerleader. Rip. Time to play a game of “How long will it take to move on from this girl that has no interest in you whatsoever??” Love that one. Goin on 2 years, i might beat some records. If you want more details and backstory on me and this girl read “Interesting title #2” (maybe #3?). I feel like I’m trying way too hard to get a girl. Anyone got some hobbies I can distract myself with? Any advice to avoid future headaches? // Anyone here a fan of Ratchet and Clank, Burnout 3, My Babysitters a Vampire, Soeedcubing, Legend of the Guardians, the Legend book series, or SAO? Oh speaking of which I am one cheesy mf when it comes to romance shit because I love animes like SAO, Toradora, Angel Beats, etc. They really hit home with what I’d look for in a relationship... you know, without all the trapped in game worlds, afterlives, and shitty situations stuff.",lonely,“Interesting title #6”,2019-06-16 16:41:56

820,clank999,1560661513,3,"Hello redditors this is my first time ever on the platform. Basically I am going through a whole lot at the moment like everyone I don't want to seem like I am looking for attention I just have absolutely nobody to speak to or who would care enough to listen. 

Ok I don't know where to begin pretty much I come from a 3rd world country my father was a drug addict fool who was lost in the street life from a young age as all of his brothers are being 4 brothers and 8 girl siblings yeah a real big family of 14. I come from a 2 sibling family with enough trouble as it is so I can only begin to comprehend what he lived through as well for what I have at least come to know about thanks to my mother and my fathers long arguments that usually ended up with violence and the cops being called. It wasn't regulat violence my earliest memory of the first incidents involved him chasing me my older sister and mother down with a butcher knife which he proceeded to chuck at my mother and miss by a hair and hit a tree next to her head, another involved him kidnapping me and my sister and another time at a large party he started a fight between a man he believed to have been having adultery with my mother I remember it very vividly because my mother fainted at the hostess house all these incidents are very few to the many that later came but these are to mention the ones that happened in my early memories from 3-6 years old. I come from a long line of pedophiles and degenerates basically all I heard growing up during some of the arguments between my parents was about my dads childhood abuse how he was molested by his father same as the rest of his siblings many of my aunts will deny it because my grandfather has built pretty good wealth and the whole family just vultures over it and would rather keep their silence then bring themselves justice. My father would tell me many storys about how my grandfather would chain him down outside of the house to prevent him from runing away my father was a very troubled kid and there for acted out with vicious violence getting involved in street fights and gang brawls at partys. This is all pretty confirmed since he was kicked out by my grandfather when he was 16 at this point he had also been shot at plenty of times and actually hit once in the butt where he still has the bullet in to this day he also had about 4 or 6 of his original teeth left he had almost all of them kicked in by a guy in his neighborhood who had steel tow boots on so he was forced to illegally come to the US but besides all the trouble he was regularly in he had also gotten my mother pregnant at that time with my older brother who was miscarried 4 months into the pregnancy. Basically that is a short breef story on my father.  Now on to my mother she was also from a large family 7 siblings or 6 I believe from two different fathers it was her a younger brother and an older sister from the same father and then an older brother and two more sisters from another father who were both absent fathers throughout all of the childrens lifes so my grandmother her mother was left to fend off for them with what little she could. My mother comes from even more poverty then my father money is truly an evil thing when left in the wrong hands growing up my father would always repent that me and my sister were not his children but his siblings and that my father was really my grandfather I do not know if this is true and will probably never find out. I am an exact replica copy of my father but my mother looks alot like his mother my grandmother so I really don't know the answer just from comparison because it is very possible that he could've been telling the truth all this time. I do not know if my mother went through any sexual abuse like my father but mental and other type of physical abuse I am sure of. After my dad left to the US my mother mis carried and he went back for a short while went through alot of depression and eventually got my mother pregnant and had to come back to the US to do it all over again and send back money almost 3 years after my sister was born she was pregnant with me. 6 months later I was born small weak and too early. Growing up my mother would always take care of me and my sister making sure we dressed well and looked as nice as possible with what little we had which was not very much even with my dad sending money back my mother working one of my grandfathers corner stores all by herslef and heling out with one of his familys food side business we still struggled often to make ends needs and had to call my father at many of times to remind him to send money. Growing up me and my sister were always complimented on our looks we were pretty good looking children and even growing up all my friends always seemed to fall for my sister and tell me that they had a crush on her for me well many of my sisters friends would always like me but I honestly became very oblivious to it and never saw myself as an attractive person much of it has to do with what later happened to me growing up. I don't want to drag this on for too long so I am going to jump straight to the point and the reason why I am struggling today and will probably die this way. My mother and sister both deny this ever happening both say that I've made the wholde thing up in my head and dreamt it all. Basically I have very vivid memories of being sexually abused in kindergarten going home having trouble while peeing and therefore having to tell my mom who got the police involved and the culprits fired being my kindergarten female teacher and the male principal. I have so many vivid memories of it all. The many days my mom took me and my sister to the district offices and filed a lawsuit and the many days we had to go back to said building to keep pursuing the lawsuit. I remember this specifically because vendors outside on the street would be selling merchandise like toys watches high end stuff for the country I remember always looking at a light up spiderman watch and beging my mom to buy it for me every time we went to the offices until the final and last day we had to go that's when she bought it for me which I assume is the day that we were payed for the lawsuit at this point i was already unrecognizable to myself when the abuse happened I was abusing food and I didn't want to take care of myself in appearance and hygiene I stopped brushing my teeth refused to bathe I noticed not doing these things kept people away from me. The kindergarten eventually closed down and I remember standing outside the gate looking into the main entrance pateo with the small concrete kittie pool in the center area that would be used during the summer heat. I was in elementary up to the 2nd grade I was 6 years old when my mother decided to bring us to the US to re unite with my father. Before this I was hospitalized for almost a whole year do to kidney problems I had kidney stones and was peeing blood I remember the night that it happened and exactly what we had for dinner and the movie we were watching my father was also back visiting since we had all that money by the time I was hospitalized he was gone and back in the US. When coming to the US yes we did it illegally and failed the first time so I approximate that we spent close to 30 thousand in all since we failed thr first time. I have spoken to my father recently and confronted him about it all he denies it as well same as my sister and mother but says other wise about where all the money came from he claims he earned it all working here and saving and sending it back. While my mom claims she earned it working for my grandfather and also saving what my father would send. But this is where I know those are all lies because he wasn't capable of even supporting himself here in the US and even less support another 3 people it wasnt long after we arrived that he couldn't afford to pay the rent and made my mother work cleaning houses much and many other drama happened involving my uncle whos house we rented a single room at and lived in all four of us in one room all the way up until I was in middle school. Basically he got my sister pregnant and had been having a relationship with her since I was in elementary school I had known about it and had told my mom about it long before the tipping point ever came. I saw alot I haven't even mentioed and personally I know how troubled and mentally unstable everyone around me was and some still are I have no one to talk to about it or anyone who will listen. I am slowly loosing my own sanity or what little I have been able to hold onto in this life. My mother sister and I were granted residency because of what my father did and I wish I could say everything was well afterwards but it has been far from that. From all the self applied I don't know what to even call it harm, pain, pretty much I struggled with my weight was around 245 at 5'8 in height at the age of 16 and have come close to having heart complications. All the self neglectment I did in order to push people away eventually came back to bite me never carrying for my dental state was been with me since I was 5 but now bothers me to the point I cant ride the bus to work without getting into a confrontation over stinking up the bus I don't even have to talk to affect the people around me. I can't be in a closed room or car do to this and pretty much I am left to work jobs that nobody wants where I have little to no contact or communication with other people I did graduate high school. Never pursued my academic goals do to this issue never felt comfortable anywhere I went. I did eventually loose weight and gained my health back thanks to a few friends that took me under their wing I went from the 245 to 145lbs and fell in love with weight lifting and being physically active but I could never try to get a carrier working with people doing fitnes do to what I have done to myself. Now I work a job that even ex felons with tattoos in their face wont work for longer then a day or two which I wish was just a made up analogy but it actually happens almost every other week at my job. I am the only worker that isn't related to the company owner and that hasn't quit after a few days. I will most likely die alone keeping all of this and much more to myself. I really havent felt like myself in such a long time I've lost all sense in who I was. Going day by day without any type of human communication or at least one that won't call me a lier and crazy. The first time I ever confronted my mother about my past she denied it all said I was crazy I never mentioned any money just that I remembered it all the abuse when and how it happened the night terrors no longer being able to share the same bed as my sister when we were young because I would scratch her face in my sleep and wake up screaming at night. But all she would mention is I dont have your money I had never mentioned any money that just gave it all away that I wasn't crazy that I didn't make it all up in my head. They did try to make me go to therapy back when it happened after the lawsuit was passed but my mother stopped taking me once I began having night terrors I have vivid memories of sitting at the therapist office with her and them fighting about me going and my mother saying she can't deal with the long nights anymore. At the end everyone enjoyed the money my mother bought her high end clothes, gucci boots paid off alot of things I got all the food I asked for to eat my feelings away and my dad got his nice truck my sister got a few nice things and eventually after another argument with my mom my sister got all the money that was left from it 10k which is in a bank account in Mexico I never cared about the money I didn't even know about the money all I was looking for was my sanity. I don't know how much longer I can see meaning in this life I gave it all I had for as long as I could and I am contempt with leaving with just that.",lonely,My short life,2019-06-16 15:05:13
821,Tannenberg1914,1560658841,3,"Heres some venting 

Hi, im 15, just ending my freshman year of highschool. Ive literally wasted all of it, never got a girlfriend, never got rid of my acne, became a worse student. Ive only like 2 people this year, never asked either out. The first I sort of liked, but Im pretty sure she never liked me. I mean my looks and personality are basically just 4.5/10, im not even fat anymore thanks to my hard work (thanks mom and dad for letting a 10 year old weigh that much). I liked the second one since last year, was going to ask her out but before doing that I found out she was lesbian.
 
Ive had acne for probably 3 or 4 years now, have had a dermitologist for about a year. Its never gotten better, I use a wash and 2 gels, I wash my face 3 times a day, and take a shower twice a day. It used to not be that bad, but after it being fucking 95 degrees and constantly being sweaty its gotten even worse. I know people will say ""teenagers have acne dont worry about it"", but at my school maybe 1/5 of the people there have visible acne like me, and its almost exclusively guys. 

Recently some guy my mom knew that I have never met before moved in and is staying for ""a while"", he brought his massive dog who just constantly barks and slobbers. I just dont feel like im in my own house before. My mom often talks about getting rid of the family cat, even though the cat doesnt act out and is really sweet.

Ive been crying alot more recently, and im just so tired of all this shit. I just want someone to love, a girl who is nice and shares my at least one of my interests (I havent yet found one thats interested in history, or politics, or other nerdy shit. 

To anyone who says ""you need to learn to be happy on your own"", I know your intentions are good, but being in a relationship is a fundamental and important part of life, I just want to expirience that once before I die alone on the planet my parent's generation has ruined.",lonely,Venting,2019-06-16 14:20:41

The other day it vanished at 2 pm and didn't turn up til the next morning, not even bothering to come up to my bed to sleep next to me as usual.  And today it vanished for 7 hours.  It's not that I have to pet it all the time but if it liked me it would have wanted to sit next to me on the bed or at least in the same room.

This really hurt my feelings but the thing is humans hate me a lot more.  Today on a dating site this guy messaged me out of the blue and he called me a fat pig in glasses and told me that that's why I'm alone.  He said my mum must have given me away because I was an ugly baby and told me to kill myself and also assured me he would track down my IP address and kill me (I don't believe he will really bother to murder someone he doesn't know though)

I have tried online dating this year because I'm now in my 30's and prior to this I have no dating or relationship experience.  Guys on there either don't reply, block me, or call me ugly, fat, etc etc.  People in real life have regularly told me they'd kill themselves if they look like me.  Honestly, I don't feel bad about my looks, because I think my character is more important and I think I'm a fairly nice person.

But the hate and the loneliness gets to be too much. I'm just sad not even my pet loves me.

I guess on the positive side I have read on forums that most chameleons don't allow their owners to hold them at all, they bite, hiss, or run away but my Chameleon has never done any of that.  We are always together in public (I rarely left the house prior to this bc I sometimes get people insulting my looks in public) and people have commented it does not run away and is very tame.  It loves sitting in my glasses or hair.

I go to school 5 days evey week. Talk to two guys in class but those are not the type of guys i could or would hang out with outside of school. 

I go home and sleep for about 30 minutes and watch youtube videos or netlfix the rest of the day in my room. 

The weekends are more lonely, im basically just watching youtube or netflix, but when some of my friends are online and want to play,  i play some games with them. 

Im tired all the time (dont think its depression) 

But the few times im getting invited to go see a movie or my one friend says lets go to mcdonalds, i get this happiness inside and it makes my life better. 

The problem is that my few friends are either introverted or i just dont know them well enough to be invited to stuff. They also have their own friends so they dont think about me. 

I consider myself kinda attractive. i have never had a girlfriend,  i have not even talked to a girl in like 3 years because the schools and education i have chosen is mostly men. 

I dont know what to do, im just waiting and waiting for something to happen but the problem is just gonna get worse and worse when adult life starts. 

Its not easy for an 18 year old with little to no friends to get more friends. I need friends to get new friends if you understand. I cant just go to the mall alone and start talking to people, thats strange and everyone thinks thats strange.

Fall through the floor
Of your dilapidated shell
Into the void unending,
Where is all is shed and for a moment
Freedom is tasted so sweetly.
Be faceless, nameless, suspended in time
Outsid pitiful calculations
And nagging memory - your history.

Freedom is found in emptiness
Like gold in the muddy creeks.
Silence is the pick and shovel.

So dig, dig you fool. Dig for your life.
Or a life's madness will bury you
And choke every hope you had
Of feeling the sun again.

Leaving you to howl at the reflection of the moon
In a puddle of ceaseless tears,
While the stars look on
Mourning a brother lost.


&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;


Outside is a desert
Its sands pale as pearl;
Blinding, under the suns light
And burning all uncovered soles.

Yet we march across it, to the holy place
Which has no name or direction indicated.
You might have guessed, this land is the place.

Yes, hell is our temple, where we worship at the shrines of pain and longing
And joy bursts from our peeling skin.

Smile then, show your blackened, broken teeth
And kiss the hand that feeds you;
Every knife, thorn and fist.

For no greater gifts can be found 
Than those that bring you to the core
Beyond all artifice and contention;
To only pure, intentful life

It's a strange high when I get a call back or an interview set up. I feel validated. Days when I get rejection emails I tear myself apart. 'Why am I not good enough?' I wonder to myself .
  Can anyone relate to doing job searches and trying to find newness or acceptance from random places hiring?

It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

871,ENEB1487,1560569681,4,"I'm texting this as I go, and honestly... I fucking hate my life. Maybe I'm getting an early start into that midlife crisis, maybe I'm being a bit of a twat, I'm quite unsure but I know that what I truly want is no longer attainable unless circumstances change by my hand or another. 

I've been on the job market since April 2010 (I've worked the same restaurant job since March 2007). I've been dating the same woman since November 10th, 2012. I've raised a child since April of 2013 (her daughter came w/ the territory). Honestly, I know I can be doing better. I have switched my schedule on multiple occasions to accommodate my partner's life, taken up financial responsibilities that do not concern me, reconnected w/ my family while becoming more acquainted w/ hers... yet we barely have a moment where I am not entirely ""happy.""

I have some college education, I am attracted yo other women, and I don't desire kids of my own (Seriously, if anything has brought any joy to me, it has been raising this little ratscallion. Nothing but joy!). I don't love the woman I am with any longer because of her lack in desire to better herself, all the bullshit she has attributed to my personal debt, and the lack of an intimate relationship. 

If I were to cut the cord now, I would be working everyday not because I need to, but because I want to. I would be in the black before the end of the year; I would be in a better profession because I wouldn't have to worry about the cost of a certification program or putting money up front for school. But what for? NOTHING!!! The fucking purpose for doing all of this, bettering myself, is all for HER DAUGHTER!!!

I grew up in a broken home. My mother had a poor taste in men, including my own father. As much of bastards he and my stepfather were, I made a decision many years ago that I would do my damned best to raise a child far better than any of them could. Call it Daddy Issues, but I knew what it was like to crave that guidance and wisdom a father could instill. As well, I'm so attached to this kid; I love her as though she were my own flesh and blood. 

So there it is folks! While my partner and daughter sleep, I sit alone at a kitchen table unhappy, stressed, and wondering how to solve this quandary called life. Am I selfish? Maybe but who isn't? I just don't know what to do other than fake my way through this scenario until my house of cards collapse",lonely,32 M W/ Family... and I Still Feel Like Shit,2019-06-15 13:34:41

874,BBCactus119,1560565919,2,"I moved out to Colorado from California about 3 years ago to live with the love of my life. It's honestly the best decision I've made in my life and would make the same decision time and time again if given the opportunity. I've been happy but at the same time, progressively more and more sad as time goes on, especially this year.

For one my parents didn't make it easy the whole entire time I've been living here. I could go on and on about them but I'll spare anyone that reads this and not. I'll just say that I recently connected the dots that I have been blind to the fact that both of my parents are narcissistic people. I had to cut ties with them because they couldn't be happy for me. A great example of the kind of people they are is the night I got engaged. Both my parents didn't say ""congratulations"" but instead left me saying sorry to them on the happiest day of my life so far because they weren't here with me to share the joy (which is on them because I have offered multiple times for them to come visit me and see the life we were building together, and they refused to everytime). They always had me in tears and I felt guilty because it made my fiancee feel bad seeing me like that. Plus fighting with them was getting worse and worse to the point where my fiancee was getting dragged into the fights. That's where I had to draw the line and I made the decision to send a goodbye letter to both of them about a month ago. 

Then about two months ago I also made the decision to cut ties with my only friend that I had because she left me feeling confused and used at the same time. I offered for her to come visit and she agreed, and she even pushed it to where she would visit for a week which I was ecstatic for at first. Because I was lonely then (not as much then as I am now), I offered to buy her a plane ticket down here when I didn't have that much money to begin with. During her visit I ended up spending an additional 800 dollars on her because she didn't offer to pay or pitch in for a single thing. It would be a little different if she had said ""thank you"" or showed any type of gratfulness during her time here, but she didn't. Instead, she had the nerve to talk crap about my fiancee who was nothing but kind to her and was also was spending money for her meals and gas while he drove us everywhere because I don't have a car. She also gave me attitude when we weren't doing as much her as she wanted (when we were doing a LOT already) which left me upset because it made me feel like my month of planning for her visit wasn't good enough, and she didn't help with the plans at all. She left me shocked because when she was my roommate, she didn't show any of these red flags to me in the year and a half we lived together. We haven't texted or talked since we dropped her off at the airport after her visit, and to be honest, I don't plan on talking to her again because of this and because she hasn't reached out to even say hi or ask what's wrong. I know deep down she knows why I am hurt and that's why she's not reaching out.

And then to go further back to around Christmas, I had quit my job so we could move somewhere different in Colorado. I had high hopes because I felt like the new year 2019 was going to be the year I was going to finally make new friends at whatever new job I would pick up (I haven't been able to make friends before at my old job). After the move and when I was job hunting, my old job called me up and offered me a at home position. I made the decision to take the job because one, I had already been unemployed for a month and money was draining quickly and two, I thought it would be awesome to work in my pajamas, not going to lie. And while I am grateful for the opportunity, it's left me feeling so lonely because on a day to day basis, I don't speak to anyone that isn't my fiancee or my fiancee's family on the weekends. 

It's just been hard. I feel like I am a reasonable, generous, fun and a loving person, but because I've had to push people away that were toxic in my life, I've been having feelings that I'M the reason I'm this lonely even though I know it's not true. I gave my parents every chance for three years to be better towards me and they refused to change. I practically spoiled my friend a week before my birthday and she ends up using me and not having the decency to even ask me why I am not talking to her. I try to move past this depression, but it's hard when I don't have any friends that treat me with the kindness I treated them with. I have my fiancee, which is the reason why I am able to function right now and my fiancee's family who are so sweet towards me, but I've always kept my guard up with them for whatever reason. 

Right now I am trying to apply for a second job just to make friends. But with me working right in the middle of the day (8am-5pm). I don't think anyone wants to hire me. My fiancee has offered multiple times to go out to a bar and meet people that way (all my fiancee's friends are long distance, so we can't hang out with any of them as well), but it just makes me too nervous, I've always been socially akward when meeting new people. At this point I don't know what to do. That's why I am making my first post on Reddit here. I don't know what I am expecting out of this post, but I already feel better just venting. So thank you if you made it this far to read my long post. I've read other stories on here and felt better too knowing I'm not the only one who feels this way.

TLDR: Because of my multiple decisions I've had to make this year in hopes of finding happiness and getting rid of toxic people in my life, it's left me feeling lonier than ever before.",lonely,The decisions I've (23F) had to make have left me feeling lonier than I have ever felt before (Vent),2019-06-15 12:31:59
875,Mediocre_Note,1560564375,2,"So I've been recovering from an immobilizing injury for a few weeks now and its all making me a bit stir crazy, so I decided to google around and look up self help guides and I keep stumbling across [articles like this](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/injured-stuck-in-bed-cant_b_7457650) which include quotes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 

For several weeks, I was reliant on my partner, Brandon, for pretty much everything -- and he stood by my side through some pretty rough, unattractive moments.

He watched me sobbing because my pain was so intense and comforted me, telling me that it would all be OK.

He dashed out to the pharmacy to get laxatives for me (Fun fact: some pain medications cause extreme constipation! Ugh).

He went to the grocery store, made sure I had plenty of food available, assembled a wheeled cart so that I could push various things around while on my crutches... so many acts of service and care.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a strong reminder of the practical support that comes with having someone in your life. over the last few weeks I haven't had that, I've had to do everything by myself, including racking up huge bills by ordering my groceries in. Whenever I've tried to get in touch with friends to help they are too busy with their own lives, with their jobs, their kids, their partners.

880,freewillgestalt,1560559339,30,"i usually lurk but maybe sharing my experience for once will help someone, and i just need to let how i feel today and how i've been feeling out of my mind.

so i just got home from plans with some people i'm in a club with at college (i'm currently home from college, college is about 2 hours away from home for some context). i wasn't expecting much, felt like a pity invite just because i live near a lot of people in the club and they don't want me to feel left out. 

i'm not close with (m)any of them to begin with, and i often feel isolated during club meetings and activities, but today was even worse because we were just hanging out, and a lot of them are really extroverted and close friends outside the club and my introverted self just did not fit in or talk very much. i just never know what to say to keep the conversation fun and i felt pretty invisible and like me being there meant nothing to them. i really don't know why i was invited but what makes me feel so bad about it is that this club is practically my only source of friends at my college besides my 1 (one, singular, only) friend i somehow made while at college, as well as the fact that i have recently come to the realization that i have no friends/family who i feel like value me and want to understand me. it just made me realize how alone i am at college as well as in the world in general. this club also gives me a lot of good resources for my major so i don't want to leave but i just do not make friends easily with the people there but it seems like everyone else gets along so well :(

i don't know how to meet people that i vibe with and after an extremely lonely freshman year at college it's really hard to see how i could ever make new friends who actually care about me when that hasn't been the pattern. my first roommate hated me, made 0 friends on my floor, in clubs, and in my classes 1st semester, moved rooms and barely talked with my roommate 2nd semester and joined the aforementioned club and made the aforementioned 1 (literally just 1) friend. when i went home i thought at least i had my high school friends, but no, i matured at college while they didn't (bc of loneliness, partly) and/or they made a ton of friends so we can't really relate. what's mostly bothering me is that i feel like i have no one in my life that i can share my feelings of loneliness with because i feel like they either won't understand/will judge me. i'm planning on joining even more clubs next semester to find people i can relate to but i don't want to get my  hopes up too high.

i lurked on this forum a lot during my freshman year and the first thing i wanted to do when i got home was write this post since this is where i feel people are who understand. i just want to say thank you to every one who makes up this forum, and i hope that you are enjoying your friday night. even if you're just spending it at home alone or with family like i am, i hope you are doing something good. if you feel like you want to talk to someone tonight then just message me :) thanks for reading and any advice/support you feel like sharing would be great but just an upvote would also mean a lot!",lonely,today hit even harder than usual and i need to talk about it,2019-06-15 10:42:19

I have a really good support system, my immediately family. I have one proper friend who likes well enough and I'm acquainted with their other friends and we get along so the day to day isn't so bad. I'm fine. I'm really just okay. For the first time in my entire life I can say that! I'm fine! And I mean it, too. That's fucking awesome, it's a great feeling. 

I'm estranged from my biological family and I've stopped talking to someone I thought was closest friend. Through these constant and somewhat more recent experiences I've developed a harder skin about apathy in the last few months. No one really gives a fuck, and that's okay because to be honest? Most of the time I don't either. But obviously I can't help but crave the kind of intimacy that comes along with being able to truly be open with someone. I don't care about romance, or anything like that. I mean like, a real human connection with someone on the basis of trust and communication and commonality. 

So while I'm fine, and I'm not alone, really technically. I still feel unheard, unseen, ignored. I'm very okay with my own company. I don't mean it in a egotistical way, but I've worked pretty hard to get away from my parents fuckups and self improvement and I can say that I am my own bestfriend. I like me a lot, I'm very comfortable with my personality for the first time in all 17 years on this funky little orb.

I'm looking to hopefully make some good friends on Reddit preferably in the UK but not a requierment .

Some of my interests are

Music- I am a musician, i pay bass mainly and i'm into Prog rock (Camel, YES, GONG, bits of Pink Floyd, Comus, ELOY and ELP) I really love the complex insanity of most Prog songs.

gaming- I most games i'm not massively fussy but i do prefer single player stuff (FinalFantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Resident Evil and Silent Hill are some of my favourites) I'm also on PS4 if you are too and want to do some Co-op 

Film-I love cult horror films from the 70's and 80's, the type of films that are so bad they are good 

TV- I mostly watch British comedy (Panel shows, sitcoms etc.) but also some american dramas and comedies. Currently rewatching all the Big Fat Quizzes 

Hmu if you have any of the same interests and want to chat. i have discord so we can chat there if that's easier than Reddit

&amp;#x200B;

Funny how when you travel alone you don’t actually feel lonely. The world is filled with fantastic distractions, so even when you’re alone, you don’t actually feel it. I’ve been in some of the most remote locations in the world, no one in sight, and sure I’ve thought about what it would be like with another person to share that moment with, but at the time I felt completely whole, on my own. This time was different though. I was across the world from home for three weeks, not particularly long for me, and for the first time since I was a child, I felt lonely. Really lonely. I haven’t been able to shake the feeling since coming home. I have the overwhelming feeling that something in me, that’s been held back or hidden for a long time is now free, awake, and hungry. Starving for attention, starving to be whole. Perhaps I never truly have been whole because I’ve kept this feeling locked away. It’s awake because, when I was away, I realized that I was lonely because I wasn’t wondering what it would be like to be with someone through my experiences. I wanted to be with a certain someone. I had let someone into my life, to seed and root, and now without them sharing the experience with me, it felt empty and I felt alone. Alone is a desperate feeling that I’ve avoided for a long time. More that I’ve avoided being in a place with someone where their absence could make me feel less than whole. And now that’s where I find myself. I’ve let someone in to the point of seeing a future and without them, without the confidence in that future, I feel desperate and in despair. Without that future to hold onto, I’m lost. And it seems that nothing they do is enough to quell that feeling. I even fear that the feeling is pushing them away, which then self fulfills the prophecy of a painful end, alone again. And then one little text, or phone call, or facebook like from him - and it’s all gone. All the fear, pain, dread. The spiral stops. 

How do you get back to whole on your own? How do you make the spiral stop on your own? How is it that you can love someone wholly and still be willing / ready to walk away at any moment. So you’re never too attached. You always have the edge on the negotiation. You won’t be completely devastated if the deal doesn’t go through and your future turns out to be something else?",lonely,Lonely in a Relationship,2019-06-15 04:13:53

I still talk to my friends back home almost everyday but it's just not the same as having someone here. I haven't found any friends up here; I tried during school but nothing stuck. Haven't found any groups or clubs that fit my tastes, haven't found anybody I'm interested in romantically. So I feel lonely but I still have some people. To be honest the thing I miss most from back home is having a partner. Not even for sex; just having that emotional connection with someone is all I want. Hell I haven't had sex in about 2 years (21 year old male), I just get bouts of super low libido; like I went 8 months without masturbating and sex because I was never in the mood and just felt like shit.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

 For a while I've been talking with a friend (A) from my old school. I moved school halfway through last year and stayed in contact with this person. At the time, i thought they been really nice and genuine with me and others and they weren't in drama and other stuff. 
  They accused another friend (R) of mine and theirs shortly after I moved. I learnt about everything through messaging and I tried to sort it out, I didn't have any other friends at the time. It kept on escalating and soon I didn't believe R, I believed A. R left the group chat I was in with all my old friends and that was the last time I talked to R via messaging.
  At one point as well, A spread rumours about another of our mutual friends (K) which made K break up with her then boyfriend (A wasn't into him or anything but she knew this would ruin their relationship). A claimed it was an accident and she didn't mean it but that it was the truth, gosh why was I so gullible, and I believed her story. I feel like such an idiot, I tainted so many friendships by sticking with her.
   She also has repeatedly claimed she has no friends and that she is so lonely. She lied to people online about her age, became their friend and when she was exposed she self harmed. She jokes about suicide and self harm like its nothing, claims everyone is toxic, so much bullshit.
   I moved back to the school with A, R and K and all my other friends and she had a group of friends, pretty big if I'm honest. She had scars all down her arms and laughed and it, joked about it. 
   She'd asked me to come back because she was lonely and depressed. Emotionally unstable, I believe, is the correct way of terming it. I had already wanted to move back but I felt compelled when my best friend was sad and lonely and I wanted to be there for her.
   I've talked to her since I moved and she claims her friends are manipulative and mean to her. I told her to stick with me but she still hangs out with them. Both incidents from earlier she never apologised for either.
   I can't and don't want to be friends with her. I'm sticking with R and K and some other friends and they don't like at all after all she did. A is also often in drama and ""false"" accusations. 
   I've always hated drama and this bitch is serving it right up. She does a lot of stuff at yet she's always believed. I really doubt everyone has something against her.

I'm happy now with my friends but now I've learned everything I don't know why I trusted her.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep looking back and I can see how I got here. I was the eldest of 5 kids from an immigrant mom, the father just wanted to have fun and left us after the 5th (lol), so I was raised always keeping in mind that I have to help the family out. And that's exactly what I did, I just concentrated in school, I became the nerd in school and everyone was always telling me how that was amazing. And I did it, I went from High School to a Trade School then actually got a job, and a good one. I helped out the family and got them to where they needed to be but I started to notice that I was feeling lonely as shit. And that's because I concentrated so much on work and I never developed social skills. Now even if I try, people annoy me and I can always tell their true intentions. It's a weird feeling but I can always judge a person by his character, there have been a few people where I've been wrong....but I decided to keep them as friends and not get closer because at the end of they day, they'd never understand what's going through my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I meet someone new, I always listen, I always ask questions but that's because I'm trying to figure them out. And that is a side effect of the work ethic that I had during highschool to the work force. I can't turn that shit off, and therefor I just end up isolating myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if any of this makes any sense, is there anyone out there that has a similar story?

Hello, I am a 23 year old girl named Eve. I've been pretty lonely for years, till I started gaming. I made 3 really good friends and now we want to do the same for other people.   


So we started a ark server last week, where everyone is welcome and the main focus is on being nice to each other and create one big friendly group. I found the best people in my life online, and I am finally at a point where I am happy.  And that is mainly because I feel like I am part of a group now and fit in. I want that for everyone so we created this Ark and Discord server.  


Everyone is welcome, it does not matter if you are new to the game or a pro. We just want a big world where we have fun with each other and the dinosaurs. We started out with 4, but we are already joined by 2 new friends.  


The server is PvE from Monday till Friday and PvP in the weekend. To keep it exciting and interactive. We are just starting so it will be mostly PvE for the upcoming weeks, but we will be happy to get you going with a starter base/kit. Everything is still in a early stage. So if you join now you will probably get a big say in what the server and community is going to look like and what the rules will be.  You might even become mod.  


This are the server stats and for questions don't be afraid to pm me. We also play other games from time to time. But we want to focus on Ark now.  


 Server Info: \[EU\]\[WeekendPvP\]\[x15\]\[ArchaicAscension\]\[QoL\]\[TP\]\[CrossDinos\] -The Purge    


Server IP: 51.77.152.105:7020    


Player slots: 60    


Server Discord (WIP): [https://discord.gg/6DByhRe](https://discord.gg/6DByhRe)   


It's a EU server, but we have NA people playing on it with 25 ping.

I do my best to reach out and talk to people and make new friends and I’ve been kind of doing that for my summer school class and it’s awesome.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

So I’ve come back seeking some more advice as things have gotten a little worse. From the original post, I did take some of the advice for bettering myself by involving myself in hobbies such as photography, basketball, etc but it seems that the friends I was afraid of losing originally are being lost. For the last few weeks it seems that I’ve not only been brushed off, but my existence itself online has been invisible to them. Every message or image I send in our group chat is mostly ignored or they move past it. I’m happy to be improving myself but what’s happening now is making me feel like I’ll have no one in the end. Though my parents and older brother are still being positive, I know I can’t just only speak with them. Telling them I feel isn’t a valid solution either as they’ve had past complicated family relations causing them to be sour about the idea of having friends except for my older brother. The issue I have for ditching them and moving on is that some of these friends have been with me since I moved here and met them in elementary school and I never thought to lose them, and if I do ditch them I will have no where to turn as I always thought we would be friends. It just hurts and frustrates me now to think that the friends that were kind to accept me have just isolated me and left me behind. They’ve posted images of them doing stuff and whenever I message them to do something I’m just met with no response which I guess would have been the first warning. I’ve already thought about and went through messages sent if I said something wrong or distasteful but I haven’t really found anything unordinary or unusual to cause that. Anyways I just need help figuring what I should do wether it be to seriously speak with them or split away from the group.",lonely,"[UPDATE] 17 year old, lonely",2019-06-13 11:19:37

988,Nausea_,1560385970,5,"So here's a fun story of my obsessive mental tendencies to hopefully ease the loneliness of all of us. There's a new girl at my work who caught my eye as soon as I was introduced. The ordeal feels hazy in my recollection, and I often associate this haziness with a heavy attraction. I've felt it before, a few times prior. It's the same as feeling lost when you look at someone in their eyes. Sappy, right? I like to think that she felt the same.

Just kidding. Well, sort of. I'm not crazy, I can separate mental fiction from reality. But as soon as the thought is introduced within the realm of possibilities, what else do you do? You pluck at it and flirt with it. Wrap yourself in it; get it in every nook, and don't you dare miss a spot. It's not my choice, anyways... these things just appear and reappear in the mind without permission. Now, already, this poor woman is my mental subject due to a simple greeting, one of which was entirely out of her control. This is life's fate in the modern corporate era - yes my children, I knew your mother was the one as soon as we exchanged a half-hearted shake of our hands at my cubicle. I knew she felt the same as soon as I lightly said a greeting and lost half of the message to my mumbling. This conversation between myself and the children takes place among all four of us at some small cafe on a cool Saturday morning, sun in the lightly overcast sky, with our two darling children probing away with questions of their historical origins. I ordered pancakes and meat, she's more of a parfait girl. Get the picture?

Over the course of two weeks I have had multiple conversations with her in my head; pounding away at her poor, defenseless soul with my endless virtues, truths, and beliefs - all while she simply takes it in and maybe nods. She already knows my childhood woes, my dearest insecurities, and some of my home-Ec skills. When the day gets difficult, and I get wrapped up in my emotions leading me to completely question the purpose of it all, her image appears in my head. It's pure meaning, her image telling me to improve myself; the image is something to admire, something to respect, something to love, something to work toward, and to claim that it's mine. Something to stick around for. I think of the mutually beneficial outcomes of our exchanged nurturing, and I think of how we could make choices together that would not merely just give life meaning - but how it would maximize our short existences with pleasure, understanding, and happiness. I think of how any two people can do that, and the magic that it entails. I think about what they can accomplish from it all, and what we can all accomplish from it, collectively.

I've spoken with her a few times not in my head; no mention of virtue, philosophy, or belief.  And especially nothing of our children, the representative permutations of our respective ancestries, fit with the peculiar features that would only occur from the two of us.  But I have learned recently that her favorite fruit are grapes.  Everything's coming up, Milhouse!  

Isn't it something? It's a choice few steps and a few words. That's all it would take for all of this to unravel. The freedom of it gives me nausea, and the choice to ignore it gives me sadness.  But what bites most is that I'm stuck fighting some demons with dumb mental impressions and illusions of things that don't happen because my stupid brain has some bad chemicals in it.",lonely,A dumb narrative to hopefully distract your lonely woes,2019-06-13 10:32:50

990,putaaa_,1560384433,7,"here's my story 

I'm only 17, but i feel my world coming to an end. On march 29th my parents and i got in a big BIG fight, they found out about me smoking, drinking, etc... nothing the average highschooler hasn't done. ever since then my life has been constant emotional and physical abuse. they took everything away from me (no way to contact anyone), and took me out of school for over a month. my principle and other staff then got involved and gave my parents an ultimatum, they had to put me back in school. when i returned all my friends were so unexplainably supportive, none of them knew what had happened to me despite constant efforts of trying to reach out that my parents hid from me. when i came back everyone felt as if they could finally let out the breathe that they had been holding in for so long. but i just wasn't the same, being on lockdown staring at 4 walls for a month changed me mentally and physically. this seems rather materialistic, but my parents took away all my makeup, forcing all my insecurities to crawl back out. i couldn't talk to people normally anymore, i felt like everyones staring at my horrific under eyes bags from a month of sleepless nights, malnutrition, and crying. i have lost every bit of confidence. I used to have it all, i was popular, smart, pretty, and well liked... now i have nothing. going back to school after missing a month also came with a month of makeup work, right before finals and AP testing, the amount of stress I'm undergoing in indescribable. all my hair is falling out, i can feel my body deteriorating. my mom wants me to be ugly, she doesn't want people taking to me, she came to throw boiling hot water on my face. the thing is, before this all happened our relationship was great, i loved my mom with everything in me and she would support me whenever my dad would mentally or physically abuse me, but our relationship has gone to nothing. and they think that everything they're doing is rational, and that other parents would do the same. I'm so so so emotionally scarred, there's people all around me that go out of their way to make my life better, but the power is no longer in my hands. i've considered moving out and staying at my ever so welcoming friends houses, but then i would have to worry about things that i had never worried about before i.e. paying for college and other monetary demands. I was a diligent student and pictured my future in a UC  or another good university, but if i move out that might go to waste. and i know that if i move out now, no matter how much time has passed, my parents will never take me back. they also hate the fact that i have friends that would give up everything for me, so they're taking me out of the state next year... my senior year was supposed to be my best year, now it's going to be the absolute worse if i even make it. I know everyone says things get better but in this case they can't, if they take me out of the country, i cant come back to the US for college and in turn the rest of my life. If I move out, i might not even get to go to college. If i stay living like this, I'll OD. there's no winning.  i just want to cry and vent but I'm not allowed to.",lonely,"i need advice, or just someone to listen...",2019-06-13 10:07:13

I'm 18, male and very shy tbh. I don't do much other than study hard and stay in writing/drawing. I'm gay but I'm in the closet to all my friends. I don't think they'd take it that well considering how they acted when another guy at school came out behind the guys back. Everyone acts like homophobia is over but it's not it's just not mainstream any more. I find it exhausting to be around them because I feel like a fraud. I also feel like if I don't make jokes all the time they'll drop me, and often I'm just too sad. 

So most of my time is spent with my parents. My mother works a lot and she's ok but never really listens to me. Dads another story. He ignores me for days then I do one thing wrong and he shouts, throws things and often  gets violent. I know if I came out to either of them it would be the end for me. 

I hate how cliche it is but I could even live without friends if I just had a dad who loved me. I could be so much happier if I had that one role model who didn't think I was a total failure and would actually hug me and teach me things and not shoot me down over everything. I want that so badly. I've gotten so desperate for it that I've started looking for guys online who are older because I figure at least if I have sex with them maybe they'll stick around after and feel like a dad for a while. I really hate myself for it. It doesn't work anyways they just want thousands of naked pictures then they run off, so it's not even successful 😐

It's almost over and I'm happy about it but more then that, I am depressed/lonely/sad. Ever since i was a very young kid I was loved by everyone, had good grades and no one had a problem with me. Basically i was the good kid. And last year I got super close with all my friends. But this year everything changed. They all started drinking/smoking/vaping, they wanted me to do it with them, but this is where our ways parted. I just didn't want do it, because of my complicated past with my father and i didn't want to dissapoint my mom, I didn't want to become someone i wasn't. Following that, they stopped inviting me to hang out and left me completely out of it. They think that we are still buddy buddies, but we're not. I see them sending me snaps of them going out and I'm just at home crying nearly every day, thinking how did I end up like this, what did I do wrong to not have any friends anymore and I just feel so lonely. I can't make friends easily, because I think that I'm a complex person and talking to someone I don't know is like the hardest thing in the world. I just don't know how I'm gonna get through 2 more years of this hell...

Romance doesn't work well for me either. This year I met a girl through a mutual friend and thought she was really different from all the girls and she wasn't doing any drugs either, which i really admire. The 1st conversation we had brought me hope that I finally won't be alone anymore and that I found someone that will finally love me back, but it ended up different than usual it still felt like rejection. I started chatting with her from time to time and I felt something special, I thought she did aswell and every time we meet she just smiles so nicely at me and I can't tell if it's because she is friendly or because she just felt bad for me, because i have no friends. 1 month after i asked her out and she replied ""Oh i can't i have a lot of homework"" and i got really sad and thought ""ok maybe that's true, I'll try again next time"". Next time didn't go better either, she just said she can't, no reason, no interest to hang out another day. After that i just stopped messaging her, because i thought she just didn't care anymore. 6 months passed and now we're here. I saw her at school again and straight out of the blue just fell back in love with her, I have no idea what happened, probably a mood swing, but I just couldn't stop thinking about her. So I decided to write a long message telling her how I feel and to my surprise she said ""It's very nice to get a message like this, I'll find time for you some day"". And i felt on top of the world, but a week has passed and I'm losing hope, my imagination is too big and I'm just thinking of the worst scenarios, because I've been hurt so much that I don't trust anyone anymore. To top all of that off, I saw my best friend (one of the guys who i talked about earlier, so not really best friend but its hard to describe it) chatting with her a bit and I just got a million emotions inside of me. I was sad, mad, jealous and I wanted to cry so much, but I was in class so I managed not to. Even if she'd go out with me I'm still really scared. I've never been on a date with a girl and I don't know what I'm supposed to do, how much should I open up, what if she just likes me as a friend and it gets worse every day, just waiting for a miracle to happen yet being afraid of the miracle itself. 

English isn't my main language so I didn't manage to put it in the best way and I know that many people here have it much worse, but I just feel so down, this has never happened to me before and I feel just so lost, when I see others being succesfull I just look down on myself thinking, why am I such a failure....

I think he chooses to not respond to me most of the time, because when it’s one of his coworkers, friends, or social groups that send him a notification, he doesn’t waste any time in checking or responding. I’ve asked him about it and he said no, but the proof is in the pudding. Just because you have a significant other doesn’t mean you can’t still be lonely. 

My best (only) friend recently stopped responding to anything I would send to him after he got himself a new girlfriend, who he is already talking about marrying. It’s been a month. His last gf (who was also my very close friend) and him were together for 6 years. She ended up cheating on him and blocking the both of us with no explanation. We only found out what was going on after detective style sleuthing together. He seems a little better now with a new gf, and I absolutely get being hurt and the craving for love, but god, give yourself some alone time first. 

My mom is really the only other social outlet in my life, and we have an on again/off again familial relationship. We did not get along and she was abusive/neglectful for most of my childhood. She’s trying hard to make up for the past now, but it’s still sometimes hard for me to talk to her or be around her. But, she talks to me more than my partner and friend combined. 

Even though I work most days, I stress out when I try to hold a conversation with a coworker. There’s several people I really like at work, and they’re folks I’d love to hang with outside of work. But I’m constantly afraid I’ll end up saying something stupid or come off far too awkward for my age. Either that, or I will get the feeling every once in a while that they really don’t give two shits about what I have to say and are just being generally friendly to keep the peace. 

I’ve joined an astonishing amount of social/meetup apps to try and make friends, local and long distance. I’ve made probably half a dozen posts in total on reddit, begging for someone to message me, pleading to start a friendship that I know isn’t real that I probably will never have. Every friendship I do manage to make and maintain ends up in flames, or they fall off the face of the earth, and I never hear from them again. 

At this point I’m tearing up as I write this in public. I can’t believe how fucking pathetic I must sound. And selfish.... I know there are others that have it worse than me, I do. But I am so fucking lonely and there is just this hole in my heart. My heart feels so cold because I know no one will ever really be there when I need them. I don’t have the promise of comfort and support 24/7, I don’t have anyone that I’ll always be able to talk to whenever about whatever. No one to hang out with in person for damned sure. And that lack of security, that lack of platonic love, it kills me. I don’t care how melodramatic I sound at this point, I am lonely and I am in pain.",lonely,I hate this,2019-06-13 05:36:18

I accidentally ruined a couple of friendships when I tried asking them out. So I just accepted the fact that I shouldn’t expect anything more than friendship. I just wanna make good friends without the intimacy because I’ll be honest, I’m very scared when it comes to talking/asking out to girls.

I am 29, female, single, and live with my parents. I've mostly been single. Back when I was in school, I was relentlessly bullied. I don't get out of the house because I don't have any friends and I never get invited anywhere. I had to resort to making friends online. I went on Words with Friends and a guy had befriended me on there. He would talk to me everyday and seemed genuinely interested in my life and how I was doing.  6 months ago, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes as I truly loved and trusted him. He had asked me to marry him and we made many plans in advance. I got all of my immigration papers ready to move to Ireland to be with him. I was ready to leave everything I had here in Canada to get married to him. I went to a lawyer, bought new luggage and travel essentials, paid for all my plane tickets, paid for everything I needed for myself and for this move to Ireland, which was a total of $8K from my savings. I told people I was getting married as well. We talked everyday until 9 days ago. He suddenly stopped texting and phoning me and I tried to get a hold of him. It was not like him not to phone or text, so I was worried for his wellbeing. I lost sleep and stopped eating because I was so worried about him because I loved him so much. This morning he emailed me telling me he found someone else, that he got her pregnant and this was why he was not talking to me. I was floored. I invested a lot of time, money and energy into this relationship. The money that I had spent for the move was from my savings which I had received from financial benefits for victims of crime, because I was sexually and physically abused. Another part of that money was from 2 student awards that I worked so hard for by getting the highest grades out of anyone in the program I was in. All because I believed and trusted in someone, and wanted to be loved and have companionship. All because I tried to have faith that something was real. I was wrong and I am taking it so hard because I was burnt so badly and rejected by everyone I have tried to believe in in the past with both guys and also friendships. After receiving the email, my mind was in a blur, and I reached my breaking point and tried to hang myself in the bathroom because the pain is too much for me to bear.

1011,LordDurand,1560351808,246,"It's always the same boulder that I have to roll up the same mountain. It always ends like this, so I don't know why I'm surprised.

I met her a couple months back when we joined Kendo at the same time. I was attracted to her from when I first saw her. Slowly, we started to talk and get to know each other. Eventually, I got a first date with her. We went for dinner, then went to an arcade together. I thought it went okay. It probably wasn't the best date she ever had, and I was kinda awkward sometimes, but it was okay. We kept talking and all that, and I still loved being with her.

There was a second date. It's the only time I've ever gotten a second date in my life. We'd just finished our morning Kendo class, went home to get changed, then went to see a movie together. After that, I brought her to visit the bazaar for awhile, then we went to this video game cafe, and finally got dinner. We were together for the whole day, from 9am to 1130pm, and it was the absolute best day of my life. If I had died that night and the Devil asked me if it was a life well-lived, I'd have to actually pause and think about it. That day could've made up for all the pain in this life. Getting to spend the whole day with such an amazing girl... I'd trade everything just to live that day again, and again, and again.

But life went on. A new guy joined our Kendo class recently, and she's been talking to him so much. Today I had dinner with all of them, and... It hurt. It hurt so much. To see her purposefully walk beside him, stand beside him. She's usually very introverted, but she talked to him so much. The worst part was the way she smiled at him and looked at him. There's always someone better than me. She's never smiled at me like that before, never looked at me like that before. There's always someone better than me.

I'm always rolling the same boulder up the same mountain, and I always get crushed just the same. It always ends like this. Someone better. Either that someone comes along, or she *knows* that someone will come along. I'm never good enough. But I thought now might be different. I really, really believed that maybe *this time,* I'd get to love someone and be loved back. Maybe *this time*, I'd have my chance at happiness. Maybe *this time*, I'd finally be what someone wants.

I can't keep going. I can't do it. If it's always gonna be like this, why bother? I've been begging for someone all my life. And no matter how close I think I get, I'm farther away than I've ever been. I drink a lot these days to try to make everything numb for awhile. I was sober all my life, not even a drop of alcohol.

I'm looking to hopefully make some good friends on Reddit as i have lost contact with all my IRL friends and have trouble meeting new people.

Some of my interests are

Music- I am a musician, i pay bass mainly and i'm into Prog rock (Camel, YES, GONG, bits of Pink Floyd, Comus, ELOY and ELP)

gaming- I most games i'm not massively fussy but i do prefer single player stuff (FinalFantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Resident Evil and Silent Hill are some of my favourites) currently playing Evil Within 2 and PREY

Film-I love cult horror films from the 70's and 80's

TV- I mostly watch British comedy (Panel shows, sitcoms etc.) but also some american dramas and comedies.

Reading- Mainly H.P Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe, i'm a big fan of horror stuff

Hmu if you have any of the same interests and want to chat. i have discord so we can chat there if that's easier than Reddit

1014,pixie_led,1560350334,2,"Fact is, that's how it has been all my life. From my teens to adulthood I've always struggled to find my people. To find anyone at all that I can feel close to. The fact that I'm still struggling at this age depresses me beyond description. 

This morning I woke up feeling ok. Tried to talk to family members, just normal chit chat, and was met with grumpiness and dismissal. Gave up on that fast. They have always clung to each other more than me, and they actively push me away nowadays.

Reflected on my day yesterday...conversation with other female co-workers that was filled with underlying snark and competitiveness on their part - who has the better marriage, kids, family-life - that kind of thing. I was barely involved since I have none of those things, and the competitive subtext made me vaguely sick to be honest. So, unsatisfying and unfulfilling interactions. 

And that's it. That's my life. I've tried pretty hard to put myself out there for someone who is innately shy and reserved. Yet at this point I have nothing but loneliness, and a feeling of being an outsider everywhere I go. I've tried to bond with people and been rejected. And the universe seems to get a kick out of keeping me around people, sometimes very different people, who become tight friends almost to the point where it's weird, everywhere I go.  Yet *I* can't find anyone. Really at this point it's laughable! Do you want a bestie? Just hang around me you'll get one - it won't be me, but I guarantee you'll find one, just so I can die a little inside when I see you two together.

Loneliness kills, it is fatal. One day it will be too much for me, a lifetime of loneliness and reaching out in the dark only to remain cold and alone. For now I can just laugh at the ridiculousness of it all...the predictability of it all. I'm a pathetic lost individual, but it seems to be by design. I'm not fighting anymore, not trying anymore.

1023,t3chnophile,1560321824,2,"Just wanted to rant about something, so feel free to ignore.  It just makes me feel better to get it off my chest.

I have some great friends, but there is still a void that they can’t fill.  I’ve been single for 4 years, and dating is... difficult.  I have severe anxiety and meeting people to date AND holding a conversation is nigh impossible.  I stutter, I get awkward, and I can’t pick up on flirting cues in the moment.  It’s painful looking back at the missed opportunities.

I’m tired of being alone.  I’m tired of not having someone.  I’m an affectionate, emotional guy.  Coming home to a woman is the best feeling in the world.  The feel of her arms around me, the smell of her hair.  Her softness, her sheer femininity, is soul soothing.  It takes a 10/10 bad day to a 2/10 in an instant.  Her smile, her voice, brings an incredible calm.  My love language is touch, I crave it constantly.  The little things like running my fingers along her arm, playing with her hair, or her nails against my skin, my hair, just keeps me centered.  I haven’t had anyone to make this connection with in years, and it’s painful.  It’s painful seeing couples being intimate, knowing I have no one to come home to.  Though I truly wish them happiness, it still hurts to watch.  

My best friends are married, as is my brother.  I’ve been divorced for 7 years now, and I still feel like a massive failure.  She cheated on me and was caught, fully admitting to it.  And our relationship never recovered.  Although I’ve thankfully moved past the resentment due to an amazing therapist and can, with all sincerity, wish her happiness and the best of luck.  I just can’t seem to find that happiness on my own.  At times, especially at my lowest, I feel like I’ve failed as a husband.  Other times I feel like I gave it my all and it simply didn’t work.  Now, I’m truly ready to start again.

1026,hamartiated,1560314555,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

1027,OptoBot,1560313732,2,"I've been moving around the country pretty frequently over the last 4 years or so. I've been chasing the ideal work environment. The problem is that every time I move I have to start over with people. It is an incredibly hard thing to gain traction when you know absolutely no one. I've been lucky this time around and met a guy to hang out with and we do a lot together. But I still come home to an empty apartment every day. No one to greet me. No one to care about how my day went. I have ideas on how to fill my time but have trouble focusing after the intellectual grind of my day job. I've just been giving up and watching TV in the evening and then feel guilty that I wasted valuable time. 

I generally am a pretty hardy person and can exist under trying circumstances quite well but lately I am beginning to wonder if its just who I am that is contributing to the problem. I am an intellectual at heart and spend most of my effort thinking really hard all day at my job and then coming home and thinking really hard about other things. One might accuse me of being borderline melancholic, and while I do struggle with depression at times, I am good natured in general. I used to think that there was no real reason I shouldnt have lots of friends. I thought of myself as a friendly, smart, funny, and good natured person who wanted the best for people. I have a great job, read lots of books, and work out every day.

But after being alone for so consistently for the last 5 years I am beginning to suspect that I am probably wrong about myself. I thought I had a lot to offer but what really makes me interesting? I guess I am not as attractive as I thought. I am never in proximity to like minded people. My colleagues at work are much older than I am. And I come home to an empty apartment every night.

1028,Lorn_silhouette,1560313495,3,"I think I’ve been alone from the very start. A little over a year ago I met people on discord through my cousin. We talk for a bit and got to know each other. Soon we became friends, and we made calls on a daily basis. Even as a new friend i would ask this one person if they are ok every morning, everyday. One day she told me that she had problems with her friends. This problem turned into a love triangle between her and her two friends. She needed help, but she never asked for it. Still, i helped her, giving her my advice. In the end it turned out fine. For past few months I’ve been more open to her about my depression and past. I have always felt alone and i asked her for help. I received none. As i got to know her more she started to treat me differently. She seems more happy when im not there. My cousin asked her to draw art for him (she is a very good drawer btw) and she drew it within a day. But when i asked her the next day, she didn’t finish. I was fine about this at first until the next day passed, then the next. Until 5 days passed she finally finished (btw i was reminding her about it in each day) It seemed like she cared for my cousin more than a person who showed empathy despite his own mental struggles. Every time she talks with my cousin she laughs more, and seems more happy. In our group chat, i knew all of our friend’s full names(first and last). I named them all but when i asked the girl about my full name, she only knew my first name. We’ve been friends for over a year and she doesn’t know my last name. Today she finally refers to me as her best friend, despite after all i did earlier. Im not the best looking guy, but the treatment between me and my cousin are different. This just shows how fucked up society is. Just by your looks, people treat u differently, even if u helped them out in a very difficult situation.

I have a facebook full of people who claim to be my friends, but never want to get into any video games with me. Never want to hang out. Never want to actually be there, as a friend.

Then I found a girlfriend. She was perfect for me. The whole relationship was like something from a dream. Then some things happened on her end, and her life filled up, and she really didn't have space, mentally or emotionally, to deal with a relationship.

Good thing we never went through with that private, secret, just-for-us wedding ceremony.

I tried to hold on to her saying I could give her space, I would be willing to wait for her...which was probably a dumb thing to say...but since she stopped talking to me I realize how much she has infected every aspect of my life.

Open up my steam library, and there are the games we used to play together. Go to the internet, there are the sites we looked at and shared back and forth. There's my bluetooth headset, that I bought just so I could talk to her.

It's my own fault, but the few friends I did have who would play games and whatnot got pushed away by my devoting all my time to the gf when she was available to play.

So here I am now, sad, friendless, loveless, and alone. I'm the guy who normally stays up til 12 or 1 in the morning playing games and hanging out on the internet. I found myself from 9 to 10 last night literally just sitting and staring. I listlessly flipped through youtube pretending I was trying to find something to watch, but I wasn't.

I went to bed at 10. Told my kid just to go to bed soon and laid down. Then proceeded to be sad and not sleep for the next four hours.

I've been through breakups before, but it's never been like this. My life has never been SO shattered when the relationship went away. 

I know this isn't a place for break up stories, but that's just the context. I am so alone. I sit and stare at the hundreds of games in my steam library and literally nothing interests me. No books, no shows, no movies. Those are all things I'm doing *without her*.

I'm trying to move on. But how do you as a 35 year old man start making friends? Find a game group? I just feel trapped and hopeless and I really don't know what to do anymore.",lonely,"I never understood the term ""crippling loneliness"" before the past few days.",2019-06-12 06:29:21
1041,knightofduality,1560284832,1,"  
There's probably no point to this, and I'll probably delete this post, but for this moment at least I have to spill my thoughts out.  
I'm fucking dying from loneliness, isolation, and boredom. For context, I do have social anxiety and while that has made me do extreme things at times (literally run out of a gym because they needed a picture of me), I'm basically functional. I'm in grad school and have a job. When I'm in those settings and have something to talk about, I can talk. There's other situations where I'm basically okay, but when it comes to just being conversational with a stranger for no reason, I can't do it.  
Not that any of that even matters. I have tried EVERYTHING I can possibly do on my end of things to make friends and nothing has worked. The key word here is FRIENDS. I've never had much trouble finding a boyfriend (if you're an okay-looking girl and are on Tinder, it's really not hard to find a dude who'll take the time to get to know you because he knows he'll get to smash in the end. Women ignore me though--bisexual/lesbian dating is like pulling teeth. But I digress). Anyway, point is, I have a boyfriend, and we're basically attached at the hip, but it's not enough. He's desperate for friends too, and I want him to have that. We both deserve connections outside of each other. But with the way things are going, we might as well be the last two people on earth surrounded by vaguely people-looking things that sometimes talk to us but never connect with us.   
Before anyone starts hitting me with some advice I've already heard 10 billion times, let me just list everything I've tried to make friends/treat my social anxiety in order to make friends. 

1. tinder
2. bumble
3. okcupid (back in the day when it was cool) 
4. A writing meetup group
5. a social anxiety/depression meetup group (might've worked out but it disbanded after like 2 meetings)
6. my college's lgbt club 
7. my college's vegan club
8. activism
9. volunteer work
10. staying in shape/dressing well/basically looking good so people won't treat me like a goddamn leper 
11. talked to a random person at my college's stupid 'heyday' event
12. going to coffee shops/bars/etc alone and hoping to CHRIST that some person just fucking acknowledges i exist (best result: an old couple felt sorry for me at the bar and talked to me for about five minutes before leaving).
13. meditation 
14. journaling
15. mindfulness
16. religion/spirituality
17. focusing on myself and my hobbies so i dont spiral into this exact mood i'm having right now oh wait too late 
18. four different therapists
19. three different medications 
20. and a partridge in a fucking pear tree  


I hear you asking ""why didn't any of those things work out"". Well, I'm a psych grad so going to therapy is like watching a play except the lights never go down, so you can see all the set pieces moving and all the costume changes. I know what they're going to say to me, and it's all redundant and unhelpful. As for the meds, I don't know, I'm not a med person. They just didn't work.   
The social stuff mainly boils down to living in a shitty fucking Southern state in the year of our lord 2019 where no one looks up from their fucking phones, so even the people who AREN'T socially anxious don't know how to talk to anyone anymore, and even if they did talk to me, we'd have nothing in common because my beliefs are so radically different from everyone else's (except my boyfriend, the ONE person in the world who agrees with me on anything). I definitely don't fit in with the conservative majority, but I don't fit in with the liberals or anyone else either.   
There are SO many things I can't talk about with people or have no interest in talking about. Like I can't talk about politics because of the aforementioned differences in beliefs (and I mean MAJOR differences, and no, I don't want to 'discuss our differences' because I've tried that shit and it just leads to arguments and I know no one's mind is going to change anyway so its a huge headache and waste of time).   
I also can't talk about a lot of innocuous surface-level stuff because quite frankly, I don't CARE about the fucking Office or Game of Thrones or Snapchat or whatever the fuck everyone is so obsessed with. Oh, Just talk about MY interests then? Sure, let me bore you to death with my comparison of three different versions of Victor Hugo's *Notre Dame de Paris*, and ooohhh you're already out the door. Do I have any popular interests? Sure, I'm into *Star Wars*, but probably not the way you're into it. How? Oh, nothing, it's just the sequel trilogy is my favorite and----oh, bad opinion alert, off you go!   


I'm trying to accept that all the love I'll ever have is between me and my partner. I know I'm lucky to even have that, and I shouldn't ask for anything more, but that doesn't stop me from crying at least three times a week because he's busy at work and I'm home alone with nothing to do and no one to see and nothing else to live for. I'm really not looking for advice here, because I seriously don't think there's anything left for me to try. I just wanted to spill my guts into the void and be angry and lame and feel sorry for myself, I guess. Whatever. You can make fun of me if you want or tell me I'm being ""negative"". Have at it. I don't care.   


Sorry you had to read this, if you made it this far. Hope your life is going better than mine, that you have popular interests, popular opinions, and live somewhere cool where things happen and people aren't all carbon copies of each other constantly chanting ""it gets better"" with no proof that it actually does.

Gender: Male

Age: 27

From: Michigan

Looking for (Friends, Gaming buddies, Someone to meet up with IRL): Mostly Friends/Gaming buddies. I'd be up to chat on discord or something. I enjoy having new people to talk with and I'm always looking for someone to try/play games with. I'd be happy to share my discord if someone would prefer to talk there.

Interests: Gaming obviously (FPS, strategy, rpg, action, etc. I'd like to be good at/play games like LoL and Overwatch, but I seem to have trouble actually getting good XD)

Dislikes: I think I'm with most people when I say I dislike rudeness or trying to be jerks. I'm very sarcastic, but there is a huge difference between being yourself/being sarcastic and actively trying to be an asshole.

Kids/Pets/Partner: I'm engaged with the wedding planned for next year. No kids and no pets. I'd like a dog, but the place we are renting doesn't allow them.

Interesting fact about yourself?: ....excellent question haha. I guess that I've done 2 study abroads? 1 was both Taiwan and Japan, while the other was just Japan.",lonely,Always up for new friends!,2019-06-12 05:31:12

The kind that feels like a burden you carry around with you everywhere you go, that just kinda hovers like a rain cloud. It plagues your thoughts with feelings of not being good enough and everyone hating you, etc etc. 
And then theres this new layer of depression that's found me. It's the opposite of carrying a ton of bricks around. It's a weird sense of emptiness and floating in a void where nothing matters.

Not a whole lot of people even bothered to wish me a happy birthday and a few of the “close” friends weren’t even part of those that did, only like two, and I don’t think they would’ve known if not for me sending a meme on snap or through a shared birthday in a group chat of ours 

Another thing that happened recently: I would often rant on a spam insta account bc I don’t know who to even bother individually w my problems, so I just have to get them off my chest somehow. Well some of the “close” people unfollowed w no explanation bc they don’t like that I posted that stuff. Well why don’t you, idk, ask if I’m fucking ok???

Don’t use your struggles and problems for an excuse for bringing the much needed attention, instead save it for yourself, use it as a boost for improving your life. Truth is nobody likes the person that is so focused on their problem that won’t think in a solution. Focus your attention always on the solution, better days will come if you have faith in yourself. Listen your intuition, forget about all exterior influences, your intuition will never lie to you. The only way to find someone appropriate for people like us is to improve your life, heal your wounds, detoxify your body, leave behind harmful addictions. We grow from adversity, our soul is here in this world to grow from the adversity of the world. I believe this is our main purpose in this life. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, that will only make it worst. Start now being your own best friend, have compassion for the other but mostly have compassion for yourself. We are sons and daughters of the Stars. Some advices: 1-Quit sugars, eat healthier. 2-Make a test of heavy metals, if there is something there you will be able to remove it by chelation, your life will improve exponentially. 3- Quit fear based media, quit filling your mind with fear. 4- Replace fear with love, unconditional love. 5- Exercise. 6- Be close to nature. 7.

You sit at a desk
And you squirm in a chair
You stretch out on a couch
You could fall asleep there
You lie in your bed
And you try not to think
You put on your bathrobe 
And you stand at the sink 
You look in the mirror 
And you unplug the phone
You re-read the letter 
You’re living alone

You clear out a closet
And you listen to a clock
You wipe off a table
And you pick up a sock 
The you put up your feet
And you stand on your head
You hate what you did 
And you regret what you said
You gaze at a snapshot
And you wait for the tone
You talk to yourself 
You’re living alone

So you turn up the heat
And you fight off a cold
You thumb through the Bible 
A you sit on hold
You’re your own boss 
You can do as you please
Open a window and let in a breeze 
You sit down to dinner
You cooked your own
You light a candle 
You’re living alone

You think about your love
And how did it end
Your cleaning lady 
has become your best friend

That you never were

But you just didn’t see it
You tried to be someone different 
But you just couldn’t be it

After all of it
Is that you’re usually fired 
Before you can quit

What you need is a dog 
Some goldfish or a cat
A boa constrictor 
And a laboratory rat
The end is at hand now 
And you have the means
A roll of toilet paper

I’m not okay and I’m going throughout lot mentally because of this and an illness I’m suffering with but when I try to tell them this it’s they always say you’ll get over it or that they still care but I can see they don’t.  
I don’t do one sided relationships so I just haven’t messaged them and they don’t care in the slightest so much so that for all they know I could be dead.

I now have no friends and 8 weeks of summer holidays to watch them have fun with their new friends that they’ve known for less than a year, while I sit at home and suffer.  
I don’t know if I’m the problem but it feels awful because people in my classes are antisocial or we just don’t have anything in common. 
So I don’t know what to do and it’s hard to find people my age who have similar ideas if fun as me. Most of them go out drinking every weekend, take drugs and go to motives ( parties or events with strangers) and that’s not my idea of fun.

Gym is a heaven and a toxic place for me in one big building.
I like getting tired, but also it makes me body dismorphic. Iam that kind of girl who has to literally starve to see a little peak of abs and i mostly pack my fat around my mid section, dont get me wrong, i aint overweight but hell it hurts to keep dieting and seeing no improvement there and whats worse to see teeny tiny girls with abs walking around that place. 

•Anyways thats an r/lonely sub and not r/bdd, so ill talk about the almost main reason of why i joined a new gym again. Its because of loneliness and desperation to finally find someone who might actually like to talk to me and maybe even be like me so we can hang out. 
I didnt talk to anyone much today, because i went there around the morning and there was just a couple of old people there and some really fit girls that for sure wont want to talk to my weird lookin ass. Hopeing for better luck next time.

I had a friend for 6 years who ended up dating another friend we both had met years after. They really hit it off, and to keep the story short they ended up buying a house together, everything was fine until she went on a random boat cruise. I can only assume she cheated on him and they broke up fairly fast and she ended up with the dude she met on the cruise. None of that really is my business but from that cruise point on not only did she ditch that relationship she totally ditched me too. Haven't heard from her nothing... gave it a few months to let the situation calm down and sent her a sms... Got the typical who's this reply and as soon as she knew it was me, complete silence and haven't ever talked again.

1101,FluffyStatistician3,1560163439,5,"Background: 20 yrs old, female, in a relationship, depressed, autistic, college student. 

My eating is starting to become problematic. I have no issue with weight (not anorexic, overweight, etc- in excellent physical shape), and I try my hardest to maintain a healthy diet (working on shifting from vegetarian to vegan)/do plenty of research on obtaining proper nutrients. However, I often crave specific foods when I am in an anhedonic mood. The foods are usually warm and prepared by someone else. For some reason I believe that having a certain meal will make me feel happy or interested again, and then I'll somehow feel all better. I don't know if that makes sense. For example, this morning I'm craving a specific type of crepe for breakfast. I know I'll need to drive like 30 min to get one though unless I make my own. I have this feeling like I need the crepe to make me feel better- as if after I eat breakfast I will magically feel satisfied and ready to start getting into my work. 

In reality, going out to get specific foods never seems to solve ""the problem"", whatever the problem is, so I don't know why I keep repeating this behavior. I notice it usually happens when: 1. I feel especially hungry  2. I feel lonely   3. I feel bored/anhedonic 4. My sleep schedule is messed up (sleeping all day, up all night) 

I don't see my boyfriend as often as I'd like (will make a post about that later). He's really my only friend, and I don't have a school project to work on this summer yet- trying to get into one soon so I can be keep myself more occupied/around other people instead of in my room all the time. I think the frequent trips to get food could partly result from wanting human contact- I get crepes from this specific cafe both because I like the crepes and because I like eating around other people.

This is starting to become a problem because I am constantly thinking about going to get food.

Does anyone else do something similar? I have read about emotional eating and I'm familiar with that. I also understand that food cravings can be normal and that it is human nature to want novelty.",lonely,"Specific food cravings related to boredom, sleep issues and/or loneliness",2019-06-10 20:43:59

1103,mou_ikkai,1560161964,2,"So I made a really long post before with a dump of all my feelings. Then I lost it. Here we go again, I guess.

I struggle with feeling like I'll never be good enough/never amount to anything. I'm 21, don't have a license, work a dead end job and never had a boyfriend.

On top of feeling like I'll never be anything, I deal with a lot of anxiety and depression. I always feel like I'm useless, that nobody needs me, ""what's so great about me anyway?"". And ironically I feel like I'll be lonely forever, but also feel like I deserve to be alone. Like I just don't deserve happiness.

My parents divorced when I was young. Their relationship just grew more and more toxic and eventually they just ended it. This is pretty much where it started. Where I started feeling like a burden and that things would be better if I just wasn't here. I still think that way, sometimes.

I see my father often. He's turned himself into a good man. He doesn't drink anymore and watches his health closely. Unfortunately, after the divorce, he moved out and things just became tense between us. Like I just couldn't be myself around him anymore. I love him and he says he's proud of me and loves me, but part of me just feels like that's not true. This weekend (meeting up with family members from his side of the family) solidified that thought again. (My parents marriage wasn't very well received on that side so I can only imagine what my existence means to them.)

My mom and I were always close, and still are, even through all the fights and tensions we've had. Though the past few years she has been struggling with her own depression and breast cancer, which might possibly be coming around again. I've noticed she's not really herself anymore, and her habits just rub me the wrong way sometimes. I love her, I really do, but I just can't help but push her away. She's not the mom I knew anymore.

I know I'm only 21, things could get better from here. I do have plans to get my license soon but I'm not very confident in getting behind the wheel. 

Maybe one day I will get a boyfriend/a relationship but it just feels like I won't ever establish that connection. I think I'll be the crazy cat lady when I grow older, if I even live that long, who knows.

The really only good thing about my job is the pay. The hours suck (I work nights so no life for me anyway) and the atmosphere is just so god awful and toxic. I know I should just move onto another job but it'll be hard adjusting to the new environment/pay difference. It also jabs into my working experience.

I don't go to college mainly because I don't want to. It's not a lie, I just don't really have a drive/passion to pursue in anything for a degree. There's also the financial burden that comes on top of that, and if I went and still felt like it wasn't for me, then I'd regret it more than I already am for not going.

I know I'm only 21, I haven't even been out of school for 3 years yet and all the girls my age are literally popping out babies left and right. Some are engaged. Some of my friends are graduated from college, or are pursuing a dream of theirs. I envy them so much. I don't even know what I want to do with my life it's that pathetic.

I've got no confidence in my looks. I dress like a tomboy, sweatshirts and baggy clothes. People tell me I'm cute and stuff all the time but I can just never see it. I used to be bullied back in elementary school really bad for my overbite. Long story short I got a couple of (broken) molars removed and it's receded back quite a bit. It's not very noticeable, I hope.

I think that's the end of that. There was no main point to this post, really. I've just got a lot on my mind and I just wanted to let some things out. I'm afraid to tell my family or friends about all this because then I'll feel like I'm burdening/annoying them. I really don't want to bother anyone.

Part of me still hopes that it'll get better one day. I have to. It's gotta get better, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Every day I drive my car somewhere (grocery store, restaurant, book store), eat/walk around there alone, and drive back while playing loud music.

&amp;#x200B;

I need extremely detailed directions on how to make friends, because “go to cafe/bookstore/etc.” and “be friendly” do not work.

I would leave these toxic people for improvement in my mental, emotional, and physical health since each “friend” was damaging. Yet when I see them living their best lives, I feel like shit. My life has become worse without these toxic people I must admit. They have many friends, boyfriends who deeply care for them, they go places with others, they laugh happily and such. I’m just getting worse. Nobody texts, calls. Nobody asks to hang out and if I ask to they don’t respond, or wait to respond when the day is over and there’s no point. I could lay in my bed all day and nobody will text “hey, how’s everything” yet I would always check up on others. I’m learning that many people don’t care. At school these people will talk with you but outside of school you’re a total stranger. They would talk shit about people yet smile in their faces, and completely act like I don’t exist in the process. Summer will be horrible. Like last summer, and the one before, I did nothing but work and stay in the house. I had nobody to hang out with, laugh with, cry with, or make memories with. I would try to make plans and friendships but everything was so one sided. It’s like I was putting effort and they weren’t. I would always have to text first saying “hey, you busy today?” And they wouldn’t answer, or read my message and not answer. Even the people who I think care about me most wouldn’t check up on me. I would cry at times, wondering if something is wrong with me. I don’t even bother going on Snapchat. Seeing everyone living their best lives, going on trips, laughing with friends and family angers me. I didn’t even have at least a birthday lunch for my birthday (which my mother wanted me to do with friends) because I had nobody to invite. I’m now at that point where it’s fuck everything and everyone. And I curse at myself for being this way, because this mindset blocks blessings. I’m now too nervous to make friends, due to rejection, and the hurt when they leave, or if I have to because of their toxicity. I don’t rely on anyone anymore, nor do I make them feel like I need them. Because In the back of my mind i know if I act vulnerable, the first thing that pops in my head is “damn, it’s gonna hurt when you leave” and it always. Fucking. Does. People who I’ve known since kindergarten have stopped talking to me, pushing me to the side and acknowledging my “friends” and not me. I feel like I’m going crazy sometimes.

1140,BRIDAGT,1560108629,7,"Hi, new here, 20 years old and this past month my boyfriend of 1.5 years left me, and i lived with him, so i also lost my home and it sucks, its just so lonely now. The depression from this also caused me to fail all my finals and almost lose my scholarships for college. Currently living with emotionally abusive family members who are old fashioned and don't take mental health seriously. I work for minimum wage at a crap fast food place where i just get yelled at by people all day. And almost all my friends have summer internships long distances away. My days are long and boring and so lonely. I miss home, i miss having someplace to go where everything was better at the end of the day. I miss having someone to share things with. Idk what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best way i can describe how i feel is, it's like there's a small mechanic in my heart, and he works hard to make sure everything is repaired and running, but he needs help. Sure he's done it before on his own for a long time, so he's perfectly capable. But because sometimes it's such a mess and so broken it's just too much for one person alone. He is tired and wants to take a break and have someone else to hold all the broken pieces together, even just for a little bit. But he can't rest or break or everything will completely fall apart.

""Loneliness is the human condition. Cultivate it. The way it tunnels into you allows your soul room to grow. Never expect to outgrow loneliness. Never hope to find people who will understand you, someone to fill that space. An intelligent, sensitive person is the exception, the very great exception.

I'm on a few dating websites as it's pretty standard in today's society and it's great to get to talk to people, but ideally I'd like to meet someone organically. Like I said above, the dating app scenario almost feels forced? (I know it's my choice to be on there but I hope that makes sense)

I was the only new kid at my high school when I moved and spent four years as a dedicated outlier, I tried to make friends but just didn't really fit in with any group enough to be a significant part of anyone's life. Had a job too but it was a similar deal, most of the other employees had been friends since childhood and were friendly enough, but really didn't want a new addition. It hurt a lot, as I always had to try to embrace the loneliness and assure myself that it was just the circumstances not me, but I made it through because I figured it was just four shitty years of a long life and really didn't matter in the long term. Then I went to university full of hopes...and for a variety of reasons abused alcohol and a lot of drugs for two years. I've been sober from everything for about a month and am honestly devastated. I left university for the summer realizing that I had squandered so many opportunities and not made any lasting friendships at all, so now I'm back home in another small town w/no one from home or from university to talk to and still dealing with the psychological side effects of coming off of an extended period of self medicating. I'm trying to embrace the idea that being by yourself doesn't have to mean being alone again, but fuck that. I've had to tell myself that most of my life and if I'm honest I really don't want to go through it alone anymore, but my entire world feels too shattered to be able to even try to make friends currently.",lonely,"Hello other lonely people, want to be friends? :)",2019-06-10 03:20:01

1162,hamartiated,1560067088,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

fuck. I've had a few close friends of mines unfriending me on facebook and unfollowing me on instagram. 
I hate how I became close with them for so many years
and they ask me for advice... I help them. When they need me. I'm there. But when I need someone. NO ONES FUCKING THERE. When they got what they wanted they leave.

1192,RenegadeLegume,1560011183,2,"For as long as I can remember, I have had no one permanent in my life outside a family that I've never really been close with. I don't have siblings. I grew up poor so going out with people and enrolling in extra classes and even just eating out with classmates has rarely been an option. I was also raised with English as my first language which made it difficult to communicate with everyone else because then not only was I socially inept, but now I had to speak differently from how I thought when I switched language. 

I didn't think of it much back then because I thought eventually I'd find someone or things would get better, but now that I'm a young adult I see that nothing's changed and that nothing probably will change. I don't know if I'll experience what it's like to have a circle of friends or a best friend who genuinely cares. I've stopped hoping.

It's much harder now in college because everyone has their own cliques and hobbies and support systems while I have literally no one. I've spent entire weeks with no one proper to talk to, and I think some of you can relate with the heavy disappointment that comes when no one chats you up on Messenger the entire day. The silence is pure torture and it just hits me hard every time I wake. (And now I realize why I like sleep even though I don't remember my dreams: it's the only time I don't feel lonely.)

Human life is about connection with other human lives. That's where we create and find meaning. Even ascetic monks have a community. But I don't have roots I can point to and say, ""That's where I belong!"" And if I can't point to that, how am I supposed to know where I'm going? Every day is aimless and I feel like a shell. I don't know who I am anymore and I've lost all motivation to do anything. When you're lonely, nothing matters and no one cares, and frankly I want to stop caring. It's dark and lonely and it's a miracle I haven't completely broken down yet.

I want to believe that things will get better, or that if I keep going while shamelessly reaching out I'll meet the right people who won't leave, or that I'll at least find something that makes me happy, but reality is much firmer than that and I don't want to delude myself any more.",lonely,"I've been lonely all my life, and I possibly will remain so.

1213,jayx468,1559968068,2,"It's a reoccurring thought I've been having. A lot of people are scared of dying alone, unnoticed and unloved but I'm just like ""Eh, okay."" about the whole idea. I don't really have a desire for a romantic relationship or friendship but I have been feeling kinda bothered lately. Do people really care about being cared for these days? I want to believe that they do but it just doesn't seem like it. I noticed it's very unlikely/ not doable to have a ""regular friendship"" and most people want casual friendships anyway so I decided that would be best. Casual friendship like someone or a couple of people to play games with but afterwards they kinda just ignore your existence til it's time to play again? I can handle that type of relationship. It really seems like quantity over quality matters most to people and I suppose I can understand that. Why have one or a couple people that genuinely care about you when you can flaunt and be admired by a bunch of strangers?

I guess I am a tad disappointed because I reached out to someone I met on this sub years back and after a month I had to stop because of issues and the guy pretty much said he prefers strangers and didn't really want to talk to me anymore. He claimed to not have friends and I wanted to be his friend to make him happy. It's such a shame really. I really cared about the guy and we seemed to have stuff in common. He was a part of one of those ""charity subs"" and appeared to be well liked. I thought it was better to have someone that actually cares about you rather than a bunch of people that only like you because you have them advice or brought them make up but again quantity over quality. It's something I'm gonna have to make myself fully understand.

I'm serious when I say I have no desire to be loved or care for. The thought scares me frankly but I probably don't have to worry about that. I just want someone to care about and talk to occasionally and have that someone show me appreciation because I care about them. I'm not asking for much but I would like something more than just being told I'm appreciated because words mean nothing. I think being asked seldomly how I'm doing without me always asking that question first is good enough. Is it wrong to want something because you care about someone?

I honestly wouldn't mind giving someone everything they want if I'm able to afford it but I would like some appreciation at least just to keep things fair.

I'm just really in an awkward position. If no one I come across care about being cared for I don't know what to think or do because just focus on being successful and making more money.

I suppose people like me could fit right in with the ""sugar lifestyle"" but I don't have the money for it or want to be appreciated ""that way"" if you get what I mean.

1215,dadson231,1559965000,1,"I (19M) just recently broke up with my girlfriend who I was in a long term relationship with. I thought that it was the right thing to do because I felt as if neither of us were getting anything out of it and we had talked about that constantly but it turned out I was wrong. She was my best friend and she was always there for me no matter what happened and I threw it all away. 

I’m home from my freshman year of college and missing those friends is so hard. It’s so weird to go from seeing these people literally every day to not seeing them at all and the ways we can talk is just never the same and I’m always scared that I’m going to grow apart from them. 

I also feel like my friend group from home feels different about me. I really like the idea of partying but I get anxious and awkward and never know what to say. Whenever I am in a group with them I feel like when I say something it just gets shut down or nobody responds idk I’m probably just imagining it. And this is even worse because my ex was good friends and whenever we would hangout as a group she would always respond to the things that I would say. 

Honestly I would say the hardest things are 1. Seeing everybody have fun in other places without me and 2. Knowing that I shouldn’t be feeling this way. I have a fantastic family and they are all very supportive of me in no matter what I do. I’ve always had the best opportunities to do everything and I always feel like I squander it.

1217,xoxogossipgirlie,1559963426,1,So I’ve been having a rough time recently. I’m just getting out of high school and I don’t know I feel so lonely it’s always been like this. Even at time when I am surrounded by people who I know care about me I just feel so alone. I hope I can just post this on here because I just need to talk about what I’m going through and i don’t know who to turn to really. Sorry if this is kinda long I have a lot on my mind. The last two years have been so shitty and I have no one to talk to about what I am going through. It all started back in September of last year I was sexual harassed by someone I felt close too and it really hurt me. This person has done weird things before but he tried pulling up my dress in a car full of people and I have felt so violated and disgusted by the whole thing. Then in around October I got diagnosed with pcos and it basically mean that’s cyst form around my ovaries it can make having kids a lot harder and it just took away this kind of womanhood I had I’ve been struggling with this idea that I might not be able to have kids it’s difficult I’m trying to move forward. In October as well my grandfather passed away it was just a really hard time. I started hooking up with this guy in this time to kinda get my mind off things and then he started dating my best friend at the time right after we parted ways. It really hurt me because those two people were the only people I ever really talked to about my problems really especially my best friend. She had been my friend for years and then all over a boy we stopped being friends and I lost the one person I thought I would always have. In January i got into a car accident where I almost lost my life and nobody seemed to really care that I got into the accident. I still have trama from that car accident I don’t even want to drive it gives me anxiety to even think about driving after the accident. Toward the end of the last school year I told this kid I had know for three years that I had a crush on him and he told me he didn’t like me. I later found out he started dating someone soon after I just felt really stupid I still do. So I’m general my life is such a mess and I’m sorry for making this so long I just need someone to talk to because right now I am so alone. People who I thought were my friends just end up leaving me or disappointing me I’m just really tired of always feeling like this.

I recently got out of a 3 year long relationship, and that's a good thing for me because it was no longer a healthy relationship for me to be in.  But at the same time I had gotten used to having someone around all the time, and now even though I'm no longer suffering emotionally, or dealing with self harm (as a result of the relationship) I still just feel so sad and lonely, trying to make friends, but it never feels like anyone is actually interested in getting to know me or establishing an actual friendship and it's so awful.  I'd just like to be someone's first choice for once, I wasn't even my ex's first choice (she cheated on me a lot, for example /shrug and would always be on the phone with other people when she wasn't doing that, not wanting to spend time with me) -- Not that I'm out looking for someone romantically, I'm just looking for someone to actually want me in their life, and for us to be supportive of each other.  It's so painful to be alone, and it sneaks up on me so suddenly.  It's incredibly depressing.  I just want to feel better, and I feel like all I need is human interaction. /shrug  :/

I've always had trouble making friends. All my life. I've tried every technique in the book. The only technique that worked was being a social chameleon and changing myself dependent on who I was with. Which was ultimately fake and made me unhappy. Actually sent me into a depressive episode lasting nearly 2 years behind closed doors because of how lost I felt. Only came out of it a couple of months ago. 
I've never had any ""mainstream"" interests per say without sounding like a douche. 
I'm too much of an introvert or extroverts but to extroverted for introverts. 
Whenever I do make a friend they refer to me as their ""quirky"" friend. When they introduce me to others they pull up my clothes to show people my tattoos. (I'm half covered) without any warning or consent. Or start laughing at clothing and such. Or my interests. 
I looked after someone for a year after a serious accident. They asked for me all the time, after they recovered I no longer existed to them and they no longer reply to my messages. Which hurt quite a bit. 
I'm struggling as I see my husband laughing and joking with his mates and I will admit to feeling envy. 
I don't have any friends, only people who acknowledge my messages when they need something. I meet up with them just so I can talk to someone, but they ultimately ask for money or a favour. 
I just want one good friend. 
Every friend I make lasts a few months and then shows no interest when I'm being my true self. I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong. I try to be tough and act like it doesn't bother me. However, sometimes I feel so lonely it brings me to tears. 
I've even tried joining friend making apps. Hasn't helped. 
It would be so good to have a close friend who loves me for who I am. 
I hope it's something in my personality I can change. Maybe I'm too chatty and don't listen? I can work on that. But I can't work on who I really am and change my appearance and interests. I'm not doing that ever again. 
I have no problems getting a partner obviously, it's finding a friend that's the trouble!

Second of all I'm fairly new on reddit, so I don't really know how things work out here yet.

So I'm 19/M and I don't have any real friend right now. I mean I got some buddies on Discord/Steam but I wouldn't consider them as actual real friends. Don't get me wrong they are very nice people but it takes some more for me to consider someone as a friend than just ""someone"" on the internet. Friends are people that hang out with one another and actually care about each other, I guess. 

I had some friends before like in school etc. We had sleepovers and all that good stuff but as the time proceeded we lost contact because I just like different stuff than the people that were my friends before. They liked partying and I just stayed at home and played video games. They liked alcohol and I just didn't. Plus I'm a bit introverted which doesn't help.

My relationships with women after divorce have not been worthwhile and this led for me to rely on escorts. As I have no time for friends nor entertainment I started using the internet more, reddit became something fascinating, it reminds me of old internet forums but more social and subs make it easy to be involved in specific interests. 

I feel this has caused my personality or ideas to be distorted, I am  interested in more ""deviant"" sexual interests. Not having a partner and depending on escorts has make this fetishes to develop more freely, with a wife or girlfriend you tend to keep some things for yourself to not scare or make yourself look like an abnormal person. 

It is a vicious cycle, my loneliness inclines me to do this and doing this makes me feel more lonely. I don't know if anyone related, I hope for your own good that I'm on my own this time.",lonely,Social outcast and corrupted thoughts after divorce,2019-06-08 05:23:46

I never made friends in highschool and once I graduated I left my hometown and moved to California, which was because my mom kicked me out of the house but that’s another story. 

Now however I’ve really come into my own. I have friends, I’m in great shape, I’ve had my fair share of flings, and my family here in California really loves me. 

My problem is that when all the dust settles and I close my room door and lay in bed I’m just struck by an overwhelming feeling of loneliness. It only comes when I have no interaction with anyone else. And I feel like at this point the only way I won’t be lonely is if I have a constant stream of stimulation. Yet I know this isn’t realistic. I guess I’m really just writing this to vent, or maybe find some closure.

1250,ConciousGlitch,1559909575,1,"I came home late last night after my family had already gone to bed and as I sat in the kitchen looking for a snack or something to drink before bed, I noticed that my nose had started to bleed. I pinched my nose and grabbed a napkin to help with the bleeding. As I sat there holding my nose i started to get light headed. I decided to get some water and went to go get a glass. As I walked to the fridge I started to get a little dizzy as well and I stumbled. I caught myself on the counter and opened the fridge. Seeing a Gatorade I grabbed it and before I could open it I fell (feinted?) onto the kitchen floor. I think I remember feeling my body seize up, but I don’t know if that’s just because my memory is fuzzy. Also,  a couple of weeks back I was at a concert and got light headed and dizzy before blacking out, so I don’t know if that’s what happened again or if they aren’t connected. I’m terrified though. I’ve recently been struggling with some existential dread, and fear of death, and this experience terrified me. I’m afraid I may be seriously sick or hurt in some way, I mean what if I have a brain tumor or something which is causing these symptoms? I can’t do this shit it’s not fair. I’m only 19 and I’m just so fucking scared that I’m going to go to the doctor and find out I’m dying. I don’t know who to talk to and I just feel so scared and alone. It’s times like this that I really realize how lonely I am, and how much I wish I had someone who really cared about me. Why don’t I have someone to hold me and tell me it’s going to be okay? Why do I just have to sit in bed alone crying, terrified about what is coming? I’m not really sure if this is the place to post this, but I had to do something because I’m just sitting in the bathroom at work trying to hold myself together and act like I’m fine when really it feels like my world is starting to fall apart.",lonely,Scared and alone,2019-06-07 22:12:55
1251,hamartiated,1559908629,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

1253,BearTheKiwi,1559904228,21,"16-M. Even tho I may be a young lad still, I am much more mature then everyone else around my age where I live. So I don't get along with them, sometimes I'll make a mate my age but it never lasts long. I have always gotten along with people many years older then I but what should I say during our conversations, They all have been in relationships or still are, they drink and smoke and have stories to tell of their life. I can't tell my story to any of them, going through my own hell, being another depressed young adult, if I tell anyone about that then I'll never be taken seriously let alone respected.

&amp;#x200B;

My mind is always changing ways of thinking, one day I will be thinking like a child but the next day I become a massive pervert or some super offensive 16 year old, how can I relate to the people I become friends with if I have nothing in common with them. People often come to me for relationship problems, one person will have been dumped, ""oh yea no worries mate I'm here for you"" while another might have been alone for a year or two ""oh I'm sorry, I could never understand your pain"" yet they don't understand the pain of never having someone to lay your shoulder on, or not having someone to tell your day about. 16 years I have been on this earth and only ever thought I had two partners, yet both of them were just using me, the first was someone i cared about quite a bit, she never cared for me instead she was just covering up her relationship with my best mate at the time, the second one really ruined me. I was in a very bad place in my life at that time, depressed and suicidal everyday then came along Sam, thought she was the one but I was young dumb and full of suicidal thoughts so I pay attention to the problems about this relationship, the age gap for one, the distance between us, she was thousands of miles away. Turns out it was just another cover up for her going out with a good friend of mine.

1255,osuartax,1559896815,1,"This is gonna be long. Permission to not read granted. I just wanted to actually say it instead of just letting it fester in my head. I'm from small town Ohio where are men are men and we don't talk about things. I know that sounds dumb in this day and age and I know it's stupid that I still let that dictate my life but it's how I was raised and it's a tough thing to shake out. I'm a pretty old school good ol boy but I don't think that's all bad. We still have manners and chivalry and aren't afraid of a little elbow grease. I left my life in Ohio for a life on the west coast 7 years ago and I should be happy right? I'm one of those people who was closing their 20s and all I knew was Ohio. I wanted to experience something different. I was a likeable guy and always had a lot of friends growing up and through college and I was one of those weird situations that always dated beautiful girls above my pay grade. But I felt like I never really always fit in bc I was different. Everyone I grew up with was white and we were asian. I was athletic, a pretty popular guy, and was always one of the first people to be called to do something. I always felt like I was right at that border of being a solid in the friend group and just outside. Like always in 4th place in the Olympics. I was there but one will remember. But I was always friends with the popular kids in high school and college. But I still never felt like I fit in. I played sports growing up bc all the popular kids did. I had to work twice as hard but was always on the fringe of being good. Started varsity but was never really a stud.  I don't say these things to brag about cool I was a lifetime ago or to sound like a dick but to help frame it all. I'm 35 now, have a pretty good six figure job that people would be jealous of, I go on a bunch of outdoor adventures in some of the most beautiful places, I surf and on the outside life seems like it would be great. But the truth is I'm lonely as fuck. I've dropped from fourth to to be the alternate. All those great friends I've left behind, most have moved on and forgotten about me even though I think about them everyday. I have acquaintances here and I'm surrounded by people who enjoy having me around but I can't tell if the few that actually call me every once in a blue moon to hang out genuinely want me there or are just bring polite. I can't get a date to save my life and everyone always asks me why I'm single and I always say I have different values where most women in LA are pretty superficial and the ones who aren't are all taken. But really that's just an excuse bc I don't think I'm that good looking anymore and my athletic body has gotten a bit softer. So no real close friends and no girl and no potential for either has shot my confidence down and it's cyclical thing bc my low confidence keeps me in front of the TV after work most days. Which drives me further into a funk and further away from people. I'll talk to people the 10-11 hours a day im at work but then pretty much be alone all night and all wknd. So all I do is work a job I'm good at but really makes me stressed like a mother fucker. I have $100k in student loans that I feel are crushing me. Then when I'm mentally exhausted and broken down, I go home to be by myself...again. I'm in a hole and every passing day I keep digging it deeper. I think about moving but then I just realize I'll most likely just be moving my hole but then I wouldn't have the beach, the surf, or the camping to temporarily dull my feeling of loneliness.

No matter what, rejection and the other bad stuff in life hurts, but when you have something good to turn to in that time; close friends or family, it makes it so much easier and you move on in healthier ways. It just seems like the people who have good connections and belong somewhere are those guys you see out in the world who are just ok, like they got it together and im starting to think more and more that it's because of those close connections, not that they come as a result of. Its so hard to spark these connections when you didn't grow up in a good social setting cause you then don't know how. So those of us who are ""born"" loneley are basically destined to stay so cause all we know is ""how to be loneley"" unless someone were to just selflessly invest their time on inviting us in to their circle and accepting/ teaching us. It seems impossible to be fulfilled in solitude or rather, to somehow escape solitude without help, it requires active assistance and idk how to get any. Tl;dr self improvement is always good but i think that old saying ""you have to be happy on your own before you're happy with someone else"" is bs because it downplays how connections do make people happy and without them we're stuck.

Everything was going well in my last job until I started to get bullied. I'd come home every day crying. Making up sick days. I confronted the manager and HR about it. Unfortunately it's a clique type place and because she had been there so long ( the person bullying me) they just said oh well nothing we can do you best part ways. 

I apologize now for this long post and hope it won't get deleted. I just figure a small back story. 
Anywho so the first few months were fine. Then cabin fever sets In. I get lonely bored and even more depressed. I do try and get out. Had a few interviews. Nothing seemed to work. 

So now I've put on God knows how many stone. Stopped taking care of myself. And the gap on my CV is hurting me real bad. I volunteer at girl guides which keeps me slightly active. But even then some days I feel like making excuses not to go. I do that alot. 

I sometimes think back to when I had my two miscarriages and wander if that was some underlying start to my issues. But not to put any bad light on this since I got married I changed alot of my hobbies as you do to match what they like to do. Which I didn't regret at the time. But now I've no friends. Any new hobby I try I hate.

Let me bore you with my stupid update.

I work in a team that has full time employees and contractors. Our manager is a wonderful person and she takes care of every body and celebrates everyone's birthdays and we all cut a cake.

I am a awkward person and I try to avoid such events as much as I can. I try to avoid team lunches as well. But I have gone to many of them and participated in birthdays of others.

Team also does farewells and does team lunch when someone is leaving.

I have been here for 2 years. Never celebrated my birthday. Nobody ever wished it. Manager knows every single person's birthday including mind.

Today is my last day at this company. No farewell for me. Lul. 

How do I recover from this? I cried in a separate room for good 15 minutes today. Alone.

I just get a mixed feeling here. My manager said that she will ask for my promotion. She also lets me come early and leave early. And I am the only one to be allowed to do that.

But on other occasions I have fought with my manager over small issues. But she gave me a good mid year review after my mild misdemeanors. So I know that at least they don't hate me.

Yet...

Like no matter what you do you can't be seen or heard. It's like I'm a ghost. People can walk away mid conversation because someone else has turned up or whatever you have to say just gets shrugged off with either mumbling in agreement or nodding just to seem like they're listening. Sometimes it feels like people can't get away quick enough. I'd be surprised to even be acknowledged in the mornings at work. 

Is this a part of growing up? I'm 32m btw. 

I've always made the effort with people, I used to have a loads of friends. I've traveled and I've met loads of great people none of which stay in touch. It's like I'm out of sight out of mind. I've felt like this most of my life and it's only just recently started to feel more worse than usual. I've only ever had one best friend and that lasted close to 20 years and we always felt like we were the only ones that understood each other until that fizzled out about a year ago over no reason. 

I've always got on well with my family, they're amazing people but I never got on with my extended family. Everybody else did, but me. We just couldn't click. It was like I could see them for who they really were. They always gave off the impression they were better than you, very bigheaded, 'your opinion doesn't matter' type. I was always told it's cause they're a ""different generation"" being as they're 10 or 15 years older than me so I just assumed the age gap was the issue. That was until aunts or cousins started having kids of their own and everybody took notice of them but I was still ignored or cast aside like a leper. It would just of been nice to of been asked how I was or how school was going. General chitchat or be invited out like everyone else. I used to wonder what was wrong with me and to be honest I still do to this day. You learn to ignore it but somewhere it cuts pretty deep. 

For years growing up when Christmas rolled around we would all go to my aunt's house for dinner and to exchange gifts. One of my cousin's was quite wealthy and would show off by showering everyone with gifts, no matter what age or if he hadn't seen them for years. Buying holidays abroad, cruises, high-end clothes, games consoles, experience days. (Anything that was expensive basically) spoiling everyone. Apart from me. I would get a Christmas card. Some years I didn't even get that. I wasn't jealous, I'm not the type. Again, it would be nice to be part of it all.  

I hated growing up thinking I didn't matter or that the 'different generation' quote was just some bullshit excuse. Like I said, you learn to ignore it. 

It genuinely feels like I don't exist. It's such a weird feeling. I'm a fun guy, really good sense of humour (or used to have, God knows now) I love to have a laugh and don't seem to have a problem starting conversations with anyone. I feel like the issue is I can't hold a conversation with most people anymore. At work for example, if I can't talk about welding or going fishing nobody makes the effort to talk about anything else. I feel like I have fuck all in common with anyone these days. 

I've had a few jobs over the years and just can't seem to connect with anyone anymore. I'm starting to convince myself there's something wrong with me and it's frustrating to try pinpoint what it is! It's like I'm cursed or the universe hates me.

Maybe I am a ghost? Maybe none of this is even real? Maybe I've took a huge hit off a bong and this is one big trip, wake up onboard a spaceship surrounded by my aliens mates one day and they're laughing at me due to throwing a whitey!  Haha. Imagine!? Weirdo. Anyway! 

I'm so convinced with this ghost shit that it won't even get noticed here on Reddit. I'm not an attention seeker even though this does feel attention seekerish. But I guess we'll see. 

Apologies for the rant. This is my first post on Reddit. I always wondered if anyone else experiences this. Is anyone out there!

1301,iveyjbdeykj478vu,1559818064,3,"I took my walk. Last day of school, bell rang, and I just started walking. Didn’t really know where, I just wanted to walk. See how far I could get before I had someone come pick me up. It was interesting to see what was down that road. Never had any reason to go there before. It was mostly farmland and a couple neighborhoods. I found a pretty butterfly, found a mini waterfall, and stood on a road that was right next to the end of a runway and saw a plane take off. I want to do it again, but there’s a lot of reasons I can’t. I don’t exactly live in the nicest of areas, I’d need someone to pick me up afterwards, and... Idk. It was refreshing though. Gave me a lot of time to think.

I guess the most important thing to me right now is preparing for my future and finding a girl that will always be there for me. Which is very hard to do if you’re someone like me lol. I think a lot of you can relate. Yes I lust for some of the girls I meet, but it’s always buried by the desire for love.

I’m working on really changing myself right now.  I can’t say it’s going great. I always feel defeated, that nothing will ever change. 
//
Some who know me may know that i love making a good puzzle. Those people do not know me. As hard as I try, I only lose myself in my words, and leave the others even more lost than me. I tell them of codes and riddles they must solve, but like a poorly researched Rubik’s cube t-shirt, it’s unsolvable—or rather, it is solvable, but it can’t be dissected for any meaning. It’s only purpose was to be there, to be solved. I can give them rewards or hints, but nothing will show them why I really make these puzzles. 
//
I dream. I dream of being creative. I dream of being able to thoroughly express myself. I dream of dreaming dreams that I will never wake up from. But alas, I am snapped awake every time by the cold touch of reality. I awaken to familiar scenes, so familiar I can close my eyes and they’ll still be there. They overtake everything. An invasive vision that fills my head from neuron to neuron, making a network so secure that to break it would be to shatter all that I know. Is it worth starting anew? The fear of the unknown guides me, the unknowing, to a destination unbeknownst to me. I only follow it because i know not what else to do. There’s nothing else anywhere and i can’t be alone. No. I don’t want to be alone. In the company of another I can make a cure. Another door to walk through. Another path to light the way. But the path flickers behind me. Beyond the refraction of its waves, it crumbles. As much as I hope that it does not catch up to me, it will. It always does. It always has. And again I fall. I’m left with what will never leave me. It will always be by my side, showing me a way. Maybe not the way I hoped, but a way nonetheless. Control was stripped from me the moment I took a step in another direction. There’s no escaping this path. I realize this now, that the other paths were simply detours. I arrive at the same place every time. But—it’s not out to get me. It lets me stray because it knows I will shortly return. I look closer and analyze it more each time, wondering why. And each time, I come to the same conclusion. A randomness so pure that not even it itself can predict where it might go next.

1305,ahhhimsoconfused1995,1559808807,2,"I used to be social it wasn't even funny. I talked to any person who would listen and initiated conversations with every person I came across. I graduated high school May 2018, and the summer was fun with my two best friends. But both moved away to college, which left me realizing that the only people I hang out with were those two and everyone else who I've ever talked to in school are just people that I would never actually hang out with, just school friends. I do have a girlfriend of two years, but I only see her twice a week because of work and other things. It took me two months at college before I had my first actual conversation with another student. He sat at my table (which I was by myself at)  and introduced himself, which made me really excited because that was the first time someone knew my name because I told them it. I was finally on a name to name base with someone else after two months. I immediately texted my girlfriend saying how I made my first friend! I never talked to that guy ever again though. That was the first and only time I ever willingly spoke to someone in my first year of college. I hated how lonely I felt walking to class seeing everyone walking with their friends or sitting on the couches at school talking and doing homework. The few weeks my friends came back home for breaks were the most exciting for me because I could go to someone elses house other than my girlfriends. But that was short lived. The worst part about it is that they decided to stay away for they are living in apartments at their own colleges with friends they made and are not planning on coming back home. When I found that out, it really hurt. Mainly because I am becoming forgotten about because they have new friends. I've been in this weird depression/lonely rut for the last 9 months and It has changed who I am. I am  no longer social in public anymore, and at my job I avoid personal contact.

1306,walterGw,1559802762,4,I've been watching as all my friends leave my home town for the last 3 years now. Most of them went off to college or university right away and stopped talking to me in any form since then. Some of them will come back to town during their breaks and all but one refuse to speak to me at all. I have only one friend that lives nearby but they've been ghosting me for about 2 weeks now. I don't know if I've just been too needy or what. In the past I've been able to keep my depression at bay with the idea that I'm working all day/week (I work 12 hours a day 6 days a week if nothing goes wrong at work) to be able to see someone who gives a damn and just do whatever with them but I don't think there's anyone like that left,lonely,A dying town,2019-06-06 16:32:42

Tonight has been extremely hard for me. Im fighting back suicidal thoughts. Im trying  my hardest to find reasons to stay, but I feel like I hate myself so much. I just want to run away from my own life. I wish I could fall asleep so I wouldn't have to feel this pain. 

My birthday is coming up in 2 weeks  and it's been bringing me down just knowing i'm gonna have to tell my family the situation I'm in. 

I'm currently looking for work, i've gone to school for psychology and I used to work in  plumbing, heating  and air conditioning in the Bay area for 4 years. But then decided to move back to LA for family. I got injured at work when a grinder landed in my arm. Luckily it missed my arteries and tendons so i still have function of my arm just a nasty scar and PTSD. 

I have two dogs that are my world now. 
I make music, produce  beats,Dj, and host Cannabis Catered Events all over southern California.  My favorite artists are Mac Miller, Kid Cudi, anything from TDE ( Kendrick, scHool, Rock, Soul ,Sza, Rashad) J.Cole &amp; Ty Dolla $ign. 
I enjoy hiking, music shows , raves, the beach everything typical. 
I'm active at the gym. 

But yea I need some friends who want to go out, or chat through messages or  just want to watch some movies or do free things near by. I need distractions so I'll make sure to respond. 
 I won't hit on you or make you feel uncomfortable. Most people who I hang out with say I'm chill.  I'm a great listener and I'm usually free all day until I start working hopefully soon.

I am attractive, confident, and I would consider myself fairly interesting and fun to be around. I have a bunch of friends and do well in social situations, yet a relationship eludes me. I have been involved with a few women both sexually and non sexually, yet none of them were people I would want to be with for the rest of my life. I truly do want to find someone I can spend my life with, but it seems like such an enormous insurmountable task.

1315,hamartiated,1559783997,6,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I met someone 3 months ago and spoke daily, it was so nice. I made a terrible mistake with her and it really hurt her. The guilt is killing me. I miss talking to her. I just hate feeling this emptiness. For the 3 months I knew her I finally felt some freedom from my anxiety. I'm tired of just putting on a brave face everyday. I just want to feel normal for once and I did for a while. I've never felt truly loved, but for once I actually felt liked and it was nice. I also accidentally told her I loved her, which may have been too soon but what I meant was I really cared for her. I was afraid of losing her the whole time which is maybe why I tried to hard. I don't even care about myself at this point, I just want her to be happy. I've lost over 12 pounds in a week over stress and worry for her. She probably thinks I'm scum, I've tried to contact her but she won't even speak to me. I liked her a lot and it felt like such a natural friendship.

I'm 22M &amp; I've always been kinda lonely. But it's been really difficult since the last two years. 

My idea was to keep working all the time. I thought by drowning myself into work I will not have any time to reflect upon the fact that I'm lonely, it didn't work quite as expected. 
Even while working, if I was rewarded for something good or having a bad day, I've wished to have someone to share this with. 

I have a few friends but they're quite older than me, they're married and have families. We rarely see each other and don't get to talk.

I never been in a relationship, the longest someone has gone out with me was 4 dates.

I’m the person people like to take advantage of. My family keeps saying “You’re fine” “Just be social” this one is my favorite: “Just get over it”. I’ve been told that so many times when I try to tell people how I feel lately. I hate it when my teacher tells us to partner up because my 2 friends in that class partner up or I don’t get one. I hate it when I get left out of things, my friends always talk about how much fun they had that weekend or they make plans without me. I’ve been trying to get myself involved in it and they simply ignore me. I hate on the first day of school trying to find somewhere to sit at lunch without being told to fuck off. It’s like people forget I exist, I been thinking if I was gone will anyone notice? I’m truly starting to believe that no one likes me and everyone fucking hates me. I get bullied for being the kid that no one likes and being so “weak”. I’m only weak because people kicked me while I’m down. No one seems to notice when I’m crying, no one cares. I’m being bullied for having different opinions, being too masculine for a female (wearing guys clothes). My family looks at me like I’m a disappointment during family reunions for not wearing something “lady-like”. Like for fucks sake Karen I just wanna be comfortable in the cold weather. I have so many insecurities because my parents compare me to other kids, “How come you don’t have straight As like him?”, “Why does she have nicer clothing than you do?”.  (Parents/Soon-to-be-parents please don’t say these things to your child it’ll stick with them). I’ve been trying so hard to impress my family and friends and all I get is bullshit in return.

I had a group not really friends that I always sat with at lunch. They barley talked to me unless they needed something. Never texted me even tho they had a group chat called squad. They never invited me to their group hangouts. I got a job and started making money. We always at the end of the school day went to the nearby store before catching the bus. They always asked me to buy them shit and I did because I am very nice. Plus I liked the attention for once. They left me when I bought them stuff. Eventually I met a girl  that I liked and ditched my shitty friends. To join her group of friends. She made me really happy even though she never liked me at all. Shortly we all became somewhat friends but something was off just like the other group. They never texted me. They never talked to me. Never asked to hang out. She ditched me first chance she got to be with her friends. Let’s go to my job now. Guess what THEY NEVER TALKED TO ME EITHER!!! I’m like what the fuck is wrong with me. Are they afraid of skinny white 19 year old who looks like he’s 10. I don’t get it. My family never speaks to me as well.  Every gathering they laughed at me because I never had a girlfriend yet. So there is that. People ask me what I did on the weekend or whatever and I literary have nothing to say because I just sat in front of computer waiting for something interesting to happen. The only words I speak now are idk or nothing because I haven’t talked to another human being in years. I never look people in the eyes and fear them when I walk by people. I am fucked. Fast forward to grad. I graduated and didn’t get invited to the after grad party so I just went so I have at least one high school party. Met my friends from both groups. I didn’t get drunk because I am afraid I’ll be a sad drunk or an violent drunk so I just sipped on the same beer for like 4 or 5 hours. The girl I liked was wasted and then she put my hand on her boob in front of all her friends. I was weirded out as shit because I don’t touch people let alone in public. Her and her friends say “haha that’s the only boob he will touch.” I faked laughed and then went off alone for a bit almost crying. After I left that was the last time I ever seen or heard of any of them. They haven’t texted me once and it’s been a year or so. Still haven’t got a job haven’t started college. Because I am a coward and afraid. But after all that bullshit I am not suicidal. Never selfed harmed which is odd to me. I still have hope I will do something great.

I’m seeing someone, and I have posted about this a lot in several other subreddits (mostly deleted them). Things are rough right now, I continuously feel like I am putting in more of the effort than him. He often does things that irritate me and when I speak up about them to him he either gets mad at me and ignores me for a while, or tells me he understands and then continues to do those things.

Then I have my friends, but as much as they’re there for me I just feel like I’m troubling them with all my problems. They’re most likely sick and tired of listening to my issues that I just give up trying and instead I push them away and tell them I’m fine. When I guess I’m not fine.

My family are always there for me and are super supportive, but they’re all working (I am looking for work) so they’re all super busy which means I don’t see them often.

1361,an_iron_giant,1559682012,3,"One thing to understand about social skills is that they are like muscles. The only way to get better at socializing is to socialize. Stepping out of your comfort zone, no matter how hard it may be, is your best bet at meeting new people. Good situations like this are self improvement places and specialty stores such as gyms, rec centers, hobby/craft shops. As strange as it may sound, role playing groups (the groups that LARP) are very friendly to newcomers as well. I've met people who say they've made a personality flip from an ""antisocial"" individual to a rather outgoing person. If you live in the US, chances are there's a group like that near you.

This might sound a bit like a broad stroke, but the best place to start in a lot of situations is to start small. Start with small talk. If you get anxiety from small talk, the best thing you can do is ask relevant questions ""What do you do?"" ""How long have you been doing that?"" ""What would you say is your most/least favorite part of that?"" Something you shouldn't do is be the only one asking questions, this is a conversation not an interview.

1369,Copperdoo62,1559676393,2,"I’m a 19 yr old male and for the past 6 years I’ve been stuck in what many people in my life seem to call a “rut”. After going through a rough upbringing filled with traumatic episodes of physical abuse, arguments, and bad blood between the two sides of my family, I realized early on that life isn’t what its made out to be. Growing up I always knew my folks had problems, and when they split I tried to be their for both of them, putting a huge toll on my mental health. My father is one of a kind and has had a plethora of bad luck that’s come his way and tons of baggage to go with it. To sum it up he is simply an extremely mentally unstable person. Though I have  say he has the kindest heart of anyone I’ve ever met in my life he has issues with his anger and his bullheadedness gets in the way of logic and reason. My own problems didn’t start till I lost my friends back in middle school, around 12-13. I had no other outlet to get my anger out about my parents divorce but within the small group of friends I hadMy father confided in me things that he shouldn’t have. Late at night when he would sleep on the floor in my bedroom after a night of him and Mom arguing, he would give me details I frankly didn’t need at such a young age. On top of that he would talk down about my family members and instilled a sense of uneasiness on who to trust even within my own family at an early age. Life simply spiraled out of control from there with flairs of what I thought was happiness but was simply me masking the everlasting void inside of me. After the 4 years of back and forth the divorce was finalized and my father moved to the next town over in a decent little 3 bedroom home. My brother lived with him for a while and Dad as well as his wallet fought hard to get him there. My father drove him insane. I’m a lot like my father and my remaining family makes sure I’m aware. Dad eventually moved to Arizona to live in the same neighborhood as his parents, and to my luck after years of being lonely I met a girl online who happened to live in Arizona. I wasted 2 years of my life trying to make a long distance relationship work by the grit of my teeth just to meet her once for a week. The rest of the time I spent in AZ was spent fighting physically and verbally with my father. Miserable I returned home realizing that all the chances I missed with girls here in my home town were lost because I thought I truly loved this girl. I realized after meeting her that it wasn’t going to work out. I was simply infatuated with having someone around to talk to. After being completely alone with no friends for about 3 years at that point I decided getting with her was a good idea. But all it turned out to be was false hope that some day I would just settle down with this girl my first girlfriend who I met online and that was all I needed. It was insanity! I made it work for about a year after meeting her. Returning home from Arizona I found my mom had met a guy and at the time I was happy for her. Me and my mother had a close relationship for a long time. I told her everything. She soon married the guy within a few months of meeting him, and this is where it all truly started. I was unstable coming back from Arizona and breaking up with my girlfriend not long after, I needed support and wasting the first two years of high school with a girl 2,100 miles away kept me pretty isolated. My mother began neglecting me and I became angry and borderline insane just like my father. In a few months time I was drinking myself to bed every night out of depression and sheer loneliness. Eventually my Mom put me in a group home where I lost my shit for a week straight. It wasn’t the place for me from shitty bunk conditions to complete alienation from the outside world, it wasn’t the place for me I wasn’t a harm to anyone. My mother claimed to be afraid of me and while I admit I got in her face and yelled in heated arguments I never would have put a hand on her. After leaving that ward I threw a party at my house while my mother and her boyfriend were away, it got too crazy and was shut down and so happened to be perfectly timed to be the day my now stepdad proposed to my mother. Now I liked this guy at the time and he liked me, there was no bad blood. Thing got worse between me and my mother as time went on and my stepdad didn’t like it. He proved his distaste in me when he went to the extent of cutting his own jacket in half and displaying it for me to see just because I wore it. Ugh I feel like at this point I’ve been typing forever and nobodies even going to read this... Anyway to make a long story short I got heavy into drugs to try and kill my pain. Hanging out with the wrong crown and getting in trouble with the cops. Doing anything from crack, heroine, xans, molly, you name it my broke ass was doing it. Wrecked my car got kicked out of school and arrested all in the same day. Somehow graduated high school through a local program for basically degenerates. At this point I’m living with my grandparents, I have been for a year and a half now though I told Mom it’d be for a week. I had to get away from it all. But its bittersweet here as well. The friends I have no are good heads to be around but the house I live in and the family around me do nothing but remind me about how dull life really is. My uncle owns the multi million dollar home I live in with my grabdparents on my mother’s side. He got in an accident in college on the swim team and was paralyzed from the neck down. My grandparents take care of him, he got money from lawsuits at the time I believe he was in his 20’s in college. Everything around me reminds me of how life and society truly are. The race to the finish, self betterment, making money, getting the things we want in life why strive for those things? I see myself in the dimmest light possible. I feel disconnected from the few friends I have, alone in my head. I hate the way I look and everything else about me. I honestly couldn’t tell you why I feel the way I do I’ve just been here for the ride like everyone else. I don’t seek therapy because if I was honest I’d get put back in a ward. I can’t get meds that I want because I was on 9 months probation that I finished back in December. The material aspects of my life are fine my family is well off, I lived in a nice house even before staying here with my grandparents but I still hate life and all its aspects. I’ve lost all hope of having a good future, finding a woman and settling down. I’ve sealed the deal in my head that I’ll be dead before I’m 25. I feel nothing not joy not anger nor sadness but just this numb feeling every day. As if breathing was a hard task I wake up to my monotonous routine of either working, smoking weed with the boys, or sleeping. Women don’t find me attractive even when I do end up meeting them. I wasted my High School career with a long distance relationship, I go to a commuter college so its not too easy to meet girls. I’m just so engulfed in my self hatred and hatred of society I feel theres no hope for me. I’ve tried many times to strive for betterment but why get better when bad things always come our way? Why not just stay numb? It seems theres nothing I can do anyway. This message goes out to whoever sees it, takes the time to read it, and maybe see solace the fact that theres someone else out there struggling as many people do on this sub.

For quite some time I felt like I was stuck in a loop where I could start out by having friends and suddenly drift away from them after quite some time, it happened during my years in elementary, middle school, 1st half of high school, 2nd half of high school...

And now, we begin college.

For the first two semesters I've got the chance to meet a group of friends that are attending the same careers as me, it felt like I've met them for a long time, we were there for each other, we could crack out jokes and laugh, it felt like I actually belonged somewhere after previously joining groups where I simply didn't feel comfortable with back then.

During 2nd semester there was a lot going on, I forced out my personality and humor to keep the friendship consistent (and it went horribly wrong), some started leaving the group for personal reasons, and I was getting ignored and got left there like if I was some kind of weird guy talking to himself around strangers.

I don't really get it, there was another guy that got treated the same but was able to reach out to them and then be in good hands again. I tried to figure out, apologize and fix what was wrong and now there doesn't really anyone in the group where I can talk to. All I've gotten was either ""Oh most of the time you get off topic when we talk."" (bullshit), ""Just move on then."", ""I don't know."", or no answer. I'm aware that one of them is scared of me for some reason even though he was a close friend of mine.

About an hour ago I got into a minor car accident, it was totally my fault but it also didn’t help that there was a sign that was almost completely blocking my view. I am  and have had my license for about a week (short I know but this will come in later). After getting out and assessing the damage I see I dented their back driver door and put a few deep scratches in the paint. Well, being a new driver this freaked me out and after swapping info I get in the car and call my dad and then sit in the car and cry for a bit. Like, I could have hit the breaks a second later and it would have been much worse.
Well I drive home and have another short cry in the driveway for a few then go inside and see my dad getting off the phone with our insurance and my mom watching the tv. I start crying again because I’m really shook up but instead of asking if I’m ok or giving me a hug my dad walks PAST me to go inspect the car and my mom doesn’t even glance in my direction she just tells me to go empty the dishwasher.

I see people on a regular basis every school year (junior year of high school right now) and yet, out of hundreds of people, I can't seem to talk to a single one out of fear and anxiety of feeling like I'm not worth anyone's time.

My ex left me 3 weeks ago, and it's been a long and hard 3 weeks.

2 years back, I was at a different college. I made a few friends but I gotten myself distracted. As a result, I failed a few classes, and lost any money that help pay for school. I had to get a job and pay out of pocket and have to go to a different school just to be near work. 

In order for me to not repeat history again, I limited my social life. At best I made small talk to people that I sat next to in class and I petty much gave up friends. 

The second reason why I thought this was a fine idea was because I thought the only person that I need to socialize is with (that the time gf) my ex.

Now I'm alone. I been talking to people in class but with little success. At best i made a few acquaintance, but no phone numbers, no username on social media, and no invitations from people. 

It doesn't help that I'm stuck in a loop too.
For the pass 3 weeks, it's been nothing but a repetitive day. Wake up, go to school, go to work, go home, do some homework, check reddit, go to sleep and repeat. Monday through Thursday, work all day Friday, and half on Saturday, with nothing to do on Sunday. That is my whole week and it repeat itself every week.

I feel like I lost all will to try anything new, and to go anywhere. 

I can even go back to my old self. I used to game a lot but school made me slow down and when my ex left me, I stopped.

1400,Nausea_,1559613385,0,"So here's a fun story of my obsessive mental tendencies to hopefully ease the loneliness of all of us.  There's a new girl at my work who caught my eye as soon as I was introduced.  The ordeal feels hazy in my recollection, and I often associate this haziness with a heavy attraction.  I've felt it before a few times prior.  It's the same as feeling lost when you look at someone in their eyes.  Sappy, right? I like to think that she felt the same. 

Just kidding.  Well, sort of.  I'm not crazy, I can separate mental fiction from reality.  But as soon as the thought is introduced within the realm of possibilities, what else do you do?  You pluck at it and flirt with it.  Wrap yourself in it; get it in every nook, and don't you dare miss a spot.  It's not my choice, anyways... these things just appear and reappear in the mind without permission.  Now, already, this poor woman is my mental subject due to a simple greeting, one of which was entirely out of her control.  This is life's fate in the modern corporate era - yes my children, I knew your mother was the one as soon as we exchanged a half-hearted shake of our hands at my cubicle. I knew she felt the same as soon as I lightly said a greeting and lost half of the message to my mumbling. This conversation between myself and the children takes place among all four of us at some small cafe on a cool Saturday morning, sun in the sky, with our two darling children probing away with questions of our historical matters.  I ordered pancakes, she's more of a parfait girl.  Get the picture?

Over the course of two weeks I have had multiple conversations with her in my head; pounding away at her poor, defenseless soul with my endless virtues, truths, and beliefs - all while she simply takes it in and maybe nods.  She already knows my childhood woes, my dearest insecurities, and some of my home-Ec skills.  When the day gets difficult, and I get wrapped up in my emotions leading me to completely question the purpose of it all, her image appears in my head.  It's pure meaning, her image telling me to improve myself; the image is something to admire, something to respect, something to love, something to work toward, and to claim that it's mine.  I think of the mutually beneficial outcomes of our exchanged nurturing, and I think of how we could make choices together that would not merely just give life meaning - but how it would maximize our short existences with pleasure, understanding, and happiness. I think of how any two people can do that, and the magic that it entails. I think about what they can accomplish from it all, and what we can all accomplish from it, collectively.  

I've spoken with her a few times not in my head; no mention of virtue, philosophy, or belief.  No mentions or prying of our respective food preferences.  So we can be assured that I am not some aimless wacko - but dammit all, isn't it something?  It's a choice few steps and a few words.  That's all it would take for all of this to unravel.  The freedom of it gives me nausea, and the choice to ignore it gives me sadness.",lonely,"Being weird and lonely is a strange mix, isn't it?",2019-06-04 11:56:25

Looking back at my High School years I was never a very social and open person, I believe I've always been seen by my classmates as more shy, reserved, introverted in general. I don't think they're wrong if they actually see me like that, however beliefs tend to shape behaviors and so I've always had the feeling that because they perceive me like that I ended up being left out. It's not like I was alone all the 3 years I spent in that class, as a matter of fact I'm pretty sure the times I was actually on my own during school time were far more rare than those when I'm in my classmates company. Despite this fact whenever I'm around them I still get this sense that I'm alone, as they're the ones who do all the talking and I just stand there listening to whatever they're talking about, sometimes I'm not even sure whether everyone who's in there even knows I'm there. As a result of this something that accompanied me throughout that time (and still does) is loneliness, and sometimes, when I'm at my worst, depressive thoughts. This is rather funny because it affects me quite a lot but I still do nothing in relation to it, I just let it be. I'm aware I can do something to try and revert it, for instance I can come out of my comfort zone when talking to my peers and try and interact with them more, but I do none of that, I don't have the will for such a thing. I'm not quite sure why that is, perhaps it's the fact that I find most of my classmates very uninteresting given that I have nothing in common with them, perhaps it's because they mostly do small talk or talk about other people's lives and cars, and I'm not a big fan of such conversations, or perhaps it may also be because I went into the 10th grade with the mentality that I'd only be around for 3 years with those people and afterwards I'd go to college and most likely never see any of them again, which kind of put me off the idea of establishing and developing relations with others because I'd stop seeing them anyways, so I thought ""What's the point?"". Nonetheless there's at least 1 person for whom I care very much in that class which I could consider to be a friend, as I'm more comfortable around them, but even in that case I don't see it as anything permanent, besides the time I spent with the person in school we never hang out nor text, so I believe there's a big possibility we will never interact with each other again once I leave for college. Also the way that friendship (if I can call it that) started is very unsettling, as for me it seems like the person only got close to me because of my grades, which kind of hurts.  


But basically as a result of my experience in High School I'm now putting a lot of hopes that College is going to change my social life (in a positive way). Obviously I don't know whether that's true or not, however given that so many different people frequent College and that I'm going to a course that I have a fair amount of interest for, I just have this idea that it will be easy to find like-minded people with whom I'll actually create long-lasting relationships, or at least that's what I hope for... But here a problem arises, what if my expectations won't correspond to reality and everything will just be the same or even worse than it currently is? That scares me a bit, as I'm not sure I'll actually be able to handle such a thing.

Okay but enough about this, I've said too much for now. What do you guys think of my situation? And is putting a lot of hopes that in the future things will just get better a good thing?",lonely,Feeling down because of my social life,2019-06-04 07:14:31
1408,eeriemoon69,1559596301,2,"So, I turned 25 y/o this year and have been reflecting on my life so far. I realized I haven't made many friends since I graduated high school and the friends I did have I lost touch with because such is life. Since then I haven't really made any friends entering young adulthood, and when I did I managed to fuck up those relationships someway, somehow (e.g. get drunk and say some things I shouldn't).

Outside of my parents and this one friend I have who actually is more of a girlfriend I don't have anyone else. I feel pathetic for always only hanging out with her and when she's busy with her other friends and needs time away from me (which I fully support) I feel even more pathetic when that means I'll just be at home alone, probably crying. When I think about that I get sooo sad. And it's not like I don't try to branch out and be more social. If a group of people invite me out I have almost always agreed to go out with them (and have). 

But lately, I'm not sure if it's my own securities getting in the way again but if I get invited out I decline because the inner voice inside my mind has more and more to say: ""They're inviting you because you're a loser and they're just being nice. This is their form of performing a charitable act. Nobody wants to actually be around you, or speak to you. You're too socially awkward and boring. Don't become another burden for someone else.""  

I mean when I do manage to go out with my acquaintances I can't stop my anxiety from controlling my every thought and it's such a mess. I can't fully engage in a conversation or contribute meaningfully. It's embarrassing. 

I'm not looking for advice or suggestions or anything. I know what I need to do in order to be more social and make friends, but it's a matter of getting past the intrusive thoughts. I guess I just wanted to put my feelings out there and hope maybe someone else experiences a similar thing?",lonely,Inner voice continues to fuel my anxiety,2019-06-04 07:11:41

So there was a camp there and I immediately went up to her and talked to her. I knew it as soon as her first words came out of her mouth she was perfect and I would be the luckiest guy to get together with her. In that camp we spoke a lot and when school started we got even closer. We even went on s date together which was probably the best time of my life. I was able to be truly me. When the date ended I didnt kiss her or anything. I was way too scared to do any of that because I thought that it.would fuck everything up. So then after the date wr met at school the next day and I couldnt hold it in myself anymore so I told her how I felt and she told me that she really likes me but we can never be more then just friends. A world broke inside of me. I didnt come out of my room for a whole day and I barely ate. My friends came over after my mother called them. They got me going for a long time. That time while I was recovering and that time was really like a roller coaster. One day I was really happy and on the other I wa sso sad I wanted to jump in front of a train. After half a year of forgetting there was another camp where we both got drunk and we held hands for like 10 seconds. That was the only night in my life I thought that I finally have a reason to live. But that was it. After a week and the camp had ended we went separate ways. But I still saw her at school every day. 1 month passed and she got together with a guy I was really close with earlier. And then I got so wasted I went to her place and her boyfriend was there. They came to the door I was standing there with tears in my eyes and asking for redemption. The boyfriend went in so that we could talk. I told her everything about rhat I fell in love with her and she told me that I am an obsessive asshole and that I am not good for anything so then she slapped me. After that. I went to a shop and bought more alchohol and got so drunk a group of homeless people attacked me and robbed me. The next morning I woke up at home... She found me and she called my mother. I saw her in the morning sitting at the end of my bed hoping that everything would be alright. Me, lying in the bed half naked with huge bruises on my head I told her.

1416,Oscar454star,1559592178,3,"I honestly think I have an unhealthy obsession with trying to build/rebuild a relationship with women who clearly don’t wanna be anything more than just friends with me. Whether if it’s Friends, Exs, and/or total strangers i cling onto them the moment they trust me and tell me how important i am, And i always fall for someone who Always there for me and try to kindle/rekindle a relationship,but in reality: all they see is a friend and nothing more. I can’t be so forcefully positive about the future with someone because more often than not: they don’t see/share future with me so early in my relationship with them. It’s a harsh and brutal lesson for me to learn. But I just can’t expect someone to fall in love with me no matter how long we’ve known each other or what we’ve been through.

And I’d hate to say it but: I don’t think relationships are meant for me.....I honestly think it’s okay for me to give up on something that was never bound to happen.. just because I’m important to someone doesn’t mean that I should fall in love with them......

I was falsely accused of rape at age 17 (while i was a sophomore in high school and also kept on stalking me on facebook as if nothing ever happened), one of my ex’s faked her own “death” just to get away from me even though I didn’t do anything. Another used me as a wallet and treated me like garbage calling me hopelessly brain dead, retarded dumbass etc (she even hits me sometimes) Another one never bothered to show up on any of the dates we planned and just blocked me out of nowhere and the one time I asked a girl out she legitimately said and I quote: “it must be hard being that fucking stupid!!”  My fear of relationships has gotten so bad that I genuinely have a phobia to talk to women let alone be in a relationship with one.

1418,hamartiated,1559582054,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

It’s hard talking to people. I have a really hard time talking to girls especially (and I AM girl). I need to make girl friends though because most of my friends, whom I talk to seldom, are guys. I love them but sometimes it’s hard to relate or whatever. I don’t know why I don’t talk to them more. I think during the day I really like being alone and I keep myself busy. But at night, everyone is asleep or partying, and I feel kind of lonely.

Anyway I met a girl online and she lives pretty close to me (when I’m not at university) and she’s super nice. I’m hoping to go out with her on Wednesday to a fun little house show. She just moved to the area so it seems like she wants to make friends too. That being said, she’s already made a ton of friends already and is really good at socializing.

This beautiful person, she felt like a source of light, if you're a kids movies nerd like me, to quote hotel Transylvania, she was a zing. Figuratively speaking, she lifted the rock up, peaked inside and said hi. Anyway, you all know about that feeling, from fantasy or experience or movies or all three.

1448,artistotle,1559526054,8,"Hello everyone on here, this is my first post and I'm a first time user of Reddit. I am a twenty-two year old woman living in Canada. For the past few years in my life, I have experienced sustained periods of loneliness, mostly due to unpleasant life events, but also because of some defence mechanisms/fears that have originated from trauma, bullying, etc. I have not been able to find my tribe, even after almost a year of therapy now, and I feel so sad, so lonely, that I decided to come here to feel like I am no longer thinking/writing in the void.

Here are some of the worst things about loneliness, from my experience of it:

*  **There is nobody to share stories with**. If something makes me laugh, I have nobody I can call, or gossip with, or simply text throughout the day, or after work. I suppose that is something one could live with, but it gets much harder when there is nobody for the hardships, which there have been many in my past. I feel imprisoned in my own silence, and I wish there could be at least somebody who could recognize my pain, look closely enough to see it in my eyes or hear it in my voice.
* **It is hard to leave the house**: in our very social world, it is hard to eat out alone, to go to the cinema alone, to take oneself on a ""date"", or multiple such ""dates"". I am sometimes embarrassed in some settings, and if I am not, I find it difficult to put myself in such settings and watch groups and/or couples around me, in what seems like hermetic circles that further emphasize my isolation.
* **I start wondering if there is something fundamentally wrong with me**, which lowers my self-esteem: should I change my behaviour? My interests? Should I refashion myself to find company -- if so, how to do so, and how long could I sustain living the life of somebody who is not me?
* **Likewise, I start experiencing unfounded resentment: what's fundamentally wrong with others**, that they do not care to spend time with me, or ask me how my weekend was, suggest to go out for drinks and dinner? Ultimately the opposite of the point I bring up above, this is also toxic to the psyche in that I further isolate myself, trying to rationalize an explanation, thinking and overthinking at night - how to fix this loneliness that sometimes feels unfixable.
* **As time passes, one misses out on opportunities**: my nineteenth, my twentieth, my twenty-first, and my twenty-second birthday were spent in isolation, and the ones before that were only celebrated by my mum. I have cried on my birthday this year, when I realized that nobody remembered me. In the morning I stayed at the same subway station for some time, not wanting to confront the day to come, which again further highlights the absence of people in my life. I sometimes wonder how many ""opportunities"" time will take away, should the loneliness be prolonged, and how many years more I can take.
* **The boredom:** I enjoy reading, crafts, going for walks, attending lectures. But there are so many hours in the day, that it is often hard to fill them with entertainment without some kind of meaningful social life. There is only so much sleeping one can do, so many ideas and projects one can accomplish alone. The boredom that accompanies the empty hours is the hardest to the soul.

These are just some aspects of loneliness that I thought of bringing up today. It feels better already to write it out not in the void, but to this website, knowing perhaps some of you will relate.

Sometimes I like board games but I’m too shy to introduce myself to groups. My pc games are mostly single player. 

It’s a conflict between what I want to be and what I want to feel. It would be nice to be hugged by a friend. I hug my pet and it feels nice but it’s not like hugging a person. And I will try to get out more and approach people. Just scared of rejection. It makes me cry sometimes.

She seemed real nice and never did I get the feeling that she was uncomfortable or just being ""friendly"" and wasn't interested. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically she gave me her number and told me to text her, so I did. Messages never went through though (I've never been blocked before so I didn't know that when your number is blocked, texts will never be delivered), so I brought it up to her on the last day of class. When I went to text her and show her that it wasn't being delivered, to my surprise it actually did go through and I saw her receive it. So I didn't think anything of it and she told me to text her again later since it was the last day of the semester and we didn't have any more class together. She even said, ""I'll see you later"" the last time I talked to her.

I felt like this would be the best place to share my feelings. I have spoken to family, but there is only so much support they can give. I'm not really sure how this could be replied to. Mods, delete this thread if you want. I just need somewhere to pour my feelings.

I feel deeply lonely. My heart stings. I'm a 16 yr male and find it very difficult to make friends. I'm diagnosed with tourettes syndrome and ADHD, and find it hard to interact without getting too hyper and seeming strange, or not getting involved enough.

I do not click well with other teenage males. I have 2 friends; both male and my age. One is an online friend who is very accepting and laid-back, and I praise him for that. The other is a classmate with autism, which I have 'experience' with as my younger brother and primary school friend also have/had autism, plus we share an interest in gaming. All other males, I struggle with. I'm not sure what it is, but I always feel very alienated around most of them. As for girls... except for family, I have not spoken to a girl face to face in about 3-4 YEARS. While I am in the mood for a relationship (just for comfort and cuddles, I'm rather asexual), I don't have many options and feel lost as for where to hunt friends. I don't see people I can see myself communicating with, and those I do often feel out of my league.

I don't go to mainstream school; there are only 3 girls in my class, all of whom I fail to connect with. They aren't my type, to keep things simple. Besides the one I mentioned earlier, the boys are worse and have dabbled with things like drugs.

Family are wonderful, but I don't think they solely can fulfill the hole in me. My parents are amazing; understanding and wonderful. My sisters play Mario kart or poker or whatever, and that's great. My little brother games with me. But I don't think its enough. I cant bug family to constantly spend time with me 24/7, and I'm starting to get bored of spending all day playing Skyrim, or any game. I don't go out to bars or whatever; not really the outgoing type. My classmate isn't either so we don't hang out outside of class. There are places to go, people to meet, and things to see. But I don't feel involved.

Maybe I'm just overreacting. It could be the boring half term or the GCSES getting to my head, or the horrible hot summer air. But I fear that things can only get worse. What if there are no girls i like in my course next year? What if I don't make any new friends and only isolate myself further? What if the friends I have now drift away?

If you read the whole thing, thanks for caring. I mean it. Really. I'm glad there's a safe haven where I can ask anonymous strangers for advice and where to look for more to do with myself. Whatever your reply is, knowing that people are reading this makes it all hurt a little less. Who knows, maybe next year I'll meet the perfect one. Or even just some people that are ""good enough"".    I should probably stop spilling now. I just don't know how much longer I can wait.

Thank you so much

1477,McFossil,1559480583,1,"24 m here and holy fuck I miss being touched. I'm single living in NYC and it's almost mind boggling that it's gotten this bad. about two years ago I ended a 3 and a half year relationship for many reasons, namely moving to Buffalo. afterwards I didn't have much trouble dating around and finding companionship although last November things just sort of stopped. I got a new job that would have me moving to NYC, I was sleeping on couches while looking for an apartment  and the idea of dating fell to the wayside so I could focus on standing on my own in a new city. I really shouldn't feel so lonely. I live with two of my best friends and have a large social circle of people who genuinely care about me. I'm very extroverted and have no trouble meeting new people although for some reason I can't bring myself to admit to anyone that I have this deep, burning desire to have anything close to intimate in my life which is what brings me here. Therapy should be the obvious answer because 7 months is really not that long to have gone without touch and this feeling is likely irrational. People in this sub suffer much worse and I'm sorry if this post comes off as whining I just really needed to put this out there for someone/anyone to see. a friend jokingly patted my back after I offered her a drink and that was the warmest I've felt in recent memory. I've tried to really put myself into my hobbies as well as focusing on work and exercise but recently nothing seems to be helping. online dating feels more and more like a waste of time after countless hours of swiping and ghosts. I suppose it would be easiest to just hit up a bar and see how that goes.

I think the thing i miss the most is having a friend. a connection with someone you so fully trust and being yourself around them where it doesn’t feel forceful or worrisome of what i’m saying. My last “real” friendship was when i was a teenager lol. what i mean by real is, irl friends. i know that online friends are just as much of real friends as irl friends but what i often find the most difficult in online friendships is the physical aspect of it. 
“can we talk?” “would you want to hang out” etc things that can further the friendship. When you meet someone let’s say at the market or somewhere public you’re already faced with the physical entirety of that person. It can be a lot easier to tell if you’ll click, wnd already seeing each other face to face and so  it’s someone you wanna be friends vs when it’s online you don’t really find out until chatting beforehand. 

it often comes with the illusions and idealising of those people. As much as i want to believe that someone actually wants to be my friend, even though they’ve never met me is what brings me panic and disappointment.

1512,anonsweet,1559432841,1,"Leading up to this point I think I realised my friends weren’t really my sort of people any more, I tried to cling on to them and tell myself that I still want a close friendship with them, but part of me knows I don’t and I feel so judgemental and mean but it’s that feeling of “I can’t unsee what I’ve seen” and Now I see such difference it saddens me that I feel I no longer belong in such a group. They aren’t bad people at all and they’ve done nothing wrong, I hate myself to “look down” but I feel like I’m growing and they aren’t.  I feel frustrated and I don’t want to anymore. I don’t want to control and change people because it’s not my role and it’s not helpful for anyone. I need to move on but don’t know how.  

I’m on holiday at the moment and Ive been feeling anxious and not good the whole time. They are so oblivious to their ego ruling their lives, image obsessed, fakery. I can feel my resentment and my desire to fix creeping in, suggesting “hey why don’t you try this” and it’s probably appears critical. I feel so sad and upset that the people I thought were my best friends aren’t anything like me anymore. Nobody wants to face their problems and just validate their whole lives away. I have a lot of anxiety about this sort of stuff and I prefer to be around people who want to better themselves and challenge, reflective and intelligent beings who are ambitious with themselves, and I feel like I’m just being picky and selective and high maintenance but I just don’t feel happy around people like this anymore. I feel disheartened by so many humans, but not when I’m around the right people, I feel inspired and amazed and excited and then I switch back to feeling a bit sickened.  I don’t hate humans at all,  I love them so much, but I resent so many people close to me. 

The problem is, a lot of people are like this and it’s so easy to slip in, including myself; it’s easier to become part of it than challenge but now I’ve seen the other side it’s like, wow, not everyone is like this, we don’t have to be frauds.

So I'm 21, Male, I read comics, watch anime etc and I play this game on console and on this game when you slip out of a rank it's hard to climb back up but recently I got lucky and found this person who dropped down from a higher rank on purpose to help people rank up and she was this super cool girl. We started messaging on console putting a x on the end of messages, we told each other our real first names (she said my name was cute and that I have a nice voice) and things and it was nice, we played this game together and had fun you know but one day she asks if I have Snapchat and I didn't but she says I should get it so I said sure, we then sort of agree to send each other a picture of ourselves on Snapchat the next day which I was super nervous about because I don't usually take pictures of myself but she says she doesn't judge or anything and we both joked about how we're ugly and we're both saying how we doubt that things like that, so I'm like cool but to my surprise she sends me her picture after we go off console that night and she's you know attractive and there's a nice message attached to the picture so I decide to send her one of me that night too and I feel something of a connection to her..... 

And I dno maybe I'm imagining it but I just felt this connection cut out when she replied to that picture of me, like the day before she messaged me on console if I was home so we could play but the day after that picture exchange there was no such message and I suddenly felt like I was I dno chasing after her and bothering her to play with me or something, she doesn't reply to me on Snapchat, just looks at the message and that's it and the cute messages on console have just kinda stopped and I'm going to be honest, this hurts a surprising amount because I always told my best friend (who has a girlfriend) that I'm not actively looking for a girlfriend like I'm not on dating sites or anything, I'm just waiting to meet the right person no rush which I truly believed.... Right up till now and while I don't necessarily fancy this girl I play with on console it was nice to have those sort of exchanges and have a connection with a girl again and when I felt that connection disappear I suddenly felt this absolute wave of loneliness and unhappiness like the feeling that sending her my picture ruined this nice thing is a really painful feeling and I'm not really sure how to deal with it and now I can't escape this feeling that I need a relationship, basically everyone where I work and all my friends have a partner and I'm just there.... alone, am I just so unattractive that I can't even make friends now?",lonely,I Need A Connection Again (Not Wi-Fi),2019-06-02 02:55:27

1531,danielr088,1559403080,2,"Preface: no im not trying to brag about having a girl, this was literally the only close female in my life. So i have zero non-acquaintance females in my life as of now.

Background: Originally I was friends with this girl up until around April since last mid-June 2018. We would text nearly everyday up until February. It slowed down after but we still dm’d and texted each other. We had already hung out about 4-5 times from when we had started being friends in June. Anyways, I got into some argument with her last month and she forced me to meet her in person to admit my feelings for her (that I like her more than a friend). So I did and it’s mutual. 

We started making more of an effort to see each other after classes even if it’s for just 10 mins. We also upped the flirting over text and social media a bit (We haven’t explicitly said we’re dating or anything yet to each other but the feelings for each other were definitely there) and also opening up to each other more. Anyways, on Saturday we went to a big park to hang out and we ended up making out in forested area for the first time. The rest of the hangout ended up going well and that was that. 

So I told her to meet me in person the next day so we could speak in person about something and we ended up getting into a discussion and her telling me how she “doesn’t want me to get the wrong idea” and she “doesn’t want any labels” and she’s “scared of commitment” and I said yea i agree we’re not bf and gf *yet* (it’s too early) but in the future i may want that. I don’t know if she was so much on the same page with the second part but, despite that, she did say that wouldn’t mean she’d be going to go around talking to other guys (which I believe because she’s not that type) So I just told her to be honest with me and to just tell me if that was it and if we should stop now if she doesn’t foresee a future as I do and she all she could say was “i dont really know” 

Anyways that night I removed her from my snapchat because she was taking unnecessarily long to answer my message and it got me a little annoyed. So yesterday I hit her up on messaging to ask her to not leave me hanging and let me know what’s up. After her taking so long to reply, she finally told me that she thinks we wouldn’t work out. This really came out of nowhere because things seemed to be going well a few days before. But when I asked her to explain further, she said she thinks “things were going too fast and she got ‘confused’ (when i kissed her)”. Then we both spoke about how we felt about what we had. I still felt like there’s something missing though because she also said how I should’ve told how i felt and speeded things up earlier - basically contradicting herself. But I told her how I felt she was special and how I was finally ready and able to open up because i didnt want to miss out on her and then I finally let her go (so to not cause an argument) and she said she “felt the same”

I honestly don’t know why she couldn’t just communicate about this earlier when I had met her in person or even the day we hung out at the park or any other time.

Let me tell you she was SO. DAMN. DIFFICULT. to get answers from or get a point across to her over text. We would sometimes get into arguments (on text) because she just couldn’t answer simple questions and I had to repeat it over and over which made it seem like I was being annoying or something. But i just dont get how when she’s finally able to communicate about everything that’s when she wants to break things off.

I get that maybe I shouldn’t have “pushed” her to answer me but she’s the type to completely forget about you and not initiate texts first for days on end so that’s why I had to ask her to make sure she wouldn’t forget.

I really did like this girl though, she’s literally perfect for me and EVERYTHING i wanted. I didn’t want to miss out on someone so special. I didn’t want to be quick to throw everything away of months of getting to know her and working on this and myself. I just can’t believe this happened. I feel so hurt because I spent 10 months to almost a year getting to know her and this feels like it came out of nowhere. To just throw it all away. But the worst part is knowing that she probably won’t even be thinking about it or feeling sad or hurt or not care or anything 💔😪

1540,MacNoggins,1559379668,15,"The other week I passed by a party as I was entering my apartment building. It was up on the second floor balcony. The sounds were what I noticed first as I rounded the corner. All the music and the thumping and cheering that comes with the gathering of 20-30-something-year-olds. 

As I opened the gate I looked up and saw well dressed people holding full glasses and smiling. One of these shiny people might have glanced down at me but I might have imagined it. It was almost like that eerie feeling of looking at a very famous and beautiful painting in a museum. 

I was coming back home from the liquor store (admittedly preparing for a night of grim introspection) when this happened. How odd, though, to stare at a group of people both so close and yet so distant.

Any one of them I could reach out to and ask: ""How are you? What are you thinking right now? What's your name?""

And the scary thing is they might answer and I'd be trapped like a rogue cell. Dividing and multiplying like so much social math.

But... Maybe the shiny people up there on that second floor balcony are like me, maybe we are all like each other; trying to stay afloat in this overly crowded public swimming pool.

But... Maybe if I nod at someone, smile at them, say hello, they might smile back.

""I see you! You are there and I am here! We are both alive and the world can be beautiful if you let it!""

But... Maybe, and this is a stretch, maybe you and I have seen each other on the street, in a coffee shop, at a bar, or as I was crossing the street one day.

Maybe you nodded to me and smiled as we walked past each other. Maybe you made me smile.
And maybe this life isn't as fucked up and tragic as it appears.

1546,zeeainie,1559369245,1,"I’ve always struggled at building relationships with people, that’s why I was really glad that I met this “friend” of mine in middle school. She was persistent and at first it got on my nerves but soon we eventually became best friends. We went to different high schools but we still talked to each other everyday until some time near the end of freshman year. She would start leaving me one word texts and evading my phone calls and not really texting me back. Not too long after this started, it began to feel like she was ghosting me. 

I was extremely devastated as this was my only decent human connection that I thought I could sustain forever. Months went by and we barely spoke to each other, I saw her post pictures of her new friends and I saw her refer to them as her best friends and it was like she had forgot about me. There were times where I would curl up in ball on my bed and just cry and ask myself “what did I do wrong?” I was completely alone...again. 

After a really long while, I finally got over it. I got used to not talking to her all the time and finally didn’t care. I finally accepted that we just grew apart and moved on with my very lonely life. But somewhere during the summer between sophomore and junior year, I started hearing from her again and she suddenly wanted to hang out with me more. Obviously, I’m very confused as it felt like she made it a point to cut me off not too long ago but I accepted. It’s been almost 4 years since she out of no where decided that we’re friends again.

I’m the type of person that when you do something like this that hurts me deeply and I finally get over it, I’m done with you emotionally.  Yeah I forgive her for pretty much ghosting me for about 2 years then popping up out of no where and yeah we now hang out every now and then but she’s no longer and will never be a priority in my life anymore. Before, she was all I thought about, all I ever wanted to hang out with, I would constantly put her happiness before mine and at that point in time, she was the most important thing. As I said before, I suck at peopling so the fact that I even made a friend was so great that I felt I had to do anything to maintain it even at my own expense. Now, I realize that she wasn’t all that great as a friend and that she only really hung out with me because she was bored and not because I was her friend. 

Today, she only hangs out with me when she’s bored and she talks shit about me to her more important friends and thinks I don’t know. She’s kind of horrible and she treats me like an after thought. Last year at a combined nontraditional high school senior prom, she ditched me after only half and hour for her more important friends. She’s also dating my ex( I legit don’t care as I often forget we were even together) but tries to rub it in my face. 

She sucks as a person kind of but I don’t usually try to make a big deal out of the dumb shit she does because as I said before, she’s not a priority and I don’t think about her like I used to anymore but recently, she’s just been all over the place and it’s been driving me insane. 

What really gets me though, is how she’ll go on and on about how *SHE’S* always forgotten and how *SHE* has no one when she literally ghosted me for 2 years, ditched me at prom for her more important friends and she constantly disregards *MY* feelings but ok. Go off I guess. I also don’t have *ANY* friends and I literally mean *NONE*. I’ve been feeling really insignificant and super unimportant and lonely for a while now, but I’d rather feel like this than have her as a “friend”.

She makes me feel even more alone than I actually am and she’s making it 10 times more frustrating to cope with me already being completely lonely enough.",lonely,"My “friend” is annoying (I’m so sorry it’s long, I’m venting)",2019-06-01 16:07:25

1554,The_Lone_Musician,1559360349,4,"The title says it all. I'm goddamn terrified for the future. I feel as though the moment I graduate that it will all go downhill from there. There are a few major things I hope to accomplish in my life.

1) Somehow find a way to make a living off of creating music

2) Meet my ""soulmate"", for lack of better words 

3) Get married

4) Have a child/have children

That is what I wish to do in my life. However, there is a lot going against me. Let me start simple and then make my way to the more dire issues.

The first issue is that I found my passion quite late in life. I didn't find my passion until a year or two ago, and please note, I'm already a Junior in high school and I'm about to be a Senior. I haven't been able to even partly master my passion, and I'll be thrusted into the adult world quite soon. I couldn't be a music teacher, since I'm not skilled enough to do so (not yet at least), and even then, I don't want to be a teacher. I do plan on going to college for at least two years, but that plan may even change, and the classes will only slightly benefit me. So, the minute I graduate, I'm essentially fucked. And my family isn't exactly supportive. My brother suddenly found that his passion was no longer his passion almost half way through his first year of college, so he dropped out. He hasn't heard the end of it, and that was nearly a year ago. My mother called it ""pathetic"". I couldn't handle that. I truly couldn't. Not to mention that the way the world works nowadays almost ensures that this dream will never become a reality. Anyways, I'll move on. I could go on for hours if I really wanted to on this subject alone.

The next reason is that, in America, you cannot survive off of minimum wage, and the value of a high school diploma is dropping more and more every year. Minimum wage (in New York State, as of 2019) is $11.50 before taxes. That's pretty good for minimum wage, but even that isn't enough to live off of. A one bedroom apartment is usually around $1,500-$2,000 or more, from what I know at least. Minimum wage only provides a little over $1000 per month, and even that might be a bit of a stretch. My facts may incorrect, and please correct me if they are, but if what I say is indeed true, then I can't even have a bummy job and a bummy home. Remember, I didn't count food cost, health insurance, car insurance, etc. So, it's either homeless, or a laughing stock and disappointment to my family. Both are essentially the same, though. 

The next reason is that I'll essentially be alone. My only closest friend (who is like a brother to me) will be going into the airforce for nearly a decade right after highschool. Besides that, all I'll have is my family, and I already described how they'll most likely treat me. I haven't a significant other, which depresses me every day, and I haven't many friends. I'll be, virtually, completely alone. My mental health is fragile as is, but enduring even more isolation, alienation, loneliness, and depression than I already do will shatter me. I don't even know how I'll handle it. It'll be a miserable existence.

And, the last one I'll list since, again, I could go on for hours, is that nobody seems to care about anybody but themselves nowadays (or at least the majority of people my age). Nobody cares or looks out for one another. We're all lost in our own worlds. I feel as though the world is connected completely via the internet and such, but we're still somehow so far apart from each other. Nobody seems to care at all. It really depresses me.

That's all I've got for now. Sorry for the long-ass post. Let me say for a second that I know I'm not entitled to anything at all. I just wanted to come on here and vent my fears and frustrations to people who, generally, get it. Any advice is appreciated, and thanks for reading. Have a good day/night, and cheers. 

P.S. I apologize for any typos. This is a long post, and it's about twenty minutes until midnight for me. I just couldn't be fucked to read and revise this.   XD",lonely,I'm terrified for the future.,2019-06-01 13:39:09

1574,Slumish,1559325219,7," 

Let me go back in time so I can tell you exactly what I've been going through for the past nearly 2 years.

I had always been an outcast. Everyone I've ever met has had the notion that I was this weird kid instilled into them by other kids at school. I was always looked at as that one quiet kid who hardly ever talks and has little to no social skills. I had a small group of friends and I was always going in and out of the Principals Office on the daily for stupid remarks that I would make.

&amp;#x200B;

I never really had a high school experience... or any school experience for that matter. I always avoided clubs and large groups because I was always looked down upon and I would never ever want to talk to new people because everyone had already gotten a bad first impression of me due to what other people would say about me. I felt so isolated at times. I felt as if I was in a deep dark corner by myself. No one knew what it was like not being able to go to certain parts of the campus without feeling the need to look over my shoulder since I was always targeted and blamed for mischief by this group of people who'd I'd consider to be the ""bad kids"" since they were honestly a group of pothead fuck ups that I had gotten into lots of feuds with throughout Middle School.

&amp;#x200B;

For my 10th grade year, I moved to a new high school (which was literally right across from my old one on the same campus) since I wanted to start fresh and actually get respected for once. I felt so accepted and people actually saw me in a good way. I met new friends.

&amp;#x200B;

And I had even met this one girl (Let's just call her Alice) who I had 10th grade chem class with in my old school that I attended before I got locked up and she was very... loose?... to say the least.. I had sat next to her in class and I always heard her talking to the guys and girls around me about very sexual topics such as preferring her male partners having a smaller penis so she could have oral sex with ease and whatnot.. One day she told me she had a fetish for skinny guys (I was a 115lbs 5;7"" twig at the time) and I had honestly just cringed.. I crawled into my hoodie and felt so awkward about it, but I actually felt like hitting on her because why not I guess!

&amp;#x200B;

On October 24th 2017, 2 weeks after my 15th birthday, I was held in custody in a Juvenile Detention Center for various charges including Accessory in Robbery. Rumors were spread around my old school, and I was apparently feared by a good amount of people from what others had told me. During this time, I felt as if I had nobody. I met lots of new people in the foster home / rehab that I was in and they always teased me for being ""afraid of pussy"" (I was rather quiet and very honest about how far I had gotten with my past girlfriends). And I honestly saw it as a wake up call. I felt so ready to get out and go back home and try to do what I thought I had been missing out on when it came to the opposite sex.

&amp;#x200B;

(Fast Forward 6 months to when I served my sentence)

&amp;#x200B;

Once I had gotten out I felt so determined to meet new people and maybe even get a girlfriend and have my first serious long term relationship now that I felt as if I've grown up and I felt much more mature.

&amp;#x200B;

I met this one girl (Let's just call her Alice) who I had 10th grade chem class with in my old school that I attended before I got locked up and she was very... loose?... to say the least.. I had sat next to her in class and I always heard her talking to the guys and girls around me about very sexual conversations such as preferring her male partners having a smaller penis and whatnot..

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really know her all that much, and I honestly didn't think she was all that bad, so to make a long story short, I ended up falling for her really hard, and she wasn't open to having any sort of relationship with me. She ended up hooking up with an adult considering the fact that she is still a minor and I just had to pull myself together and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

I had blocked Alice on social media on September 1st of 2018 so I could get over her completely, and sometime around 20 days later, I had started talking to someone who I had known about that I had 3 classes in back in my Freshman year of High School. For the purpose of this, I'm going to call her Jade. Jade was different, she was older than most students in her grade and she seemed very nice and outgoing. She was one of those people who talked to everyone since she liked company. Jade had always tried to talk to me in English class but I was too shy and when we started talking on social media, she'd always tease me about me staring at the floor in a playful way. She had told me that I reminded her of her sister's ex boyfriend and that the moment she had layed eyes in me, she wanted to know everything about me, (she would constantly try to give me signals but I was completely unaware. She admitted to having a crush on me way later on)

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was cute and I honestly really liked her since she didn't really mind all of the rumors people had made about me and the stories about me getting incarcerated. I liked how she could look past all of that and accept me for who I was. (She did this for everyone, so it was a cure and a blessing at the same time... More on that later...) I ended up talking to her a lot more and we ended up flirting with each other, and I eventually made her my girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

She ended up opening up a lot more about her older sister who had passed away when Jade was in the 7th grade, and she told me how her sister's ex boyfriend stuck around with her family in order to support them and Jade emotionally. (Lets call this man Raymond)

&amp;#x200B;

At the time of Jade's sister's passing, this man was 16, and he himself passed away in a car crash 5 months prior to me talking to her over social media when he was only 19 and serving the country if I am not mistaken, and right off the bat I felt weird... she had told me how Jade and Raymond had gotten very close to each other despite the creepy age gap...

&amp;#x200B;

And she told me lots of stories about how she and him would cuddle and watch movies together, she even opened up to me and told me about both him and her were high on the couch watching a movie and they had accidentally ended up making out, and he had bit her lip so hard to the point where it bled... Which at first got me furious to think about, and I expressed it very thoroughly with her and she had apologized for sharing such a disturbing memory with me. I asked her if she had any feelings for him before his passing, and she would always say no.

&amp;#x200B;

She even ended up telling me that if I didn't text her or try to contact her at around the same time that I ended up doing so, she would have most likely committed suicide from the anxiety and sadness... which I had no comment on...

&amp;#x200B;

She told me he tried to ask her out at one point, but she declined the offer because it seemed so messed up and disgusting.

&amp;#x200B;

She had always compared me to this man... and how I reminded her of him so much... I mean.. hell, I even wore the same cologne as him coincidentally... And it had always creeped me the fuck out..

&amp;#x200B;

She was very different from me, but I still managed to connect to her, despite the differences in interests, hobbies, and music. It was so strange having someone stick around with me for so long since I had never been in that long of a relationship before in my life. I had shared so much with her and she had noticed that other people would treat me like shit, and I felt so accepted by Jade. I loved her so much.

&amp;#x200B;

I had texted her for about 5 whole months without seeing her once because we went to different schools. I just decided to grow a pair and tell my mom that she was just a friend and I would like to go to her house, so I did just that. On March 8th 2019, I got so fucking high to the point where my heartbeat felt it would play ping pong with my rib cage, and every time it beat, it felt so numb and fuzzy. I saw her walking out of her house and I felt shocked... I just felt as I were falling in love all over again. I saw how short she was compared to me (I'm 5 foot 10, and she's 4 foot 11) and I just smiled so hard and hugged her... I felt so happy.. and immediately, we started talking and teasing each other. There wasn't any awkward silences or anything... I felt as if I was made for this person. I had a tour around her house and my heart stopped when I saw a photo of Raymond on a shelf near her TV.. I brushed it off and just ignored it.. We walked around her neighborhood and I had started hugging her and just admiring her.. I treated her like a queen...

&amp;#x200B;

We had sat down in her porch after a long long walk and it was around 9:30 pm, so it had already been dark. She played the music she listened to (Marilyn Manson, Shiloh Dynasty, Joji, etc...) and I honestly vibed so well with her.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I had started to kiss her hands and neck, then I started thinking about how I had never really kissed my previous girlfriends.. I had always kissed girls in the way that I'd kiss a relative or something (lol) So we both leaned in with our eyes closed and I kissed her right then and there. It was hands down one of the most beautiful nights I have ever had in my life with someone.

&amp;#x200B;

She had texted me when I had gotten home about how she was scared about me going home because her and Raymond used to cuddle. And I felt so sorry for her loss..

&amp;#x200B;

One month later, she had started to act very very distant from me. When I'd try to express a concern with her, she'd reply with a ""..."" or a ""-\_-"" and it honestly pissed me off.. She had shown me someone named Henry on her Instagram that was bothering her, asking her for nude pictures. She blocked him right in front of my face, and a week later she sent me a screenshot of a meme she saw, and she had a notification from Henry on Snapchat. So I asked her, and she had lied to me, telling me it was a ""Jimmy"" that she had blocked. My blood fucking boiled. I didn't really mind her talking to some fuck boy, but I got mad at the fact that she'd lie to me like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I even heard stories of her male friends at school trying to undress her as a joke. Which got me pissed off because she must have been giving them the inclination to act that way considering the fact that she was an outgoing person who forgave people very easily, and she'd basically let people walk all over her. Which I had always tried to tell her not to do, but then she'd throw a big fucking fit.

&amp;#x200B;

On May 17th 2019, I had the worst date I have ever had in my entire life. I went to her house and the light from her eyes had vanished. She was acting so disrespectful and I had not seen her in a whole month. I sat down on a bench near a museum with her and she didn't want to kiss me, let alone even hug me. I got so furious seeing this sort of behavior from her, I didn't even want to tell her because I thought it was just all my head, and I thought I was being immature about it.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she had to make me leave 2 hours earlier than usual, and top it all off, she was ignoring me the entire time, and I felt so disappointed. She gave me two letters that were so bland and basic. They were in black ink on white printer paper in cursive. I felt so cheated and played. I understand that young love dies out pretty often, but this just seemed so cold. I felt as if I wasn't a good enough replacement for this Raymond guy... And I felt so used.

&amp;#x200B;

A day after she had told me she wanted to break up with me since she felt so distant from me, and felt as if we had nothing in common, when she insisted that we were very compatible at first. I felt so mad, and I accepted her friendship afterwards for two days since she told me that she might possibly return back to me if she felt as if it was ""the right thing to do"". I wasn't going to simp and chase after a girl. So 2 days later, I tell her this isn't going to work, and even if you take me back, you'll only do the same thing again.. She had replied with ""Ok......."" and then replied with a kiss emoji an hour later which I left on read for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

She tried to text me 3 days ago, telling me how her friend said she should check up on me, which I found very shitty because she didn't even worry at her own fucking will.

&amp;#x200B;

And last night I put the puzzle pieces together and realized what she saw in me... It was only because I was a replacement for her. I feel as if she used me for emotional support.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I wasn't a good enough replacement for this dead guy. I hate him with a passion... But I feel as if I have no space for hate in my heart. I just want to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I befriended a girl who accepted me for who I was despite the fact that she heard lots of rumors about me going to jail and being an outcast, I made her my girlfriend, and she was only into me because I reminded her heavily about an older friend who I believe she had a crush on, but then became cold and distant when she realized I wasn't the same as him. Now I lost a friend who actually seemed to care alot about me... I just want friends",lonely,I just want someone to show me how much they truly care,2019-06-01 03:53:39

1576,Zenithiah,1559321040,3,"Sometimes I just really hate who I am. It’s so difficult for me to relate to my peers for a lot of reasons. If I could pinpoint all the reasons, it would probably be my interests, ADHD, and circumstances lately.

I guess I’ll start with the interests. This will probably get taken out of context and posted to r/notlikeothergirls, but whatever. I have trouble connecting with other women. I’ve been a tomboy for as long as I can remember, and I’m also a big geek. I’m really into rock music, guitars, and PC gaming (I play a lot of MMOs). I’m either really bad or uninterested, or both, at the things many girls my age talk about. All of the girls I’ve been able to actually talk to usually stick to topics like grades and who’s pregnant. I don’t want to sound judgmental of them for being domestic, because it’s fine if they’re that way! I’m saying I just can’t relate at all and neither of us will find meaningful connections in each other.

As for my ADHD, it makes me just bad at controlling my emotions and hyperactivity. I don’t have medicine anymore either (problems with insurance). When I do make friends with someone, I get very attached because I’m just not used to it. I’m really bad at reading the room, so I can never tell when I’m annoying people. That’s when people start to distance themselves from me or outright ignore my existence. And the cycle just repeats from there.

Now for the icing on the cake. I’ve moved cross country twice 4 times in the past 8 years, so any lasting relationships with people have had the rug pulled out from under them. I’m now homeschooled, so the possibility of making friends at school is ruled out. The only time I get the opportunity to interact with people my age (and they’re not even my age since I’ve failed a few grades) in real life is when I go to church. However, the conversations are very surface level because as I stated before, I don’t relate to the girls in my youth group at all. I’ve only had one actually meaningful friendship in my life, and that went out the window when he killed himself. I haven’t gotten over it despite it being 3 years. 

I’m starting to believe that I’m a freakish NEET who is destined to be lonely. My depression keeps getting worse and last night I was on the verge of overdosing again. I just fucking hate life and hate being lonely.",lonely,I Wish I Could Relate to My Peers,2019-06-01 02:44:00
1577,throwin_rocks,1559318611,3,"I basically have no friends. Never really ever had a best friend but have a couple of acquiantences that don't really care about me more or less just want something from me. Married with 4 kids. Wife is never happy with anything I say and do and puts me down with sly comments that are probably passive aggressive but when I tell her that, she says she doesn't do it and I'm just whinging. She has plenty of friends and better relationship with the kids so I feel if we split then my loneliness will probably be the death of me, but I'm miserable if I stay. 

I'm the breadwinner and work is fairly full on along with running a side business, so it would also make their lives hard if that income stopped. I feel like I have social anxiety. I would much rather never go out to social occasions because I never have anything to say or share when others always seem to have a bag full of funny stories to relate to every topic that comes up. It makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable. I feel like I may have depression. I see other people when out having huge laughs and so much fun, but none of it seems fun to me. I don't actually know how to have fun or what it feels like to laugh out so loud. It's almost like I've heard the funniest ever stories and jokes before and nothing can make me genuinely laugh anymore.  Seems to be the easiest way to describe it. I have zero self confidence and my will to live is probably quite low. 

So yeah...I don't know what to do. There seems like there is no way out...stuck in an underground cave with no light and no direction to go.

I have zero motivation for my work, would love to just quit and be a hermit working from home in my business so I don't have to deal with idiots or office politics. 

No one knows I feel like this. My wife knows minor parts but again, if I've ever said I feel depressed she writes it off and says no you don't. None of my family know any of it. I've joked about wanting to die first out of my wife and I, and other KMS jokes but mine have a serious background whereas she thinks it's all just a joke. 

How much do you relate to any of this and if so, have you had any sort of diagnosis that can help out me on a path.

Thanks for reading. I know there are others out there that feel similar pain that may be worse than mine and I only wish I could offer you something to ease your pain or loneliness.",lonely,Not sure what to do...,2019-06-01 02:03:31
1578,MrBlowie,1559318030,3,"Most of the time they don’t even fit in with the context of the post for example, “my bf/gf bought me this thing” in no way do we give a shit that you are with someone nor does it make the post better but it just advertises that you’re in a relationship. It hurts anytime I see one because it makes me feel worthless and empty because of the amount of times I’ve been put down and the lack of motivation/ social skills I have to get in a relationship.

I don’t think people care and they think it’s normal and everyone is in a relationship so they can just post about having one.",lonely,I’m sick of “my bf/gf” posts on Reddit,2019-06-01 01:53:50
1579,engiuser,1559316163,6,"I was/am an introvert, and I am at the highest social point in my life right now than I have ever been. While it may not be much by other people's standards, I have gone from having no real friends to some of the best ones, actually 3-4 of them. But I realized that the more I try to be social, the more lonely I feel. Previously, I kind of had the thinking that it's just me for me, at the end of the day, and I didn't know how fun it could be if I were social. Now that I have seen a glimpse, it leaves me wanting more, and that's why I feel lonely more often than not.

It's not like I could have fun with just anybody; yes I do have my type, and I don't...I basically want someone intelligent to discuss intelligent things with. It eats me that I don't have someone I can talk to whenever I want (I'm single), and that it would just feel like I'm putting my burden on someone else if I told them all this.

1580,letsrunaway99,1559315662,42,"It's like a lot of people have that special someone they can talk to about anything, share their favorite things with, and hang out with on any occasion. But like, I don't have that, and that person seems like such a necessary part of life to keep you grounded. Not having her is just, wrong.

It also makes me wonder, how can someone not have a best friend? So many people seem to already have them but maybe I'm just so unordinary and can't find a best friend like me. Not to mention there's way too many people in this world and most of them by default are incompatible with me.

It's not just hard, but like, it's wrong and weird. I should have my best friend. Everyone should have their best friend. Things would be so much better that way. I don't know what went wrong.",lonely,It feels bizarre and fucked up not having a best friend,2019-06-01 01:14:22
